<text>Ryan Sook is an American comic book artist, known for his work on books such as &quot;Seven Soldiers: Zatanna&quot;, &quot;X-Factor&quot; and &quot;The Spectre&quot;. His style has been compared to that of Mike Mignola, Adam Hughes, and Kevin Nowlan.

==Career==
Sook&#x27;s first professional work was in &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot; #15, published in 1998. For the next two years, he worked primarily on books for Dark Horse, including several stories set in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; universe, as well as two creator-owned projects in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;: &quot;Witch&#x27;s Son&quot; &amp; &quot;Ragnok&quot;, with writer John Arcudi. He has also inked over Matt Smith&#x27;s pencils in &quot;Lobster Johnson: The Killer in My Skull&quot;, a back-up story in &quot; #1&quot;.

In 2001, he earned critical and fan praise for his work on The Spectre for DC Comics. He left the book in 2002 to draw the first spin-off mini-series from Mike Mignola&#x27;s &quot;Hellboy&quot;, &quot;BPRD: Hollow Earth&quot;.

From 2003 to 2010, Sook worked primarily for DC Comics focusing more on coverwork than interior sequential pages. His work in this time period includes: &quot;Arkham Asylum: Living Hell&quot; with Dan Slott, &quot;Hawkman&quot; with Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti and &quot;Seven Soldiers: Zatanna&quot; with Grant Morrison and &quot;X-Factor&quot; with Peter David for Marvel. He has also worked on several books for Wildstorm.

In 2009, Sook garnered his highest critical praise to date for his work on the Kamandi story in &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot;, written by Dave Gibbons. For the twelve-part serialization, he handled all of the art chores including lettering.

Sook has been compared to Mike Mignola, Adam Hughes and Kevin Nowlan and has as well been influenced by them, but he also draws inspiration from Alphonse Mucha, JC Leyendecker and Norman Rockwell, among many others.

Sook created the poster for the American TV series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; episode &quot;S.O.S. Part 1&quot;.

<doc id="868349" wikidata="Q311739" url="?curid=868349" title="Leônidas">
<text>Leônidas da Silva (; 6 September 1913 – 24 January 2004) was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. He is regarded as one of the most important players of the first half of the 20th century. At the height of his career, Leônidas da Silva was very popular amongst the people of Brazil and Rio de Janeiro. Leônidas played for Brazil national team in the 1934 and 1938 World Cups, and was the top scorer of the latter tournament. He was known as the &quot;Black Diamond&quot; and the &quot;Rubber Man&quot; due to his agility.

==Club career==
Leônidas started his career at São Cristóvão. He then played for Carioca side Sírio e Libanez, where he was coached by Gentil Cardoso. When Cardoso left to coach Bonsucesso, he brought Leônidas with him. Between 1931 and 1932, he played for Bonsucesso before joining Peñarol in Uruguay in 1933. After one year, da Silva returned to Brazil to play for Vasco da Gama. He helped them win the Rio State Championship. After playing in the 1934 World Cup, he joined Botafogo and won another Rio State Championship in 1935. The following year, he joined Flamengo, where he stayed until 1941. Once again, in 1939, the team won the Rio State Championship. He was also at the forefront of the movement against prejudice in football, being one of the first black players to join the then-elitist Flamengo team.

Leônidas joined São Paulo in 1942 and stayed at the club until his retirement from playing in 1950.

===The bicycle kick===
Leônidas is one of several possible players credited for inventing the &quot;Bicycle kick&quot;. The first time da Silva used this technique was on 24 April 1932, in a match between Bonsucesso and Carioca. In Flamengo he used this move only once, in 1939, against the Argentinian team Independiente. The unusual volley gained huge fame at the time, propelling it into the football mainstream.

For São Paulo, da Silva used the bicycle kick on two occasions: the first on 14 June 1942, in the defeat against Palestra Italia (currently Palmeiras). Most famously of all, he used it on 13 November 1948, in the massive 8–0 victory over Juventus. The play (and the goal) was captured in an image and is regarded as the most famous picture of the player.
In the 1938 World Cup, he also used the bicycle kick, to the delight of the spectators. When he did it, the referee was so shocked by the volley that he was unsure whether it was within the rules or not.

==International career==
Leônidas played 19 times for the Brazil national team between 1932 and 1946, scoring 21 goals in total, and scoring twice on his debut. In 1938, he was the World Cup&#x27;s top scorer with 7 goals, scoring at least three times in the 6–5 extra time win over Poland.

Nevertheless, his performance also made him be frequently fouled by the Poles. For the next match, against Czechoslovakia, he was not in the ideal conditions, but the Brazilian staff, concerned for possible punishment in using Niginho in Leônidas place, preferred to keep Leônidas in the team; Italian Football Federation had warned FIFA about Niginho&#x27;s irregular condition: this player, who had Italian Citizenship, was still legally attached to Lazio, the club he left without permission in 1936, due to fear of being recruited by the Italian Army to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Leônidas managed to score against the Czechs, but his injuries got worse, making him definitely unable to be used in the next game – the semifinal against Italy. Brazil lost the match 2–1 and for many years the coach Adhemar Pimenta was criticized as many fans, not aware of Lêonidas true poor conditions, believed his absence was just an option arrogantly made by Pimenta &quot;to rest the player for the final&quot;. This version still circulates, despite the fact that Leônidas had written a letter, which was published by certain newspapers at the time, in which he clarified that Pimenta had no choice but to rest him due to the Niginho affair.

The Niginho affair also prevented either of the players from playing in the semi-final. In their place, Romeu was chosen as the team&#x27;s improvised center-forward for the match, scoring Brazil&#x27;s goal late in the game. Leônidas returned for the third place match and scored two more goals in a 4–2 win against Sweden.

==Personal life==
At the height of his career, Leônidas da Silva was very popular amongst the people of Brazil and Rio de Janeiro. In the 1930s and 1940s, Leônidas was a celebrity against the backdrop of controversy and racial discrimination looming within Brazil during this time. Leônidas had a major impact on and off the field because of his ability to relate to the working classes of Brazil, and his humble beginnings and racial representation led to this national popularity. When his team won the Brazilian Club Championship in 1931, the people of Rio de Janeiro greeted Leônidas and his team in the streets of the city with cheerful crowds dancing and celebrating their victory.

Historically, Leônidas is well known for his contributions to the relationship between consumerism and the business side of football within the country of Brazil. In the year 1938, Leônidas especially gained massive popularity after his appearance in the World Cup tournament and it was around this time he started to receive numerous advertisement offers, such as for watches and cigarettes. His willingness to participate in interviews and being a constant within the public eye helped his fans feel personally connected to Leônidas. Later that same year, a voting popularity contest was held including Leônidas and he received 249,080 votes in his favor, thus winning the contest.

During the 1938 World Cup, Leônidas was nicknamed Diamante Negro (black diamond). In the next year, Brazilian chocolate manufacturer Lacta purchased from him the right to name a chocolate bar as Diamante Negro. This chocolate brand became a commercial success in Brazil.

Leônidas joined São Paulo as manager the 1950s before leaving football to become a radio reporter and then the owner of a furniture store in São Paulo. He died in 2004 in Cotia, São Paulo, because of complications due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, from which he had been suffering since 1974. He is buried in the &quot;Cemitério da Paz&quot; of São Paulo.

<text>Sydney Ernest Rogers (November 11, 1888–September 10, 1965) was a Manitoba politician. Between 1937 and 1941, he was the leader of the province&#x27;s Social Credit Party.

==Biography==
Rogers was born in 1888 on the Isle of Wight in England, the son of James Alexander Rogers and Elizabeth Spencer. Moving to Canada with his family in 1897, he later worked as a farmer. He was elected reeve of the Rural Municipality of Shell River in 1920, and held this position for well over a decade, serving two terms. In 1905, he married Georgina Elizabeth Johnston.

In 1936, Rogers was a candidate for the newly formed Social Credit League in Manitoba. This party was influenced by the recent victory of William Aberhart in Alberta, and promised a similar program of monetary reform.

The party did not have a leader during the election, but nevertheless succeeded in electing five of its candidates. Rogers was elected in the riding of Roblin.

The five-member caucus subsequently chose Stanley Fox as the party&#x27;s leader. Fox stepped down in 1937, and was replaced by Rogers.

In 1940, Rogers was responsible for bringing Social Credit into the all-party coalition government proposed by Liberal-Progressive Premier John Bracken. Rogers did not join cabinet, standing aside for Norman Turnbull to become a minister without portfolio.

The decision to join government split the Social Credit ranks, and several of the party&#x27;s candidates in 1941 ran against the coalition. Rogers, Fox and Turnbull (all government supporters) were the only party members re-elected, and the group does not seem to have had a leader during the parliament that followed. The Social Credit group, in fact, came to be regarded as little more than an appendage of the Liberal-Conservative coalition.

Rogers retired from the legislature in 1945, and died twenty years later.

<text>Glen Keane (born April 13, 1954) is an American animator, director, author and illustrator. As a character animator at Walt Disney Animation Studios for 38 years (1974–2012), he worked on feature films including &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Tangled&quot;. He received the 1992 Annie Award for character animation and the 2007 Winsor McCay Award for lifetime contribution to the field of animation. He was named a Disney Legend in 2013, a year after retiring from the studio.

In 2017, Keane directed &quot;Dear Basketball&quot;, an animated short film based on Kobe Bryant&#x27;s retirement poem in &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot;, for which Keane and Bryant received the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 90th Academy Awards&quot;.&quot;

==Early life==
Keane was born in Philadelphia, the son of cartoonist Bil Keane, creator of &quot;The Family Circus&quot;, and Australian-born Thelma Keane (née Carne). He grew up in Paradise Valley, Arizona next to Scottsdale, as a Catholic.

Keane&#x27;s interest in art developed from observing his father&#x27;s work as a cartoonist. (Keane&#x27;s father based his &quot;Family Circus&quot; character of Billy on Glen&#x27;s younger self.) To encourage Glen to draw, his father gave him a copy of Burne Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Anatomy&quot;, and recommended he observe body forms and practice creative approaches to life drawing.

After graduating from high school at Brophy College Preparatory in Phoenix in 1972, Keane applied to the California Institute of the Arts School of Art in Santa Clarita, southwest of Palmdale, rather than accepting a football scholarship to another college. His application was accidentally sent to the Program in Experimental Animation (then called Film Graphics), where he was mentored by Jules Engel.

==Career==

Keane left CalArts in 1974 and joined Disney the same year, where he spent three years working with veteran animator Ollie Johnston on the characters Bernard and Penny in &quot;The Rescuers&quot;. He then animated Elliott the Dragon in &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, and the climactic bear showdown in &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;.

In 1982, inspired by the groundbreaking film &quot;Tron&quot;, Keane collaborated with animator John Lasseter (&quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;) on a 30-second test scene of Maurice Sendak&#x27;s &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, which was optioned for them by Disney executive Tom Wilhite. The test integrated traditional character animation and computer-generated backgrounds (), and, like &quot;Tron&quot;, was a cooperation with MAGI. It was Disney&#x27;s first experiment with digitally-drawn characters. Although the project was revolutionary (and became a predecessor to the famous ballroom scene in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;), Disney declined to invest further in the featurette due to its cost.

In 1983, Keane left contract employment with Disney and worked as a freelance artist. He animated the character Professor Ratigan in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;; the &quot;Boys and Girls of Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot; and &quot;Getting Lucky&quot; in &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot;; and the characters Fagin, Sykes, Jenny Foxworth, and Georgette in &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;.

He became a lead character animator, one of the group of young animators mentored by &quot;Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men&quot;. Keane animated some of Disney&#x27;s most memorable characters in what has been called the &quot;New &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Disney Animation. He designed and animated the character of Ariel in the film &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), and the eagle Marahute in &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;. He was supervising animator for the title characters of the three Disney hit features &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. While living with his family in Paris for three years, Keane completed work on Disney&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Tarzan&quot;, for which he drew the eponymous character. He returned to Disney&#x27;s studio in Burbank, California as the lead animator for John Silver in &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;.

In 2003, he began work as the director of Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Tangled&quot; (based on the Brothers Grimm story &quot;Rapunzel&quot;), released in November 2010, where Keane and his team strove to bring the style and warmth of traditional animation to computer animation. In October 2008, due to &quot;non-life threatening health issues&quot;, Keane stepped back as director of &quot;Tangled&quot;, but remained the film&#x27;s executive producer and an animating director.

On March 23, 2012, Keane left Walt Disney Animation Studios after 37 years there. In a letter to his coworkers, he said, &quot;I owe so much to those great animators who mentored me–Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnston –as well as to the many other wonderful people at Disney whom I have been fortunate to work with in the past nearly 38 years. I am convinced that animation really is the ultimate form of our time with endless new territories to explore. I can’t resist its siren call to step out and discover them.&quot; He later said that one of the reasons he left Disney was his experience during the production of &quot;Tangled&quot;, which underwent several storyline and title changes. He felt that in a big studio like Disney, there were too many conflicting interests, with management pulling people &quot;in too many different directions&quot;.

In December 2013, it was announced that Keane joined &quot;Motorola&#x27;s&quot; Advanced Technology and Projects Group to help its engineers create interactive hand-drawn animation. He released his first animated short, &quot;Duet&quot;, at the Google I/O Conference in San Francisco on June 25, 2014. It is the first hand-drawn cartoon made at 60 frames per second, and the third in a series of shorts, called the Spotlight Stories, designed to explore spatial awareness and the sensory inputs of a mobile device to create distinctive storytelling experiences. When Google sold its Motorola subsidiary in early 2014, Keane and his group remained there.

In 2015, it was revealed that Keane and 16 other prominent artists and filmmakers had been hired by the Paris Opera to work on their 3rd Stage project. Keane is the creator of the animated short &quot;Nephtali&quot; (a reference to Jacob&#x27;s blessings and Psalm 42), on which he collaborated with choreographer and ballet dancer Marion Barbeau.

In addition to his work as an animator, Keane has written and illustrated a series of children&#x27;s books based on Bible parables, featuring the characters Adam Raccoon and King Aren the Lion. Keane directed the Chinese animated film &quot;Over the Moon&quot;, about a girl who builds a rocket and flies to the moon to meet a legendary moon goddess. Written by Audrey Wells, produced by Pearl Studio, and animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks, it was released on Netflix on October 23, 2020.

At the 2018 Oscars, Keane shared the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film with Kobe Bryant for &quot;Dear Basketball&quot;, which was based on a poem Bryant wrote on his retirement. On May 26, 2018 Keane received the 2017 Reuben Award for the Cartoonist of the Year in his hometown of Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
In 1975, during the production of his debut film, Keane married Linda Hesselroth. They are the parents of author and illustrator Claire Keane and animator Max Keane.

Keane has been cited as artist with aphantasia, a condition characterized by an inability to form mental images. He is a Christian.

<doc id="868356" wikidata="Q974336" url="?curid=868356" title="Killer Croc">
<text>Killer Croc (Waylon Jones) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Gerry Conway, Don Newton and Gene Colan, the character was introduced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #523 (February 1983). He has become one of the most enduring enemies of the superhero Batman and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

In his comic book appearances, Killer Croc is depicted as a former sideshow wrestler who suffers from a rare genetic condition that gives him a reptilian appearance and superhuman strength. Driven insane by this, he turned to a life of crime, over time developing animalistic tendencies. The character has also been a member of the Suicide Squad, debuting in the fifth volume of the comic series revolving around the team, and a romantic interest of Enchantress. While typically portrayed as a supervillain, he has also been occasionally depicted as an antihero.

The character has been adapted into various media, most revolving around Batman. Killer Croc made his live-action debut in the 2016 DC Extended Universe film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, portrayed by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. A version of the character appeared in the third season of the Arrowverse series &quot;Batwoman&quot;, performed by Heidi Ben.

==Publication history==
Killer Croc was created by writer Gerry Conway and artist Gene Colan. The character made cameo appearances in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #523 (February 1983) and &quot;Batman&quot; #357 (March 1983), with his full first appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #524 (March 1983).

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Waylon Jones was born with a rare form of atavism that imparted him with reptilian traits with his birth causing the death of his mother. He was raised by his aunt, an abusive alcoholic who called him names like &quot;lizardboy&quot; and &quot;reptilian freak&quot;. Croc eventually killed his aunt and became a criminal in Gotham City. After committing several murders, he faced off against Batman and the new Robin, Jason Todd, who defeated him.

In these original, Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearances, Killer Croc resembled a powerfully built man covered entirely in green scales, but was still basically human in his facial proportions and build. He was also originally depicted as killing Jason Todd&#x27;s parents. (This was later retconned to make Two-Face their murderer.)

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Killer Croc escaped custody and sought revenge on Harvey Bullock and two other criminals who got him in jail. Batman tracked him down and Croc went into a homicidal rage. When new water tunnels were built, which would flood Killer Croc&#x27;s new home, Croc seemingly sacrificed himself to hold the water back when they finally were open.

In reality, Croc was buried under rubble and was freed from his prison by storm drains. Killer Croc survived on rats and was isolated for months, driving him further into madness. Croc later went on a rampage after a confrontation with a vagrant, and winds up in a shopping mall. After delivering several blows to Croc, Batman (Jean Paul Valley is posing as Batman) is distracted by a glimpse of Bane. Croc then grabs Batman and tries to break his back. He fails, and Bane pits himself against Croc, breaking his arms. Croc is then put back into Arkham Asylum.

When Bane breaks the inmates out of Arkham Asylum in the &quot;&quot; saga, Croc attempts to get revenge on Bane. While in the sewers, he smells Bane and goes after him and the two fight each other atop a ledge. Bane casually breaks one of Croc&#x27;s arms again, but Croc fights until the ledge they are standing on breaks and the two fall into the sewers. The fight ends up as a draw. Croc later returns, attacking the docks to try to lure Bane out for a rematch, but is defeated by Dick Grayson (now acting as Batman after Bruce defeated Valley before taking time off for self-analysis) without the villain realizing that he is facing a new Batman. Killer Croc is left for the police in a fishing net all bruised up with a broken arm.

Killer Croc is summoned by a paranormal force to break out of Arkham and make his way to the Louisiana swamps. Batman follows him there, only to find that the mysterious force is actually the Swamp Thing, who offers Croc a place in the swampland where he can finally give in to his animal side, live free from human persecution and have a peaceful and joyous life.

Killer Croc has appeared in both the &quot;&quot; storyline and its chronological follow-up, &quot;Broken City&quot;. In the former, he is infected with a virus that greatly increases the rate of his devolution, &#x27;overseeing&#x27; a kidnapping for Hush before Batman defeats him; this provides Batman&#x27;s first clue that someone else is orchestrating events, as he knows that Croc is too stupid to attempt a complex scheme like a kidnapping on his own due to the many variables. Though Killer Croc was briefly restored to his original form, the Mad Hatter, under Black Mask&#x27;s orders, implanted Killer Croc with a device that made him loyal to Black Mask and caused the virus to return. Batman freed Croc from Black Mask&#x27;s control. Croc attempted to take revenge on the Mad Hatter, but was stopped by Batman. Croc then escaped.

When an attempt at a cure fails, Killer Croc devours the involved doctor and retreats to the sewers, vowing vengeance on Batman and Black Mask.

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Croc becomes a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains.

One Year Later during the &quot;&quot; storyline, Killer Croc is shown to have been feeding on the dead body of an orca. He next shows up in &quot;Countdown&quot; where he breaks free from his shackles in Arkham Asylum and attempts to kill Jimmy Olsen, who uses elastic powers to escape. Killer Croc is then subdued.

He is later seen among the exiled supervillains in &quot;Salvation Run.&quot; After the Martian Manhunter is defeated and imprisoned in a fiery cage, Croc suggests that he will eat the Martian. Lex Luthor forbids it.

During the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline, Killer Croc can be seen as the member of Libra&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains. Killer Croc is later turned into a Justifier.

In the &quot;&quot; storyline, Killer Croc is recruited by a new Black Mask to be a part of a group of villains aiming to take over Gotham and Bludhaven.

During the events of &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Killer Croc is intentionally released from his cell by a guard whom Osiris kills when Deathstroke and his band of Titans infiltrate Arkham. While attempting to flee from the facility, he is attacked by Osiris who mistakes Killer Croc for his old enemy Sobek.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In the continuity of DC&#x27;s 2011 reboot &quot;The New 52&quot;, Killer Croc is established to have fought Roy Harper in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen in a flashback seen in &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot;. He is then passingly referenced by Roy, as he is Roy&#x27;s current sponsor for his alcoholism at the time when Roy was in a bar with Jason Todd. Roy is only drinking water, but knows that Waylon would disapprove.

During the 2013–2014 &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Croc began ruling over Gotham&#x27;s lower class. He murders a corrupt S.W.A.T. team that murdered one of the few people who were nice to him. When the Crime Syndicate invades Earth, Croc takes over Wayne Tower. He is confronted by the villain Bane, who injects Croc with Venom, turning Croc into a hulking giant, whom Bane then defeats.

While institutionalized in Arkham, Killer Croc meets Sybil Silverlock, a woman with dissociative identity disorder. He bonds with her softer personality, and she shows him a picture of her daughter, Olive. Sybil has him promise to look after Olive if he ever gets out.

After Batman confronts them, Olive and Killer Croc escape to a swamp. Before parting, he tells her that, if she is like her mother, to come and find him one day.

He recently helped Harley Quinn and her friends fight a gang of other Batman villains in Coney Island.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In the pages of &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; with the Suicide Squad, Killer Croc and the Squad go on a mission to retrieve a &quot;cosmic item&quot; from a Russian undersea prison, revealed to be a portal to the Phantom Zone, and come face-to-face with General Zod. He attacks the Squad and, when spotting Zod about to kill June Moone/Enchantress, Croc saves her just in time. After the mission, back in their cells, June Moone and Croc have a heartfelt conversation and embrace each other. Killer Croc and June Moone enjoy New York City and decide to explore their romance in the future. Croc encourages her to try, but later expresses fear and sheds tears that he will lose her if she is able to achieve her dream. Enchantress&#x27;s rampage in New York City lasts until it is revealed that it is an editor from a magazine company who rejected June. After being convinced by Croc to reevaluate her, he decided to give her some freelance work. Moved by Waylon&#x27;s actions, June reigns in the Enchantress and thanks her love for helping her.
Amanda Waller escapes the battle after downloading the file. Two days later in the cell, Croc mourns, and breaks down in tears over June Moone&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;, as Rick told him that June Moone is the only one who did not see him as monstrous. He eventually leaves the Squad.

In Harley Quinn&#x27;s series, Killer Croc joined the Penguin&#x27;s plans to take over New York, but went off on his own to take Coney Island, revealing that he was on display there in a freak show as a kid driving out the other villains. After it was all torn down, Harley convinced him to join her side and help take it all back from the Penguin.

Killer Croc, deciding to go by his first name Waylon, later took over Tusk&#x27;s hotel in Monster Town, granting second chances to any monster in need.

In &quot;Joker War&quot; event tie-in, the Joker and his goons assaulted Monstertown. He decided to create a new one in the sewers of Gotham, hoping that he and the others would be left alone and wanting no involvement in the war. Batman attempts to warn Croc of the dangers of the chemicals in the water, but doesn’t believe him. He makes a deal with Batman to fight him, only to lose. Although Croc and his gang are later taken to jail, he promises them the best of care, including a reversal of their conditions, if a cure can be found.

==Characterization==
===Powers and abilities===
Killer Croc&#x27;s backstory explains that he was born with a condition resembling epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, a disfiguring skin disorder. However, it is actually a form of regressive atavism, meaning that he has inherited traits of ancestral species of the human race, such as reptiles. This condition has been augmented by the presence of a metagene. Consequently, he has several extraordinary physical abilities relating to his endurance, speed, and strength.

His skin is hardened to the degree that it is nearly impenetrable to ordinary forms of abrasion or penetration, including high caliber weapons fired from a distance. He also possesses an extraordinary amount of super-strength; for example, he was able to tear a bank vault door off of its hinges with minimal effort. He has demonstrated regenerative powers, allowing him to heal and restore lost limbs and teeth. He possesses superhuman reflexes and speed, especially while he is moving underwater. He can also see through his crocodile eyelids. Killer Croc also has an enhanced sense of smell. Once he has become familiar with a person&#x27;s scent, he can track them from miles away. As his appearance and personality has grown more and more bestial, his misanthropy has increased dramatically. He is jealous and hateful of &quot;normal&quot; people and often lashes out violently without provocation. As a result of these feelings of jealousy, Croc will often entertain himself by grabbing hold of small, pointy objects as a source of comfort.

Croc&#x27;s main weakness is consistently portrayed in most adaptations, aside from &quot;The Batman&quot; series, as being his low intellect. He typically resorts to brute force to solve most problems, allowing Batman to outmaneuver him in combat by thinking his way through the problems he faces in defeating the powerful Croc. Batman regularly describes his foe as an animal rather than a man. He acts almost solely on instinct and hardly ever takes the time to plan or rationalize his actions. This is a departure from his initial portrayal, where he was shown to be a ruthless and intelligent criminal who was able to plot his ascent from henchman to The Squid to perhaps the most powerful force in Gotham organized crime before being defeated by the Batman.

===Appearance===
In recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. An action figure made by Kenner in 1998 featured a tail and dinosaur-like feet. When Mattel got the license to make DC products in the early 2000s, they released their own version of Killer Croc, sculpted by Four Horsemen Studios. This version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet. In late 2005, a re-release of this figure was modified so that the tail, along with his shirt, was removed. This version also sports a more &quot;human&quot; head.

The 2002-2003 &quot;Batman&quot; storyline &quot;&quot; featured a more bestial Croc who had been mutated against his will to appear more reptilian. This version of the character was drawn by artist Jim Lee. In &quot;The New 52&quot;, he is shown to have a crocodile-like head, though how this came to be has not yet been revealed. Such a design had previously appeared in &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot;, drawn by Kenneth Rocafort.

<doc id="868361" wikidata="Q336300" url="?curid=868361" title="Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford">
<text>General Frederic Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, (31 May 18279 April 1905) was a British Army officer who rose to prominence during the Anglo-Zulu War, when an expeditionary force under his command suffered a decisive defeat at the hands of a Zulu force at the Battle of Isandlwana in 1879. Despite this defeat, he was able to score several victories against the Zulus, culminating in the British victory at the Battle of Ulundi, which ended the war and partly restored his reputation in Britain.

==Early life==
Frederic Augustus Thesiger was born 31 May 1827, the eldest child of Frederic Thesiger, a lawyer who later became Lord Chancellor and was created Baron Chelmsford. Thesiger was educated at Eton College.

Thesiger&#x27;s great-uncle Sir Frederick Thesiger was aide-de-camp to Lord Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801.

==Military career==
He wished to pursue a military career. In 1844, after unsuccessfully trying to obtain a place in the Grenadier Guards, he purchased a commission in the Rifle Brigade. He served in 1845 with the Rifles in Halifax, Nova Scotia before purchasing an exchange in November 1845 into the Grenadiers as an ensign and lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant and captain in 1850, and became aide-de-camp in 1852 to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Eglinton, and then to the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, Sir Edward Blakeney, from 1853 to 1854.

===Crimean War===
In May 1855, he left for the Crimean War, in which he served firstly with his battalion, then as aide-de-camp from July 1855 to the commander of the 2nd Division, Lieutenant-General Edwin Markham, and finally as deputy assistant quartermaster general from November 1855 on the staff at Headquarters, being promoted to brevet major. He was mentioned in dispatches and received the fifth class of the Turkish Order of the Medjidie and the British, Turkish and Sardinian Crimean medals.

===Indian Rebellion of 1857===
In 1857, he was promoted to captain and lieutenant colonel, and transferred (1858), as a lieutenant colonel, to the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot, serving with that regiment at the end of the Indian Rebellion, for which he was again mentioned in dispatches. He served as deputy adjutant general to the forces in Bombay from 1861 to 1862, and was promoted to brevet colonel in 1863. There, he befriended the then governor of Bombay, Sir Henry Bartle Frere, and this relationship would be important later when serving in South Africa. He served, again as deputy adjutant general, in the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and made an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria in 1868. He was Adjutant-General, India from 1869 to 1874.

Thesiger returned to England in 1874 as colonel on the staff, commanding the forces at Shorncliffe Army Camp, and was appointed to command a brigade at Aldershot, with the temporary rank of brigadier general, in 1877. He had however requested a posting overseas in order to benefit from the cheaper cost of living.

===Anglo-Zulu War===

Thesiger was promoted to major general in March 1877, appointed to command British forces in the Cape Colony with the local rank of lieutenant general in February 1878, and in October succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Chelmsford. He brought the Ninth Cape Frontier War to its completion in July 1878, and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in November 1878. His experiences fighting against the Xhosa created a low opinion of the fighting capabilities of African soldiers, which later led to disastrous consequences during the Anglo-Zulu War.

In January 1879, the official Sir Henry Bartle Frere, a personal friend of Chelmsford, engineered the outbreak of the Anglo-Zulu War by issuing the Zulu king Cetshwayo an ultimatum to effectively disband his military. Cetshwayo refused this ultimatum, an act which led to an outbreak of war between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. A British expeditionary force under the command of Chelmsford invaded the Zulu Kingdom, heading in three columns towards the Zulu capital, Ulundi. The force was attacked by a Zulu force at Isandlwana, during which the Zulus overran and destroyed the central column of Chelmsford&#x27;s separated forces. The engagement was an unexpected victory for the Zulus, which threw British war plans into disarray.

Afterwards, the British government, anxious to avoid the Zulus threatening Natal, issued orders for the hasty relief of Chelmsford of his command and for him to be replaced with Sir Garnet Wolseley. However, this order could not be implemented until the arrival of Wolseley, and in the meantime Chelmsford ignored diplomatic overtures from King Cetshwayo and made plans to capture Ulundi, aiming to defeat them in a decisive engagement and salvaging his reputation before Wolseley&#x27;s arrival. The Battle of Ulundi took place on 4 July 1879, being the last major battle of the Anglo-Zulu War. After a half-hour bombardment by the Royal Artillery, Chelmsford attacked a Zulu army massed at Ulundi, making full use of concentrated small arms fire from Gatling guns and rifles, leading to the destruction of the Zulu force. The British Army&#x27;s casualties after the sharp but brief engagement was ten killed and eighty-seven wounded, in exchange for nearly sixty times that number of Zulu dead. quotes the London Standard reporting 473 counted dead and another 1000 or more wounded. Chelmsford ordered Ulundi to be burnt, after which he handed over command to Wolseley on 15 July at the fort at St. Paul&#x27;s and left South Africa by ship for England two days later. The defeat of the Zulus at Ulundi allowed Chelmsford to partially recover his military prestige after the disaster at Isandlwana, and he was honoured as a Knight Grand Cross of Bath. However, he was severely criticised by a subsequent enquiry launched by the British Army into the events that had led to the Isandlwana debacle, and did not serve in the field again.

===Later career===
Lord Chelmsford became lieutenant general in 1882, Lieutenant of the Tower of London (1884 until 1889), colonel of the 4th (West London) Rifle Volunteer Corps (1887), full general (1888), and colonel of the Derbyshire Regiment (1889). He exchanged the colonelcy of the Derbyshires for that of the 2nd Life Guards (1900), and as such was Gold Stick in Waiting during ceremonial events at Court. King Edward VII appointed him Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in the November 1902 Birthday Honours list, and he was invested with the insignia by the King at Buckingham Palace on 18 December 1902. He was the inaugural Governor and Commandant of the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade, a post he retained until his death.

==Personal life==
His sister, Julia (1833–1904), was married to Sir John Eardley Wilmot Inglis (1814–1862) who commanded the British forces during the Siege of Lucknow in 1857. She later wrote of her experiences during the siege in her diary, which was later published.

In 1867 Thesiger married Adria Fanny Heath (1845-1926). The couple had six sons, two of whom died in infancy. The eldest succeeded as 3rd Baron Chelmsford and later became Viceroy of India and first Viscount Chelmsford. Another son was Lieutenant Colonel Eric Thesiger who served in the First World War and was also a Page of Honour for Queen Victoria. The diplomat Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger, who served in Addis Ababa in 1916, was another son, and father of the author and explorer Wilfred Thesiger. He was the uncle of the actor Ernest Thesiger.

==Death==
Chelmsford had a seizure and died while playing billiards at the United Service Club in London on 9 April 1905 in his 78th year. His body was buried in Brompton Cemetery in London.

<text>Guy Davis (born 1966) is an American creature designer, concept artist, illustrator and storyboard artist who has worked on film, television, comic book and video game projects. He is known for his collaborations with filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, including the television series &quot;The Strain&quot; (2014–17) and the films &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; (2013), &quot;Crimson Peak&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; (2017). Beforehand, Davis was the regular artist for the &quot;Hellboy&quot; spinoff comic &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; (2003–2010), as well as the artist behind his own creator-owned comic &quot;The Marquis&quot; (2009).

==Biography==

===Career===
A self-taught illustrator, Guy Davis began his art career in 1985. Soon his independent work attracted the editors of Caliber Press, who published his first creator-owned series — the Harvey Award-nominated &quot;Baker Street&quot;. It was the success of &quot;Baker Street&quot; that got Davis work with DC Comics/Vertigo, illustrating &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;. He illustrated Mike Mignola&#x27;s ongoing &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; series, &quot;The Zombies That Ate the World&quot; for &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, and his creator-owned series &quot;The Marquis&quot; for Dark Horse Comics. He has also provided illustration work for the White Wolf role-playing game series and TCM Underground, cover artwork for Criterion, and poster art for Mondo.

At the 2011 ECCC, Davis announced he would no longer be the ongoing &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; artist. Since leaving comics, Davis has moved to a career in conceptual design, providing concept art, character design and storyboards for film, television and video games. He worked on &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;, designing the Kaiju Otachi and Slattern, various props and storyboards. Other conceptual design projects for director Guillermo del Toro include &quot;Crimson Peak&quot;, &quot;The Strain&quot; TV series and &quot;The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XXIV&quot; opening. He has also provided concept for &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, &quot;ParaNorman&quot;, &quot;The Mill at Calder&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and video game projects including &quot;Evolve&quot;, &quot;InSane&quot;, and &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (2024).

===Personal life===
Davis currently resides in Michigan.

Almost 400 years later, during the Sengoku period, there is more evidence for the existence of Kusatsu, which had grown into a hot-springs resort popular with wounded samurai. The contains correspondence during the year 1595 (Bunroku 4) between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi in which Hideyoshi recommended the Kusatsu hot springs to Ieyasu. The latter however, did not go to Kusatsu himself, but sent some servants to fetch some water from Kusatsu instead.

===Edo period===
During the Edo period, especially the Bakumatsu period, Kusatsu experienced unprecedented economic growth and became one of Japan&#x27;s best-known hot springs. This was partly due to the increasing incidence of venereal diseases like gonorrhoea and syphilis, contracted in Tokyo red light districts like Yoshiwara, for which there was then no known cure besides bathing in a hot spring. The saying: also goes back to this time and means: a thousand stores, just like in (the shopping districts in) Edo.

Hearing the praise of the Kusatsu Onsen the 8th Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune had hot-spring water drawn from the Yubatake source and transported into his castle for bathing. The area of present-day Kusatsu was part of the &quot;hatamoto&quot;-administered territory within Kōzuke Province during the Edo period.

===Meiji period===
In 1869, Kusatsu burned to the ground. The town was reconstructed within a few years, but the process left many local people in debt, causing the bankruptcy of many small enterprises, especially &quot;ryokans&quot;, over the next 20 years. At that time many of the inhabitants of Kusatsu abandoned the traditional practice of , which meant leaving Kusatsu in wintertime and returning to their hometowns, located further down the mountains. Instead, the townspeople sold their old homes to repay their debts and began to live in Kusatsu all year long.

Kusatsu Village was created within Agatsuma District of Gunma Prefecture in April 1889, by the merger of former Kusatsu with Maeguchi and six other hamlets, with the creation of the modern municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration. In July 1900, the former Kusatsu and Maeguchi portions of the village was raised to town status, and the remaining portion formed Kuni village.

The infrastructure developed in the Meiji period and also people&#x27;s knowledge, therefore many famous people were visiting Kusatsu. Especially foreigners were scientifically interested in this area, which became an important area for research of effects of hot springs, volcanoes etc.

In 1876, Erwin Bälz, a German internist came to Kusatsu for the first time. Bälz was one of the fathers of modern western medical science in Japan and court physician to Emperor Meiji. He was convinced of the healing power of the hot springs in Kusatsu, and began scientific research into them with a view to convincing the townspeople of the need to teach the correct application of the hot springs to Japanese medical doctors.

===Taishō to Reiwa===
In 1914, the Kusatsu ski club was founded.

The year 1915 saw the first visit of British Anglican missionary, Mary Cornwall Legh. In 1916 Cornwall Legh using her own funds established the St. Barnabas&#x27; Mission, providing residential care facilities to the sizable population of Hansen&#x27;s Disease sufferers then present in the Yunosawa area of Kusatsu. Cornwall Legh devoted her remaining years to the care of the Kusatsu leprosy community, her work and dedication to this cause recognized with honors by the Japanese Government.

In 1941 the St. Barnabus&#x27; Hospital was closed, replaced by the, subsequently notorious, government run Kuryu Rakusen-en Sanatorium. St. Barnabus&#x27; Church and Cornwall Legh Park in Kusatsu attest to the charitable legacy of Mary Cornwall-Legh and the history of the community she sought to serve.

In 1926, the construction of the between Kusatsu and Karuizawa, which had been begun in 1908 was finished.

In 1948, a ski lift was erected on Mount Tengu, near Kusatsu. It was the first ski lift in Japan, with Kusatsu going on to become one of the country&#x27;s first proper ski resorts.

==== Sexual assault allegations against mayor ====
In 2020, a local election in which over 90% of voters voted to recall town councillor Shoko Arai made international headlines. Arai, the only woman on the council, had accused mayor Nobutada Kuroiwa of sexually assaulting her. Kuroiwa denied the accusations, which triggered a backlash against Arai, who was accused of tarnishing the town&#x27;s reputation with her allegations. 

In December 2021, Arai filed a complaint against the mayor of the town for indecent assault. The Maebashi District Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the mayor was not suspected. In response, the mayor filed a complaint against Arai for the crime of filing a false complaint. In October 2022 the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office indicted Arai on charges of filing a false complaint and defamation against the mayor. In December 2022, Reiji Iizuka, a writer, stopped selling e-books meant to denounce the mayor and issued a statement apologizing to him. 

On November 15, 2023, Arai&#x27;s lawyer announced that Arai had admitted that her claim that the mayor had sexually assaulted her in the mayor&#x27;s office was false, and that Arai would now claim in court that the mayor had touched her breasts and buttocks in his office. 

On January 22, 2024, the Maebashi District Court found that there was no sexual activity between the mayor and Arai, and sentenced the writer, Iizuka, to one year in prison, suspended for three years, for defaming the mayor. According to prosecutors, Iizuka opposed the mayor&#x27;s attempts to reform Kusatsu&#x27;s hot spring management and published the e-book even though he knew Arai&#x27;s testimony might be false.

On April 17, 2024, the Maebashi District Court ordered Arai to pay the mayor 2.75 million yen for defamation. This is a civil judgment; the criminal case for false complaint and defamation committed by Arai has not yet been opened.

==Government==
Kusatsu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Kusatsu, collectively with the other municipalities in Agatsuma District, contributes two members to the Gunma Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Gunma 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The town&#x27;s main income is tourism. About 90% of the working population is employed in the tertiary sector, primarily in connection with its hot spring resorts, with very little industry and almost no agriculture.

==Education==
Kusatsu has a public elementary school, Kusatsu Elementary School (草津町立草津小学校), and one public middle school, Kusatsu Junior High School (草津町立草津中学校), operated by the town government.

The town does not have a high school. Gunma Prefectural Board of Education operates prefectural high schools elsewhere.

==Local attractions==
===Kusatsu Onsen===

There are about 100 hot springs in Kusatsu with a total amount of about 34,000 liters water per minute pouring out of the ground. The water is sulfurous and acidic. The hot springs are said to help cure: arthralgia, stiff shoulders, paralysis, hardenings, bruises, sprains, chronic indigestion, hemorrhoids, chills, arteriosclerosis, burns, chronic gynecological disorders. The water from the natural hot springs is used not only for bathing but also for heating of the city&#x27;s primary and secondary schools, the municipal welfare center, the streets during winter and many households, as well as for the municipal swimming pool.

The Yubatake, one of the biggest hot springs and the main attraction of the town, is located in the center of Kusatsu. The spring water pours out of the rock and is then conducted through several rows of wooden boxes. In these wooden boxes one of Kusatsu&#x27;s specialties is cultivated. The word Yubatake means &quot;hot water field&quot;. 

Around the Yubatake, there are 100 name plates of famous persons that visited Kusatsu. Internationally well-known are: Erwin Bälz (German internist), Julius Scriba (German surgeon), Bruno Taut (German architect), Ernest Satow (British researcher of Japan and diplomat), Kakuei Tanaka (Japanese prime minister 1972 - 1974), Rikidōzan (famous pro wrestler). On the lower part of the Yubatake there is a small cascade and the rock has an emerald shade. This is one of the most popular spots for souvenir pictures. 

* , though located adjacent to the Yubatake, is a hot spring in its own right. The water is about 54 degrees Celsius, so it is not possible to bathe in it. For that reason there is the ancient tradition of , which means kneading or bashing the water. Using 1.80 meter long wooden boards the hot water is stirred, bashed, kneaded and thus cooled down. The simpler method of pouring in cold water is not practiced as it would dilute the healing power of the water. During the &quot;Yumomi&quot; ceremony, the Kusatsu song is sung and Japanese traditional dance is performed.
* is named after spring water forming a waterfall. The building is made from wood and there is one basin on the inside and one on the outside (&quot;Rotenburo&quot;). Th
* is an outside basin of approximately 500 m2, which can be used by more than 100 guests at once. There are separate baths for men and women divided by a wooden fence. Located in a valley overflowing with hot springs claims to be one of the most beautiful &quot;rotenburo&quot; of Japan.

* March 28, 2010 - Kuni was merged into the expanded town of Nakanojō.

==Name origin==
Before the creation of Kusatsu village in 1889, there were six villages, called Akaiwa, Kosame, Hikage, Ooshi, Iriyama, and Irusu. When thinking of a name in 1900, Kuni, meaning six put together (六合), was chosen since there were six villages. The pronunciation of the village&#x27;s name came from the Nihon Shoki.

<doc id="868370" wikidata="Q27582" url="?curid=868370" title="Duesenberg">
<text>Duesenberg Automobile &amp; Motors Company, Inc. was an American racing and luxury automobile manufacturer founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, by brothers Fred and August Duesenberg in 1920. The company is known for popularizing the straight-eight engine and four-wheel hydraulic brakes. A Duesenberg car was the first American car to win a Grand Prix race, winning the 1921 French Grand Prix. Duesenbergs won the Indianapolis 500 in 1922 (when eight of the top ten finishers were Duesenbergs), 1924, 1925 and 1927. Transportation executive Errett Lobban Cord acquired the Duesenberg corporation in 1926. The company was sold and dissolved in 1937.

==History==
Fred and August Duesenberg began designing engines in the early 1900s, after Fred became involved with bicycle racing. The brothers designed a vehicle in 1905, and they formed the Mason Motor Car Company in 1906 with funds from lawyer Edward R. Mason in Des Moines, Iowa. F.L. and Elmer Maytag acquired a majority stake in the company and renamed it the Maytag-Mason Automobile Company until they sold their stake in 1912.

The Duesenberg brothers then moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, where they established the Duesenberg Motors Company in 1913. Eddie Rickenbacker drove the first Duesenberg-designed vehicle to race at the Indianapolis 500 in 1914, placing tenth. During World War I, the Duesenbergs designed and built aircraft engines in Elizabeth, New Jersey. A Duesenberg driven by Tommy Milton won the 1919 Elgin Trophy. In 1919, the brothers sold their Saint Paul factories.

In 1920, the Duesenberg brothers relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, where they founded the Duesenberg Automobile &amp; Motors Company, manufacturing the Duesenberg Model A. The brothers assumed engineering roles after signing over the naming rights and patents for Duesenberg engines to promoters Newton E. Van Zandt and Luther M. Rankin. The first ModelA was commissioned by Hawaiian businessman and politician Samuel Northrup Castle. The car had a straight-eight engine that output , the largest engine in a commercially available vehicle at the time, and was the first to have hydraulic brakes on all its wheels.

The company continued to build race cars as well, and a Duesenberg driven by Jimmy Murphy won the 1921 French Grand Prix, the first American car to do so. Duesenberg cars also performed well at the Indianapolis 500 during the 1920s, winning the race in 1922, 1924, 1925 and 1927.

Van Zandt left the company in 1921, after which it struggled financially and entered receivership in 1924. Duesenberg was purchased by Errett Lobban Cord in 1926. August&#x27;s role in the passenger-car side of the business declined after Cord&#x27;s takeover, and August worked primarily in Duesenberg&#x27;s racing division after 1926, designing all Duesenberg race cars built from that year until the company&#x27;s dissolution. Two years later, Cord had the Duesenbergs make a new model to &quot;outclass&quot; all other American cars. In 1929, the company began selling the Duesenberg Model J, which was powered by a straight-eight engine. The body and cabin were custom-built by coachbuilders. Prices for the cars ranged from $14,000 to $20,000 at the time.

Duesenbergs were considered to be among the most luxurious American cars ever made. Historian Donald Davidson called them the &quot;most prestigious passenger car&quot; in American history and likened them to an American version of the Rolls-Royce. The vehicles were popular with movie stars, royalty and other wealthy individuals. The company was sold by Cord and dissolved in 1937. The last Duesenberg to be made by the original company was completed in 1940, commissioned by German artist Rudolf Bauer and completed by August Duesenberg after the company had shut down.

In 1998, The Franklin Mint started producing collectible scale models of Duesenberg Coupé Simone, a fictitious custom-made luxury car allegedly manufactured in the late 1930s.

===Revivals===
Several unsuccessful attempts were made to revive the Duesenberg name. August Duesenberg failed to restart the company in 1947, and an attempt by his son, Fritz, and car designer Virgil Exner to revive the brand failed after the production of one concept car in 1966. In 1970, Bernard Miller bought the Duesenberg Corporation and produced the SSJ model from templates taken from the original 1935 SSJ La Grande body. The body was aluminum over ash. There were grand plans for over 300 SSJ&#x27;s to be produced but over the company&#x27;s life span of 1970-1974 only 8 were completed. 

=== Duesenberg II ===

In 1978, Elite Heritage Motors acquired the trademark for Duesenberg and started producing the handmade &quot;Duesenberg II&quot; in Elroy, Wisconsin, under the name Duesenberg Motors Company. The &quot;Duesenberg II&quot; retained the styling of the cars from the 1920s and 1930s, but included some modern updates, such as stereo systems, air conditioning, and an automatic transmission. Each &quot;Duesenberg II&quot; was precisely measured using an original example as a template. Over 5,000 manhours of craftsmanship was put into each car. In 1981, a new Duesenberg II Royalton had a base price of $125,000. The company produced several models, including the Torpedo sedan and phaeton, and the Murphy roadster. The factory produced a total of 67 cars before closing in 2001.

=== Duesenberg Custom Coach ===

In 1996, the Duesenberg name was revived by Minnesota based company Duesenberg Custom Coach. Designed by Jeff Teague, the new &#x27;Duesenberg Torpedo Coupe&#x27; would feature a radical axial twelve-cylinder engine layout known as a &#x27;Cylindrical Energy Module&#x27; or CEM. Adapted from a firefighting pump design by car designer Eddie Paul, the CEM would rotate on an axis, sucking in fuel and providing self lubrication and was capable of running on either petrol or diesel. The powerplant would also allegedly create only 1/6th of the heat of a conventional engine, meaning air cooling would be sufficient. A Mercedes V12 engine was planned to be used if this powerplant prove to be too costly or difficult to implement. Alongside this, the Torpedo coupe would be the first production automobile to use Bose electromagnetic suspension, alongside incorporating a number of new innovative technologies.

Despite plans of producing between 25 and 50 units per year, the project never materialised.

==Products==
===Model A (1921–1927)===

Duesenberg&#x27;s first car was the Model A. It is powered by the Duesenberg Straight-8 engine and was the first car to be mass-produced with a straight-eight. The purchase price for a ModelA started at $6,500 (). The Duesenberg ModelA introduced several innovative features, such as an overhead camshaft, four-valve cylinder heads, and the first four-wheel hydraulic brakes offered on a passenger car. It had the largest engine of any consumer vehicle at the time of its production.

The Duesenberg Model A experienced various delays going from prototype to production. Deliveries to dealers did not start until December 1921. Sales lagged, and Duesenberg could not meet a 100-vehicles-per-month quota as the Indianapolis plant struggled to roll out one a day. In 1922, no more than 150 Duesenberg ModelAs were manufactured, with only a total of 650 units sold over a period of six years.

===Model X (1926–1927)===
The Model X is a sportier version of the ModelA with a heavier and longer ( wheelbase) chassis and engine that enabled it to reach . The most notable differences between the Aand the X were that the latter had hypoid differentials and all its valves were on one side.

The Duesenberg Model X chassis is an upgrade over the ModelA chassis, offering a reworked straight-8 engine, an overhead cam, with a new crankshaft, revised valve train, improved pistons and superior intake manifold. Power is 100 hp, which made driving at possible. The chassis length increased to , with additional reinforcements. Improved leaf springs are mounted above the frame rails, thus, lowering the center of gravity. The Duesenberg ModelX chassis is the rarest Duesenberg street production chassis ever made, with only thirteen ever manufactured. Only five of the Duesenberg ModelXs manufactured are known to have survived.

===Model J (1928–1937)===

The first Model J prototype was created in 1927 and the first cars were delivered in 1929, shortly before the onset of the Great Depression. About three hundred ModelJs were completed by 1930, short of the original 500-vehicle goal.
The car&#x27;s engine was based on the company&#x27;s racing engines of the 1920s and was manufactured by another Cord company, Lycoming. It output , aided by dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder, making it the most powerful car of its time. The ModelJ was capable of a top speed of , and in second gear. Duesenberg historian Randy Ema wrote that the ModelJ spurred change in engine design, &quot;single-handedly (starting) the horsepower race that drove the number of cylinders from twelve to sixteen,&quot; but noted those engines still could not match the ModelJ&#x27;s power output.

Only the chassis and engine of the ModelJ were displayed, as the body and cabin of the car were custom built per custom for luxury vehicles at the time. The company&#x27;s chief body designer, Gordon Buehrig designed around half of the ModelJ bodies, while the remainder were designed by coachbuilders around the world, including Gurney Nutting, Murphy, and Derham, among others.

The J was available in two versions of chassis with a different wheelbase; a longer one () and a shorter one (about ). There were also other special sizes, like the SSJs with a wheelbase shortened to and a few cars with the wheelbase extended to and over.

The supercharged Model J, referred to as the SJ, was reported to have reached in second gear and have a top speed of in third gear. Zero-to- times of around eight seconds and in 17 seconds were reported for the SJ despite having an unsynchronized transmission, at a time when even the best cars of the era were not likely to reach . The SJ had a wheelbase of . The SJ was introduced in 1932. Only 36 units were built. A special version of the SJ, the &quot;Mormon Meteor&quot;, broke several land speed records.

Investors in New York City originally supported the ModelJ, but following the Stock market crash of 1929, the market for ModelJs switched to Hollywood stars. The one-off SJ Twenty Grand was produced in 1933 for the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair to represent Duesenberg&#x27;s automotive progress. Two modified ModelJs, known as the SSJ, were produced in 1935 for actors Gary Cooper and Clark Gable. The SSJ reportedly produced and could go in less than 8 seconds. Cooper&#x27;s SSJ sold for $22 million in 2018, making it the most expensive American car ever sold at auction at the time. About 378 of 481 ModelJs of all types still existed as of 2002.

<text>Buggingen is a municipality in the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany located between the Rhine Valley and the Black Forest on the northern edge of Markgräflerland.

Buggingen lies in the western part of the pre-Black Forest mountains.

It is home to many vineyards and is a largely agricultural center. It also is home to Germany&#x27;s largest tech mail order company. Buggingen administratively also includes Seefelden and Betberg, which is the site of a Protestant retreat centre.

==History==

The village was first referred to in 778. It was mentioned in the &quot;Urkundebuch&quot; of the monastery of Lorsch as &quot;Buchinger marca&quot;. In 940 the village shifted to the control of the Bishop of Constance.

As far as can be ascertained, Buggingen has been associated with vineyards throughout its history. The settlement of Buggingen has its origins in the alemannische. As a number of documents confirm, the majority of the property was in the hands of the church. Property owners were the monasteries in Lorsch, St. Blasien, Tennenbach, St. Peter, St. Trudpert, Sulzburg, Kappel, Neuenburg, Adelhausen, Sitzenkirch und Sölden.

In 1934, 86 people were killed in an accident at a salt mine near Buggingen. The site of the mine, which was opened in 1904 and closed in 1973, is now a museum.

==Business==
Perhaps the largest business in the town is a computer mail order catalog company called, Pearl, which also has an outlet store in Auggen.

<text>Hobbit (&quot;Russian:&quot; Хоббит) is a Soviet/Russian 8-bit home computer, based on the ZX Spectrum hardware architecture.
Besides Sinclair BASIC it also featured CP/M, Forth or LOGO modes, with the Forth or LOGO operating environment residing in an on-board ROM chip.

==Overview==

&quot;Hobbit&quot; was invented by Dmitry Mikhailov &quot;(Russian: Дмитрий Михайлов)&quot; (all R&amp;D) and Mikhail Osetinskii &quot;(Russian: Михаил Осетинский)&quot; (management) in Leningrad, Russia in the late 1980s. The original circuit layout was designed on a home-made computer (built in 1979 using ASMP of three KR580 chips - Soviet Intel 8080 clones), also created by Dmitry Mikhailov. The computer was manufactured by the joint venture &quot;InterCompex&quot;.

&quot;Hobbit&quot; was marketed in the former Soviet Union as a low-cost personal computer solution for basic educational and office needs, in addition to its obvious use as a home computer. Schools would use it on the classrooms, interconnecting several machines and forming a 56K baud network. It was possible to use another Hobbit or a IBM PC compatible with a special Hobbit network adapter card by InterCompex as a master host on the network.

The &quot;Hobbit&quot; was also briefly marketed in the U.K., targeted mainly at the existing &quot;ZX Spectrum&quot; fans wanting a more advanced computer compatible with the familiar architecture. It was mentioned on Your Sinclair September 1990 and January 1991 issues; Crash April 1992 issue, and on Sinclair User August and September 1992 issues, highlighting the available Forth language and CP/M operating system.

Domestic models often did not include the TV output, the internal speaker or both. The AY8910 chip for the domestic models was sold separately as an external extension module, hanging off the same extension bus as the optional external disk drive.

Another extension was the SME (Screen and Memory Extension) board. This featured 32 KB of cache memory, some of which could be dedicated to a video text buffer in CGA mode (only supported by drivers in the FORTH or the CP/M environments; no known programs using the Sinclair-based BASIC mode used this feature). SME worked at astonishing speed - one machine code command made an output of an entire display line. SME was capable of rendering several dozens of windows per second, and its capabilities were fully utilized only in the Forth environment.

<text>Oranienbaum () is a Russian royal residence, located on the Gulf of Finland west of St. Petersburg. The Palace ensemble and the city centre are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==History==
In 1707, four years after Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg, he gave the grounds near the seaside to his right-hand man, Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov.

Menshikov commissioned the architects Giovanni Maria Fontana and Gottfried Schädel, who built his residence, the Grand Menshikov Palace from 1710 to 1727 (not to be confused with Menshikov Palace in Saint Petersburg, built by the same architects around the same time). Menshikov was deposed shortly after Peter&#x27;s death, and died in exile, and the palace passed out of his family. In 1743, Oranienbaum became the summer residence of Grand Duke Pyotr Fyodorovich, the heir of Empress Elizabeth (the future Emperor Peter III). From 1756 to 1762, the architect Antonio Rinaldi built the Peterstadt Fortress ensemble on the bank of the Karost River for Grand Duke Peter Fedorovitch. 
From the outside, the palace is a relatively simple building, single-storey except for the small central pavilion, painted in a mellow combination of ochre and yellow. The Upper Park was laid out from 1750 to 1770.

The palace was the site of two opera premieres to libretti by Metastasio in the middle of the eighteenth century, &quot;Amor prigioniero&quot; (one act, composed by Francesco Araia, 1755), and &quot;Semiramide riconosciuta&quot; (three acts, composed by Vincenzo Manfredini, 1760).

In the 19th century, Oranienbaum became a noble manor. During World War II, Oranienbaum suffered to a much lesser extent than other suburbs of St. Petersburg, since defense was deployed here on the so-called “Oranienbaum Bridgehead”. However, the ensemble became desolate in the post-war period, and its serious restoration began only in the late 1990s. Restoration Of Oranienbaum has been a slow process. For the city which grew up around the palace see Lomonosov, Russia.

<doc id="868407" wikidata="Q5027882" url="?curid=868407" title="Campaigns of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars">
<text>The French Revolutionary Wars re-escalated as 1793 began. New powers entered the First Coalition days after the execution of King Louis XVI on 21 January. Spain and Portugal were among these. Then, on 1 February France declared war on Great Britain and the Netherlands.

Three other powers made inroads into overwhelmingly French-speaking territory in the following months prompting France to amass, domestically, an army of 1,200,000 soldiers. The very ascendant Jacobins executed thousands of proven and suspected dissenters, in the final, climactic phase of the Reign of Terror. Counter-revolutionary forces turned Toulon over to Britain and Spain on 29 August, capturing much of the French navy, a port not retaken by Dugommier (with the assistance of the young Napoleon Bonaparte) until 19 December. Between these months a battle on the northern frontier, in September, was won by France, which saw the mainly British siege of Dunkirk lifted. The year ended with the First French Republic&#x27;s government, the National Convention, having rebuffed attacks from the south and south-east but having made an unsuccessful counter into Piedmont (toward Turin).

==Campaigns==
At the opening of the year, Dumouriez chose to ignore orders from the government in Paris to defend Belgium and instead began an invasion of the Netherlands, hoping to overthrow the stadtholder and establish a popular republic backed by France. In the event, he took Breda in Brabant and prepared to cross into Holland and capture Dordrecht. However, the armies remaining in Belgium suffered a number of defeats, such as by the Austrians at Aachen and Liège and their raising (lifting) Miranda&#x27;s siege of Maastricht. Dumouriez was forced by his superiors to return to Belgium and take command in the Flanders Campaign.

After a defeat at Neerwinden, Dumouriez had to retreat from Belgium. He then made an agreement with the Austrians to hand over to them several border fortresses in return for a truce where he could march on Paris and restore the monarchy under the Constitution of 1791. However, he was unable to secure the loyalty of his troops, and he defected to the Austrian lines rather than face arrest by the Jacobins.

At the same time, the increasing power of radicals in Paris incited revolt in the provinces, with the people of Lyon and Marseille rebelling and the Vendée raising an army to attack the central government and open communications with Britain. Spanish armies crossed the Pyrenees, Kingdom of Sardinia (largely Piedmont-Savoy) armies various Alpine borders, and Austrian armies occupied Valenciennes and forced the northern armies back toward Paris. Britain ordered a naval blockade of France on 31 May.

The revolutionary government prepared a full mobilization of the nation (see Levée en masse), showing no mercy to internal or external enemies. According to Mignet&#x27;s&quot; History of the French Revolution&quot;: &quot;The republic had very soon fourteen armies, and 1,200,000 soldiers. France, while it became a camp and a workshop for the republicans, became at the same time a prison for those who did not accept the republic.&quot; They proceeded to suppress Caen, Lyon, and Marseille, although the counter-revolutionary forces turned Toulon over to Britain and Spain on 29 August, resulting in the capture of much of the French navy, and Toulon was not retaken by Dugommier (with the assistance of the young Napoleon Bonaparte) until 19 December.

In September, Nicolas Houchard defeated the Duke of York at Hondschoote, forcing him to abandon the siege of Dunkirk. In October Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, taking over the northern armies, won the Battle of Wattignies and returned to the offensive, but did not make major gains before the winter.

In the Pyrenees, the French armies ended the year on a defensive posture near the border, while on the Alpine frontier, a French invasion of Kingdom of Sardinia failed.

<doc id="868415" wikidata="Q730470" url="?curid=868415" title="Errett Lobban Cord">
<text>Errett Lobban &quot;E. L.&quot; Cord (July 20, 1894 – January 2, 1974) was an American business executive. He was considered a leader in United States transport during the early and middle 20th century.

Cord founded the Cord Corporation in 1929 as a holding company for over 150 companies he controlled, mostly in the field of transportation. The corporation controlled the Auburn Automobile Company, which built the Auburn and Cord automobiles; Lycoming Engines; Duesenberg Inc.; New York Shipbuilding; Checker Motors; Stinson Aircraft Company; and American Airways (later American Airlines), amongst other holdings.

In 1932, Cord formed the Aircraft Development Corporation, which was instrumental in the development of Jerry Vultee&#x27;s Vultee V-1.

==Biography==
Born in Warrensburg, Missouri, Cord had been a race car driver, mechanic and car salesman before he was offered the opportunity to manage the dying Auburn Automobile Company in 1924. By 1928 he controlled Auburn, which by 1931 was the 13th largest seller of autos in the United States. During 1934, he moved to England, reportedly because of kidnapping threats. He moved back to the United States in 1936, but then came under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for his dealings in Checker Cab stock. In 1937 he sold the Cord Corporation to the Aviation Corporation and retired to Los Angeles to earn even more millions in real estate. Cord owned several of the first radio and television stations in California and later Nevada, where he moved in the 1940s. In the call letters of his Los Angeles radio station, KFAC, the A.C. stands for Auburn Cord. In Reno, Cord established KCRL-TV and radio in the 1950s and operated it for more than 25 years. The &#x27;CRL&#x27; in the station&#x27;s call letters stood for &quot;Circle L&quot;—a ranch Cord owned in the Nevada desert.

During the 1940s he filled in for a Nevada state legislator who died in the middle of his term and again rose to fame as a politician in his later life. In 1958 he was asked to run for governor of Nevada, but he refused and never explained why. He died in Reno, Nevada from cancer in 1974, aged 79.

==Legacy==
Cord established The E.L. Cord Foundation on December 4, 1962. After his passing, a substantial portion of his Estate was dedicated to the foundation to be used for the betterment and well being of mankind.

The foundation established the E.L. Cord Museum School and funds several scholarships at the Nevada Museum of Art.

Other grants in the field of education include the E.L. Cord Student Success Center and The E.L. Cord Foundation Center for Learning and Literacy at the University of Nevada, scholarships at Truckee Meadows Community College, and a fellowship at Wichita State University.

A collection of Cord&#x27;s autos is in Auburn, Indiana, (1600 South Wayne Street) at the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum.

==Popular culture==
Gram Parsons wrote a song about Cord called &quot;The New Soft Shoe&quot; that appeared on his first solo release, titled &quot;GP&quot;.

<text>Hunza River () is the principal river within the Hunza region in Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan. It is formed by the confluence of the Chapursan and Khunjerab &quot;nalas&quot; (gorges) which are fed by glaciers. It is also joined by the Gilgit River and the Naltar River, before it flows into the Indus River.

The river cuts through the Karakoram range, flowing from north to south. The Karakoram Highway (N-35) runs along the Hunza River valley, switching to the Khunjerab River valley at the point of confluence, eventually reaching the Khunjerab Pass at the border with China at Xinjiang.

The river is dammed for part of its route.

The Attabad landslide disaster in January 2010 completely blocked the Hunza Valley. The blocked Hunza River created a lake — called the Attabad Lake or Gojal Lake, which extended 30 kilometers and rose to a depth of 400 feet (approximately 122 meters). The landslide completely covered sections of the Karakoram Highway.

The Hunza River is being affected by the climate change.

<text>How Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent? (How Late Do You Have To Be Before You Are Absent?) is a double album by George Clinton &amp; the P-Funk All-Stars, released September 6, 2005 on Clinton&#x27;s label The C Kunspyruhzy. The album also featured release in France on Nocturne Records. It is their first album of new studio material since 1996&#x27;s &quot;T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M.&quot; (The Awesome Power Of A Fully Operational Mothership), which was primarily due to a lengthy court battle over ownership of Clinton&#x27;s recordings.

&quot;How Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent?&quot; features appearances by Prince and Jazze Pha, alongside members of Parliament-Funkadelic. The album is compiled from different sessions over the last decade and is presented as a taste of more new Parliament and Funkadelic material to come. Clinton cited it as &quot;one of the best records we&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. Despite mixed criticism towards its indulgent style, &quot;How Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent?&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics.

<text>The is an executive department of the Government of Japan, and is responsible for the country&#x27;s foreign policy and international relations.

The ministry was established by the second term of the third article of the National Government Organization Act, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Establishment Act. According to the law, the mission of the ministry is &quot;to aim at improvement of the profits of Japan and Japanese nationals, while contributing to maintenance of peaceful and safe international society, and, through an active and eager measure, both to implement good international environment and to keep and develop harmonic foreign relationships&quot;.

== Policy formulation ==

Under the 1947 constitution, the cabinet exercises primary responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs, subject to the overall supervision of the National Diet. The prime minister is required to make periodic reports on foreign relations to the Diet, whose upper and lower houses each have a foreign affairs committee. Each committee reports on its deliberations to plenary sessions of the chamber to which it belongs. Ad hoc committees are formed occasionally to consider special questions. Diet members have the right to raise pertinent policy questions—officially termed interpellations—to the minister for foreign affairs and the prime minister. Treaties with foreign countries require ratification by the Diet. As head of state, the emperor performs the ceremonial function of receiving foreign envoys and attesting to foreign treaties ratified by the Diet.

As the chief executive and constitutionally the dominant figure in the political system, the prime minister has the final word in major foreign policy decisions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, a member of the cabinet, acts as the prime minister&#x27;s chief adviser in matters of planning and implementation. The minister is assisted by two vice ministers: one in charge of administration, who was at the apex of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs structure as its senior career official, and the other in charge of political liaison with the Diet. Other key positions in the ministry include members of the ministry&#x27;s Secretariat, which has divisions handling consular, emigration, communications, and cultural exchange functions, and the directors of the various regional and functional bureaus in the ministry.

The ministry&#x27;s staff includes an elite career foreign service corps, recruited on the basis of a competitive examination and thereafter trained by the ministry&#x27;s Foreign Service Training Institute. The handling of specific foreign policy issues is usually divided between the geographic and functional bureaus to minimize overlap and competition. In general, bilateral issues are assigned to the geographic bureaus, and multilateral problems to the functional bureaus. The Treaties Bureau, with its wide-ranging responsibilities, tend to get involved in the whole spectrum of issues. The Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau engages in comprehensive and coordinated policy investigation and planning.

Long a profession of high social prestige, diplomatic service from the Meiji period through World War II was a preserve of the upper social strata. In addition to formal qualifications, important prewar requirements for admission were proper social origin, family connections, and graduation from Tokyo Imperial University (the present-day University of Tokyo). After World War II, these requirements were changed as part of democratic reform measures but foreign service continued to be a highly regarded career. Most career foreign service officers had passed the postwar Higher Foreign Service Examination before entry into the service. Many of these successful examinees were graduates of the prestigious Law Faculty of the University of Tokyo. Almost all ambassadorial appointments since the 1950s have been made from among veteran diplomats.

Diplomacy in postwar Japan was not a monopoly of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Given the overriding importance of economic factors in foreign relations, the ministry worked closely with the Ministry of Finance on matters of customs, tariffs, international finance, and foreign aid; with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) on exports and imports; and with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries on questions of foreign agricultural imports and fishing rights. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also consulted other agencies, such as the Defense Agency, the Fair Trade Commission, the Japan Export-Import Bank (JEXIM), the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, and the Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency. On many issues affecting the country&#x27;s foreign economic activities—and thus its diplomatic relations as well—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sometimes MITI and the Ministry of Finance were known to favor liberalizing import restrictions. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries and other domestic ministries, however, took a more protectionist stand, evidently because of pressures from special interest groups.

The vital importance of foreign affairs expanded to affect virtually every aspect of national life in postwar Japan, and the multiplicity of agencies involved in external affairs continued to be a source of confusion and inefficiency in the formulation of foreign policy. Yet as the postwar generation of leaders and policymakers began to assume a greater role in government decision making and as public attitudes on foreign policy issues matured, there were indications that foreign affairs were being conducted on the basis of a more stable consensus.

The current Minister for Foreign Affairs is Takeshi Iwaya.

== Diplomatic Bluebook ==
The is an annual report produced by the Ministry outlining the government&#x27;s foreign policy and assessment of international political trends. The Bluebook was first issued in 1957. The report can trigger reactions from other countries upset with relevant Japanese policy. For instance, the omission of the phrase &quot;South Korea is our most important neighbor&quot; and the addition of &quot;South Korea&#x27;s occupation of [the Liancourt Rocks] is illegal&quot; in the 2018 Bluebook caused significant controversy with the South Korean government.

<doc id="868430" wikidata="Q3247581" url="?curid=868430" title="Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars">
<text>The French Revolutionary Wars continued from 1793 with few immediate changes in the diplomatic situation as France fought the First coalition.

On the Alpine frontier, there was little change, with the French invasion of Piedmont failing. On the Spanish border, the French under General Dugommier rallied from their defensive positions at Bayonne and Perpignan, driving the Spanish out of Roussillon and invading Catalonia. Dugommier was killed in the Battle of the Black Mountain in November.

On the northern front in the Flanders Campaign, the Austrians and French both prepared offensives in Belgium, with the Austrians besieging Landrecies and advancing towards Mons and Maubeuge. The French prepared an offensive on multiple fronts, with two armies in Flanders under Pichegru and Moreau, and Jourdan attacking from the German border. The French withstood several damaging but inconclusive actions before regaining the initiative at the battles of Kortrijk, Tourcoing and Fleurus in June. The French armies drove the Austrians, British, and Dutch beyond the Rhine, occupying Belgium, the Rhineland, and the south of the Netherlands.

On the middle Rhine front in July General Michaud&#x27;s Army of the Rhine attempted two offensives in July in the Vosges, the second of which was successful, but not followed up allowing for a Prussian counter-attack in September. Otherwise this sector of the front was largely quiet over the course of the year.

At sea, the French Atlantic Fleet succeeded in holding off a British attempt to interdict a vital cereal convoy from the United States on the First of June, though at the cost of one quarter of its strength. In the Caribbean, the British fleet landed in Martinique in February, taking the whole island by 24 March and holding it until the Peace of Amiens, and in Guadeloupe in April, where they captured the island briefly but were driven out by Victor Hugues later in the year. In the Mediterranean, following the British evacuation of Toulon, the Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli agreed with admiral Samuel Hood to place Corsica under British protection in return for assistance capturing French garrisons at Saint-Florent, Bastia, and Calvi, creating the short-lived Anglo-Corsican Kingdom.

By the end of the year French armies had won victories on all fronts, and as the year closed they began advancing into the Netherlands.

<text>Domenico Nicola Aniello Scotti is an American former actor, model and singer.

Scotti left high school to travel the world for a career in modeling, moving to Japan at age 17 and France at age 19. In the process, he became a popular male model. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; in June 1996 with a heading that read, &quot;Biology of Beauty&quot;. 

His self-titled debut album, released in 1993 on Reprise Records, contains two songs that reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. The first, &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;, was a cover version of a hit song by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes from 1976. It reached No. 9 on the Club Play chart in May of that year and remained on the chart for eleven weeks. The follow-up single, &quot;Get Over&quot;, was written by Madonna and Stephen Bray and produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone. &quot;Get Over&quot; peaked at No. 33 on the Club Play chart.

From 1996 through 1999, Scotti had a contract role on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, where he portrayed an auto mechanic named Tony Viscardi. In 1997, he starred in the independent film &quot;Kiss Me, Guido&quot;, which was directed by Tony Vitale. For his role in that film, he received a Leonardo da Vinci Award from the Beaux Arts Society, Inc. in the category of Actor, Debut Performance (Film) in 1997. Other film credits include &quot;Bullet&quot; (1996) and &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; (1999).

Scotti appeared in episodes of the television programs &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot;. In 2004, he hosted a cooking, fashion, and lifestyle show on the Style Network titled &quot;New York Nick&quot;.

<text>Pitkern, also known as Pitcairn-Norfolk or Pitcairnese, is a language spoken on Pitcairn and Norfolk islands. It is a mixture of English and Tahitian, and has been given many classifications by scholars, including cant, patois, and Atlantic creole. Although spoken on Pacific Ocean islands, it has been described as an Atlantic or semi-Atlantic creole due to the lack of connections with other English-based creoles of the Pacific. There are fewer than 50 speakers on Pitcairn Island, a number which has been steadily decreasing since 1971.

==History==
Following the Mutiny on the Bounty on 28 April 1789, the British mutineers stopped at Tahiti and took 18 Polynesians captive, mostly women, to remote Pitcairn Island and settled there. A pidgin was formed based on English and Tahitian so that the English mutineers could communicate with the Tahitian women they brought to the previously uninhabited Pitcairn Island. The Pitkern language was influenced by the diverse English dialects and accents of the crew. Geographically, the mutineers were drawn from as far as the West Indies, with one mutineer being described as speaking a forerunner of a Caribbean patois. One was a Scot from the Isle of Lewis. At least one, the leader Fletcher Christian, was a well-educated man, which at the time made a major difference in speech. Both Geordie and West Country dialects have obvious links to some Pitkern phrases and words, such as &quot;whettles&quot;, meaning food, from &quot;victuals&quot;.

The first children born on Pitcairn Island mainly spoke a mixture of non-standard varieties of English and the contact language. In the 1830s, Pitkern&#x27;s local prestige increased, and the language started to be used in church and school. In 1856, 194 residents of Pitcairn Island moved to Norfolk Island, where many residents continued to use Pitkern in their households.

After 1914, the Australian government tried to end the use of Pitkern/Norf&#x27;k by restricting its use in public spaces.

==Relationship to Norf&#x27;k==
Norf&#x27;k is descended predominantly from Pitkern. When the residents of Pitcairn Island moved to Norfolk Island, they brought the language with them. The language developed and changed over time. The relative ease of travel from English-speaking countries such as Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea to Norfolk Island, particularly when compared with that of travel to the Pitcairn Islands, has meant that Norf&#x27;k has been exposed to much greater contact with English relative to Pitkern. The difficulties in accessing the Pitcairn population have meant that a serious comparison of the two languages for mutual intelligibility has proven difficult.

The exact relationship between these two languages is a point of contention for scholars. Some believe that the difference between Pitkern and Norf&#x27;k is negligible, while others believe that Standard English is more present in Norf&#x27;k than it is in Pitkern.

== Common phrases ==
Pronouns included , commonly spelled &#x27;we/us&#x27; (or just &#x27;us&#x27;, with for &#x27;we&#x27;); , &#x27;you and I&#x27; / &#x27;you and us&#x27;, and &#x27;you (plural)&#x27;.

&quot;Note: Pitkern spelling is not standardised.&quot;

== Excerpts from a transcription of Pitkern ==
The sentences below are excerpted from a longer dialogue held in 1951 between a teenage speaker of Pitkern and A.W. Moverley, a foreigner who worked as a schoolteacher on Pitcairn during the mid-20th century. The dialogue was recorded by Moverley and later transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by A.C. Gimson, with translations to English provided by Moverley.






==Poetry in Pitkern==
Some poetry exists in Pitkern. The poems of Meralda Warren are of particular note.

<doc id="868475" wikidata="Q3297231" url="?curid=868475" title="Maschalismos">
<text>Maschalismos () is the practice of physically rendering the dead incapable of rising or haunting the living in undead form. It comes from the Ancient Greek word and was also the term for procedural rules on such matters in later Greek customary law.

Such acts considered &quot;maschalismos&quot; were not limited to folkloric physical risings but also meant to escape the ill will of those wrongfully slain by a murderer after death. Sophocles expresses that such treatment is saved for one&#x27;s &#x27;enemies&#x27; due to the act being a way to elicit indignation as well as dishonor the dead.

In Aeschylus&#x27; tragedy &quot;Choephori&quot; and Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Electra&quot;, Clytemnestra performs maschalismos on the body of Agamemnon after his murder, to prevent him from taking vengeance on her. In the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes, Jason performs maschalismos on the body of Medea&#x27;s brother Apsyrtus after treacherously murdering him; in addition to cutting off the extremities, Jason licks the dead man&#x27;s blood three times and spits it out three times. &quot;The scholiast says that the blood was spat into the mouth of the deceased&quot;, according to a footnote in the Loeb edition.

<doc id="868476" wikidata="Q7766544" url="?curid=868476" title="The Stingray Shuffle">
<text>The Stingray Shuffle is Tim Dorsey&#x27;s fifth novel, published in 2003. It is the fifth novel to feature criminal Serge A. Storms, and also concludes the story arc, begun in the first novel, &quot;Florida Roadkill&quot;, about Serge&#x27;s pursuit of a briefcase containing $5 million.

==Plot summary==
Novelist Ralph Krunkleton has never been more than marginally successful, but his publishers are surprised to see sales of his novel &quot;The Stingray Shuffle&quot; soaring in a small bookstore in Miami Beach, Florida, called &quot;The Palm Reader&quot;. The book&#x27;s publishers mount a publicity blitz culminating in a train journey with the author from New York to Miami. What they do not realize is that no one is reading the book; the owners of the bookstore are selling packets of cocaine in hollowed-out paperback copies of &quot;Shuffle&quot;, trusting that no legitimate customer will ask for such an obscure title. Unfortunately, the publicity campaign sparks a reading at the store with Krunkleton as the guest speaker, where the cocaine in the books is discovered and the owners are forced to close and flee the county.

The owners - five former KGB agents dismissed from intelligence work for gross stupidity - are then recruited by &quot;Mr. Grande&quot;, the head of the &quot;Mierda&quot; Cartel (the smallest in the world) to track down a briefcase containing $5 million in cash that was accidentally paid out by the insurance company that was laundering the Cartel&#x27;s earnings. The briefcase was last seen at the conclusion of &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel&quot;, in the possession of private investigator Paul and Ernest Hemingway-impersonator Jethro Maddox. Also on the trail of the briefcase are Serge and his traveling companion, Don Johnson-impersonator Lenny Lipowicz.

The briefcase changes hands several times, and Paul, Jethro, and several of the Russians are killed, before their leader, Ivan, finally gets the briefcase from Serge (who was hoping to use the money to buy a trip into space and a monogrammed spacesuit from the Russians) and takes it to New York planning to buy a former Soviet submarine that Mr. Grande has promised to a larger, Colombian cartel for drug trafficking. Serge leaves Lenny at his mother&#x27;s home and follows Ivan&#x27;s trail to New York.

While searching for the briefcase, Serge encounters five single mothers from Miami, who have been best friends since college and now formed a book club. They have traveled to Manhattan to attend the New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration in Times Square and then join the Krunkleton book tour on its way back to Florida. The women are instantly taken with Serge, and he seduces one of them, Samantha, who invites him to join them aboard the &quot;Silver Stingray&quot;.

Ivan inadvertently switches the briefcase with an identical one carried by a bathroom attendant; when the attendant peeks inside and sees the money, he flees New York on the first available train, the &quot;Silver Stingray&quot;. Searching the attendant&#x27;s apartment, Ivan and a Jamaican gang leader, &quot;Zig-Zag&quot;, hear a message on his answering machine confirming the train booking.

Hijinks ensue aboard the train, which has been set up as a mystery tour loosely based on one of Krunkelton&#x27;s books. These include Ivan and Zigzag jumping their car onto the roof of the train from an overhanging bridge, and Serge feverishly searching the train&#x27;s staterooms for the briefcase. In the finale, the train derails, and Serge, &quot;in character&quot; as the mystery tour&#x27;s detective, dramatically announces that one of the other actors, a washed-up hypnotist named Preston, was actually murdered rather than killed in the crash. Serge then deduces that Preston was the man who impregnated each member of the book club in college years ago, and they signed up for the tour not just to meet Krunkelton, but to confront Preston. At first, they believe he is accusing one of them of the murder, but he confesses that he killed Preston himself, as just punishment for his treatment of them. Then the unstable train lurches again, and Serge hits his head, becoming amnesiac. He wanders off the train in a daze, and Samantha discovers the briefcase hidden with her luggage.

A few months later, the five women are living large, having shared the $5 million between themselves. When they meet again to discuss Ralph Krunkelton&#x27;s latest novel (a lurid potboiler inspired by his sudden notoriety after the train crash), they raise a toast to Serge, wherever he may be.

In fact, Serge is camping on an off-limits island off the Florida coast, giving history lessons to its population of test monkeys.

=== Johnny Vegas ===
Several of Dorsey&#x27;s novels features one or more failed attempts by his recurring character, Johnny Vegas, to finally lose his virginity. In this novel:
*Johnny takes a girl to a mini-golf course, pretending to be a golf pro; they try to have sex in the range cart, but as it makes its way onto the course, it becomes a target for the other golfers, causing the woman to jump out in fear before getting hit on the head with a ball;
*Johnny tries to have sex with a female book reviewer aboard the &quot;Silver Stingray&quot;, but when the train derails, both Johnny and the woman are unharmed, but the woman is too shaken to continue.
*On a speed boat, Vegas takes a woman to the small island. High on cocaine, the woman takes off her clothes and runs onto the island. Just as Johnny follows, the pair are attacked by the test monkeys.
*Johnny also recalls two failures from his past:
**Trying to have sex with a Cuban girl in Little Havana, before being interrupted by the FBI&#x27;s removal of Elián González from his relatives&#x27; home nearby.
**Trying to have sex with a female attorney, who becomes irretrievably distracted by the news of the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling against Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election.

<doc id="868477" wikidata="Q5027883" url="?curid=868477" title="Campaigns of 1795 in the French Revolutionary Wars">
<text>The French Revolutionary Wars continued from 1794 between Revolutionary France and the First coalition.

The year opened with French forces in the process of attacking the Dutch Republic in the middle of winter. The Dutch people rallied to the French call and started the Batavian Revolution. City after city was occupied by the French. The Dutch fleet was captured, and the stadtholder William V fled to be replaced by a popular Batavian Republic, which supported the revolutionary cause and signed the Treaty of The Hague on 16 May 1795, ceding the territories of North Brabant and Maastricht to France.

With the Netherlands falling, Prussia also decided to leave the coalition, signing the Peace of Basel on 6 April, ceding the west bank of the Rhine to France. This freed Prussia to finish the occupation of Poland.

The French army in Spain advanced, advancing in Catalonia while taking Bilbao and Vitoria and marching toward Castile. By 10 July, Spain also decided to make peace, recognizing the revolutionary government and ceding the territory of Santo Domingo, but returning to the pre-war borders in Europe. This left the armies on the Pyrenees free to march east and reinforce the armies on the Alps, and the combined army overran Piedmont.

Meanwhile, Britain&#x27;s attempt to reinforce the rebels in the Vendée by landing troops at Quiberon failed, and a conspiracy to overthrow the republican government from within ended when Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s garrison used cannon to fire grapeshot into the attacking mob (which led to the establishment of the Directory).

On the Rhine frontier, General Pichegru, negotiating with the exiled Royalists, betrayed his army and forced the evacuation of Mannheim and the failure of the siege of Mainz by Jourdan. This was a moderate setback to the position of the French.

In northern Italy victory at the Battle of Loano in November gave France access to the Italian peninsula.

<text>Timothy Alan Dorsey (January 25, 1961 – November 26, 2023) was an American novelist. He is known for a series starring Serge A. Storms, a mentally disturbed vigilante antihero who rampages across Florida enforcing his own moral code against a variety of low-life criminals.

==Biography==
Tim Dorsey was born in Carmel, Indiana, and was taken to Florida by his mother at the age of 1. He grew up in Riviera Beach, a small town in Palm Beach County just north of West Palm Beach. Dorsey graduated from Bishop Guertin High School in Nashua, N.H., in 1979.

Dorsey attended Auburn University, where he became the editor of &quot;The Auburn Plainsman&quot;, the student newspaper; he wrote about racism while at Auburn. Dorsey graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Transportation. After graduation, he moved to Montgomery, Alabama, and served as a police reporter for a local newspaper. In 1987, Dorsey relocated to Tampa, Florida, and became a reporter for &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;. Until he resigned from the paper in 1999 to write full-time, he worked variously as political reporter, correspondent in the &quot;Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Tallahassee bureau, copy desk editor, and, finally, night metro editor and news coordinator.

Dorsey lived in Tampa with his wife and two daughters and was a Tampa Bay Rays fan. He also still considered himself a Boston Red Sox fan, cultivated while attending high school in New Hampshire as a teen.

Dorsey died in Islamorada, Florida, on November 26, 2023, at the age of 62.

==Serge Storms==

Most of Dorsey&#x27;s novels feature Serge A. Storms as the primary character. The character has several coexisting mental illnesses that render him obsessive, psychopathic, schizophrenic, and frequently homicidal, but Storms serves as the anti-hero in Dorsey&#x27;s works due to his strong sense of moral absolutism and justice. Serge is intelligent, and frequently devises wildly inventive ways of condemning villains (or at least who he perceives as such) to death. His co-pilot in the majority of his adventures is Coleman, whose personality is the exact opposite of Serge. Whereas Serge is a high-strung straight-edged coffee addict, Coleman is an alcoholic drug user who goes to extreme lengths to maintain his buzz.

<text>Victor Value was a London-based value supermarket group that operated at the discount end of the grocery trade. 

The brand was started by the group London Grocers, who also ran London United Grocers, Bernard Best, Newmans Stores and Titus Ward &amp; Co. In 1965, the rival supermarket chain Anthony Jackson Foodfare was purchased, which added a further 61 stores to the Victor Value chain.

In 1968, Victor Value had 217 stores, and was sold to Tesco for £1.75 million. Tesco converted many larger branches to their own brand including some to Tesco Home n&#x27; Wear, and closed a number of smaller branches which were in close proximity to an established Tesco store, while those that retained the Victor Value fascia traded at the budget end of the market. Prior to Tesco&#x27;s purchase, the board of Victor Value had decided to drop S &amp; H Pink saving stamps, using the £1 million it had cost to discount goods instead. The purchase of Victor Value by Tesco and trying to integrate it nearly brought the company down. Old Victor Value stores which survived after conversion to Tesco could, for some time, be identified by their distinctive blue and white tiled frontage.

At the beginning of the 1980s, some smaller town centre Tesco stores were rebranded as Victor Value. These town centre stores, including ones in Huyton and Bexleyheath, were used to trial new scanning and barcode technologies, before launching them as Tesco-branded stores. In 1986, frozen food supermarket chain Bejam purchased the 45 store chain from Tesco, itself being taken over by rival Iceland in January 1989. Victor Value&#x27;s remaining stores were sold by Iceland to British discount supermarket chain Kwik Save.

<doc id="868505" wikidata="Q1901958" url="?curid=868505" title="Neoromanticism (music)">
<text>In Western classical music, neoromanticism is a return to the emotional expression associated with nineteenth-century Romanticism. Throughout the 20th and into the 21st century, numerous composers have created works which rejected or ignored emerging styles such as Modernism and Postmodernism. 

==Definitions==
Neoromanticism was a term that originated in literary theory in the early 19th century to distinguish later kinds of romanticism from earlier manifestations. In music, it was first used by Richard Wagner in his polemical 1851 article &quot;Oper und Drama&quot;, as a disparaging term for the French romanticism of Hector Berlioz and Giacomo Meyerbeer from 1830 onwards, which he regarded as a degenerated form of true romanticism. The word came to be used by historians of ideas to refer to music from 1850 onwards, and to the work of Wagner in particular. The designation &quot;neo&quot; was used to acknowledge the fact that music of the second half of the 19th century remained in a romantic mode in an unromantic age, dominated by positivism, when literature and painting had moved on to realism and impressionism.

According to Daniel Albright, In the late twentieth century, the term Neoromanticism came to suggest a music that imitated the high emotional saturation of the music of (for example) Schumann [ Romanticism ], but in the 1920s it meant a subdued and modest sort of emotionalism, in which the excessive gestures of the Expressionists were boiled down into some solid residue of stable feeling. Thus, in Albright&#x27;s view, neoromanticism in the 1920s was not a return to romanticism but, on the contrary, a tempering of an overheated post-romanticism.

In this sense, Virgil Thomson proclaimed himself to be &quot;most easily-labeled practitioner [of Neo-Romanticism] in America,&quot;
Neo-Romanticism involves rounded melodic material (the neo-Classicists affected angular themes) and the frank expression of personal sentiments. . . . That position is an esthetic one purely, because technically we are eclectic. Our contribution to contemporary esthetics has been to pose the problems of sincerity in a new way. We are not out to impress, and we dislike inflated emotions. The feelings we really have are the only ones we think worthy of expression. . . . Sentiment is our subject and sometimes landscape, but preferably a landscape with figures.)

==Notable composers==
The United States has a sizable tradition of neoromantic composers, following practitioners from the mid-20th century such as Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein, David Diamond, Ned Rorem and John Corigliano. Younger generations include Richard Danielpour, Jennifer Higdon, Aaron Jay Kernis, Robert Maggio and Christopher Rouse.

Since the mid-1970s the term has come to be identified with neoconservative postmodernism, especially in Germany, Austria, and the United States, with composers such as Wolfgang Rihm and George Rochberg. Currently active US-based composers widely described as neoromantic include David Del Tredici and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. Francis Poulenc and Henri Sauguet were French composers considered neoromantic, while Virgil Thomson, Nicolas Nabokov, Howard Hanson and Douglas Moore were American composers considered neoromantic.

<text>Junior Vasquez (born Donald Gregory Mattern; August 24, 1949) is an American DJ, record producer and remixer. He has been referred to as one of the only DJs of his time to gain international attention.

== Career ==
Mattern moved to New York City as a young man of 22 in 1971 with ambitions of becoming a fashion designer, briefly attending Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and working for a while as a hairdresser. Mattern soon became fascinated with NYC nightlife, especially the work of DJ Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage. Despite his Italian and German ancestry, he adopted the pseudonym &quot;Junior Vasquez&quot; (inspired by the Latino neighborhoods he frequented) as a way to &quot;reinvent&quot; himself.

He began his career in music production in the 1980s. Vasquez worked with DJ and pop remixer/producer Shep Pettibone, and together they co-produced and edited numerous singles from artists like Madonna, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, MC Hammer, Prince, Pet Shop Boys and others. Vasquez landed a brief residency at Club Bassline, where he began to make a name for himself as a live DJ.

Many of Junior Vasquez&#x27;s earliest underground hits were released under the name &quot;Ellis D&quot;, including the house track, &quot;Work This Pussy&quot;. Vasquez also released the tracks &quot;Just Like a Queen&quot;, &quot;My Lolleata&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Scratched&quot;, and &quot;Took My Love Away&quot;.

From 1989 to 1995, Vasquez was the DJ at the original Sound Factory, a club he co-founded with Richard Grant, which was located at 530 W. 27th St in the Chelsea district. Major record labels began soliciting Vasquez to produce club-friendly remixes for their top singers using his personal beat-driven house style. Due to a rise in demand from these labels, many singer and musicians like C+C Music Factory, David Morales, Björk, Marilyn Manson, and Madonna were known to frequent his Sunday morning events. Working with many popular artists allowed Vasquez to create his own repertoire of exclusive &quot;Private Collection&quot; of authorized remixes (along with several unofficial remixes) which were not released to the market, and thus made his live sets even more distinctive to his following.

In 1994, Vasquez released his notably biggest single &quot;Get Your Hands Off My Man&quot;. At this time he was also associated with The House of Xtravaganza, a ballroom &quot;house&quot; which enjoyed prominence in New York City at this time. In the early 1990s, Vasquez released his single &quot;X&quot;, which sampled Danny Xtravaganza say the word &quot;extravaganza!&quot; (the voice sample was taken from Danny Xtravaganza&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Love the Life You Live&quot;).

After the Sound Factory was closed in February 1995, Vasquez held residencies at the Tunnel (1995–1996), and at ArenA (held at the Palladium) (1996–1997) where his suspended booth was custom designed by designers Dolce &amp; Gabbana. In 1997, he returned to the former site of the original Sound Factory, now called Twilo. Remodeled to include a custom-designed DJ booth for Vasquez&#x27;s exclusive use and fitted with new cutting-edge audio technology known as &quot;Phazon&quot;, Vasquez&#x27;s residency at Twilo lasted until May 2001, when the venue was closed by order of the city. In 1997, Ian Jenkinson and Inner Rhythm Artists Tribal Gathering enlisted Vasquez for the largest single artist DJ event in UK history at the London Arena. Problems with the venue saw the event split between the two clubs: Ministry of Sound and Cream.

Vasquez held shorter-lived residencies at the various clubs in New York including, Exit Nightclub, the highest capacity club space in New York City where he called the Saturday to Sunday sets &quot;Earth,&quot; Discothèque, Sound Factory (so-named by Richard Grant who retained legal rights to the name) and opened in a new space located in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen section of Manhattan.

In addition to his work as a DJ and remixer, he has co-produced albums for John Mellencamp, For Real, Lisa Lisa, and Cyndi Lauper as well as individual LP tracks for Madonna, Cher, Wild Orchid, and Kristine W. Vasquez, along with his former record label Junior Vasquez Music, is also known for introducing new artists, including many crossover singers, to dance/pop music scene, including Vernessa Mitchell, Jason Walker, Casey Stratton, Quentin Elias, Vivian Green, and Sam Harris. Finally on June 28, 2021, after nearly 40 years in the music business, Vasquez was inducted as a voting member into the Recording Academy (Grammys).

=== Madonna controversy ===
Vasquez had a public falling-out with Madonna in 1996, after the release of an unauthorized single titled &quot;If Madonna Calls&quot;. The original version that Vasquez plays at nightclubs contains what is widely believed to be an actual phone message from Madonna left on Vasquez&#x27;s answering machine.

<text>Karl František Koecher (born 21 September 1934 in Bratislava) is a Czech mole known to have penetrated the CIA during the Cold War.

==Early life==
Born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, his father was a Viennese-born Czech and his mother Irena, a Slovak Jew. As the son of an Anglophile, Koecher gained his language skills from an early age attending an English grammar school and later French lyceum before the war. Prior to his entry to university, his anti-state activities in his teen years attracted the attention of the Czechoslovakia State Security after the Communists took over in Czechoslovakia in 1948.

As remembered by some of his classmates, from early age he showed strong analytical capabilities, high intelligence and individualistic nature. Due to his unlikeable character, in later years, his former classmates would not invite him on annual class meetings. He studied physics and mathematics at Charles University as well as film at the Academy of Performing Arts.

After university he tried a few jobs including a teacher, a reporter for state television, and a radio comedy writer. He became a radio comedy writer and was allegedly frequently scrutinized by the Communist security forces for his satire that mocked the regime (this turned out to be a pre-planned &quot;cover story&quot;). He joined the Communist Party in 1960, and the Czechoslovak intelligence service in 1962 using the codename &quot;Pedro&quot;.

== Czechoslovakia State Security (StB) career ==
Koecher claimed that constant harassment from the Czechoslovakia State Security (StB) due to his history of anti-state and anti-social behavior, ruined his different careers and in order to end the harassment, he decided to join the StB. With the help of a friend within the StB and his language skills, he was recruited into the intelligence service.

Koecher&#x27;s first two years were devoted to training and counter-intelligence work against West Germans in Prague.

Koecher was selected to become a mole in the West working with the first directorate in the Stb because of his English language skills.

;Immigration to the United States
In 1965 he and his wife, Hana Koecher (the daughter of a Communist Party official), seemingly emigrated to the United States via Austria posing as defecting dissidents.

His language skills and status as a defector aided Koecher in gaining employment at Radio Free Europe and a year long fellowship at Indiana University.

He returned to New York in 1967 and he gained a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University, and became an American citizen in 1971.

;CIA work
With the purge of his superiors at the StB during the aftermath of the 1968 Soviet Union led invasion of Czechoslovakia, he found himself out of touch with the service and approached the FBI instead in an attempt to defect and use his knowledge against the Soviets but they were not interested.

His supply of information to the StB dwindled from 1969 until 1971, but he continued to integrate himself in American society.

Taking a CIA prescreening employment exam in November 1972, he passed and was employed. After several years as a sleeper he was hired by the CIA as a translator/analyst in 1973 due to his fake dissident credentials and skills in a number of Eastern European languages. He was given high level security clearance and given the job of translating and analyzing documents handed over by CIA agents and transcripts of wiretaps and bugs.

He quickly became one of the USSR&#x27;s best sources of information, allowing them to mount an effective defense against CIA covert actions. He translated documents from a key CIA asset in Moscow, Ogorodnik. According to Martha D. Peterson, a retired CIA officer, Koecher is believed to have betrayed Aleksandr Dmitrievich Ogorodnik, a Soviet diplomat who spied for the CIA.

;KGB death threat and CIA retirement
In September 1976, however, Koecher was summoned back to Prague to a meeting with KGB head of counter-intelligence, Oleg Kalugin. Kalugin claims that after interrogating Koecher, Kalugin argued that he was in fact a triple agent and his information could not be trusted. According to Koecher, the StB then ordered Koecher to resign from the CIA or face death.

After seven days of interrogation, Koecher returned to New York and retired, leaving the CIA for a post in academia teaching philosophy.

; Reactivation 
By 1982, Koecher was rehabilitated by the KGB after Kalugin was demoted from chief of foreign counterintelligence and Koecher&#x27;s past intelligence had been reassessed. In the 1980s, Koecher was one of a number of agents reactivated, when he was approached by the StB intelligence officer Jan Fila, operating out of the UN, in New York. He returned to work part-time for the CIA. Although the FBI asserts that they had been monitoring and surveilling Koecher and his wife from the early 1980s, it was at least three years before he was arrested.

To this day, neither the FBI nor the CIA will reveal what alerted them to Koecher&#x27;s treachery. Koecher and other KGB officials claim it was Kalugin. Another suggestion by a CIA historian, is that it was the StB intelligence officer, Jan Fila, who betrayed him with the latter disappearing in December 1989, a month after the Czechoslovakian Velvet Revolution.

==Apprehension==
The FBI apprehended Koecher on 27 November 1984, outside New York City&#x27;s Barbizon Plaza Hotel, and brought him and, soon afterwards, his wife Hana in for several days of questioning. Finally, Koecher agreed to become a triple agent working for the Americans, provided that they agreed to grant him immunity from prosecution. This was done and Koecher attempted to convince the FBI that he was cooperating.

However, it was then decided that Koecher was not reliable enough to be a triple agent and was likely to defect and return to Czechoslovakia. On November 27, 1984, the day after the couple sold their apartment and hours before they were scheduled to fly to Switzerland, Koecher and his wife were arrested in New York City. Koecher was held on espionage charges and Hana Koecher as a material witness. The arrest of the two agents was released to the media. U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani led the case. The case on his wife, Hana, a purported diamond merchant but actually a courier for the StB from 1974 to 1983, had been bungled and would not result in a conviction, so the prosecutors allowed her to gain immunity in return for information against her husband Karl Koecher.

It soon emerged that the FBI had badly blundered. Koecher&#x27;s confession was given only after his interrogators promised him immunity as a ruse, and was thus invalid. His wife had been denied access to a lawyer despite frequent requests for one, which reportedly caused Justice Department officials to refuse to charge her. She refused to testify against Karl, asserting spousal privilege, though prosecutors argued this did not apply given the two had been partners in crime. With little concrete evidence, it appeared that Koecher had a good chance of being acquitted. The issue of whether or not Hana Koecher could be compelled to testify against her husband went before the US Supreme Court but the fact that both spouses were returned to Czechoslovakia in a prisoner exchange before the court&#x27;s opinion was published rendered the case moot. According to Koecher, Rudy Giuliani, as a prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, had bungled the case and was unable to gain enough evidence to convict Koecher after Koecher&#x27;s arrest and instead offered immunity to Koecher in exchange for more information.

Koecher was the victim of an attempted stabbing by an unnamed inmate while in prison. The inmate supposedly lunged at Koecher with a pair of scissors in an attack Koecher said was foiled by a Hells Angels member, Sandy Alexander. Koecher claims the inmate was moved to another prison, and could not be located years later, which he says is proof of an attempt by US intelligence agencies to assassinate him.

Koecher, worrying about his own safety, sent through his lawyer and his spouse&#x27;s father, a request to the KGB chairman that he be part of a prisoner exchange with the Soviets. KGB chairman Kryuchkov agreed, and so did the prosecutor&#x27;s office, concerned about the embarrassing chance of an acquittal. Koecher pleaded guilty on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage for Czechoslovakia, and was sentenced to life in prison, which was reduced to time served provided he left the US and never returned. On February 11, 1986, Koecher and his wife were part of a nine-person exchange at Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, of which the most prominent member was noted dissident Anatoly Shcharansky.

==Return==

Koecher returned to Czechoslovakia to a hero&#x27;s welcome and was given a house and a Volvo car as a reward for his services. He was also given a job at the Prague Institute for Economic Forecasting, where many future politicians worked; Václav Klaus and Miloš Zeman, the future Czech presidents, were among them. Some U.S. journalists stated they had seen Koecher issuing orders at the Laterna Magika theatre during the early days of the Velvet Revolution (1989). Koecher denied any involvement in the Velvet Revolution, saying that journalists must have mixed him up with the then unknown Václav Klaus, who had a similar appearance.

The fall of communism has seen Koecher fall from prominence, with the exception of his alleged involvement in a scheme run by Oswald LeWinter, a self-professed former CIA operative, to defraud Mohammed Al-Fayed with false documents that would support his conspiracy theories about the death of Princess Diana. He continues to live in the Czech Republic in relative obscurity. His wife, Hana Koecher, made the headlines in the Czech Republic, when she was fired from her new job as a translator for the British Embassy in Prague. The British were completely unaware of her espionage past until a Czech newspaper reporter notified them. A suit she filed against a media organisation for revealing her past as a spy, damaging her business, was rejected.

An episode of the 2004 Canadian documentary series &quot;Betrayal!&quot; covered the Koecher case.

<text>Gu-Edin (also transcribed &quot;Gu&#x27;edena&quot; or &quot;Guedena&quot;) was a fertile plain in Sumer, in modern-day Iraq. It lay between Umma and Lagash, and claims made on it by each side were a cause of the Umma-Lagash war. Argument over the territory continued for around 150 years.

== Early history ==

According to a peace between Umma and Lagash mediated by Mesilim, king of Kish had determined where the boundary lay and the terms of use of a canal used to irrigate the land. The terms of that agreement were recorded on a stone monument called a stele, but Umma continued to feel that Lagash were unfairly advantaged by it.

== Reign of Eannatum ==
It is recorded on the Stele of the Vultures that Gu-Edin was pillaged by a later (énsi) of Umma, who ruled that city on behalf of its god Shara, and whose name, according to the Cone of Enmetena, was Ush. Gu-Edin had been claimed by the énsi of Lagash, Eannatum – author of the Stele of Vultures – as the property of Lagash&#x27;s god, Ninĝirsu, and the pillaging precipitated a war between the two cities.

Eannatum attacked back and Umma was heavily defeated. By the time peace was re-established, Ush was either dead or deposed. 

=== Treaty ===
A peace treaty was agreed between his successor, Enakalli, and Eannatum which established Gu-Edin as the property of Ninĝirsu. A deep canal was dug to mark the freshly agreed border and two stone monuments were put in place: the Stele of Mesilim, which had been there before, and a newly carved one. Leonard William King, writing in 1910, suggested that the second stele may have had much the same text as the Stele of the Vultures, but that the latter would not have been on the boundary itself. 

The treaty, which was sealed with oaths and the erection of temples, also included the establishment of an &#x27;ownerless&#x27; tract of land intended as a buffer, and treated any barley Umma grew in that area of Gu-Edin to which it had access as a loan from Lagash, with resulting interest. That area of land, then, could be used by Umma but only by paying rent. However, Umma did not reliably pay up.

== Later events ==

Gu-Edin was invaded by Umma at least twice during the reign of Eannatum&#x27;s son, Entemena: once by Ur-Lumma and once by his successor Illi. The first attack was defeated soundly, according to Entemena&#x27;s account, and the second was not lastingly successful.

Lagash finally fell to Lugalzagesi, king of Umma, circa 2350 BCE, ending the First Dynasty of Lagash. Tablets of lamentation have been found, recording the fall of Lagash to Lugalzagesi, during the rule of Urukagina. Lugalzagesi went on to conquer the whole of Sumer, until he was himself vanquished by Sargon of Akkad.

<text>The Great Stand on the Ugra River () or the Standing on the Ugra River, also known as the Battle of the Ugra, was a standoff in 1480 on the banks of the Ugra River between the forces of Akhmat Khan of the Great Horde, and Grand Prince Ivan III of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

After Ivan III stopped paying tribute to the Horde, Akhmat Khan led an army towards Moscow, leading to a standoff between the two armies on the banks of the river. Akhmat Khan waited for his Lithuanian reinforcements to arrive, but they never did, with one Mongol attempt to cross the river failing due to Russian fire, leading to Akhmat Khan retreating. Both armies departed after little fighting. Nevertheless, the outcome of the campaign corresponded to the strategic plan of the Russians to defend the capital and the border from the Tatars.

In Russian historiography, it has been interpreted as the end of the &quot;Tatar yoke&quot; in Russia, though some historians believe that the event itself was insignificant and did not change Russo-Tatar relations. Nevertheless, the event is usually regarded as the end of nominal Tatar suzerainty over Russia.

==Background==
The main Russian defence line ran along the Oka River from Kaluga east toward Nizhny Novgorod. At Kaluga the Oka bends sharply from north to east and the defense line was extended westward along the Ugra River. The land west and south of Kaluga was claimed by Lithuania. At this time Ivan III was uniting the lands north of the Oka. At the same time the Golden Horde was breaking up and the steppe remnant came to be called the Great Horde. Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland-Lithuania was allied with the Great Horde, while Muscovy was allied with the Crimean Khanate against the Horde. In 1472 Akhmed of the Great Horde raided the Oka at Aleksin but was driven off. In 1476 Russia officially stopped paying tribute to the Tatars. In late 1479 Ivan quarreled with his brothers, Andrey Bolshoy and Boris of Volotsk, who began intriguing with Casimir. This internal conflict may have influenced Akhmed&#x27;s decision to attack.

==Campaign==
In late May news of the pending invasion reached Moscow. Nesin (2015) says it was the largest Tatar army in the fifteenth century. One faction wanted to flee north, but was overruled. In June Ivan sent troops south to the Oka: to Serpukhov under his son Ivan the Young, to Tarusa under his brother Andrey the Less, and under Ivan himself to Kolomna. Tatar scouting parties soon appeared south of the Oka. Russian outposts reported that Akhmed was tending northwest so Russian troops were moved west toward Kaluga. Forces from Tver moved toward the Ugra. Around 30 September Ivan returned to Moscow to meet with his bishops and boyars and major decisions were made. The quarrel with his brothers was settled and their troops began moving toward the Oka. The state treasury and royal family were moved north to Beloozero, and some cities were evacuated. Vasily Nozdrovaty and the exiled Crimean khan Nur Devlet were sent east down the Oka and Volga to attack Akhmed in the rear. Meanwhile, Akhmed had moved northward between the upper Don and Oka and at an uncertain date made camp at Vorotynsk just south of the Ugra-Oka junction on the west bank of the Oka. Here he waited for Casimir, who never came. Casimir was tied down fighting the Crimeans in Podolia, but he may have had other reasons for not coming. On 3 October Ivan moved to Kremenets (now in modern Medynsky District) to watch the front. Nesin (2015) gives the Russian front as 60 versts (kilometers), but does not specify its start and end points.

On 6–8 October Akhmed moved his troops up to the Ugra. Fighting began at one o&#x27;clock on the eighth and continued for almost four days. Attempts to cross the river failed, largely because of Russian fire, and because the river was wide enough to make Tatar arrows ineffective. The battlefield extended five kilometers along the Ugra from its mouth westward. Akhmed withdrew two versts (kilometers) south to a place called Luza. He then tried to secretly move his troops to a place called &#x27;Opakhov&#x27;, but his movement was detected and the crossing blocked. Ivan began negotiations with Akhmed, which led nowhere, but gave Ivan time to bring up more troops. Both sides spent the next month watching each other across the river.

It was getting late in the season and both sides knew that once the river froze solid it would no longer be a barrier. Akhmed could concentrate his forces and break the thin Russian line at any point. Ivan&#x27;s best plan was to pull back and concentrate his force. On 26 October Ivan began moving troops from the Ugra northeast to Kremenets and then east to Borovsk. Here he had a good defensive position to protect Moscow and could strike in any direction if Akhmed chose to advance. Akhmed expected Casimir IV Jagiellon to join him with Lithuanian reinforcements, but Casimir faced a revolt at home and never showed up. Instead of advancing, on 8 November Akhmed began to withdraw. News of the retreat reached Ivan on 11 November. In his retreat, Akhmed raided twelve Lithuanian towns, including Mtsensk. His son Murtaza raided some villages south of the Oka until the Russians drove him off. On 28 November Ivan returned to Moscow. In January 1481 Akhmed was killed by Ibak Khan.

==Reasons for Akhmed&#x27;s withdrawal==

Nikolay Karamzin wrote: &quot;It should have been an odd image: two armies ran away from each other, not pursued by anyone&quot;, but it is now clear that the two withdrawals were independent. Ivan&#x27;s motive is clear, but Akhmed&#x27;s motives are a matter of guesswork. Casimir&#x27;s failure to appear was clearly important. Nesin thinks that a major factor was the end of Ivan&#x27;s quarrel with his brothers and the resulting additional troops. The impending Russian winter was a consideration. The longer the standoff lasted, the more troops Ivan could bring up, while Akhmed&#x27;s reserves were few and far away. The Tatar horses, and the sheep they drove with them for food, gradually consumed the local fodder. There are reports of disease in his army. Akhmed may have thought Ivan&#x27;s withdrawal was a ruse to draw him into an ambush, a common steppe tactic. Even if there were no ambush, he would have to fight an army in a prepared position, or try to bypass it. The Tatars preferred hit-and-run raids and Akhmed may not have wished to attack a concentrated army. The sources do not explain why he did not try to outflank the Russian line by moving west. His wise, but seemingly cowardly, withdrawal probably contributed to his death a few months later.

== Aftermath ==
On 6 January 1481, Akhmat Khan was killed in a clash with the Nogais under Ibak Khan, a princeling from the Khanate of Sibir. In 1502, Crimea destroyed the Great Horde as an organization, thereby removing the buffer between Russia and Crimea and leading to a series of Russo-Crimean wars that lasted until 1784.

For the next century, relations between the Russians and Mongols continued to rapidly change, with both launching incursions and attacks against each other. In 1521, the Crimean Khanate plundered southern Russia and almost reached Moscow. Both Russia and Lithuania allied with different khanates before moving to another.

==Legacy==
According to Russian historiography, the event marked the end of Russian dependency on Tatar overlords. On the other hand, some modern historians regard the confrontation as indecisive, and not having a significant effect on Muscovite–Tatar relations. Charles Halperin mentioned that &quot;Moscow had probably ceased paying tribute to the Great Horde sometime in the 1470s&quot; yet continued formal relations for 20 more years and continued to pay tribute of some sort to other khanates at times. Janet Martin dismissed the significance of the standoff as &quot;embellished&quot;. However, one significant change was that no Russian prince needed to ask for permission again from a Tatar khan to rule.

Some of the earliest Russian sources mentioning the event include:
* The &quot;Epistle to the Ugra&quot; (), written by Vassian Patrikeyev, bishop of Rostov and confidant of Ivan III.
* The anonymous &quot;Epistle to Ivan IV&quot; (dated 1550s), attributed to Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow or the priest Sylvester.
* The anonymous &quot;Kazan Chronicle&quot; () alias &quot;Kazan History&quot; () (dated 1560s).

<text>Mirwais Ahmadzaï (born 23 October 1960), known mononymously as Mirwais, is a French electronic dance music record producer and songwriter, born in Lausanne, Switzerland to an Afghan father and an Italian mother. A former member of the now-defunct 1980s group Taxi Girl, he is perhaps best-known for his work with American artist Madonna, whom he first met in the late 1990s. After submitting a demo of his work to her label, Maverick Records, Mirwais eventually teamed-up with the singer in 1999 to create &quot;Music&quot; (2000), a global smash record for Madonna; the album, as well as its title track single, peaked at No. 1 or within the Top 10 on the charts of several countries and territories, including the UK, US, Canada and Australia.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Mirwais Ahmadzaï was born in Lausanne, Switzerland to an Afghan father and an Italian mother. The family lived in Kabul, Afghanistan for a while before relocating to Paris.

===Taxi Girl and Juliette et les indépendants===
Resultantly becoming known in France for this reason for the better part of two decades, Mirwais was a guitarist in the punk group Taxi Girl for eight years, before forming the acoustic outfit &quot;Juliette et les Indépendants&quot; with his then-girlfriend Juliette. Taxi Girl&#x27;s first EP, &quot;(S.O.S Mannequin)&quot;, was released in early 1980 on Pathé Marconi/EMI.

&quot;For a teenager, the late 70s were a strange mixture of disco music and punk, and it was okay to like them all,&quot; he says. Taxi Girl captured the punk rock power of The Stooges, the techno futurism of Kraftwerk and the disco euphoria of Giorgio Moroder and molded the diametrically opposed styles into an electrifying new-wave sound that entertained and inspired a generation of listeners bored by the complacency of 80s French pop. Even the current darlings of the French electronic music scene, such as Daft Punk and Air, continue to namecheck Taxi Girl as a major influence on their artistic directions.
===Solo career===
In 1990, Mirwais released his eponymous debut solo album &quot;Mirwais&quot; which contained nine tracks and was performed by Mirwais exclusively in French; he had not yet learned English.

In 1998, he signed to French independent record label Naïve Records and released the single &quot;Disco Science&quot;. This single was a success as a club dance hit and appeared in the soundtrack for the Guy Ritchie film, &quot;Snatch&quot; and the 2006 Luc Besson film Arthur and the Invisibles. In August 2000, he released the album &quot;Production&quot;, which included the single &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot; made in collaboration with Madonna. It also included two minor chart hits in the UK Singles Chart: &quot;Disco Science&quot; (2000, #68) and &quot;Naive Song&quot; (2000, #50).
Naive Song went to number 2 on the US Dance Club Charts in 2001.

===Madonna===
Madonna recruited him for writing and production collaboration on four of her studio albums: &quot;Music&quot; (2000), &quot;American Life&quot; (2003), &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; (2005), and &quot;Madame X&quot; (2019). He also co-wrote a song that would later appear on her greatest hits album &quot;Celebration&quot; as a previously unreleased track.

Mirwais contributed the following tracks to the Madonna albums:
*&quot;Music&quot;: &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, &quot;I Deserve It&quot;.
*&quot;American Life&quot;: Co-produced the entire record and co-wrote all songs with Madonna, with the exception of &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;X-Static Process&quot; and &quot;Easy Ride&quot;.
*&quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot;: &quot;Future Lovers&quot;, &quot;Let It Will Be&quot;, bonus tracks &quot;Fighting Spirit&quot; and &quot;Super Pop&quot;, and the deleted tracks &quot;Triggering&quot; and &quot;Keep the Trance&quot;.
*&quot;Celebration&quot; (2009 &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation): iTunes bonus track &quot;It&#x27;s So Cool&quot;, a previously unreleased track from &quot;American Life&quot;.
*&quot;Madame X&quot;: &quot;Medellín&quot;, &quot;Dark Ballet&quot;, &quot;God Control&quot;, &quot;Batuka&quot;, &quot;Killers Who Are Partying&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Search I Find&quot;, deluxe edition track &quot;Extreme Occident&quot;, and box set-exclusive tracks &quot;Funana&quot; and &quot;Ciao Bella&quot;.

The &quot;Music&quot; album was nominated for three Grammy Awards including Record of the Year. &quot;Music&quot; won several MTV Europe awards. He was also involved in the writing and production of the title track to the movie &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, co-written and performed by Madonna. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song in 2003.

===Fischerspooner===
Mirwais also co-produced two tracks &quot;Cloud&quot; and &quot;Never Win&quot; on Fischerspooner&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Odyssey&quot;, released in 2005.

===Y.A.S.===

He worked on a project called Y.A.S. The official website stated: &quot;YAS is the name of Mirwais&#x27; new project with the singer and composer Yasmine Hamdan. The album was released in France on 8 June 2009. All songs are performed by her. It is &#x27;Arabic Avant-Garde Music&#x27;&quot;.

In an interview on 13 January 2007 published on lecourrier.ch, Mirwais said, &quot;At the moment I work with Yasmine Hamdan (one half of Lebanon electro-duo Soapkills). The idea is that today, in Western culture, we hear about Arabs everyday – in a bad way, because of terrorism, etc – but we lack of cultural representations coming from those countries that could mix with the western culture, whereas this youth is eager to. I don&#x27;t want to do world music, but a good western production with a real Arab identity.&quot;

Y.A.S.&#x27; album, &quot;Arabology&quot; was released in May 2009, with the first single, &quot;Get It Right&quot;, following in June.

===Uffie===
After remixing &quot;Pop the Glock&quot;, Mirwais became one of the producers of Uffie&#x27;s album &quot;Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans&quot;, for which he produced four songs 
&quot;ADD SUV&quot;, &quot;Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans&quot;, &quot;Illusion of Love&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot;, one of which featured Pharrell Williams (&quot;ADD SUV&quot;) and one which featured Mattie Safer (&quot;Illusion of Love&quot;).

===&quot;The Retrofuture&quot;===
Mirwais announced in early January 2021 via his Instagram page that the release of his third album &quot;The Retrofuture&quot; would take place in 2021.

The music video of the first single, &quot;2016 – My Generation&quot;, premiered on Nowness on 19 April 2021.
The music video was directed by Ludovic Houplain/ H5paris, based on an original idea by Ahmadzaï. &quot;2016 – My Generation&quot; was then released through all DSP platforms on 21 April 2021, making it the first single Ahmadzaï released in 20 years. He described it as &quot;the description of a world that is already there, but in an accumulated form&quot;.

&quot;The Retrofuture&quot; is a concept album that focuses on dematerialisation and falsification. Each song is preceded by the name of a year, as in the title of &quot;2016 – My Generation&quot;.

<doc id="868542" wikidata="Q129811496" url="?curid=868542" title="Campaigns of 1796 in the French Revolutionary Wars">
<text>The French Revolutionary Wars continued from 1795, with the French in an increasingly strong position as members of the First Coalition made separate peaces. Austria and Great Britain were the main remaining members of the coalition. The rebellion in the Vendée was also finally terminated by General Hoche.

Mignet&#x27;s &quot;History of the French Revolution&quot; states:

:&quot;The Directory found the Rhine open towards Mainz, the war of La Vendée rekindled; the coasts of France and Holland threatened with a descent from England; lastly, the army of Italy destitute of everything, and merely maintaining the defensive under Schérer and Kellermann. Carnot prepared a new plan of campaign, which was to carry the armies of the republic to the very heart of the hostile states. Bonaparte, appointed general of the interior after the events of Vendémiaire, was placed at the head of the army of Italy; Jourdan retained the command of the army of the Sambre-et-Meuse, and Moreau had that of the army of the Rhine, in place of Pichegru. The latter, whose treason was suspected by the Directory, though not proved, was offered the embassy to Sweden, which he refused, and retired to Arbois, his native place. The three great armies, placed under the orders of Bonaparte, Jourdan, and Moreau, were to attack the Austrian monarchy through Italy and Germany, combine at the entrance of the Tyrol and march upon Vienna, in echelon. The generals prepared to execute this vast movement, the success of which would make the republic mistress of the headquarters of the coalition on the continent.&quot;

==Italy==

Bonaparte left Paris on 11 March for Nice to take over the weak and poorly supplied Army of Italy, arriving on 26 March. The army was already being reorganised and supplied when he arrived, and he found that the situation was rapidly improving. He was soon able to carry out the plan for the invasion of Italy that he had been advocating for years, which provided for an advance over the Apennines near Altare to attack the enemy position of Ceva.

The Montenotte Campaign opened after Beaulieu&#x27;s Austrian forces attacked the extreme French eastern flank near Genoa on 10 April. Bonaparte countered by attacking and crushing the isolated right wing of the allied armies in the Battle of Montenotte on 12 April. The next day he defeated an Austro-Sardinian force at the Battle of Millesimo. He then won a victory at the Second Battle of Dego, driving the Austrians northeast, away from their Piedmontese allies. Satisfied that the Austrians were temporarily inert, Bonaparte harried Michelangelo Colli&#x27;s Piedmontese at Ceva and San Michele Mondovì before whipping them at the Battle of Mondovì. A week later, on 28 April, Piedmont signed an armistice at Cherasco, withdrawing from the hostilities. On 18 May, Piedmont signed the Treaty of Paris (1796), ceding Savoy and Nice, and allowing France to use its territory for the campaign against Austria.

After a short pause, Bonaparte carried out a brilliant flanking manoeuvre, and crossed the Po at Piacenza, nearly cutting the Austrian line of retreat. The Austrians escaped after the Battle of Fombio, but had their rear-guard mauled at Lodi on 10 May, after which the French took Milan. Bonaparte then advanced eastwards again, drove off the Austrians in the Battle of Borghetto and in June began the Siege of Mantua. Mantua was the strongest Austrian base in Italy. Meanwhile, the Austrians retreated north into the foothills of the Tyrol.

During July and August, Austria sent a fresh army into Italy under Wurmser. Wurmser attacked toward Mantua along the east side of Lake Garda, sending Peter Quasdanovich down the west side in an effort to envelop Bonaparte. Bonaparte exploited the Austrian mistake of dividing their forces to defeat them in detail, but in so doing, he abandoned the siege of Mantua, which held out for another six months. (Carl von Clausewitz mentioned in &quot;On War&quot; that the siege might have been kept up if Bonaparte had circumvallated the city.) The French defeated Quasdanovich at Lonato on 3 August and Wurmser at Castiglione on 5 August. Wurmser retreated to the Tyrol, and Bonaparte resumed the siege.

In September, Bonaparte marched north against Trento in Tyrol, but Wurmser had already marched toward Mantua by the Brenta River valley, leaving Paul Davidovich&#x27;s force to hold off the French. Bonaparte overran the holding force at the Battle of Rovereto. Then he followed Wurmser down the Brenta valley, to fall upon and defeat the Austrians at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. Wurmser elected to march for Mantua with a large portion of his surviving troops. The Austrians evaded Bonaparte&#x27;s attempts to intercept them but were driven into the city after a pitched battle on 15 September. This left nearly 30,000 Austrians trapped in the fortress. This number rapidly diminished due to disease, combat losses, and hunger.

The Austrians sent yet another army under József Alvinczi against Bonaparte in November. Again the Austrians divided their effort, sending Davidovich&#x27;s corps from the north while Alvinczi&#x27;s main body attacked from the east. At first they proved victorious over the French at Bassano, at Calliano, and at Caldiero. But Bonaparte ultimately defeated Alvinczi in the Battle of Arcole southeast of Verona. The French then turned on Davidovich in great strength and chased him into the Tyrol. Wurmser&#x27;s only sortie was late and ineffectual.

==Germany==
Meanwhile, Moreau and Jourdan crossed the Rhine and invaded Germany. Moreau was at first completely successful, and having crossed the Rhine and defeated the Austrian forces there, he advanced into Bavaria and fought the Archduke to an inconclusive draw at Neresheim. Advancing to the edge of the Tyrol, he took Ulm and Augsburg, but Jourdan became separated from Moreau and was defeated by the Archduke Charles of Austria at Amberg and Würzburg, and both armies were forced to retreat separately across the Rhine by September (including the Battle of Theiningen), ending with the Battle of Emmendingen in October and the same territorial conditions as the campaign had begun.

==At sea==

Spain signed the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso with France on 19 August 1796, entering the war against Britain on the side of France in return for concessions in Italy. In response, Britain withdrew from Corsica in order to concentrate the Mediterranean fleet at Gibraltar against the combined threat.

<doc id="868553" wikidata="Q4798252" url="?curid=868553" title="Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Templemore">
<text>Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Templemore (8 January 1797 – 26 September 1837), was a British soldier, politician and courtier.

==Early life==
Chichester was born in Westminster, London, the eldest, and only surviving, son of Lord Spencer Chichester of Dunbrody Park (himself the third son of the 1st Marquess of Donegall) and Lady Anne Harriet Stewart (a daughter of the 7th Earl of Galloway).

He was educated in England at Harrow School from 1808 to 1813 before matriculating at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1815.

==Career==
He entered the British Army, serving with the 2nd Life Guards and eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1827.

In 1826 Chichester was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Milborne Port, a seat he held for four years before becoming representative for County Wexford in 1830. 

The following year, on the occasion of the coronation of William IV, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Templemore, of Templemore in the County of Donegal (&quot;Templemore&quot; refers to the civil parish in the city of Derry, Northern Ireland). He was also made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber in 1835, and in 1837 succeeded this appointment as a Lord in Waiting.

==Personal life==
On 27 July 1820, Chichester married Lady Augusta Paget, daughter of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey and Lady Caroline Elizabeth Villiers. Together, they had five sons and two daughters, including:

* Harry Spencer Chichester, 2nd Baron Templemore (1821–1906), who married his first cousin once removed Laura Caroline Jane Paget, daughter of Rt. Hon. Sir Arthur Paget and Lady Augusta Fane (a daughter of 10th Earl of Westmorland), in 1842. After her death, he married Lady Victoria Elizabeth Ashley-Cooper, daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, and Lady Emily Cowper (a daughter of 5th Earl Cowper), in 1873.
* Hon. Augustus George Charles Chichester (1822–1896), a Lt.-Gen. in the 77th Foot who married Jane Townend, daughter of William Townend, in 1868.
* Hon. Frederick Arthur Henry Chichester (1824–1863), Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod; he married Frances Tighe, daughter of Daniel Bunbury-Tighe and Hon. Frances Crofton (a daughter of Sir Edward Crofton, 3rd Baronet), in 1852.
* Hon. Adolphus William Chichester (1825–1855), who died unmarried.
* Hon. Francis Algernon James Chichester (1829–1885), a Capt. in the 7th Hussars who married Elizabeth Ann Dixon, daughter of George Dixon, in 1855. After her death, he married Lady Emily Stewart, daughter of the Randolph Stewart, 9th Earl of Galloway, and Lady Harriett Somerset (a daughter of 6th Duke of Beaufort), in 1875.
* Hon. Augusta Chichester (1831–1873), who married Robert King, 7th Earl of Kingston, son of Robert King, 6th Earl of Kingston, in 1854. After his death, she married Alfred Henry Caulfeild, son of Francis St. George Caulfeild, in 1872.
* Hon. Caroline Georgiana Chichester (d. 1892), who married Sir Charles Lennox Peel, son of Laurence Peel and Lady Jane Lennox (a daughter of the 4th Duke of Richmond), in 1848.

Lord Templemore died after a short illness on 26 September 1837, aged 40, at his home of Coombe Bank, Kent, and was buried at nearby Sundridge. His wife outlived him by thirty-five years, dying in 1872.

<text>The American Muslim Council (AMC) is an Islamic organization and registered charity in the United States. Its headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois. 

An earlier organization with the same name was founded in 1990 by Abdul Rahman al-Amoudi with the support of the Muslim Brotherhood. (Al-Amoudi is also the former leader of the Islamic Society of Boston.) 

The AMC later reorganized itself under a new name and moved its national headquarters from Washington, D.C. to Chicago. The organization currently using the name &quot;The American Muslim Council&quot; is different from the AMC founded by al-Amoudi; it is much more moderate.

AMC took part in the defense of South Florida Professor and Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Sami Al-Arian and questioned the US government&#x27;s allegation that the professor took part in terrorist activities. AMC produced a pamphlet in which it said that &quot;the FBI has a history of harassing and harming minority and immigrant communities&quot;. On March 2, 2006, Al-Arian entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to help the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a &quot;specially designated terrorist&quot; organization. Al-Arian was sentenced to 57 months in prison, and ordered deported following his prison term.

AMC is also a member of the American Muslim Political Coordination Council (AMPCC), along with the American Muslim Alliance (AMA), Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC). AMPCC&#x27;s primary concern is to coordinate the member organizations on activism and lobbying.

<text>Eucalyptus diversicolor, commonly known as karri, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a tall tree with smooth light grey to cream-coloured, often mottled bark, lance-shaped adult leaves and barrel-shaped fruit. Found in higher rainfall areas, karri is commercially important for its timber.

==Description==
&quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot; is the tallest tree that grows in Western Australia. It is a tall forest tree that typically grows to a height of but can reach as high as , making it the tallest tree in Western Australia and one of the tallest in the world. As of February 2019, the tallest known living karri is just over tall. A tree south of Pemberton, known as &#x27;The Tyrant&#x27; is tall and in girth and contains approximately of wood in its trunk and is thought to be the largest karri by wood volume. A &quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot; of height and of girth in Coimbra, Portugal, is the tallest reliably measured tree in Europe.

Karri are an evergreen tree and typically have a heavy, widespread crown. The tree&#x27;s trunk tend to be long and straight with a diameter of making up about two thirds of the length of the tree.
The trees root can reach depths of up to .

Karri do not form a lignotuber but do form epicormic buds located under the bark along the length of the stem. Trees are able to resprout from the buds after fire or other damage.

The bark on the trunk and branches is smooth, grey to cream-coloured or pale orange, often mottled and is shed in larger plates, short ribbons or small polygonal flakes. The bark sheds each year with the new white bark contrasting with the orange to yellow new bark contrasts against the recently exposed white bark. The bark becomes increasingly granulated with age. The bark is rich in tannins.

The stems and branchlets are round in cross section, the branchlets have no oil glands in the pith.

The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are arranged in opposite pairs, broadly egg-shaped to almost round, paler on the lower surface, long, wide and petiolate. The leaves tend to be more spreading than pendulous. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy dark green on the upper surface, paler below, lance-shaped, long and wide on a flattened or channelled petiole long. The leaves are penniveined, where the veins arise pinnately, in a feather like arrangement, from a single primary vein. The leaves are densely reticulated where the network of veins within the leaf is packed closely together. The prominent vein near the margin of the leaf is very close to the margin and runs almost parallel with it. The yellow oil glands within the leaves are situated in centre of the smallest unreticulated areas. The fine lateral nerves spread at a wide angle from the midrib.

The unbranched inflorescences are situated in the axils in small clusters on a common stalk. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a rounded peduncle long, each bud on a pedicel long. The buds are oval, long and wide at maturity with a conical operculum. Flowering has been observed in January, April, May, August and December, and the flowers are white. The flowers have narrow cylindrical calyx tubes that slowly taper to the base into the pedicel. The many stamen form a continuous ring and has inflected white coloured filaments. The anthers at the end of the filaments have an oblong shape and open into a parallel longitudinal slits.

The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with three valves at or below rim level.

The seeds found within the fruits have a flattened ovoid shape, are grey in colour with a length of . The seeds are pointed at one end with a smooth back and a scar from where it was once attached to the placenta on the underside.

&quot;E.diversicolor&quot; is relatively fast growing, particularly compared to other Eucalypts, and can grow each year for the first five years of its life. It reaches maturity after 10 to 15 years.

The species has a haploid chromosome number of 12.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot; was first formally described in 1863 by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in his book &quot;Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae&quot;. The type specimen was collected in 1860 by the botanist Augustus Frederick Oldfield near Wilson Inlet, the location given, in Latin, is &quot;In Australiae regionibus depressioribus quam Maxime austro occidentalibus, ubi Blue Gum-tree vocatur&quot;.

The holotype is held at Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, syntypes are held at Cambridge University Herbarium, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

The botanical name &quot;diversicolor&quot; is taken from the Latin word &quot;diversus&quot; meaning to turn apart and color or &quot;separate colours&quot; and refers to the difference between the top of the leaf and its underside.
The common name is derived from the Noongar name for the tree &quot;karri&quot; pronounces &quot;ka-ree&quot;.

Karri is a part of the &quot;Symphyomyrtus&quot; subgenus, all of which have two opercula on the buds and have four rows of ovules. It is not closely related to any other members of the subgenus and is the sole species in the section &quot;Inclusae&quot;. The defining feature of this section is having inflexed stamens, flattened ovoid seed shape, enclosed valves of the fruit and the lack of pith glands in the branchlets. Although it has no closely related species it has some affinity with tall Eucalypts found the wet forests of eastern Australian including &quot;E.saligna&quot; and &quot;E.grandis&quot; all of which have discolorous adult leaves and seeds with a flattened-ovoid shape.

==Distribution and habitat==

The climate over the range of the tree is mildly temperate with small variations in humidity and temperature with frosts only occurring on rare occasions.
Karri occurs only within the High Rainfall Zone of the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia which receives of rain per year, mostly in winter. It mostly occurs within the Warren biogeographic region, but there are some outlying populations including the Porongorup Ranges, Mount Manypeaks, Torbay, Rocky Gully all along the south coast and Karridale and Forest Grove to the north west and the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge to the south of Margaret River to the west of the main belt.

The heart of the karri forest is found near Nannup and Manjimup through to Denmark.

The total area covered by karri forest is less than which is about one fifth of its virgin growth. The nearest tall tree forests are some to the east in Tasmania and Victoria.

Karri has been introduced to parts of Africa including; Kenya, Tanzania and the Canary Islands.

The species is considered invasive in South Africa where it is a problem in the Western Cape region and is locally known a &quot;karie&quot;. It commonly invades clearings, fynbos, water courses and road sides often out competing local species and is spread easily by seed dispersal.

== Ecology ==
Karri is regarded as one of the six forest giants found in Western Australia; the other trees include; &quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot; (Marri), &quot;Eucalyptus gomphocephala&quot; (Tuart), &quot;Eucalyptus jacksonii&quot; (Red Tingle), &quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot; (Jarrah) and &quot;Eucalyptus patens&quot; (Yarri).

Some karri specimens are thought to reach an age of up to 300 years. The soil in which the species grows is often poor, and the tree tends to flower after fire to take advantage of the nutrients released by the combustion of forest litter. The soil is classified as karri loam. Though low in some minor nutrients it is admired for its depth and pasture-growing properties. The depth of the soil is several metres and thought to be created primarily from the bark shed by the tree, which collects at the trunk base to a depth upwards of six metres in mature trees. The karri supports an extensive ecosystem which is connected to the granite outcrops of the lower south-west and the many subsequent creeks and rivers created from runoff. Karri generally dominate in the deep valleys between granite outcrops surrounding the creeks and rivers.

A dense understorey is found in karri forest areas which retains moisture over the hot summers. Associated trees and shrubs found in the understorey include the peppermint (&quot;Agonis flexuosa&quot;), karri sheoak (&quot;Allocasuarina decussata&quot;), karri wattle (&quot;Acacia pentadenia&quot;) and karri oak (&quot;Chorilaena quercifolia&quot;). A diverse assemblage of flowers and smaller plants – around 2,000 plant taxa – make up the mosaic of habitats within the karri forests.

The tree has a complex floral cycle and it takes four to five years from the production of flowers to the seeds being released. The production of seed is dependent on a multitude of variables including tree density, availability of pollinators, soil moisture, genetics, nutrients and fire.

===Pollinators===
Most Eucalypts achieve pollination through insects and birds rather than wind. Insects are far less active through the colder winter months so bird pollination is thought to be more important. The trees are often visited by nectar feeding birds, particularly Purple-crowned lorikeets. The lorikeets have a wide range and are quite active during winter and are thought to be dominant pollinators and able to cross pollinate over larger distances.
Karri is a source of pollen for honeybees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;). The pollen has a protein content of 23.4% and provides sufficient amino acids for the nutrition of &quot;A.mellifera&quot;. The content of some of the amino acids are; 3.84% proline, 2.07% glutamic acid, 1.72% lysine, 1.22% cystine, 1.91% aspartic acid, 1.50% leucine, 1.11% alanine and 1.11% valine.

==Uses==
The wood has a green density of around with an air-dried density of about . 
The heartwood of Karri is a red colour and closely resembles Jarrah heartwood. Bushmen used to tell the two timbers apart by burning a splint of wood, Karri would leave a white ash and Jarrah would leave a grey to black coloured ash. Timber from Karri is suitable for construction work. It is a little more dense than Jarrah but is much stronger. Karri wood is not as termite resistant as that of Jarrah.
The tree has been logged since the settlement of Western Australia with logging towns appearing throughout the range of the tree and producing hardwood timbers, mostly for construction purposes, for the first 150 years since settlement. The first Karri timber to be felled for export was at the isolated population around Leeuwin, which became known as Karridale. The virtues of the wood were promoted in the 1920s by the state conservator of forests, Charles Lane-Poole, who noted the colonists&#x27; preference for other timber as its vulnerability to white ants made it a poor choice for fence posts and railway sleepers. The timber found uses in the state for wagon spokes and wooden pipes, and in England it was found suitable for scantlings by the national railway and telegraph arms by the postal services and was listed among Lloyds shipbuilding timbers as possessing great strength over large lengths.

Fire lookouts were established in the forests using the tallest Karri trees, giving the foresters a commanding view of the landscape.
The idea of using karri trees in this way was first suggested in 1937 by a young forester, Don Stewart, who later became Conservator of Forests. The first of these was built on a large marri (&quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot;) at Alco, near Nannup. Eight lookouts were established in the forests between 1937 and 1952. Spotter planes are now used and some of the trees are now used as tourist attractions.

Karri wood is a beautiful mahogany colour, lighter in colour than jarrah. It is used extensively in the building industry, particularly in roofs for the length and knot-free quality of the boards. The wood is also used for flooring, furniture, cabinetry and plywood. The heartwood is golden to reddish brown, often with an orange or purple cast, and tends to darken with age. It has an interlocked grain with a uniform medium-coarse texture. It has the reputation of being termite-prone, although it is nowhere near as susceptible to these insects as pine. It is durable against rot. It is also an excellent furniture wood.

Some of the main streets of early Sydney were paved with blocks of Karri but have been long since covered by asphalt. The wood was also sent to London for the same purpose.

Karri honey is widely sought after for its clarity, light color and delicate flavor. In 1952 it was estimated that 25% of honey produced in Western Australia was produced in Karri forests. Tourism to this area is also supported by the Karri. Main honey flows occur every four to five years with even larger flows every fifteen years or so.

The species is commercially available and sold in seed form. It germinates readily and prefers a protected sunny position, but is known to be both drought- and frost-sensitive. Although too large for most suburban gardens they are suitable in plantations. Seeds will germinate in three to four weeks and have germination rates of 84%.

<text>is a Japanese actor and narrator who is currently affiliated with Max Mix. He is married to actress Natsuki Hayashi.

== Biography ==

As a child, Yao was very active, building secret bases with his friends and playing outside, and did not watch TV much. In addition, because his father was a government official, he had to be transferred every three years, so he moved from place to place. When he was in the second year of junior high school, he was transferred to Tokyo, and the government office building that he moved into was too small for a TV, so his family decided not to have a TV. At that time, his sister, who was four years older than him, and his mother were fond of musicals and plays, and Yao accompanied them to see them. At the time, it was popular for kabuki actors to perform William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and he saw a Shakespeare play starring Kawarasaki Gonjūrō, and when he saw the stage greeting at the final performance of the play, it solidified his desire to become a stage actor. As soon as he graduated from high school and went to college, one of the women in his class was the younger sister of Shōichirō Akaboshi, so he started going to the rehearsal room of Matenrō Theater Company run by Takuya Hiramitsu with her help, and after being involved in a couple of productions as a staff member, he joined the stage as an actor. One of his seniors in the same theater company was Hozumi Gōda.

Matenrō Theater Company was one of the more popular small theater companies, but it did not generate enough income to keep them afloat. For a while, Yao worked part-time while doing theater activities, but when he realized that he could not go on like this, he consulted with the staff and was introduced to a production company, which led him to get work in TV dramas and movies. Among them, he had an audition for an anime and made his voice acting debut as Shurugi Nam in the OVA &quot;BIRTH&quot;. Naturally, he had no experience in dubbing, and although he was the lead actor, he did not understand the technical terms included in the director&#x27;s instructions, but he was helped by his co-stars Keiko Toda and Jōji Yanami, and he still looks up to them as his teachers.

In 1985, Yao played the role of Shinobu Fujiwara in the TV anime series &quot;Dancouga – Super Beast Machine God&quot;. This is the series that Yao considers most memorable, and he says it was the show that made him understand what it meant to play an anime character. In addition, Shinobu&#x27;s line, is a byword for Yao, and is often quoted in other works. In the arcade game &quot;Kaiser Knuckle&quot;, in addition to &quot;I&#x27;ll do it!&quot;, he also shouts, &quot;Dancouga!&quot; in some scenes. He also sang a song called &quot;YATTE YARUZE!&quot;, which is included in his 1986 album &quot;YAO&quot;.

After working for Haikyō, M-Company, and Sigma Seven (May 20, 2004 – May 2009), he became a member of Max Mix on June 1, 2009.

On December 8, 2024, the staff of the &quot;One Piece&quot; anime television series announced that Yao would be stepping down from his role as Franky, the staff stated in an announcement that this was part of a long discussion process. A &quot;graduation ceremony&quot; for Yao was held on December 22 of that year during Jump Festa, where the show announced his replacement as Subaru Kimura.

<doc id="868581" wikidata="Q61541" url="?curid=868581" title="Hans Stuck">
<text>Hans Erich Karl Josef Stuck (pronounced &quot;shtook&quot;; sometimes called Hans Stuck von Villiez; 27 December 1900 – 9 February 1978) was a German motor racing driver. Both his son Hans-Joachim Stuck (born 1951) and his grandsons Johannes and Ferdinand Stuck became race drivers.

Despite many successes in Grand Prix motor racing for Auto Union in the early 1930s, during the era of the famous &quot;Silver Arrows&quot;, he is now mostly known for his domination of hillclimbing, which earned him the nickname &quot;Bergkönig&quot; or &quot;King of the Mountains&quot;.

==Pre-WWII career==
Stuck&#x27;s experience with car racing started in 1922 with early morning runs bringing milk from his farm to Munich, shortly after his first marriage. This eventually led to his taking up hill-climbing; he won his first race, at Baden-Baden, in 1923. A few years later, after a year as a privateer for Austro-Daimler, he became a works driver for them in 1927, doing well in hill climbs, and making his first appearance in a circuit race (the German Grand Prix) that year as well. In 1931, Austro-Daimler left racing, and Stuck eventually wound up driving a Mercedes-Benz SSKL in sports car racing, where he continued to excel.

In 1933, his acquaintance with Adolf Hitler (whom he had met by chance on a hunting trip in 1925) led to his involvement with Ferdinand Porsche and Auto Union in Hitler&#x27;s plans for German auto racing. With his experience from racing up mountain passes in the Alps in the 1920s, he was virtually unbeatable when he got the new Auto Union car, which was designed by Porsche. Its rear mounted engine provided superior traction compared to conventional front engine designs, so that its (eventually) 500+ horse-power could be transformed into speed even on non-paved roads. In circuit racing, the new car was very hard to master, though, due to the swing axle rear suspension design in combination of the weight distribution of its rear engine design.

His career with Auto Union was quite successful. In 1934, he won the German, Swiss and Czechoslovakian Grand Prix races (as well as finishing second in the Italian Grand Prix and Eifelrennen). There was no European Championship for the circuit races that year, or he would have won it. Wins in a number of hill-climb races brought him European Mountain Champion, the first of three he would eventually collect.

In 1935, he won the Italian Grand Prix (along with second at the German Grand Prix; he also won his usual collection of hill-climb wins, again taking the European Mountain Championship. 1936 was leaner; he placed second in the Tripoli and German Grands Prix, finishing second in the competition for the European Championship. After Stuck missed a number of hill-climbs because of injuries suffered in accidents, that year the European Mountain Championship fell to his famous team-mate, Bernd Rosemeyer. 1937 was equally lean, bringing only second places in the 1937 Rio de Janeiro Grand Prix and 1937 Belgian Grand Prix.

1938 opened poorly; Stuck was either fired from, or quit, the Auto Union team (accounts from the two sides differ). After a series of injuries to other team drivers, as well as pressure from the German government (again, accounts differ as to what combination of factors was the cause), he was re-hired, and proved himself by winning a third European Mountain Championship, his last major pre-war success.

==Post-WWII career==
After the war, although Germans were banned from racing until 1950, Stuck obtained Austrian citizenship and immediately continued racing. A link with Alex von Falkenhausen (not to be confused with the contemporaneous general of the same name) led to Stuck driving for his team in Formula Two racing, although with little success.

He drove a Porsche Spyder in 1953, also with no success. A liaison with BMW, starting in 1957, was more fruitful, although his first hill-climbs for them (in a Type 507) were not. A switch to their tiny BMW 700 RS did the trick, and at age 60, he became German Hillclimb Champion for the last time. He decided to retire on a high note, and thereupon closed his professional driving career.

As an instructor on the Nürburgring, he taught his son Hans-Joachim the secrets of this challenging circuit.

==Personal life==
Stuck was born in Warsaw in 1900. Although his parents were of Swiss ancestry, they had moved to Germany by the time Stuck was born, and he grew up there.

He was called up for military service in World War I in 1917. In 1918, his older brother Walter was killed, along with Walter&#x27;s commanding officer; as a result, Stuck met the commander&#x27;s sister, Ellen Hahndorff, and they were married in 1922. After several years, Stuck&#x27;s involvement in the fast life on the track as well as off it caused them to split up and divorce.

In 1931, he met Paula von Reznicek, a famous tennis player; they were married in 1932. The fact that she had a Jewish grandfather caused Stuck some problems with the rise of the Nazis, but his personal relationship with Hitler saved him from serious trouble.

In 1939, he met Christa Thielmann, at that point engaged to Paula&#x27;s youngest brother. Stuck and Paula divorced in 1948, and he married Christa that year. Their son, Hans-Joachim Stuck, was born in 1951. Christa died in 2014, at the age of 93.

<text>The French Revolutionary Wars continued from 1796, with France fighting the First Coalition.

On 14 February, British admiral Jervis met and defeated a Spanish fleet off Portugal at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. This prevented the Spanish fleet from rendezvousing with the French, removing a threat of invasion to Britain. However, the British fleet was weakened over the rest of the year by the Spithead and Nore mutinies, which kept many ships in port through the summer.

On 22 February, a French invasion force consisting of 1,400 troops from the &quot;Légion Noire&quot; (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel William Tate landed near Fishguard (Wales). They were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British reservists, militia, and sailors under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor. After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor&#x27;s forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an unconditional surrender by 24 February.

In Italy, Napoleon&#x27;s armies were laying siege to Mantua at the beginning of the year, and a second attempt by Austrians under Joseph Alvinczy to raise the siege was driven off at the Battle of Rivoli. Finally, on 2 February, Wurmser surrendered Mantua and 18,000 troops. The Papal forces sued for peace, which was granted at Tolentino on 19 February. Napoleon was now free to attack the Austrian heartland. He advanced directly toward Austria over the Julian Alps, sending Barthélemy Joubert to invade the Tyrol.

Archduke Charles of Austria hurried from the German front to defend Austria, but he was defeated at the Battle of Tagliamento on 16 March, and Napoleon proceeded into Austria, occupying Klagenfurt and preparing for a rendezvous with Joubert in front of Vienna. In Germany, the armies of Hoche and Moreau crossed the Rhine again in April after the previous year&#x27;s failure. The victories of Napoleon had frightened the Austrians into making peace, and they concluded the Treaty of Leoben in April, ending hostilities. However, his absence from Italy had allowed the outbreak of the revolt known as the Veronese Easters on 17 April, which was put down eight days later.

Although Britain remained at war with France, this effectively ended the First Coalition. Austria later signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, ceding the Austrian Lombardy and the Austrian Netherlands to France and recognizing the French border at the Rhine. Austria and France also partitioned Venice between them.

<text>Oleg Danilovich Kalugin (; born 6 September 1934) is a former KGB general (stripped of his rank and awards by a Russian Court decision in 2002). He was during a time, head of KGB political operations in the United States and later a critic of the agency. After being convicted of spying for the West in absentia during a trial in Moscow, he remained in the US and was sworn in as a citizen on 4 August 2003.

==Early life and career==
Born 6 September 1934, in Leningrad and son of an officer in the NKVD, Kalugin attended Leningrad State University and was recruited by the KGB, under the aegis of the First Chief Directorate (Foreign Intelligence). After training, he was sent to the United States, where he enrolled as a journalism student at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship in 1958, along with Aleksandr Yakovlev. In 1959, his photo appeared in a Newsweek article in which, identified as a 24-year-old student, he said: &quot;I like Americans very much. But after seven months here I am convinced more than ever that the Communist system is better than yours.&quot; He continued to pose as a journalist for a number of years, eventually serving as the Radio Moscow correspondent at the United Nations. In 1965, after five years in New York City, he returned to Moscow to serve under the cover of press officer in the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

Kalugin was then assigned to Washington, DC, with the cover of deputy press officer for the Soviet embassy. In reality, he was deputy resident and acting chief of the Residency at the Soviet Embassy. Rising in the ranks, he became one of the KGB&#x27;s top officers operating out of the Soviet embassy in Washington. That led to his being promoted to general in 1974, the youngest in its history.

He then returned to KGB headquarters to become head of the foreign counterintelligence or K branch of the First Chief Directorate. Meanwhile, he received high honors for the assassination of Bulgarian writer Georgi Markov. It had been accomplished on a request from Todor Zhivkov and then an order by the KGB chief, Yuri Andropov.

===Criticism of KGB===
In 1980, Kalugin was demoted to deputy head of the Leningrad KGB as a result of an intrigue initiated by Vladimir Kryuchkov, then a close confidant of Yuri Andropov who had been privately criticized by Kalugin. Kalugin was accused of recruiting an agent 20 years prior who was actually an American spy (though the KGB probably believed incorrectly). That made Kalugin himself seem to be a security risk. He was suspected of working for the CIA, but there was no supporting evidence. Vladimir Kryuchkov, Chairman of the KGB and orchestrator of the 1991 coup plot, alleged that in his time in counterintelligence, Kalugin failed to discover a single US agent, but his successor would allegedly find over a dozen. Former CIA mole Karl Koecher made unsupported claims that for his eventual arrest, Kalugin was responsible.

The unsubstantiated accusations did not stop him from criticizing the agency&#x27;s policies and methods. He complained that the KGB overlooked corruption in the highest circles of Soviet society while it terrorized common people. His unbridled public criticism led to reassignment to Security Officers posts first in the Academy of Sciences in 1987 and then at the Ministry of Electronics in 1988. His career at the KGB ended with his forced retirement on 26 February 1990.

As the Soviet Union underwent changes under Mikhail Gorbachev, Kalugin became more vocal and public in his criticism of the KGB by denouncing Soviet security forces as Stalinist domestic political police, but he never disputed the importance of espionage abroad. Finally, in 1990, Gorbachev signed a decree stripping Kalugin of his rank, decorations, and pension. In August 1991, Gorbachev returned his rank, decorations, and pension.

===Member of the Supreme Soviet===
Despite opposition from the KGB, he was elected in September 1990 to the Supreme Soviet as a People&#x27;s Deputy for the Krasnodar region.

====Countering the Soviet coup attempt====

Kalugin became a firm supporter of Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. During the abortive Soviet coup attempt of 1991, led by KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, he led crowds to the Russian White House, the center of anticoup efforts, and induced Yeltsin to address the crowds.

After the coup, he became an unpaid adviser to the new KGB chairman, Vadim Bakatin. Ever vocal, Kalugin told the press that in the future, the KGB should have no political functions and no secret laboratories to manufacture poisons and secret weapons. While Bakatin succeeded in dismantling the old security apparatus, he did not have the time to reform it before he was fired in November 1991.

==Exile to the United States==
According to Kalugin, he has never betrayed any Soviet agents except those who were already known to Western intelligence. He called intelligence defectors like Oleg Gordievsky &quot;traitors.&quot;

One of the allegations in his 1994 book, &quot;The First Directorate: My 32 Years in Intelligence and Espionage Against the West&quot;, stated that the death of Sean Bourke, who had helped traitor George Blake to escape prison, was caused by poisoning ordered by the KGB. Another allegation was that the KGB &quot;virtually controlled the Russian Orthodox Church through the blackmail of its many gay priests&quot;, according to a review of the book. In a 2015 interview, he named the late head of the church, Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, as a KGB collaborator. A second edition of the book, published in 2009, provided some additional specifics about some of the cases that Kalugin had discussed only briefly in the first edition.

In 1995, Kalugin accepted a teaching position at The Catholic University of America and has remained in the United States ever since. Settling in Washington, D.C., he first wrote the &quot;First Directorate&quot; book about Cold War espionage and a subsequent book &quot;Spymaster&quot; in 2008. He also collaborated with former CIA Director William Colby and Activision to produce &quot;&quot;, a CD-ROM game released in 1996. He has appeared frequently in the media and given lectures at a number of universities.

In June 2001, Kalugin testified at the espionage trial of George Trofimoff, a retired Colonel of the United States Army Reserve who was charged with spying for the KGB in the 1970s and the 1980s. Upon being asked whether he knew the name of the U.S. military intelligence mole codenamed &quot;Markiz,&quot; Kalugin responded &quot;Yes. I did. His name was George Trofimoff.&quot; Kalugin testified that Metropolitan Bishop Iriney (Susemihl), the Russian Orthodox hierarch of Austria, had recruited Trofimoff into the service of the KGB. Kalugin further described having invited the Metropolitan to visit his dacha in 1978. According to Kalugin, &quot;He did good work, particularly in recruiting Markiz. I wanted to thank him for what he had done.&quot; Kalugin further described his own meeting with Trofimoff at a location in Austria. When asked his reasons for testifying, Kalugin explained that as a resident alien, he was trying to obey American law. Trofimoff was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.

On 4 August 2003, Kalugin became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

===Criticism of Vladimir Putin===
With the return to power of elements of the KGB, most notably Vladimir Putin, Kalugin was again accused of treason. In 2002, he was put on trial &quot;in absentia&quot; in Moscow and found guilty of spying for the West. He was sentenced to fifteen years in jail, in a verdict he described as &quot;Soviet justice, which is really triumphant today&quot;. The US and Russia have no extradition treaty, though it is unlikely the U.S. would extradite Kalugin for such charges anyway.

As of 2019, Kalugin was a professor for the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies (CI CENTRE). He is a member of the advisory board for the International Spy Museum. He remains a critic of Putin, a former subordinate, whom he called a &quot;war criminal&quot; over his conduct of the Second Chechen War, and claimed that he would absolutely face an international tribunal some day and would be severely penalized for his crimes against the people of the North Caucasus, just like former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević.

===Trump revelation===
In 2018 Kalugin alleged that Donald J. Trump could be a KGB-FSB asset since his 1987 visit to Moscow. The operation to lure Trump had begun with an overture in March 1986 by Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations Yuri Dubinin. In &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot;, Trump brags about how they talked about his proposal to build a hotel in Moscow across from the Kremlin, &quot;in partnership with the Soviet government.&quot; Vitaly Churkin was instrumental in setting up the deal with Intourist. Viktor Suvorov alleges that the Soviet authorities often used Intourist prostitutes as bait to develop &quot;kompromat&quot;, particularly of a sexual nature. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that while Trump was in Moscow in July 1987 he met Mikhail Gorbachev. Kalugin says: “I would not be surprised if the Russians have, and Trump knows about them, files on him during his trip to Russia and his involvement with meeting young ladies that were controlled [by Soviet intelligence].”

<doc id="868593" wikidata="Q6778902" url="?curid=868593" title="Mary Ann Oatman">
<text>Mary Ann Oatman (1843 – c. 1855) was the sister of Olive Oatman. She is notable for surviving a gruesome attack on her family, “the Oatman Massacre” by south-western Native Americans who, according to historian Brian McGinty, were likely Tolkepaya, of the Yavapai, in what is now Arizona. Mary Ann and her sister Olive were both abducted. Following their abduction, the sisters were traded to the Mojave tribe. The date of her death is uncertain. According to Olive Oatman, Mary Ann died of starvation as a result of a severe drought.  

== Early life and the journey from La Harpe to Bashan ==
Mary Ann Oatman was the fourth of seven children born to Roys and Mary Ann Oatman, for whom she was named. She was born in 1843 in La Harpe, Illinois. The Oatmans were early converts to the Latter Day Saints Movement, more commonly referred to as Mormonism, founded by Joseph Smith in the 1820s. After Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, Brigham Young became the new leader of the movement. As the result of the succession crisis over this change in leadership, several new sects of the Latter Day Saints Movement splintered from the main organization. The Oatmans joined one of these sects, known as the Brewsterites.

The Brewsterites were founded in 1848 by James Colin Brewster and differed from the original movement in several distinct ways. At age eleven Brewster claimed to have had visions given by an ancient Hebrew prophet named Esdras. In these visions, he was told that Joseph Smith was a liar, and that the church must be reorganized with him as the leader. Unlike Smith&#x27;s teachings, Brewster&#x27;s sect forbade the practice of polygamy. Further, Brewster also claimed his visions allowed him to know “directions to the Mormons’ true ‘gathering place.’” The Saints “would build their ‘Zion’ at the confluence of the Gila and Colorado rivers, at a place Esdras referred to variously as the ‘Land of Bashan …’”

Believing that they were immigrating to a divine country, the Oatmans set off from Illinois to Arizona on August 9th, 1850. The trip began with James Brewster and fifty Brewsterites. After some tensions on the trail, the group split. Brewster and 32 members headed over the Sangre de Cristos toward Santa Fe. The other 18 members of the Oatman, Thompson, Wilder, Meteer, and Kelly families headed toward the Rio Grande Valley. .

== The Oatman Massacre ==
By 1851, the Oatmans’ circumstances had become dire. As the family continued to make their way towards Bashan they faced multiple run-ins with local Native nations, dwindling supplies, and were now alone because they had decided to separate from the group who had joined them in leaving Brewster. 

On March 18, 1851, a group of “Apache” approached the family near Maricopa wells. Apache is a non-specific name that Olive used to describe the Yavapai. After a short bargaining interaction between Roys and the “Apache”, the Native American party decided they were unable to come to a proper trade agreement with Roys. They clubbed to death nearly the entire family. The only survivors of the Oatman Family Massacre were Mary Ann, her sister Olive, and her brother Lorenzo, who had been injured and left for dead. He is known to have survived after finding a nearby settlement and receiving medical treatment.

Olive only referred to the tribe that massacred their family and abducted them as “Tonto Apaches” in all her interviews and in the book she compiled with Methodist minister Royal B. Stratton entitled &quot;Captivity of the Oatman Girls: Being an Interesting Narrative of Life among the Apache and Mohave Indians.&quot; Historian Timothy Braatz argues that referring to them as Apaches was most likely a “catch all term for any mountain dwellers at odds with the Pima, and Maricopa …” Braatz, and Brian McGinty further argue that the attackers were most likely members of the Yavapai tribe, not the Apache. 

McGinty suggests the attackers were of the Tolkepaya, a band of the Yavapai tribe. McGinty argues that this band of the Yavapai most accurately fit the description of the attackers given the location of the attack, Olive&#x27;s description of their village, testimony by Dr. LeConte, an individual the family passed on the trail, and interviews from members of the Mojave tribe taken by anthropologist A.L Kroeber in the early 20th century. According to English professor Margot Mifflin, “The Oatman massacre was evidently inspired by the Yavapai&#x27;s’ typical late winter hardship, exacerbated by the previous year&#x27;s bone-cracking drought.” Another possible reason for the attack was that because of the harsh climate Southwestern natives faced many tribes practiced kidnapping as a form of family replacement. 

== The abduction and the “adoption” by the Mojave ==
In &quot;The Captivity of the Oatman girls&quot;, Olive described their life among the “Apache” (Yavapai) as harsh. As with most of Olive&#x27;s testimony, it is influenced by the brutal realities of life with Indians of her time, making it impossible to know if the girls did become integrated into their captors&#x27; society. The girls&#x27; uncertain treatment is also highlighted in Olive&#x27;s own description of being traded to the Mojave tribe. Olive claims that she and Mary Ann refused to state which tribe they preferred to reside with, and that the children in the village wept when the girls departed to live with the Mojave. Olive claims that the trade occurred in 1851, and that she and her sister were traded by the “Apache” (Yavapai) to the Mojave tribe for a couple of horses and bags of beans. Once the sisters arrived in the Mojave village they were taken in by Espaniola, his wife Aespaneo, and their daughter Topeka, who belonged to the Owich clan. Although Olive later identified Espaniola as the chief, he was most likely the Kohot, a “religious leader.”

During their time with the Mojave, according to Olive, the girls were given a plot of their own land and seeds to plant. Mojaves who were later interviewed about the girls shared that the sisters were also paid to sing hymns. Both girls also received facial tattoos codifying their place in the Mojave afterlife. 

In Olive Oatman&#x27;s narrative of her and Mary Ann&#x27;s experiences, co-written with Methodist minister Royal Stratton, she highlights her unhappiness as well as a deep desire to escape. Historian Brian McGinty suggests that Olive&#x27;s complaints and negative reflections need to be read within the context of the tales of horror inflicted on other settlers common to similar literature of the time. Her desire to escape proved difficult given that the sisters apparently were unable to reach safety or contact others even when seen from a distance. According to military commander Amiel Weeks Whipple, he and a group of his men had been in the area in February and March 1854 to survey a railroad route, and the sisters had not communicated with them.

It is unknown exactly how long Mary Ann resided with the Mojave before her tragic death, but historian Brian McGinty argues that she died after three to four years from starvation during a famine. Olive gave many different dates for the death of her sister, but McGinty claims that the first interview Olive gave of her experiences is the most trustworthy. In the first interview, in 1856, she states that her sister died one year ago, making her death date 1855. Olive states later in her book that she died in 1854, and in still later interviews 1853.

== Death and legacy ==
Historian Stephanie Wampler writes, “When Mary Ann was sick, the chief&#x27;s wife made sure that Olive was allowed to sit with her sister. Then, after Mary Ann died, the chief&#x27;s wife made sure that Olive was allowed to bury her sister according to her own customs and was given time to mourn for her afterward.” 

Olive states the girls were given as much food as possible by Topeka, but that Mary Ann and many other Mojave could simply not survive on such little portions.

<text>A pallet (also called a skid) is a flat transport structure, which supports goods in a stable fashion while being lifted by a forklift, a pallet jack, a front loader, a jacking device, or an erect crane. Many pallets can handle a load of . While most pallets are wooden, pallets can also be made of plastic, metal, paper, and recycled materials.

A pallet is the structural foundation of a unit load, which allows handling and storage efficiencies. Goods in shipping containers are often placed on a pallet secured with strapping, stretch wrap or shrink wrap and shipped. In addition, pallet collars can be used to support and protect items shipped and stored on pallets.

Containerization for transport has spurred the use of pallets because shipping containers have the smooth, level surfaces needed for easy pallet movement. Since its invention in the twentieth century, its use has dramatically supplanted older forms of crating like the wooden box and the wooden barrel, as it works well with modern packaging like corrugated boxes and intermodal containers commonly used for bulk shipping. In 2020 about half a billion pallets are made each year and about two billion pallets are in use across the United States alone. Organizations using standard pallets for loading and unloading can have much lower costs for handling and storage, with faster material movement than businesses that do not. The exceptions are establishments that move small items such as jewelry or large items such as cars. But even they can be improved. For instance, the distributors of costume jewelry normally use pallets in their warehouses and car manufacturers use pallets to move components and spare parts. Pallets make it easier to move heavy stacks. Loads with pallets under them can be hauled by forklift trucks of different sizes, or even by hand-pumped and hand-drawn pallet jacks. Movement is easy on a wide, strong, flat floor: concrete is excellent. The greatest investment needed for economical pallet use is in the construction of commercial or industrial buildings. Ability to pass through standard doors and buildings make handling more convenient. For this reason, some modern pallet standards are designed to pass through standard doorways, for example the europallet (800 mm × 1,200 mm) and the U.S. military .

The lack of a single international standard for pallets causes substantial continuing expense in international trade. A single standard is difficult because of the wide variety of needs a standard pallet would have to satisfy: passing doorways, fitting in standard containers, and bringing low labor costs. For example, organizations already handling large pallets often see no reason to pay the higher handling cost of using smaller pallets that can fit through doors. Heavy-duty pallets are a form of reusable packaging and are designed to be used multiple times. Lightweight pallets are designed for a single use. In the EU, government legislation based on the Waste Framework Directive requires the reuse of packaging items in preference to recycling and disposal.

==History==

Skids date back to Ancient Egypt and Ancient Mesopotamia, at least as far back as the 1st millennium B.C.

The development of the forklift and the needs of World War II logistics operations led to substantial use of pallets.

References to the early modern pallets types are slim with a string of patents showing parts of the development. The earliest may be a U.S. patent on a skid from 1924 describing Howard T. Hallowell&#x27;s &quot;Lift Truck Platform&quot;. In the late 1930s, pallets became more commonplace with the newer forklift types. George G. Raymond and William C. House filed for a patent in 1937 (granted US Patent 2178646 in 1939) for a pallet designed to complement a new pallet jack design; the essential features of both are still in common use today. A 1939 patent from Carl Clark shows a type of pallet with steel stringers. Wartime developments were often patented just after the war, so there is a patent from Robert Braun on a four-way pallet in 1945, and a patent from Norman Cahners (a U.S. Navy supply officer) shows a disposable pallet in 1949. The principle of a modern four-way pallet is described by Darling Graeme in 1949.

== Materials ==
=== Wood ===
The production of pallets accounts for 43% of hardwood and 15% of softwood usage in the U.S.

The cheapest pallets are made of softwood and are often considered expendable, to be discarded as trash along with other wrapping elements, at the end of the trip. These pallets are simple stringer pallets, and able to be lifted from two sides.

Slightly more complex, hardwood block pallets, plastic pallets and metal pallets can be lifted from all four sides. These costlier pallets usually require a deposit and are returned to the sender or resold as used. Many &quot;four way&quot; pallets are color-coded according to the loads they can bear, and other attributes. Wood pallets can pose serious bio-hazard risks as they are susceptible to bacterial and chemical contamination, such as &quot;E. coli&quot; problems in food and produce transportation, and even insect infestation, and thus the need for ISPM 15.

Wooden pallet construction specifications can depend on the pallet&#x27;s intended use: general, FDA, storage, chemical, export; the expected load weight; type of wood desired: recycled, hard, soft, kiln dried or combo (new and recycled); and even the type of fasteners desired to hold the pallet together: staples or nails.

The price of wooden pallets reached a record high during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to increases in the prices of supplies and labor.

Although pallets come in all sizes and configurations, all pallets fall into two very broad categories: &quot;stringer&quot; and &quot;block&quot; pallets. Various software packages exist to assist the pallet maker in designing an appropriate pallet for a specific load and evaluating wood options to reduce costs. 

Stringer pallets are one of the original models of wooden pallets. They use a frame of three or more parallel pieces of timber (called stringers). The top deckboards are then affixed to the stringers to create the pallet structure. Stringer pallets can have a notch cut into them allowing &quot;four-way&quot; entry. Forklifts can lift a stringer pallet from all four directions, though lifting by the stringers is more secure. Stringer pallets can be made of both wood and plastic.

Block pallets utilize both parallel and perpendicular stringers to better facilitate efficient handling. A block pallet is also known as a &quot;four-way&quot; pallet, since a pallet-jack may be used from any side to move it.

Carrier blocks are specialized pallets for lumber carriers

Flush pallets are pallets with deck boards that are flush with the stringers and stringer boards along the ends and sides of the pallet.

All stringer and some block pallets have &quot;unidirectional bases&quot;, i.e. bottom boards oriented in one direction. While automated handling equipment can be designed for this, often it can operate faster and more effectively if the bottom edges of a pallet have bottom boards oriented in both directions. For example, it may not need to turn a pallet to rack it, and operation is less sensitive to pallet orientation.

The least expensive way to improve a pallet is usually to specify better nails. With non-wood pallets, a controlled coefficient of friction is often helpful to prevent the pallet from slipping from forks and racks. Stiffer pallets are more durable, and are handled more easily by automated equipment. If a pallet does not need to be lifted from all four sides, two-way pallets with unnotched stringers may be used, with the additional benefits of added rigidity and strength. Specifying tolerances on flatness and water content may help the supplier meet target requirements. Inspection of pallets, whether in person or by a third-party (such as &quot;SPEQ&quot; inspected pallets) offer additional assurance of quality.

The main processes that are used to manufacture wooden pallets:

* Material selection
* Cutting wood plate / block
* Chamfering (depends on the demand)
* Notching
* Nailing wooden pallet


Due to the International Plant Protection Convention (abbreviated IPPC), most pallets shipped across national borders must be made of materials that are incapable of being a carrier of invasive species of insects and plant diseases. The standards for these pallets are specified in ISPM 15.

Pallets made of raw, untreated wood are not compliant with ISPM 15. To be compliant the pallets (or other wood packaging material) must meet debarked standards, and must be treated by either of the following means under the supervision of an approved agency:

* Heat treatment: The wood must be heated to achieve a minimum core temperature of for at least 30 minutes. Pallets treated using this method bear the initials HT near the IPPC logo.
* Chemical fumigation: The wood must be fumigated with methyl bromide. Pallets treated using this method bear the initials MB near the IPPC logo. From 19 March 2010 the use of methyl bromide as a treatment according to ISPM15 has been banned within all EU member states. This is due to causing potential harm to the Earth&#x27;s stratospheric ozone layer.

Treated wood pallets must be stamped on two opposite sides, indicating either HT for heat treated or MB for methyl bromide treatment.

Pallets made of non-wood materials such as steel, aluminum, plastic, or engineered wood products, such as plywood, oriented strand board, or corrugated fiberboard do not need IPPC approval, and are considered to be exempt from ISPM 15 regulations.

=== Plastic ===

Plastic pallets are often made of new HDPE or recycled PET (drink bottles). They are usually extremely durable, lasting for a hundred trips or more, and resist weathering, rot, chemicals and corrosion. The benefits of plastic pallets over wood pallets include the ability to be easily sanitized, resistance to odor, fire retardancy, longer service life span, durability and better product protection, non-splintering, and lighter weight, thus saving on transportation and labor costs and making them safer and more environmentally friendly. They often stack. Plastic pallets are exempt by inspection for biosafety concerns, and easily sanitize for international shipping. HDPE is impervious to most acids, and toxic chemicals clean from them more easily. Some plastic pallets can collapse from plastic creep if used to store heavy loads for long periods. Plastic pallets cannot easily be repaired, and can be ten times as expensive as hardwood, so they are often used by logistics service providers who can profit from their durability and stackability. The large supply chains have increased the use of plastic pallets as many organisations seek to reduce costs through waste, transport, and health and safety. Pallets and dollies can be combined (for example the Pally), eliminating pallet instability and the need for additional lifting equipment along with creating valuable space in busy operating environments. They also deliver significant time and cost savings by reducing supply chain handling. Plastics&#x27; reusability has contributed to an increase in usage of plastic pallets.

Plastic pallets are produced and used widely in the U.S. and Europe, spurred by the adoption of the ISPM 15. A full comparison of wood vs plastic can be made by a life cycle analysis. Plastic pallets can cost 10 times as much as hardwood pallets and even more expensive compared to cheap expendable softwood pallets. RFID chips can be molded into the pallets to monitor locations and track inventory.

There are six main types of plastic processes that are used to manufacture pallets:

* High pressure injection molding
* Structural foam molding
* Thermoforming
* Compression molding
* Rotational molding
* Profile extrusion

=== Paper ===

Paper pallets, also referred to as &quot;ecopallets&quot;, are often used for light loads, but engineered paper pallets are increasingly used for loads that compare with wood. Paper pallets are also used where recycling and easy disposal is important. New designs of ecopallets have been made from just two flat pieces of corrugated board (no glue/staples) and weigh just , offering dramatic freight savings. Ecopallets are also ISPM 15 exempt, negating fumigation and barrier &quot;slip&quot; sheets. They are cleaner, safer, and provide a cost-saving eco-friendly alternative to other pallet materials. Some engineered corrugated pallets offer a significantly reduced height, providing substantial freight cost reduction. Low-profile hand pallet trucks allow picking up pallets as low as 25 mm.

=== Steel ===

Steel pallets are strong and are used for heavy loads, high-stacking loads, long term dry storage, and loads moved by abusive logistic systems. They are often used for military ammunition. Metal pallets make up less than 1% of the market. Materials include carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Of these, carbon steel offers excellent durability at the lowest cost. Stainless steel does not require a paint coating, and is preferred for such applications as clean room environments. Carbon steel units are expensive compared to wood, and stainless and aluminum cost about 2–3 times that of carbon steel. Long term costs, however, can be lower than wood. General advantages of metal pallets are high strength and stiffness, excellent durability, resistance to vermin, the absence of splinters, sanitization, and recyclability. Disadvantages include a higher initial price, significant weight, low friction, and susceptibility to rusting (in the case of carbon steel). Metal is primarily used in captive or closed loop environments where durability and product protection are key performance requirements. Metal units today are increasingly price competitive and lighter in weight. Primary industries that use metal pallets include automotive, pharmaceutical, lawn tractors, motorcycles, and tires.

Aluminum pallets are stronger than wood or plastic, lighter than steel, and resist weather, rotting, plastic creep and corrosion. They are sometimes used for air-freight, long-term outdoor or at-sea storage, or military transport.

== Dimensions ==

Wooden pallets typically consist of three or four stringers that support several deckboards, on top of which goods are placed. In a pallet measurement, the first number is the stringer length and the second is the deckboard length. Square or nearly square pallets help a load resist tipping.

Pallet users want pallets to pass easily through buildings, to stack and fit in racks, to be accessible to forklifts and pallet jacks and to function in automated warehouses. To avoid shipping air, pallets should also pack tightly inside intermodal containers and vans.

Though some major standards exist, there are no universally accepted standards for pallet dimensions. Companies and organizations utilize hundreds of different pallet sizes around the globe. While no single dimensional standard governs pallet production, a few different sizes are widely used.

The standard 48×40 North American pallet, or GMA pallet, has stringers of 48 inches and deckboards of 40 inches, and was standardized by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA). 
* A standard wooden pallet () with a static load bearing capacity of and a dynamic capacity, will weigh approximately 
* GMA pallets typically weigh , and are tall. Their deck boards measure wide and are thick each. Other dimensions of pallets have different weight capacities.

Lightweight plastic pallets can weigh as little as , while heavier models may weigh up to . Standard GMA pallets can hold up to . 

Heavy duty International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) Pallets are approximately wide by long, have three wood stringers that are a nominal high by wide timber, and weigh about . Their deck is fully covered by plywood, and is painted in blue in European and Russian countries.

Two-way pallets are designed to be lifted by the deckboards. 

Four-way pallets, or pallets for heavy loads (or general-purpose systems that might have heavy loads) are best lifted by their more rigid stringers. These pallets are usually heavier, bigger and more durable than two-way pallets.

=== ISO ===

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) sanctions six pallet dimensions, detailed in &quot;ISO Standard 6780:2003 Flat pallets for intercontinental materials handling — Principal dimensions and tolerances&quot;, which was reviewed and confirmed in 2014:
=== North America ===

Of the top pallets used in North America, the most commonly used by far is the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) pallet, which accounts for 30% of all new wood pallets produced in the United States. The ISO also recognizes the GMA pallet footprint as one of its six standard sizes.

=== Europe ===

=== Australia ===
The Australian standard pallet is a pallet size commonly found in Australia but rarely found elsewhere. It is a square pallet originally made of hardwood in size which fits perfectly in the RACE container of the Australian Railway. They are ill-suited for the standard and ISO shipping containers used around the globe. Australian standard pallets are usually manufactured in hardwood, but 1165 × 1165 mm pallets can also be manufactured using lighter timber suitable for use as disposable pallets using 16 millimeter boards. Extensively used in storage and warehousing, they are popular pallets for racking, with the right shape and size to be removed from transport and directly onto warehouse racking for storage.

The Australian standard pallet dates back to World War II, while ISO containers date to the late 1950s. Although the pallet&#x27;s dimensions pre-date the ISO containers, it requires less dunnage, is square, and leaves less wasted space than other pallets, including the GMA pallet. In 2010, Australia adopted the globally accepted ISPM 15 wood packaging material regulations (before this time it was hardwood and more expensive).

== Standards bodies ==

A number of different organizations and associations around the world work towards establishing and promulgating standards for pallets. Some strive to develop universal standards for pallet dimensions, types of material used in construction, performance standards, and testing procedures. Other organizations choose to focus on pallet standards for a specific industry (such as groceries) or type of material (such as wood).

ISO Technical Committee 51 (Pallets for unit load method of materials handling) states its scope of work entailing the &quot;standardization of pallets in general use in the form of platforms or trays on which goods may be packed to form unit loads for handling by mechanical devices&quot;. The Technical Committee works in conjunction with other Technical Committees focused on transportation infrastructure to develop interrelated standards. TC 51 is responsible for developing &quot;ISO Standard 6780: Flat pallets for intercontinental materials handling—Principal dimensions and tolerances&quot; as well as sixteen other standards related to pallet construction and testing.

The National Wood Pallet and Container Association (NWPCA) is a trade organization based in the United States representing the interests of wood pallet and container manufacturers.

The U.S. Department of Defense, Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command maintains MIL-STD-1660, the standard description of palletized unit loads for the U.S. Military and some allies. DOD Unit loads generally use pallets, are less than , weatherproof, and stack high. They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. The standard describes tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and pallet jack, impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention, and disassembly.

In addition to the other standards it publishes, the European Committee for Standardization, also known as the Comité Européen de Normalisation (CEN), produces standards for pallets. While the standards are voluntary in nature, many companies and organizations involved in transportation have adopted them. The major standard for pallets produced by CEN is &quot;ICS: 55.180.20 General purpose pallets&quot;

== Hazards ==

Both wood and plastic pallets are possible fire hazards. The National Fire Protection Association requires that both types &quot;shall be stored outside or in a detached structure&quot; unless protected by fire sprinklers.

Items made from pallet wood are likely to be durable and demonstrate good weather resistance due to these treatments. However, close contact with pallet wood or inhalation of dusts from sanding or sawing can be a source of exposure to pesticide and fungicide chemicals. It is likely that the January 2010 recall of Johnson and Johnson Tylenol and other drugs was due to their being stored on wooden pallets that had been treated with the fungicide/pesticide 2,4,6-tribromophenol. This chemical can be degraded by molds to produce 2,4,6-tribromoanisole whose strong, musty odor caused consumers to complain. There is no acute or chronic health data on 2,4,6-tribromoanisole, but it is believed that the contaminated drugs caused nausea and other health effects in some people.

== Variants ==

An air cargo pallet is a detachable and interchangeable airworthy floor panel. It can be loaded and unloaded on aircraft to transport air cargo Most are less than thick, for a cargo aircraft. Many civilian types have evolved over 6 decades from the thicker military 463L Master Pallet. When combined with a cargo net, an air cargo pallet becomes an aircraft Unit Load Device and must be inspected for integrity before use in an aircraft. It is handled on dedicated roller or ball-mat ground equipment and vehicles (fork-lifting is prohibited especially when the pallet is loaded).

Pallet boxes are pallets with four pallet walls on top and possibly a lid. Unlike pallets, pallet boxes can be stacked when they are fully loaded. They may also be fitted with a lid during stacking for stability reasons. By stacking pallet boxes on each other space can be used more efficiently, thus they are able to save warehouse space and truck load capacity. Another advantage of pallet boxes is that the goods are stored safely and are not easily damaged during logistic movements and transport. Furthermore, there are collapsible pallet boxes from which the pallet walls can be laid flat on the pallet. In this way, less space is required during empty return transport.

Bulk boxes are closely related; they are usually large separate boxes shipped on pallets.

== Alternative uses ==
Old and discarded wooden pallets can be used in pallet crafts and various furniture pieces.

Discarded wooden pallets should not be used for firewood or crafts unless it has been determined that the wood in these pallets has not been treated with wood preservatives, fungicides and/or pesticides. Various pyrethrins and propiconazole are common treatments for wooden pallets. In addition, imported palletized goods are routinely fumigated with highly toxic pesticides. During use, harmful materials or chemicals also may spill on the pallet wood and be absorbed.

Craft publications have advised readers to use pallets to build a skateboarding obstacle called a manual pad, barricades during amateur paintball games, or other sport-related items. Other publications have suggested using pallet wood for small animal cages or fences. Pallet wood has been recycled for use as furniture wood by at least one company.

The acoustic guitar maker Taylor Guitars once produced a high quality &quot;pallet guitar&quot; made from pallet wood, in order to demonstrate the importance of construction technique versus expensive exotic woods.

I-Beam Design, an architecture and interior design firm based in New York City, won an award in a 1999 competition sponsored by Architecture for Humanity for their submission of &quot;The Pallet House&quot;, a design solution to house the returning refugees of Kosovo. Full-scale prototypes of the Pallet House were featured in the Exhibit at the Milan Triennale and the Earth Awards in Prince Charles&#x27; Royal Gardens as part of The Prince&#x27;s Charities Foundation&#x27;s Conference on a Sustainable Future organized in collaboration with IBM and the Financial Times. The Pallet House is an affordable transitional home that can become permanent over time. It can be used as refugee housing or as affordable housing as well. Due to the nature of the pallet module, the wall cavity can be insulated with a variety of materials that are accessible to the user.

The two Austrian students Andreas Claus Schnetzer and Gregor Pils from the University of Vienna created a home entitled &quot;Pallet house&quot;; as the name suggests, they reused pallets to form a modular, energy efficient and affordable housing. The idea was born in 2008 during a competition and the Pallet house has been exhibited in several European cities including Venice, Vienna, Linz and Grenoble.

In 2014, Denver, Colorado was host to an Inaugural Pallet-Fest festival, which showcased the versatility of pallets and included large art structures made with upcycled materials, a pallet maze, a pallet amphitheater with live musical performances, sustainable living demonstrations, an upcycled fashion show, vendors and artists selling upcycled goods, and a parkour course. The event was crowdfunded and organized by Upcycle Events.

In Northern Ireland, wooden pallets are used to construct bonfires during celebrations of the Eleventh Night, the night before the Twelfth of July. They are built in the weeks ahead and are lit in loyalist neighbourhoods, often accompanied by street parties and marching bands. There is some contention to this practice, especially when they involve the burning of flags or effigies.

<text>Major-General Arthur Chichester, 3rd Earl of Donegall (1666 – 10 April 1706), was an English Army officer and peer. 

==Early life==
He was the eldest son of Arthur Chichester, 2nd Earl of Donegall, and Jane Itchingham (–1712). Among his siblings were Lady Jane Chichester (wife of Dacre Barrett) and Lady Mary Chichester (wife of Sir Robert Newcomen, 6th Baronet). His father served as Custos Rotulorum for County Antrim and Governor of Carrickfergus for twelve years before dying in Ireland in 1678. After his father&#x27;s death, his mother married Richard Rooth of Epsom, son of Sir Richard Rooth, with whom she had two more daughters.

His father was the eldest son of Lady Mary Jones and Lt.Col. John Chichester, who was MP for Dungannon and fought in the English Civil War. After his grandfather&#x27;s death, his grandmother married Col. Christopher Copley of Wadworth. His maternal grandparents were Sarah ( Loftus) Itchingham and John Itchingham of Dunbrody, County Wexford.

==Career==
Having succeeded his father as Earl of Donegall in 1678, he refused to attend the Irish Parliament called by James II in May 1689, but later sat in the Parliament called by William III in October 1692.

===Military career===
Having made a career in the English Army, Lord Donegall founded the 35th Regiment of Foot in Belfast in 1701, becoming its first Colonel. In 1704 he accompanied the regiment to fight in the War of the Spanish Succession in Spain, and was appointed major general of Spanish forces. He was killed in action in 1706 at Fort Montjuich near Barcelona, and was buried in that city.

==Personal life==
Sometime before 1682, he married Lady Barbara Boyle, a daughter of Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery, and Lady Margaret Howard (a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Suffolk). Lady Donegall died on 16 November 1682 without surviving issue.

After her death, he married Lady Catherine Forbes (d. 1743), daughter of Arthur Forbes, 1st Earl of Granard, and Catherine Newcomen (a daughter of Sir Robert Newcomen), on 27 July 1685. Together, they were the parents of:

* Arthur Chichester, 4th Earl of Donegall (1695–1757), who married Lady Lucy Ridgeway, daughter of Robert Ridgeway, 4th Earl of Londonderry, in 1716.
* Hon. John Chichester (1700–1746), who married Elizabeth Newdigate, daughter of Sir Richard Newdigate, 3rd Baronet, in 1726.
* Lady Anne Chichester (d. 1753), who married Lt.-Gen. James Barry, 4th Earl of Barrymore, son of Richard Barry, 2nd Earl of Barrymore, in 1716.
* Lady Katherine Chichester (d. 1749), who married Clotworthy Skeffington, 4th Viscount Massereene, son of Clotworthy Skeffington, 3rd Viscount Massereene, in 1713.
* Lady Jane Chichester, who died in a fire at her father&#x27;s house.
* Lady Frances Chichester, who also died in a fire at her father&#x27;s house.
* Lady Henrietta Chichester, who also died in a fire at her father&#x27;s house.
* Lady Mary Chichester, who died unmarried.

Lord Donegall died on 10 April 1706 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Arthur. His widow, the dowager Lady Donegall, died on 15 June 1743. After the 4th Earl died without issue in 1757, the title passed to his nephew (the 3rd Earl&#x27;s grandson), Arthur, who was created Baron Fisherwick in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1790 and Marquess of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland on 4 July 1791.

Since 2007, Stockholm City Centre has been organized into four &quot;stadsdelsområden&quot; (sometimes translated as &quot;boroughs&quot;): Kungsholmen, Södermalm, Norrmalm, and Östermalm. Before 2007, it was organized into five boroughs: Katarina-Sofia borough, Kungsholmen borough, Maria-Gamla stan borough, Norrmalm borough, and Östermalm borough.

The border between the historical provinces of Södermanland and Uppland splits Stockholm City Centre in two parts. 179,185 people live on an area of 28.05 km2 in the northern (Uppland) part, which gives a density of 6,388.06/km2. The same data for the southern (Södermanland) part is 103,646 people on 7.44 km2, giving a density of 13,930.91/km2. This border is purely historical and has no administrative significance.

<doc id="868616" wikidata="Q16269308" url="?curid=868616" title="Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars">
<text>1798 was a relatively quiet period in the French Revolutionary Wars. The major continental powers in the First coalition had made peace with France, leaving France dominant in Europe with only a slow naval war with Great Britain to worry about. The leaders of the Directory in Paris feared Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s popularity after his victories in Italy, so they were relieved when he proposed to depart France and mount an expedition to Egypt to gain further glory.

==French invasion of Egypt and Syria==
At this time, Egypt was a province of the Ottoman Empire, but Napoleon viewed invading Egypt as a way to threaten British dominance in the Mediterranean Sea and in India, as well as to gain prestige for revolutionary arms.

Napoleon raised a large army, including scientists and cultural experts, and sailed from Toulon on 19 May. Stopping to capture Malta on 12 June, he landed near Alexandria on 2 July and took the city. Napoleon&#x27;s army proceeded to march against the Mameluke armies in Cairo and met them at the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July. Facing a huge army, Napoleon organized his army into squares and used his artillery to disperse the Mameluke attacks. The Mameluke army retreated into Syria, leaving Napoleon dominant in Egypt.

===Battle of the Nile===
However, the British responded by sending Admiral Horatio Nelson to the coast of Egypt. There, he came upon the French fleet at anchor and systematically destroyed it in the Battle of the Nile. Without a fleet, Napoleon&#x27;s army was trapped in Egypt, and the majority would never return to France. Napoleon consolidated his base in Egypt for the remainder of the year. However, the local population in Cairo, encouraged by the French defeat at the Nile and annoyed by various taxes and impositions by the French, revolted in October, killing many of the French occupiers but eventually being suppressed. Damage to mosques sustained during this revolt embittered the Egyptian population against the French.

==Campaigns in Europe==
The French were also under pressure in Belgium and Luxembourg where the local people revolted against conscription and anti-religious violence (Peasants&#x27; War).
French troops deposed Pope Pius VI, establishing a republic in Rome.

===Switzerland===
On 5 March 1798, French troops overran Switzerland at the invitation of French-speaking factions in Vaud, and the Old Swiss Confederation collapsed. On 12 April 1798, 121 cantonal deputies proclaimed the Helvetic Republic, &quot;One and Indivisible&quot;. The new régime abolished cantonal sovereignty and feudal rights. The occupying forces established a centralized state based on the ideas of the French Revolution.

===Ostend Raid===
On 18 May the British launched a combined Royal Navy and British Army raid on Ostend to destroy the lock gates of the Bruge Canal and to burn the French gun-ships that were in the harbor. The objectives were achieved but the entire army contingent of 1,300 men was either killed or captured.

===Ireland===

An expeditionary force was sent to County Mayo in Ireland to assist in the rebellion against British rule in the summer of 1798. On 22 August, nearly two months after the main uprisings had been defeated, about 1,000 French soldiers under General Humbert landed in the north-west of the country, at Kilcummin in County Mayo. Joined by up to 5,000 United Irishmen rebels, they quickly routed defending British forces at the Battle of Castlebar and established up a short-lived &quot;Republic of Connacht&quot;, before final defeat at the Battle of Ballinamuck, in County Longford, on 8 September 1798.

==Second Coalition==
By the end of the year, the European powers, having recovered from their previous defeats and emboldened by Napoleon&#x27;s absence, organized a new Second Coalition. The only military activity before the end of the year was in Italy, where Naples captured Rome on 28 October but was driven out by the end of the year.

<doc id="868622" wikidata="Q7272686" url="?curid=868622" title="Quivira National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>Quivira National Wildlife Refuge in south central Kansas, United States, includes rare inland marshes. Located near the town of Stafford, it lies mostly in northeastern Stafford County, but small parts extend into southwestern Rice and northwestern Reno Counties. Its proximity to the Central Flyway migration route and the salt marshes on the refuge combine to endow the refuge with a large variety of birds. Many of these birds are uncommon in other parts of Kansas or even the central part of the continent.

On January 29, 2008, Quivira NWR and Cheyenne Bottoms Wildlife Area were jointly named as one of the 8 Wonders of Kansas. Quivira NWR is one of 29 places in the United States on the Ramsar list as a wetland of international importance.

==Name==
The name &quot;Quivira&quot; derives from a fabled Native American city of gold. In 1541 Spanish conquistador Francisco Vásquez de Coronado led an expedition onto the Great Plains of Kansas searching for wealth. He spent a month with the Quivirans, the ancestors of the Wichita tribe, but returned to New Mexico without finding any gold.

==Description==
Quivira National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1955 and in 1998 the refuge reached its present size of . The Refuge is bisected by Rattlesnake Creek from which it receives the main flow of water. It has two shallow lakes, Big Salt Marsh and Little Salt Marsh, that have attracted migratory birds and animals for centuries. of canals have been constructed to create additional marshland. The Refuge has 34 wetlands from 10 to in size totaling . The wetlands have high salt levels.

Quivira also has about of sand dunes covered with prairie grasses. The sand prairie has species from both the eastern Tallgrass prairie and the western Shortgrass prairie or steppe. About of the Refuge is wooded with trees such as cottonwood, black locust, and eastern redcedar. Another of Refuge land is farmed with winter wheat and milo. A portion of the crop is left in the fields for wildlife. Cattle are also grazed on part of the Refuge to simulate grazing by bison, which are no longer present. Bison grazing was a traditional component of the ecology of the region.

Two roads, one and the other in length, afford opportunities for wildlife viewing. A nature trail passes through woodlands, grasslands, and across a marsh on an elevated boardwalk. Birdhouse Boulevard is a wheel-chair accessible trail lined with birdhouses. A wildlife observation tower is located on the south side of Little Salt Marsh. Two photography blinds and a spotting scope aid in observing wildlife. Hunting for small game and waterfowl is permitted on of the refuge. A &quot;Kid&#x27;s Fishing Pond&quot; is located near the Visitor Center which has interpretative displays. Fishing is permitted in the marshes. Bicycles and horses are permitted on established trails and roads. Boats are prohibited.

==Wildlife==

Most of the 344 species of birds are seasonal. The Christmas bird count in 2010 counted 43,548 birds of 95 species. More than one-half of this total were snow geese many of which winter on the Refuge. Quivira also has mule and white-tail deer, raccoon, coyote, badger, skunk, two species of lizard, opossum, bobcat, red and swift foxes, six species of turtle, beaver, muskrat, porcupine, prairie dog, and wild turkey.

===Spring and Summer===
Shorebirds, pelicans, and gulls stop over at the refuge en route to their Spring nesting grounds. Plovers, avocets, stilts, ibis, and endangered least terns nest on the refuge during the spring and summer. Whooping cranes stop over on their way north to nesting areas.

=== Fall ===
800,000 geese and ducks pass through Quivira NWR en route to the Gulf Coast and Mexico. In addition, endangered whooping cranes occasionally visit the refuge en route to their wintering grounds in Texas.

===Winter===
Both bald and golden eagles spend the winter on the refuge.

===Accidentals===
These species have been seen on rare occasions on the refuge:
*Great flamingo
*Surf scoter
*Greater roadrunner
*Pileated woodpecker
*Roseate spoonbill

<text>The 2000 NHL All-Star Game was the 50th All-Star Game in the National Hockey League. It took place on February 6, 2000, at Air Canada Centre in Toronto, home to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The last time Toronto hosted prior was the 1968 NHL All-Star Game. The 1st NHL All-Star Game took place in 1947 and was also hosted by Toronto.

The All-Star week festivities saw the Canadian Hockey League Top Prospects Game played on February 2, and an exhibition game between the Canadian and American women&#x27;s national teams on February 3. The Heroes of Hockey game and the Skills Competition were held on February 5. It is to note that the opening face-off for the Heroes of Hockey game were Ted Lindsay and Fleming Mackell, two players who played in the 1st All-Star Game.

Wayne Gretzky had retired the previous year, and the NHL announced they would retire his jersey number, 99, for every team in the league, a promise fulfilled in a pre-game ceremony at the 2000 All-Star Game. A banner with his name and number in the colors of his Edmonton Oilers team, blue and orange, was raised to the rafters, after which he performed a ceremonial puck drop between Paul Kariya of Team North America and Jaromir Jagr of Team World. The NHL was inspired to honor Gretzky in this way by Major League Baseball retiring Jackie Robinson&#x27;s number 42.

Gretzky also made it clear that he would not partake in any old-timer or Heroes of Hockey game unless it was held in Edmonton, a statement that was realized with the 2003 Heritage Classic three years later.

==Super Skills Competition==
In the Skills Competition, the World All-Stars would win their third-straight skills competition. In the individual events, the Boston Bruins&#x27; Ray Bourque and Florida Panthers&#x27; Viktor Kozlov shared the Accuracy Shot event, which was Bourque&#x27;s seventh victory in the event. In addition, the St. Louis Blues&#x27; Al MacInnis won his fourth-straight Hardest Shot event, which was also his sixth all-time victory in the event, and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim&#x27;s Paul Kariya would win his second-straight Puck Control Relay event.

===Individual event winners===
* Puck Control Relay – Paul Kariya (Mighty Ducks of Anaheim)
* Fastest Skater – Sami Kapanen (Carolina Hurricanes) - 13.649 seconds
* Accuracy Shooting – Ray Bourque (Boston Bruins)/ Viktor Kozlov (Florida Panthers) - 4 hits, 5 shots
* Hardest Shot – Al MacInnis (St. Louis Blues) - 100.1 mph
* Goaltenders Competition – Mike Richter (New York Rangers) - 2 GA, 16 shots

==Uniforms==
Since 1951, the NHL had mandated that one team in each game must wear a white jersey to contrast with the other team&#x27;s dark jersey. The only exceptions to this point had been when a team opted to wear gold in lieu of white. However, for the 2000 All-Star Game, the NHL opted to experiment with a color-vs.-color format with uniforms by CCM. The North American All-Stars were clad in a navy blue uniform with white shoulders and sleeves, and the wishbone collar design previously introduced by Nike, while the World All-Stars wore red with white shoulders and sleeves, and a faux polo-style collar. The goaltenders, however, wore white jerseys with their teams&#x27; primary colors on the shoulders and sleeves. Both teams featured a white stripe across the chest (team color in the case of the goalies), with the NHL shield appearing on the player&#x27;s left side, and the uniform number placed below it. The World team also featured names below the numbers on the back instead of above the numbers, which would normally be considered a violation of the NHL&#x27;s uniform code (which requires the player&#x27;s name to be above the back number). The names and numbers were rendered in the Handel Gothic typeface.

The uniform design would be reused for the next All-Star Game, with the Toronto All-Star Game and NHL 2000 patches replaced with the Colorado All-Star patch.

Referees Kerry Fraser and Don Koharski were also clad in special sweaters for the game. A vertical orange stripe was added to the left side of their jerseys in order to help further distinguish the referees and linesmen. The jersey design was never used again.

==The game==
The Florida Panthers&#x27; Pavel Bure and his brother, the Calgary Flames&#x27; Valeri Bure, combined for six points (Pavel 3–1–4, Valeri 0–2–2) to lead the World All-Stars to their first All-Star Game victory over the North American All-Stars. Valeri would assist on two of Pavel&#x27;s three goals to become the first brother combination to set up a goal, since the 1956 All-Star Game when Maurice and Henri Richard hooked up for an All-Star goal. Pavel Bure would become the first Russian-born player to win All-Star MVP honors.

<doc id="868634" wikidata="Q454106" url="?curid=868634" title="Hans Nüsslein">
<text>Hans &quot;Hanne&quot; Nüsslein (; 31 March 1910 – 28 June 1991) was a German tennis player and coach and former World professional number 1 tennis player who won four professional Majors singles titles during his career.

== Biography ==
Nüsslein was born in Nuremberg on 31 March 1910. In his youth, he played football, handball and tennis at the 1. FC Nürnberg. After finishing school he apprenticed as a mechanic. At age 16, he gave tennis lessons to other club members for which he was paid a small amount. After a member of a neighboring club reported this to the German Tennis Federation, Nüsslein received a lifetime ban from amateur competition, preventing him from competing at Grand Slam tournaments.

Nüsslein then decided to work as a professional tennis coach. On 1 April 1928, he passed the qualifying examination and became a member of the German federation of tennis coaches. He then was hired by the Deutsche Bank in order to give lessons to their executives.

===Professional career===

;1929
Beside his coaching work, Nüsslein pursued a career on the emerging professional tennis tournaments. In 1929, he finished in third place in the concluding round robin at the German Pro tennis championships. His win was against Hermann Richter.

;1930
In January 1930, Nüsslein reached the quarter-finals of the Bristol Cup, beating Edmund Burke before losing to Robert Ramillon. At the French Pro championships at Roland Garros, Nüsslein reached the quarter-finals before losing to Roman Najuch. He placed second in the German Pro championships to Plaa and also won his first international pro tournament: Beaulieu-sur-Mer on the French Riviera.

;1931
In 1931, Nüsslein won the German Pro Championships over Roman Najuch. He played tennis against legend Bill Tilden in Europe, taking him to 5 sets in Hamburg. Tilden who had never heard of Nüsslein before the match (&quot;Who is Nusslein?&quot;) was surprised by the German&#x27;s performance and invited him to play in his United States pro tour.

;1932
In 1932 Nüsslein and Tilden played the World tour in the United States. Tilden won comfortably. Nüsslein lost in the final of the U. S. Pro in Chicago to Karel Kozeluh in straight sets in July. &quot;Long rallies, which frequently sent the score back to deuce, were the outstanding features of the match with Kozeluh, by reason of greater steadiness, scoring many points on these occasions. Both players showed a desire to hug the base line, with neither attempting to reach the net, save on rare occasions when a short drop shot would pull them to the forecourt. As a result the match was rather tedious.&quot; Nüsslein finished third out of four in the concluding round robin at the World Pro Championships in Berlin in September behind Martin Plaa and Bill Tilden.

;1933
The score in the 1933 U. S. tour between Nüsslein and Tilden was 56–22 in Tilden&#x27;s favour. In September, Nüsslein and Tilden met in the final of the World Pro Championships. In front of an audience of 7,000, &quot;Nusslein was better than he seemed ... and little by little the young man began to blunt Tilden’s shot-making. With Tilden tiring, Nusslein pushed closer into court, sometimes trapping half-volleys at the service line and moving in, often behind drop shots. The German star gradually added pace and confidence, eventually dominating play and finally winning 1-6 6-4 7-5 6-3.&quot; Touring South America in November, Nüsslein won the tournament at Buenos Aires over Kozeluh and the Facondi brothers. Ray Bowers ranked Nüsslein the World No. 1 professional for 1933 and Albert Burke also ranked Nüsslein World no. 1 pro.

;1934
Nüsslein won the Miami Pro in March beating Kozeluh in the final &quot;timing his shots to perfection and stroking with lightning-like speed&quot;. At the US Pro in August, Nüsslein beat Ellsworth Vines in the semi-finals. In the final he beat Karel Koželuh. &quot;Nusslein mixed soft slices to midcourt with stinging drives, to the corners and kept the Czech on the run throughout the match. Kozeluh&#x27;s lift shots carried about half the speed that Nusslein put on his flat drives.&quot; Nüsslein won the German Pro in September.

;1935
Nüsslein won the Miami Beach Pro in February beating Kozeluh in four sets in the final. He won the Strassbourg Pro in June over Tilden in the semis and Ramillon in the final and won the German Pro in September.

;1936
From 1936 onwards, Nüsslein spent a fair amount of his time coaching. He signed a contract with Rot-Weiss tennis club in Cologne. In the late thirties, Nüsslein coached the first Grand Slam winner Don Budge, the Australian Davis Cup team as well as several German players. Nüsslein won the Southport Pro event in July beating Cochet, Plaa and Ramillon in the concluding round robin and won the German Pro in September.

;1937
Nüsslein won the King George VI Coronation Plate at Wembley in May beating Tilden in the final, the French Pro championships in June (over Tilden and Henri Cochet), the Southport Dunlop Cup in July over Ramillon in the final and the Grand Palais Pro in August winning the concluding round robin against Tilden, Ramillon and Stoefen. He also won the Dutch Pro in Scheveningen in September beating Tilden in the final. In October he won the Wembley Pro (over Tilden) &quot;there was too little variety, neither man favouring the volley much. However, one had to marvel at the superb length kept by Nusslein&quot;. The same month he won in Rome over Henri Cochet.

;1938
Nüsslein won a round robin in Brussels in June over Tilden, Ramillon and Plaa. Another significant professional tournament of the time was the International Pro Championship of Britain in Southport, which Nüsslein won for the third time in a row in July, beating Tilden among others and won the German Pro in September. The same month, he won the French Pro in 1938 (over Tilden). In October he won another round robin in Brussels, this time over Tilden, Ramillon and Vincent Richards and beat the same players in a round robin in Copenhagen.

;1939
Nüsslein won an eight-man round robin at Olympia in London in April. He won the event at Southport for the fourth year in a row beating Vines and Tilden in successive rounds.

;1940-1957
In World War II Nüsslein served in the German army. Towards the end of the war, he suffered an arm injury which affected his tennis. At the 1953 Wembley Pro Championships, age 43, he won eight games against a 25-year-old Pancho Gonzales, losing 4–6, 4–6. In 1950, he won the international tennis coaches championships at Bad Ems. He continued to play tournaments until 1957 and gave tennis lessons until an age of 70. His most prominent tennis pupils included Wilhelm Bungert, Christian Kuhnke, Dieter Ecklebe and Wolfgang Stuck.

;Later years
Nüsslein was known for his fine groundstrokes. Tennis historian Robert Geist described his playing style: &quot;He possessed classic strokes, equal to Hall of Famers René Lacoste, Henri Cochet, and Karel Koželuh, as well as excellent volleys, magnificent drop shots and breath-taking half-volleys. As consistent as Ken Rosewall, Nüsslein was one of the best players during the 1930s.&quot;

Remaining unmarried for most of his life, at age 72, Nüsslein finally married his long-time partner Anneliese. He died nine years later at Altenkirchen after suffering a stroke.

In 2006, Nüsslein was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island.

<text>Sidney Welby Van Horn (September 8, 1920 - September 17, 2014) was an American professional tennis player and tennis coach.

As a 19-year-old player, Van Horn reached the finals of the 1939 U.S. Championships beating John Bromwich only to lose to Bobby Riggs in just 56 minutes (6–4, 6–2, 6–4). One of the high points of his career was a 6–0, 6–2, 6–1 defeat of the great Bill Tilden at a match between U.S. and British Empire service teams at Wimbledon in July 1945, supposedly the worst losses of Tilden&#x27;s career — Tilden, however, was 52 years old at the time while Van Horn was 25. Van Horn also won the United States Pro Championship in 1945. He was ranked as high as World No. 5 in the professional ranks (the &quot;Professional Players Association&quot;, instated by Bill Tilden) in 1946. Gordon Lowe ranked Van Horn as World No. 9 for 1939 in his amateur rankings.

He lived briefly in Atlanta, Ga., where he had been hired as Head Tennis Professional at the Piedmont Driving Club. In 1951, he moved to Puerto Rico as a coach at the Caribe Hilton Swim and Tennis Club, where he worked with many promising juniors, the most notable being Charlie Pasarell who was ranked No.1 in the U.S. in 1967 who he continued to coach on the main tour, another notable junior was Manuel Diaz, later to become a star on the University of Georgia tennis team and UGA coach.

His career as a coach spawned institutions such as the Welby Van Horn Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, Florida, and Welby Van Horn Tennis programs in a number of locations.

<text>Dayun Expressway () is the largest expressway structure in China&#x27;s Shanxi province.

It enters Shanxi as the Xuanda Expressway until approaching Datong (in northern Shanxi), becoming the Dayun Expressway afterwards. It ultimately ends at Rongcheng (in southern Shanxi).

The expressway passes through Datong, Shuozhou, Taiyuan, Lüliang, Jinzhong, Linfen, and Yuncheng. Thirty-one counties lie in its track.

It links with the Xuanda Expressway (heading toward Xuanhua and ultimately Beijing or Zhangjiakou), the Jiaofen Expressway (heading toward Fenyang), the Yunfeng Expressway (heading toward Yongji and Fenglingdu) and the Yunsan Expressway (heading toward Sanmenxia on the Yellow River).

The expressway passes through some interesting historical and scenic spots, such as Yanmen Pass, Mount Wutai, the old city of Pingyao, as well as many temples.

<doc id="868642" wikidata="Q7380676" url="?curid=868642" title="Rush (Big Audio Dynamite II song)">
<text>&quot;Rush&quot; is a song by English band Big Audio Dynamite II from their fifth album, &quot;The Globe&quot; (1991). A longer version of &quot;Rush&quot;, entitled &quot;Change of Atmosphere&quot;, had previously appeared on the group&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Kool-Aid&quot;.

The song samples several musical recordings, including the keyboard component of the Who&#x27;s song &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, the organ from the introduction to the Deep Purple song &quot;Child in Time&quot;, a drum break from Tommy Roe&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Pea&quot;, drums and guitars from a break in Pigmeat Markham&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes the Judge&quot;, a line from the Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s song &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; where Big Bank Hank raps &quot;a time to cry, a time to laugh&quot;, and a vocal sample from &quot;You Keep Me Swingin&#x27;&quot;, from Peter Sellers&#x27; &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Sellers&quot;. The shorter 7-inch version omits all the samples except for the &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; keyboard and the &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; drums.

&quot;Rush&quot; was a number-one hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart for four weeks in 1991, becoming the chart&#x27;s most successful hit of 1991, and it also topped the Australian and New Zealand singles charts. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Rush&quot; was originally released as the B-side to the 1991 re-release of the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;. The A-side was immensely popular due to its inclusion in a Levi Strauss &amp; Co. advert, causing it to climb to number one on the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve art for the 7-inch and CD singles displayed the Clash on the front, and BAD II on the rear. The record label displays &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; as side &quot;A&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot; as side &quot;AA&quot;, making it effectively a double A-side release.

<text>Marion Anthony Trabert (August 16, 1930 – February 3, 2021) was an American amateur world No. 1 tennis champion and long-time tennis author, TV commentator, instructor, and motivational speaker.

Trabert was ranked world No. 1 amateur by many sources in 1953, by Ned Potter and &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1954 and by Lance Tingay and Ned Potter in 1955. He was the winner of ten Grand Slam titles – five in singles and five in doubles. He won two French singles championships, two U.S. National Men&#x27;s Singles Championships, and one Wimbledon gentlemen&#x27;s singles championship. Until Michael Chang won the French Open in 1989, Trabert was the last American to hoist the championship trophy. He turned professional in the fall of 1955. He won the French Professional Championships at Roland Garros in 1956 and 1959.

==Tennis career==
===Amateur===
 Trabert was a stand-out athlete in tennis and basketball at the University of Cincinnati, and was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. In 1951, he won the NCAA Championship Singles title. He played doubles with Bob Mault and was coached by George Menefee, who later became the head trainer for the Los Angeles Rams. Trabert was also a starter on the Cincinnati Bearcats basketball team at the University of Cincinnati. Previously, at Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati, he had been Ohio scholastic champion three times and played guard on the 1948 basketball team that won the District Championship.

A native of Cincinnati, Trabert grew up two houses down from a public park. It had clay courts that helped hone his groundstrokes. By age 11, Trabert was winning junior tournaments. Trabert honed his tennis skills on the courts of the Cincinnati Tennis Club with the help of another member of that club, fellow International Tennis Hall of Famer Billy Talbert. Talbert became Trabert&#x27;s mentor. In 1951, Trabert posted his first win over Talbert in the final of Cincinnati&#x27;s international tennis tournament (now known as the Cincinnati Masters). In the midst of his amateur career, Trabert&#x27;s game was interrupted by a two-year stint in the Navy, serving on the aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea during the Korean War, but this did not stop him. In 1953, Trabert won the men&#x27;s singles in the Ojai Tennis Tournament. After winning his first Grand Slam singles title at the U. S. Championships in 1953 (over Vic Seixas in the final), Trabert was ranked the world No. 1 amateur for 1953 by Lance Tingay in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Ned Potter in &quot;World Tennis&quot;, Gardnar Mulloy, Bill Talbert, Ham Richardson, Hal Burrows and Grant Golden. In 1954 Trabert won the French Championships (over Mervyn Rose, Budge Patty in the semifinal and Arthur Larsen in the final) and was ranked world number one amateur by Ned Potter in &quot;World Tennis&quot; and by panel of 8 experts in &quot;The New York Times.&quot; In 1955, Trabert won three consecutive Grand Slam singles titles: the French (over Rose in the semifinal and Sven Davidson in the final), Wimbledon (beating Kurt Nielsen in the final) and U. S. Championships (over Rosewall in the final). He was ranked world number one amateur for 1955 by Lance Tingay and by Ned Potter.

Trabert&#x27;s record in 1955 was one of the greatest ever by an American tennis player. He won the three most prestigious tournaments in amateur tennis—the French, Wimbledon, and American Championships. He won Wimbledon and the US in 1955 without losing a set (the only time it has ever been done in consecutive majors). He is one of only ten male players to have won three Grand Slam singles title in a year. Trabert&#x27;s own chance at a Grand Slam was stopped with a loss to Ken Rosewall in the semifinals at the Australian Championships. Trabert won 18 tournaments in 1955, compiling a match record of 106 wins to 7 losses, which included a 38-match winning streak.

Trabert, along with Vic Seixas, was an American Davis Cup team mainstay during the early 1950s, during which time the Americans reached the finals five times, winning the cup in 1954. It was one of only two victories over the dominant Australian teams during the decade (the other being in 1958). He called the 1954 Davis Cup win the &quot;biggest thrill in my tennis career&quot;. Trabert turned pro after winning the ’55 U.S. Championships because he had a wife and two children to support.

===Professional===
Having reached the top amateur ranking in 1955, Trabert turned professional in the fall of that year. Trabert explained: “When I won Wimbledon as an amateur, I got a 10-pound certificate, which was worth $27 redeemable at Lilly White’s Sporting Goods store in London. Jack Kramer offered me a guarantee of $75,000 against a percentage of the gate to play on his tour.&quot; With a wife and two children to support, the decision was clear. In 1956, he was beaten on the head-to-head world pro tour by the reigning king of professional tennis Pancho Gonzales, 74–27, consisting mostly of indoor matches on a portable loose canvas surface. Forty years after his matches with Gonzales, Trabert told interviewer Joe McCauley &quot;that Gonzales&#x27; serve was the telling factor on their tour—it was so good that it earned him many cheap points. Trabert felt that, while he had the better ground-strokes, he could not match Pancho&#x27;s big, fluent service.&quot; However, he beat Gonzales in five sets at Roland Garros in the final of the 1956 French Pro title. Trabert also won a South American tour over Gonzales, Sedgman, and Kramer in 1956, winning six matches against Gonzales, and losing three matches indoor, for a 6–3 edge over Gonzales on that tour. For the year 1956 as a whole, Trabert had an edge over Gonzales in outdoor matches of 16-11 (1-1 on grass, 4–5 on cement, and 11–5 on clay).

In the 1958 pro tour, Trabert won a personal series against Segura 34–31, showing that he had adjusted to the portable canvas surface used by the Kramer pros in small indoor venues and gyms. In the Wembley Pro in 1958, he defeated Rosewall in the semi-final and was runner-up to Sedgman . In the French Pro at Roland Garros in 1959, Trabert beat Rosewall in the semifinal and then defeated Frank Sedgman in the final, to win his fourth title at the red clay venue. In the 1960 US Pro (billed as Cleveland World Pro), he was runner-up to Alex Olmedo. In November 1961, Trabert led the United States team into the Kramer Cup final (the pro equivalent of the Davis Cup) at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Trabert defeated Rosewall in four sets, but lost the fifth and deciding rubber to Lew Hoad in four sets. The following week, Trabert won the Western Province Pro in Cape Town, beating Rosewall in the final. In October 1962, Trabert won the South African Pro Championships on the cement courts of Ellis Park in Johannesburg by defeating Hoad in the final in five sets. Trabert also had wins over Hoad at the Forest Hills Tournament of Champions in 1957 and 1958.

In his 1979 autobiography &quot;The Game&quot; Jack Kramer, the former world No. 1 player, included Trabert in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.

==Post-playing career==

After retiring from the game, Trabert enjoyed a 33-year career (1971–2004) as a tennis and golf analyst for CBS, covering events such as the US Open. During many of those years, he teamed with Pat Summerall and was the lead commentator at the US Open. The popularity of their broadcasts helped propel the US Open into an annual financial success for CBS and the United States Tennis Association. He was also the US Davis Cup team captain from 1976 to 1980. Trabert&#x27;s captaincy is remembered by his frustration in dealing with the egos of younger players like John McEnroe and for his racket-wielding expulsion of anti-apartheid protesters who ran onto the court during a Davis Cup match against South Africa at the Newport Beach Tennis Club in California in April 1977.

In 1980 he had a small cameo role on the television show &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, Season 1, episode 24. He played a tennis pro at a tennis club.

He was also a tennis author and was a motivational speaker. In 1988, he published the book &quot;Trabert on Tennis&quot;, sharing his insights on the game from a player&#x27;s, coach&#x27;s, and commentator&#x27;s standpoint. In 1970, with the encouragement of Dr.Toby Freedman and Dale Jensen, Trabert opened the Tony Trabert Tennis Camp in Ojai, California at Thacher School, and then one in Pebble Beach, California for ages 8–18.

Trabert served as president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island from 2001 to 2011.

In 2004, he announced his retirement from broadcasting while commentating at the Wimbledon Championships.

Trabert resided in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida with Vicki Trabert, his wife of 30 years, and their grandchildren. They had five children (two of his and three of hers) and 14 grandchildren.

Trabert died at age 90 at his home in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, on February 3, 2021.

==Awards and honors==
In 1970, Trabert was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. He was enshrined into the Cincinnati Tennis Hall of Fame in 2002 together with Billy Talbert. On September 8, 2014, Trabert was inducted into the United States Tennis Association&#x27;s Court of Champions prior to the US Open men&#x27;s singles final.

<text>William Keith Relf (22 March 194312 May 1976) was an English musician, best known as the lead vocalist and harmonica player for rock band the Yardbirds. He then formed the band Renaissance with his sister Jane Relf, the Yardbirds ex-drummer Jim McCarty and ex-The Nashville Teens keyboardist John Hawken.

== Early life ==
Relf was born in the Richmond Institution on 22 March 1943 to Mary Elsie Vickers and William Arthur Percy Relf. Keith had a sister Jane. His father was a builder, while his mother was a housewife.

==Musical career==
Relf started playing in bands around the summer of 1956 as a singer, guitarist, and harmonica player.

Relf co-wrote many of the original Yardbirds songs (&quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Done Wrong&quot;, &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot;, &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;), later showing a leaning towards acoustic/folk music as the sixties unfolded (&quot;Only the Black Rose&quot;). He also sang an early version of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; in live Yardbirds concerts, after hearing musician Jake Holmes perform the song, which was later recorded by the band&#x27;s successor group Led Zeppelin.

His debut solo single, &quot;Mr. Zero&quot;, peaked at No. 50 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1966.

After the Yardbirds broke up in July 1968, Relf formed the acoustic duo Together, with fellow Yardbird Jim McCarty, followed immediately by Renaissance (which also featured his sister Jane Relf). After leaving Renaissance in 1970, he started producing other artists: Steamhammer, folk rock band Hunter Muskett, the acoustic world music group Amber, psychedelic band Saturnalia, and blues rock band Medicine Head (with whom he also played bass guitar). In 1974, he formed progressive/rock group Armageddon. Their self-titled debut, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, was recorded in England and released in the United States on A&amp;M Records. The album&#x27;s original liner notes used the term &quot;supergroup&quot;; their personnel (besides Relf) included drummer Bobby Caldwell (previously a member of Captain Beyond and Johnny Winter&#x27;s band), guitarist Martin Pugh (from Steamhammer, &quot;The Rod Stewart Album&quot;, and later of 7th Order), and bassist Louis Cennamo (also formerly of Renaissance and Steamhammer).

== Personal life and death == 
In 1966, he married April Liversidge. They had two sons, Danny and Jason.

On 12 May 1976, Relf died in the basement of his home at age 33 from electrocution while playing an ungrounded electric guitar. He had had several health problems throughout his life, including emphysema and asthma. He may have been taking medications such as theophylline commonly used to treat those diseases at the time, and these drugs may have led to tachycardia and/or arrhythmia which possibly contributed to his inability to survive the electric shock. His death was announced two days later on 14 May, which is sometimes erroneously listed as the date of his death.

He was buried in Richmond Cemetery.

== Legacy ==

Relf&#x27;s posthumous 1992 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction with the Yardbirds was represented by his widow April, and sons Danny and Jason (&quot;Jay&quot;).

==Solo singles discography==
Most of Relf&#x27;s recordings were released under the name of the group he was in at the time. However, an early attempt was made to establish him as a solo musician, and two singles came out under his own name in 1966.

* &quot;Mr. Zero&quot; / &quot;Knowing&quot; – UK Columbia DB7920 / U.S. Epic 10044 (May 1966)
::A-side written by Bob Lind
* &quot;Shapes in My Mind&quot; / &quot;Blue Sands&quot; – UK Columbia DB8084 / US Epic 10110 (November 1966)
::B-side is an instrumental credited to Relf, but actually performed by the Outsiders (not to be confused with the US band, the Outsiders, who performed &quot;Time Won&#x27;t Let Me&quot;). The US single featured the same version as the UK single; US promotional copies (on red vinyl) featured a complete re-edit of the song.

A further single appeared in 1989:
* &quot;Together Now&quot; / &quot;All The Fallen Angels&quot; – MCCM 89 002 (1989)
::US release only. The A-side was originally recorded in 1968 by Together. The B-side was recorded on 2 May 1976, ten days before Relf&#x27;s death.

<text>Clark Edward Graebner (born November 4, 1943) is a retired American professional tennis player.

He was four times a world top ten ranked player each year from 1966 to 1969, reaching world No. 3 in 1967 and world No. 7 the following year. He was ranked eight times in the top ten U.S. players by the USTA, reaching U.S. No. 2 in 1968 behind Arthur Ashe, and U.S. No. 3 in 1966 and 1971.

Graebner won three U.S. national titles, the U.S. Clay Court in 1968, the U.S. Hard Court in 1969, and the U.S. Indoor in 1971. He was a member of the U.S. Davis Cup team which won the Davis Cup in five straight years from 1968 to 1972.

He won a Grand Slam doubles title at the 1966 French Championships at Roland Garros with doubles partner Dennis Ralston.

==Early life==
Graebner was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the only child of Paul Graebner, a dentist, and his wife, the former Janice Clark. Paul had been a moderately successful youth player. Clark won the state high-school tennis championship three times. He graduated from Northwestern University, where he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity.

In 1964 he married rising American tennis player Carole Caldwell. They had two children, a daughter, Cameron, and a son, Clark. The couple separated in 1974 and eventually divorced. In 1975, Graebner married Patti Morgan. Caldwell died of cancer in New York City on November 19, 2008.

==Tennis career==

;1965
Graebner won his first important international tournament in December 1965 at the Victorian Championships at Melbourne&#x27;s Kooyong Stadium. He defeated Ray Ruffels, Tony Roche in a close five set match, Herb Fitzgibbon, Fred Stolle, and Roy Emerson in a five set final.

;1966
Graebner lost to John Newcombe in the quarterfinal of the Australian Open. He returned the favour by defeating Newcombe in the third round at the French Championships at Roland Garros that season. He won the men&#x27;s doubles title at the French Championships, with his doubles partner Dennis Ralston, defeating the Rumanian doubles team of Tiriac/Năstase in the final. 
Graebner won the Pennsylvania Lawn Tennis Championships at the Merion Cricket Club defeating Charlie Pasarell in the semifinal and Stan Smith in the final. At the U.S. Championships at Forest Hills, New York he reached the quarterfinals where he was defeated by Stolle, who would win the title that year.

Graebner was ranked world No. 9 for 1966 by McCauley. He was ranked the No. 3 U.S. player for that year by the USTA.

;1967
Graebner won the Buffalo Indoor Tennis Championships in February defeating Marty Riessen in a marathon final. Graebner would also win this same event in 1968 (over Riessen again in the final), in 1969 (over Mark Cox in the final) and in 1970 (over Bob Lutz in the final).

He lost to Newcombe, the champion that year, in the 4th round of the 1967 Wimbledon championships. In the 1967 United States Championship, the last time the event, today&#x27;s U.S. Open, was open only to amateur players, Graebner was the top-seeded U.S. player at No. 7. He defeated the No. 2 seed Roy Emerson in a marathon quarterfinal, but lost in the final to Newcombe.

Graebner was ranked world No. 3 for 1967, which would be his highest world ranking, by the Martini and Rossi panel of tennis experts using a point system for tournament play. He was ranked the U.S. No. 4 by the USTA for that year.

;1968
In 1968 he reached the final of the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships in London, defeating Stolle, Emerson and Alex Metreveli, but the final was not played. Graebner then reached the semifinals in singles at the 1968 Wimbledon, defeating both Manuel Santana and Stolle, before losing a close match to Roche. He won the 1968 U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Milwaukee defeating Charlie Pasarell in the semifinal and Stan Smith in the final. At the inaugural US Open, he defeated Newcombe in the quarter-final, but lost the semifinal to Arthur Ashe, the eventual champion. Graebner was ranked U.S. No. 2 by the USTA for 1968 and world No. 7 by Lance Tingay as well as by most other ranking authorities.

Graebner and Ashe led the U.S. Davis Cup team to victory in the 1968 Davis Cup, its first in five years. Graebner won both of his singles matches in the Challenge Round against Australia, defeating Bill Bowrey and Ruffels in five set matches. The Americans won four more titles in as many years. John McPhee&#x27;s book, &quot;Levels of the Game&quot;, is about a semifinal match played between Graebner and Ashe at the 1968 US Open at Forest Hills. Ashe won the match.

;1969
Graebner won seven tournaments in the 1969 season, beginning with the Richmond WCT Indoor in February, defeating Thomaz Koch (winner over both Ashe and Richey in the event) in the final. He won the New York Indoor in March, defeating Pasarell in the final. At Wimbledon in 1969, Graebner defeated Ilie Năstase and Andrés Gimeno before losing to Roche again in the quarterfinal, this time in a marathon five sets. He won the U.S. Hard Court Championships in Sacramento in June, defeating Erik van Dillen in a close five-set final. That same season, Graebner won the Southampton Invitational at Long Island on grass, defeating Bill Bowrey in the semifinal and Lutz in the final, both matches in three straight sets. At the U.S. Open that year, he retired in the third set against Roger Taylor in the second round.

Graebner was ranked world No. 10 for 1969 by the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. He was ranked the U.S. No. 4 player by the USTA ranking.

;1970
He won the 1970 River Oaks International Tennis Tournament on clay in Houston, Texas, in April defeating Santana in the semifinal and Cliff Richey in a close five-set final. At Wimbledon, Graebner eliminated Năstase again in the fourth round, but lost in the quarterfinal to Taylor. At the U.S. Open, Graebner lost to Newcombe in the fourth round, although he had beaten Newcombe earlier in the season at the 1970 U.S. Pro Tennis Championships at Longwood. Graebner also reached the singles quarterfinals in Cincinnati in 1970, falling to eventual champion Ken Rosewall. Graebner was ranked the U.S. No. 4 player by the USTA for 1970.

;1971
He won the U.S. National Indoor Championships in February 1971, his third U.S. national title, defeating Năstase in the semifinal and Richey in the final in tight five-set matches. Graebner survived two match points against him in the final with Richey serving, on one of those points returning an overhead finishing shot from Richey. At Wimbledon that year, Graebner lost in the third round to Rod Laver. During that same season Graebner won two ITF tournaments. In the Pennsylvania Lawn Tennis Championship at the Merion Cricket Club, he defeated Frank Froehling in a close semifinal and Dick Stockton in the final. At the South Orange Open on grass in South Orange, New Jersey, he narrowly won the semifinal over Onny Parun and won the final against Pierre Barthès. This was a rewarding victory for Graebner who had finished as runner-up at South Orange in 1964 (to Ashe), in 1966 (to Roche), in 1967 (to Riessen), in 1968 (to Pasarell), and in 1969 (to Smith). At the U.S. Open, he advanced to the quarterfinals where he lost to Tom Okker. Graebner was ranked the U.S. No. 3 player by the USTA for 1971.

;1972
In the 1972 Rothmans International Tennis Tournament  at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England, Graebner defeated Năstase in the semifinal, but lost the final to Richey. Graebner and Năstase had a confrontation about court manners during the first set of the semifinal. Graebner won the Long Island Indoor title in April defeating Roscoe Tanner in the final. At Wimbledon that year, Graebner lost his second round match to Nastase in four sets, Nastase proceeding to a classic Wimbledon final against Smith. In the U.S. Championships, Graebner defeated Adriano Panatta in the first round in four sets, but lost to Smith in the second round in four sets.

;1973
Graebner won his final ITF tournament at the Des Moines Open International Indoor defeating Nicholas Kalogeropoulos in the final. He defeated the world No. 1 Năstase in the semifinal of the Charleston International ITF tournament in a close match after losing the first set. He then lost the final to Jürgen Fassbender. Graebner also defeated Năstase at Paramus, N.J.in the semifinal, but lost the final to Jimmy Connors. At the U.S. Championships Graebner lost in the first round to Geoff Masters.

;1974
At the U.S. Championships at Forest Hills N.Y., Graebner won his first round match against Torben Ulrich and rallied from two sets to one down to defeat Antonio Muñoz in the second round in five sets. He lost in the third round to Ray Moore.

===Doubles===
Graebner&#x27;s most significant doubles title was undoubtedly his Grand Slam victory of the men&#x27;s doubles title at the 1966 French Championships, where he and Ralston beat Țiriac and Năstase in the final. Graebner won the 1969 and 1970 U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Doubles Championship (with William Bowrey and Ashe, respectively), and the 1963 doubles title at Cincinnati.

==Assessment==
Graebner was considered to be one of the fastest servers of his time, and was a powerful hitter with relatively flat groundstrokes.

Graebner ranks No. 32 on the list of best career set win–loss records in Grand Slam events, at 108–58, for a 65% record.

<doc id="868654" wikidata="Q697996" url="?curid=868654" title="Karel Koželuh">
<text>Karel Koželuh (; ; 7 March 1895 – 27 April 1950) was a Czech tennis, association football, and ice hockey player of the 1920s and 1930s. Koželuh became a European ice hockey champion in 1925 and was one of the top-ranked players on the professional tennis circuit in the 1930s.

==Rugby, football and ice hockey years==
Koželuh was born in Prague, Austria-Hungary (today&#x27;s Prague, Czech Republic), one of seven brothers and two sisters. His sports career began with rugby and it was only at the age of 16 that he learned to play tennis. In 1914 he joined the soccer team of Sparta Prague. In later years Koželuh also played for DFC Prag (Prague), Teplitzer FK (Teplice) and Wiener AC (Vienna).

He played international football for both Austria and Czechoslovakia.

In 1925, he was a member of the Czechoslovakia ice hockey team that won the European Championship, scoring the winning goal in the final game.

==Tennis==

===Early years===
Koželuh became a professional tennis coach at a fairly young age and thereby made himself ineligible to play in any amateur tournaments. In 1912 he beat Roman Najuch in the Germany Pro Championships in Wiesbaden. He competed in the few professional tournaments that took place in Europe in the 1920s, contested primarily between teaching professionals. He became known in these tournaments for his speed, his endurance, and his fine groundstrokes from the baseline. Koželuh used the Continental grip, in which both the forehand and backhand are hit with the same grip, and preferred to play as much as ten feet behind the baseline, returning balls endlessly to the other court, almost never advancing to the net. Seldom hitting the ball very hard, he was content to outrun and outlast his opponents in exhausting matches of attrition. He won the most prestigious of these European tournaments, the Bristol Cup, played in Beaulieu, France, six times.

He was 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 145 pounds. The American tennis player Vinnie Richards said he was &quot;seamy-faced, cadaverous-looking and, in general, resembled a cigar-store Indian.&quot;

===Professional years===
When a U.S. professional tour was started, Koželuh was one of the first players to join it, being signed up for it by Vinnie Richards, who made a special trip to Europe for that purpose. In 1928, his first year in the U.S. as a professional, he beat Richards 15 matches to 5. In the following years Koželuh continued to dominate Richards, in 1929 beating him 5 times to 2 and in 1930 4 times to 2. After watching one of their lengthy matches, a tennis expert of the time, J. Parmly Paret, wrote in American Lawn Tennis, that Koželuh had &quot;the most perfect defense that I have seen... But defense alone does not make a champion.&quot; He went on to say that either Henri Cochet or Bill Tilden at their best would be able to defeat Koželuh by attacking him consistently from the net. Koželuh defended his somewhat tedious baseline style by saying, &quot;Why should I change my style when it is so successful?&quot;

Bill Tilden, the greatest player of the 1920s, turned professional at the end of 1930 and organized a tour with himself to play the headline match against Koželuh. Their first encounter was on 18 February 1931 before 14,000 spectators in Madison Square Garden in New York. Tilden won three straight sets in only 65 minutes, attacking from both the baseline and the net and overwhelming Koželuh with his power. Tilden won the next eight matches as well, all of them played indoors on a canvas surface that seldom had enough room for Koželuh to play his normal game far behind the baseline. Koželuh finally won their tenth match on an outdoor concrete court at the Los Angeles Tennis Club. In the course of the year, both in the United States and in Europe, the Czech eventually beat Tilden 17 times while losing 50 matches to him. Koželuh had firmly established himself as one of the half-dozen best players in the world.

Koželuh had already beaten Vinnie Richards to win the United States Pro Championship in 1929. He went on to win the title again in 1932, defeating the German Hans Nüsslein, and in 1937, beating the American Bruce Barnes at The Greenbrier in West Virginia at the age of 42. With this win, he became the oldest winner of a major professional singles tournament. In the first round at the Greenbrier tournament in 1938 (not classed as the US Pro that year), Koželuh faced Greenbrier golf professional Sam Snead, beating him in three straight sets. Koželuh was the losing finalist at the US Pro in 1928, 1930, 1934 and 1935. Koželuh was a six-time winner of the Bristol Cup in Menton, France, which was the most prestigious professional title in the world in the 1920s. He also won the World Pro tournament in Deauville, France, in 1925. Another major title for Koželuh was the French Professional Championship of 1930.

Karel Koželuh was the older brother of the tennis player Jan Koželuh. Jan was ranked as high as the world number 10 amateur in 1927. Karel was ranked joint world number 1 professional in 1927 by Ray Bowers (with Richards) and number 1 alone in 1928 by Bowers and in 1929 by Bowers, &quot;American Lawn Tennis&quot;, and Bill Tilden.

Koželuh was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 2006.

==Death==
Koželuh was killed in a car accident outside Prague on 27 April 1950.

<doc id="868656" wikidata="Q548394" url="?curid=868656" title="Vincent Richards">
<text>Vincent Richards (March 20, 1903 – September 28, 1959) was an American tennis player. He was active in the early decades of the 20th century, particularly known as being a superlative volleyer. He was ranked World No. 2 as an amateur in 1924 by A. Wallis Myers, and was ranked joint World No. 1 pro by Ray Bowers in 1927 and World No. 1 pro by Bowers in 1930.

==Biography==
Born in Yonkers, New York, he attended the Jesuit Fordham Preparatory School, attended Fordham University and studied at the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1922.

Richards won the National Boys Outdoor Singles Tournament in 1917. He became a protégé of Bill Tilden after being defeated by the latter in a match, and he then teamed up with him to win the United States doubles championship in 1918 at the age of 15. He remains the youngest male to have ever won a major championship. Twenty-seven years later, in 1945, he and Tilden won the United States Pro doubles title. While Bill Tilden teamed with Richards to win titles together, he was beaten by Richards in both singles and doubles, including for several major titles. During their long rivalry, they faced each other 102 times, with Richards holding a career record of 52–50 against Tilden.

Richards retained his amateur status for 10 years because his ambition was to compete in the 1924 Olympics held in Paris, France. He realized this ambition by winning the gold medal for the United States in both singles and doubles, additionally collecting the silver medal in mixed doubles. Richards is one of two American male tennis players to win the gold medal in both singles and doubles (Beals Wright was the other), and he ranks second all-time with his three medals won in 1924 (second to Reginald Doherty of Great Britain, who won four Olympic tennis medals). Between both men and women, Richards is third behind Venus Williams in first, and Serena Williams in second, with three overall medals, with Williams collecting four gold medals over multiple Olympics. Richards was a semifinalist at the French championships in 1926, where he beat Colin Gregory and Bela Von Kehrling, then lost to Henri Cochet. He was also a semifinalist at the U.S. championships in 1922 (losing to Bill Johnston), 1924 (losing to Tilden), 1925 (where he beat René Lacoste, then lost to Tilden) and 1926 (losing to Jean Borotra). While there was no official ATP Tour in the 1920s, Richards was one of the pioneers in creating a version of a &quot;world tennis tour&quot;, playing in the equivalent of all four grand slams during his career, additional major tournaments, and exhibition matches in front of emperors, presidents, and other heads of states. While Tilden may have overshadowed Richards, even in the Davis Cup, Richards held a perfect 5–0 record when he played for his country.

In April 1926, Richards and Tilden contested the final of the Mason &amp; Dixon Tournament at The Greenbrier resort, with Richards winning in five sets.

Richards was one of the best singles players of the 1920s and played on several United States Davis Cup teams. In 1927 he was the first prominent male player to turn professional. In 1928, he was still generally considered to be one of the top 5 or 6 players in the world and played a brief tour at the end of the year against Czech player Karel Koželuh, another new professional. Richards only beat Koželuh five times in 20 matches. Richards won the United States Pro Championship in 1927, 1928, and 1930, beating Koželuh in the finals in both 1928 and 1930, and losing to him in the 1929 final. He lost the 1931 final to Tilden and won the U.S. Pro Championships for the last time in 1933, this time beating Frank Hunter in the final. He continued to play in the U.S. Pro championships in most years until 1946. Richards and Tilden won the doubles at the 1945 U.S. Pro championships.

Richards was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1961.

===Business career===
After retiring from tennis, Richards joined the Dunlop Tire and Rubber Company as general manager of the sporting goods division and became vice president.

==Personal life==
In February 1924, he married Claremont Gushee in Greenwich, Connecticut, and they had three children. She died in 1950. On September 28, 1959, Richards died of a heart attack at Doctors Hospital in New York.

==Major finals==
===Grand Slam tournaments===
==== Doubles: 9 (7 titles, 2 runners-up) ====
==== Mixed doubles: 3 (2 titles, 1 runner-up) ====
===Pro Slam tournaments===

<doc id="868657" wikidata="Q3523012" url="?curid=868657" title="The Thumb">
<text>The Thumb is a region and a peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan, so named because the Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten. The Thumb area is generally considered to be in the Central Michigan region, east of the Flint area and the Tri-Cities and north of Metro Detroit. The region is also branded as the Blue Water Area.

The counties that constitute the Thumb form the peninsula that stretches northward into Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay. There is no formal list of which counties are part of the Thumb, but virtually all definitions include Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac counties, and most include Lapeer and St. Clair counties. The population of the Thumb region as of the 2020 census was 370,617.

==Economy==

The Thumb region is very flat with fertile soil, the reason for its historical role as a chiefly agricultural area. Major agricultural products include sugar beets, navy beans, corn, fruits, and fish from Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron. Manufacturing—particularly concerning the automotive industry—is also prevalent in Michigan&#x27;s Thumb due to the region&#x27;s proximity to the automotive centers of Detroit and Flint.

===Industry===
The Thumb has many notable businesses, many linked to agriculture.
*Intertape Polymer Group, Inc. has a major factory in Marysville.
*Cargill Salt operates a large salt mine and factory in St. Clair. This is the only plant in the U.S.A. that produces Alberger salt, which is especially prized in the fast food industry because of its higher volume (due to its unique shape) and lower sodium content (for a given volume, not weight). This is part of Michigan&#x27;s large salt-mining industry.
*Cooperative Elevator Company has been named the top Michigan Agriculture Exporter by the Michigan Department of Agriculture. Its headquarters are in Pigeon, and it has branch elevators in Deckerville, Akron, Gagetown, Sebewaing, Elkton, and Bad Axe.

===International Trade Corridor===
The I-69 International Trade Corridor is a strategic commercial gateway between the Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada, with multi-modal transportation infrastructure that offers a wide range of distribution options. The I-69 International Trade Corridor Next Michigan Development Corporation (NMDC) offers economic incentives to growing businesses, both existing and new, that utilize two or more forms of transportation to move their products and are located within the territory of the NMDC. The I-69 International Trade Corridor Next Michigan Development Corporation is the largest in the state of Michigan with 35 municipal partners.

Constituent counties of the trade corridor are: Shiawassee, Genesee, Lapeer, and St. Clair counties.

==Tourism==

Some towns, such as Bay Port, Caseville, Harbor Beach, Lakeport, Lexington, Port Austin, Port Hope, Port Huron, Port Sanilac, Sebewaing, and St. Clair enjoy seasonal tourism, due to their locations on Lake Huron, Saginaw Bay, or the St. Clair River. Tourism and farming drive the local economy.

The Tip of The Thumb Heritage Water Trail is a nonprofit citizens organization working with the Huron County Parks to establish and maintain a water trail along Michigan&#x27;s Lake Huron&#x27;s shoreline.

===Unique to the Thumb===
Many of the residents commute for work to Metro Detroit, Flint or the Tri-Cities. Incorporated cities with 2,000+ population in the Thumb area are Port Huron, Marysville, Lapeer, St. Clair, Marine City, Algonac, Caro, Imlay City, Bad Axe, Vassar, Sandusky and Croswell. The majority of these cities are in the southern portion of the Thumb.

Unique features in the area include the following:
*Algonac, known as the Venice of Michigan because of its many canals.
*Bad Axe was named after a broken axe found lodged in the knot of a tree at the clearing of the settlement&#x27;s chief crossroads.
*Bay Port, is the world&#x27;s largest freshwater fishing port.
*Harbor Beach is the home of the largest man-made harbor and the Harbor Beach Light.

*Pigeon is the home of the Cooperative Elevator Company, one of the largest grain elevators in the state.
*Port Huron is the maritime capital of the Great Lakes, where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River. This is the largest city in the Thumb area. It was the boyhood home of Thomas Edison.
*The Sanilac Petroglyphs were discovered after massive fires swept the Lower Peninsula in 1881. Native Americans created this unusual artwork 300 to 1,000 years ago. The petroglyphs provide a glimpse into the lives of an ancient woodland people who occupied Michigan&#x27;s Thumb area.
*Sebewaing is the sugar beet capital of the world, and home to one of the four Michigan Sugar Company factories in the Thumb region. The sugar companies were organized with money from lumber barons such as Rasmus Hanson.
*St. Clair boasts the world&#x27;s largest boardwalk along freshwater, the St. Clair River.
*Turnip Rock, an unusual undercut sea stack at the extreme northern tip of the Thumb.

===Traveling around the Thumb===
A favorite of tourists who visit this area is traveling the Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay shoreline via M-25 (formerly US Highway 25 until 1973). M-25 starts at the end of I-69/I-94 in Port Huron at the foot of the Blue Water Bridge and ends in Bay City. The whole highway is about , and passes through quaint cities and villages. Located along Lake Huron through which M-25 passes are five lighthouses: Fort Gratiot Lighthouse, Port Sanilac lighthouse, Pointe aux Barques Lighthouse, Harbor Beach Light, and the Port Austin Lighthouse.

The Lake Huron Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. Many visitors choose to begin the circle tour in Port Huron, from which they can circle Lake Huron. M-25 winds around the Thumb and along Saginaw Bay to Saginaw and Bay City. Lexington and Port Austin feature beaches and boardwalks that are favorites with visitors.

==Thumb counties==
===Huron===
Huron County is located at the tip of the Thumb. The county is surrounded on three sides by water – Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron, and has over of shoreline, from White Rock on Lake Huron to Sebewaing on Saginaw Bay, and more shoreline parks than any other county in the state.

The county&#x27;s economy relies on agriculture and ranks as one of the top agricultural counties in Michigan. Rich farmland inland produces beans, sugar beets and grain, including most of the world&#x27;s supply of navy beans. Tourism is also important to Huron County with bay front and lakefront towns such as Sebewaing, Caseville, Port Austin, Port Hope, and Harbor Beach, attracting tourists from all over. Huron County borders Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron. There are two state parks – Sleeper State Park and Port Crescent State Park. Three roadside parks – Jenks Park, Brown Park, and White Rock Park. Also, Huron County maintains nine county parks along the shoreline, which are Caseville Park, Lighthouse Park, Stafford Park, McGraw Park, Philp Park, Port Austin Bird Creek Park, Wagener Park, Oak Beach Park, and Sebewaing Park.
The county seat is Bad Axe, located in the center of the county.

===Lapeer===
The origin of the name of the county is often disputed, but it may have derived from the French words &quot;la pierre&quot;, meaning &quot;the stone&quot;. This name could be a reference to the rounded stones, or flint pebbles, found in the rivers and streams throughout the area. Another theory is that it may be an English variation of &quot;Le Pays Plat&quot;, meaning &quot;the flat land&quot;, which is one of the original names given to the area by the French, and can be found on many early fur trader maps of the area. The idea is that &quot;Le Pays&quot; may have evolved into the current pronunciation, &quot;Lapeer&quot;.

Lapeer County is in many ways different from the other counties of the Thumb. First, it is heavily influenced by its proximity to Flint and Detroit, so as a result, its economy depends more heavily on manufacturing than the other counties of the region. Second, although agriculture is still a key economic factor in Lapeer County, it is not as important to the economy as in the other counties. Although there are still a few large-scale farms located in the county, the numbers are not found to the same extent, and these days, most farming in Lapeer now takes place on smaller, independent farms, which usually supply the local markets only. Lastly, in addition to its economic and agricultural differences, Lapeer County&#x27;s geography is very different from the other counties of the Thumb. Its topography is generally gently rolling to quite hilly, and unlike its neighbors, which are flatter, and border on Lake Huron or Lake St. Clair, Lapeer County is landlocked. The county still has hundreds of acres of inland lakes such as Barnes Lake, Miller Lake, Lake Neppessing, the Holloway Reservoir, Big Fish Lake, and Lake Metamora, and several state recreation areas, including the Ortonville Recreation Area and the Metamora-Hadley Recreation Area, which still bring in many campers and tourists.

===Sanilac===
Sanilac County has the largest area of land in both the Thumb and the entire Lower Peninsula. Like other counties, Sanilac has fertile and flat land, great for growing crops. Towns like Lexington and Port Sanilac bring in many tourists from the Detroit Area. Sandusky is the county seat and largest city.

===St. Clair===
St. Clair County has the largest population in the Thumb, and is considered part of the Metro Detroit MSA. Many residents farther north in the Thumb, especially Sanilac County, travel to Port Huron for shopping and work. It is the farthest county to the east in Michigan, and most of the eastern border is the St. Clair River, which separates Michigan from Ontario. For the most part, St. Clair County is flat with an agricultural economy dominating in the north and west; in the 19th century, agriculture and lumbering were important east to the St. Clair River. Sugar beets were cultivated and annual festivals were held at harvest time. In addition, many farms had mixed agriculture. There are steep hills and small canyons near the Black River. Since the mid-20th century, manufacturing had dominated in and around Port Huron.

===Tuscola===
Like Huron County, Tuscola is mostly dependent on agriculture. Industries such as sugar refining and ethanol processing, as well as growing various grains and beans, make up most of the economy. Caro, one of the largest cities in the Thumb (the largest if you exclude St. Clair and Lapeer counties), is named after Cairo, Egypt and is the county seat. Tuscola County only has of shoreline along Saginaw Bay, so it is not as dependent on tourism as the other counties in the area. Tuscola County is economically tied to the surrounding region as well as to the Saginaw, Bay City, and Flint areas.

==Borderline regions==
The boundaries of what is included in the Thumb are often debated, but nearly all definitions include Huron, Sanilac, and Tuscola counties, known as the tri-county region. Disputed areas include:
*St. Clair County, especially the southern portion, as the county is now classified as part of Metro Detroit by the Census Bureau.
*Lapeer County
*Richmond and northern Macomb County
*Genesee County

==Blue Water Area==

The Blue Water Area is another term describing the Thumb of Michigan. The term usually applies to St. Clair County and surrounding areas. The title is also extended to include all of Michigan&#x27;s Thumb. The name refers to the county being bordered by water: on the east is the St. Clair River, connecting Lake Huron to the north to Lake St. Clair. Below that is the Detroit River. The namesake Blue Water Bridge spans the St. Clair River, connecting Port Huron to Sarnia, Ontario. A similar name, &quot;Blue Water Country,&quot; is used to describe the same region on the Canadian side.

===Discover the Blue===
&quot;Discover the Blue&quot; is a promotion by the Blue Water Area Convention and Visitor&#x27;s Bureau. It is designed to attract visitors to the shoreline of eastern Michigan. Communities participating in Discover the Blue include Algonac in St. Clair County (at the southern end of the Thumb) and others to the north, such as Port Austin (at the tip of the Thumb).

==Geography==

===Land features===
&quot;See also&quot; List of Michigan state parks and geography of Michigan.
*The Thumb&#x27;s landscape ranges from a flat sandy plain along the shores of Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay, to a gently rolling topography. This land is fertile and well suited for agriculture. The most unusual geographic formation is a rugged glacial moraine, known collectively as the Hadley Hills, which extends in a northeasterly direction through the center of the Thumb, from the southwestern portion of the peninsula.
*All counties except for Lapeer border Saginaw Bay or Lake Huron.
*The places with the highest elevation are all associated with the Hadley Hills, and are located in Lapeer County. They are: Pinnacle Point, at and Kerr (Cemetery) Hill, at , both in Hadley Township; Mount Christie, at , in Metamora Township; and a point near Mayville, reaching up to above sea level.
*The lowest point in the Thumb region is the shore of Lake St. Clair, at a low of above sea level.
*Huron County is very flat. It has large fields that were used for agriculture and now are the sites of numerous wind turbines to generate electricity. 
*The &quot;tip of the Thumb&quot; is Pointe Aux Barques, between Port Austin and Grindstone City.
*Marlette is called the &quot;heart of the Thumb,&quot; because of its central position on the peninsula.

The Thumb has many waterways.
*The Cass River has many branches, one of which flows into the Shiawassee River in the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge at less than from where the Shiawassee merges with the Tittabawassee River to form the Saginaw River.
*The Pinnebog, Shebahyonk, and Pigeon rivers all rise in the center of Huron County and empty into Saginaw Bay.
*The St. Clair River, connects Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair, and is the farthest east border in Michigan. It forms a low impression in eastern St. Clair County, and has a delta at its mouth (North America&#x27;s largest freshwater delta), which includes Harsens Island and Walpole Island, Ontario. Ferries cross the river at Algonac and Marine City, these being international border crossings.
*The Black River rises near Minden City and flows into the St. Clair River at Port Huron. The Black River forms a basin in Sanilac County, and northern St. Clair County.
*The north branch of the Flint River lies in northern Lapeer County. It rises near North Branch. The southern branch flows through the central and southern portion of Lapeer County, originates in Brandon, Atlas, Hadley, and Metamora townships before merging with the North Branch just north of the Holloway Reservoir.

==History and local culture==

===Culture===
Since the late 18th century, ethnic European Americans have displaced the Native American tribes that historically occupied this territory. Since the early 20th century, they have dominated the population and culture of the Thumb. The French were the first Europeans to arrive, and thus influenced much of the early culture. They were mostly engaged in the fur trading and lumber industries, and had relatively few settlers. After the British won the French and Indian War, they took over this former French territory.

Many of these new settlers were sent into the area by the British from Canada in an effort to establish their dominance over the Great Lakes. In 1783, control of the Thumb was officially transferred to the newly formed United States, after the American Revolution and by the Treaty of Paris. The British were a dominant influence until after the War of 1812, when the northern border was firmly defined and this area came under US control. The US organized the Northwest Territory, and American settlement of Michigan and the Thumb was well underway by the mid-19th century. Construction of the Erie Canal through Central New York created stronger connections with the port of New York and eastern markets. Settlers migrated west from New York and New England into Ohio and Michigan, seeking new territory.

As a result of this history, the land was settled primarily by people of ethnic English and Scots-Irish descent; many arrived from Canada. Other settlers of the same ancestry migrated from eastern states such as New York, and Pennsylvania, as well as from New England. Immigration from the British Isles took place through the century, and later 19th and 20th century residents included Polish and German immigrants who migrated from Europe through the Detroit area. Many of the customs, much of the regional lifestyle, and even the local accent, strongly reflect these origins. Some local radio stations have featured polka shows, and various ethnic festivals, such as the Polkafest, in Kinde, are representative of Eastern European cultures.

In the early years, Europeans encountered and traded with people of the Fox and Sauk tribes, already living in the area for centuries. There may have also been other tribes in the area such as the Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Kickapoo, but they would have been transient tribes, or found in very small numbers. All native Thumb area tribes are members of the Algonquian peoples, a large language family. Other tribes who migrated later into the area included the Wyandot (Huron), an Iroquoian language-speaking people; and the Ottawa. The displacement of native peoples took place in many areas during the settling of North America.

===Historical events===
*The Port Huron area is one of oldest European settlements in the state of Michigan, first settled by French colonists.
*Colonial-era forts such as Fort Gratiot (north of Port Huron) and Fort Sinclair (near present-day St. Clair) were built along the St. Clair River.
*Bad Axe was named so because Captain Rudolph Papst found an old axe in 1861, when he was clearing land for the present-day Huron County seat.
*The great Thumb Fire took place on September 5, 1881, in the Thumb area of Michigan. The fire, which burned over a million acres (4,000 km2) in less than a day, was the consequence of drought, hurricane-force winds, heat, the after-effects of the Port Huron Fire of 1871, and the ecological damage wrought by the era&#x27;s logging techniques of clear cutting forests.
*The Great Lakes Storm of 1913 was a November blizzard with hurricane-force winds; it devastated the Great Lakes Basin in the United States Midwest and the Canadian province of Ontario. The storm also battered and overturned large ships on four of the five Great Lakes, particularly Lake Huron.

<text>Howard Oreon Kinsey (December 3, 1899 – July 26, 1966) was an American tennis player in the 1920s. He was originally from California.

== Playing record ==
His significant championships were the 1926 French National men&#x27;s doubles championship, where he and Vincent Richards beat Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon (a pairing who went on to win three other French National doubles titles) in the final, and the 1924 U.S. National men&#x27;s doubles championship with his brother Robert Kinsey.

Bill Tilden wrote of the pair that he had &quot;seldom seen a team work together more smoothly than the Kinseys.&quot; In 1926, he reached the Wimbledon final, losing to Jean Borotra.

Kinsey was ranked world No. 7 in 1924 by A. Wallis Myers in his amateur rankings for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. As a pro, &quot;American Lawn Tennis Magazine&quot; ranked Kinsey as world No. 6 in 1930.

Later in 1926, he was one of the early players signed by the promoter Charles C. Pyle to play in his professional tennis league. After a split with Pyle, he joined Richards in forming an association of professional tennis players.

In 1936, he and Helen Wills Moody volleyed a tennis ball back and forth 2,001 times without missing. The feat took them 1 hour and 18 minutes. They only stopped the exchange so that Kinsey could go teach a lesson that he had scheduled.

Kinsey is a member of the USTA Northern California Hall of Fame.

<text>West Michigan and Western Michigan are terms for a region in the U.S. state of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. Generally, it refers to the Grand Rapids-Muskegon-Holland area, and more broadly to most of the region along the Lower Peninsula&#x27;s Lake Michigan shoreline, but there is no official definition.

==Definition==

In general, &quot;West Michigan&quot; often refers to the area bounded by the cities of Muskegon (in the north), Grand Rapids (in the northeast), Kalamazoo–Battle Creek (in the southeast) and St. Joseph–Benton Harbor (in the southwest). However, definitions of the boundaries of the region vary widely; in some contexts, the term &quot;West Michigan&quot; is applied only to the counties of Allegan, Kent, Muskegon, and Ottawa, which form the core of the Grand Rapids-Kentwood-Muskegon CSA. Other definitions include the Kalamazoo–Battle Creek and Benton Harbor–St. Joseph regions, which can be considered distinct regions or parts of other regions such as Michiana, Southern Michigan, or Southwest Michigan, the latter according to one definition comprising Berrien County, Cass County, and Van Buren County.

The northern boundary of the region is also poorly defined; the population density, land use, economic and cultural character, and physical geography most often associated with West Michigan fades in northern Muskegon and Kent Counties, however areas as far north as Ludington and White Cloud may be included because of their close economic ties to the cities to the south. Other areas, such as Montcalm County in the northeast corner of the region, are transitional areas that straddle Michigan regions but are sometimes included for classification purposes. Greenville, in Montcalm County&#x27;s southwest corner, is closely tied economically with Grand Rapids; however, the northeastern corner, around Vestaburg and Edmore, has historically more closely associated with the cities of Mount Pleasant and Alma, which are almost universally reckoned as part of Central Michigan.

==Geography==
:&quot;See also&quot; List of Michigan state parks and Geography of Michigan.
*Counties in the area are part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids or the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalamazoo.
*In northwest Kent County is Fruit Ridge, which is a prime fruit-growing region; that accounts for 65% of all Michigan apple production.

==Municipalities==
The following table contains the largest municipalities of West Michigan according to the 2010 Census. This defines the region fairly broadly, but not at its most broadly; if Battle Creek were included, it would be ranked fourth.

Five of the above cities, Wyoming, Kentwood, Portage, Norton Shores, and Walker, are former suburban townships that incorporated in the 1960s in order to prevent annexation by an adjacent city. The presence of these cities in the top ten reflects both the large geographic area of these cities, as well as the long and continuing growth of suburban areas in West Michigan.

<text>The Mathias Ham House is a 19th-century house in Dubuque, Iowa, that is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located at the intersection of Shiras and Lincoln Avenues, near the entrances to Eagle Point Park and Riverview Park.

==Description==
The house was designed by John F. Rague and built for local businessman and lead miner Mathias Ham in 1857. Ham had owned an island in the Mississippi River at Dubuque, called Ham&#x27;s Island (which has since renamed City Island and then Chaplain Schmitt Memorial Island, after Father Aloysius Schmitt). The architect, John F. Rague, who had designed the original state capitol buildings at Springfield, Illinois and at Iowa City, Iowa, designed the house in the Italian Villa style.

The Mathias Ham House has been restored and transformed into a museum showcasing life during the Antebellum era; it contains American and European furnishings from that period. The property also features the Louis Arriandeaux Log House, a double log cabin in the dogtrot style, which is considered the oldest building in Iowa. The cabin was built in 1833 at 2nd and Locust Streets in Dubuque, then moved to Eagle Point Park in Dubuque before being moved to the Mathias Ham House Historic Site.

Additionally, a one-room schoolhouse (the former Humke School) was relocated to the property. A replica mine shaft and &quot;badger hole&quot; or &quot;badger hut&quot; were constructed on the property to educate the public about Dubuque&#x27;s lead mining history.

==Museum==
The museum is operated by the Dubuque County Historical Society, which also operates the National Mississippi River Museum &amp; Aquarium.

The song spent 10 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 72 in March 1992.

<text>King &quot;in&quot; Prussia (German: &quot;König in Preußen&quot;) was a title used by the Prussian kings (also in personal union Electors of Brandenburg) from 1701 to 1772. Subsequently, they used the title King &quot;of&quot; Prussia (&quot;König von Preußen&quot;).

The House of Hohenzollern ruled Brandenburg as Prince-Electors, and were subjects of the Holy Roman Emperor. Since 1618, the Electors of Brandenburg had also ruled the Duchy of Prussia, which lay outside the empire, in a personal union. The dual state was known unofficially as Brandenburg-Prussia. Originally the dukes of Prussia held the fief as vassals of the King of Poland, until the Treaties of Labiau (1656) and Bromberg (1657), with which Frederick William, the Great Elector, achieved full sovereignty from the Polish Crown. His son, Elector Frederick III, then sought to show his greatness by adopting the title &quot;king&quot;. 

At the time, the only royal titles within the Holy Roman Empire were those of King of the Romans (held by the Holy Roman Emperor or their heir apparent) and King of Bohemia (held more or less continuously since the 16th century by the Holy Roman Emperors in a &quot;de facto&quot; personal union). However, Prussia lay outside the empire, and the Hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it. Frederick thus argued that German law of the time allowed him to rule Prussia as a kingdom, outside the borders of the Holy Roman Empire.

In the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700, in return for Hohenzollern assistance in the War of the Spanish Succession and support for the Habsburg candidate in the subsequent imperial election, Emperor Leopold I allowed Frederick to crown himself &quot;King &quot;in&quot; Prussia&quot;. The title &quot;King in Prussia&quot; reflected the legal fiction that Frederick was only sovereign over his former duchy. In Brandenburg and other Hohenzollern domains within the borders of the empire, he was legally still an elector under the ultimate overlordship of the emperor. By this time, however, the emperor&#x27;s authority had become purely nominal. The rulers of the empire&#x27;s member states acted largely as rulers of sovereign states, and only acknowledged the emperor&#x27;s suzerainty in a formal way. Hence, even though Brandenburg was still legally part of the empire and ruled in personal union with Prussia, the two states came to be treated as one &quot;de facto.&quot; Although Prussia&#x27;s royal title gave the Hohenzollern rulers higher status, Brandenburg was the wealthier and more populous portion of the combined realm, and Brandenburg&#x27;s capital Berlin remained the primary residence of the King and his administration. In addition, the Duchy was only the eastern bulk of the region of Prussia; the westernmost fragment constituted the part of Royal Prussia east of the Vistula, held along with the title &quot;King of Prussia&quot; by the King of Poland. 
On 17 January 1701, Frederick dedicated the royal coat of arms, the Prussian black eagle with the motto &quot;suum cuique&quot; imprinted. On 18 January, he crowned himself and his wife Sophie Charlotte in a baroque ceremony in Königsberg Castle. Frederick&#x27;s move was controversial, and only became widely accepted after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Throughout the 18th century, the Hohenzollerns increased their power. They were victorious over the Austrian Habsburg monarchy in the three Silesian Wars, greatly increasing their power through the acquisition of Silesia.

King Frederick II adopted the title &quot;King of Prussia&quot; in 1772, the same year he annexed most of Royal Prussia in the First Partition of Poland. The Hohenzollerns continued to be both Kings of Prussia and Electors of Brandenburg until the empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806. At that point, the entire realm was formally unified as the Kingdom of Prussia, with Brandenburg one of its provinces and Berlin the kingdom&#x27;s capital, though the two parts became partially distinct again during the existence of the German Confederation (1815–1866).

<text>Neoclassicism in music was a twentieth-century trend, particularly current in the interwar period, in which composers sought to return to aesthetic precepts associated with the broadly defined concept of &quot;classicism&quot;, namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotional restraint. As such, neoclassicism was a reaction against the unrestrained emotionalism and perceived formlessness of late Romanticism, as well as a &quot;call to order&quot; after the experimental ferment of the first two decades of the twentieth century. The neoclassical impulse found its expression in such features as the use of pared-down performing forces, an emphasis on rhythm and on contrapuntal texture, an updated or expanded tonal harmony, and a concentration on absolute music as opposed to Romantic program music.

In form and thematic technique, neoclassical music often drew inspiration from music of the eighteenth century, though the inspiring canon belonged as frequently to the Baroque (and even earlier periods) as to the Classical period—for this reason, music which draws inspiration specifically from the Baroque is sometimes termed &quot;neo-Baroque&quot; music. Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development, French (proceeding partly from the influence of Erik Satie and represented by Igor Stravinsky, who was in fact Russian-born) and German (proceeding from the &quot;New Objectivity&quot; of Ferruccio Busoni, who was actually Italian, and represented by Paul Hindemith). Neoclassicism was an aesthetic trend rather than an organized movement; even many composers not usually thought of as &quot;neoclassicists&quot; absorbed elements of the style.

==People and works==
Although the term &quot;neoclassicism&quot; refers to a twentieth-century movement, there were important nineteenth-century precursors. In pieces such as Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;À la Chapelle Sixtine&quot; (1862), Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Holberg Suite&quot; (1884), Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s divertissement from &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (1890), George Enescu&#x27;s &quot;Piano Suite in the Old Style&quot; (1897) and Max Reger&#x27;s &quot;Concerto in the Old Style&quot; (1912), composers &quot;dressed up their music in old clothes in order to create a smiling or pensive evocation of the past&quot;.

Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 (1917) is sometimes cited as a precursor of neoclassicism. Prokofiev himself thought that his composition was a &quot;passing phase&quot; whereas Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassicism was by the 1920s &quot;becoming the basic line of his music&quot;. Richard Strauss also introduced neoclassical elements into his music, most notably in his orchestral suite &quot;Le bourgeois gentilhomme&quot; Op. 60, written in an early version in 1911 and its final version in 1917.

Ottorino Respighi was also one of the precursors of neoclassicism with his &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot; Suite No. 1, composed in 1917. Instead of looking at musical forms of the eighteenth century, Respighi, who, in addition to being a renowned composer and conductor, was also a notable musicologist, reached back to Italian music of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. His fellow contemporary composer Gian Francesco Malipiero, also a musicologist, compiled a complete edition of the works of Claudio Monteverdi. Malipiero&#x27;s relation with ancient Italian music was not simply aiming at a revival of antique forms within the framework of a &quot;return to order&quot;, but an attempt to revive an approach to composition that would allow the composer to free himself from the constraints of the sonata form and of the over-exploited mechanisms of thematic development.

Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s first foray into the style began in 1919/20 when he composed the ballet &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, using themes which he believed to be by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (it later came out that many of them were not, though they were by contemporaries). American Composer Edward T. Cone describes the ballet &quot;[Stravinsky] confronts the evoked historical manner at every point with his own version of contemporary language; the result is a complete reinterpretation and transformation of the earlier style&quot;. Later examples are the Octet for winds, the &quot;Dumbarton Oaks&quot; Concerto, the Concerto in D, the Symphony of Psalms, Symphony in C, and Symphony in Three Movements, as well as the opera-oratorio &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and the ballets &quot;Apollo&quot; and &quot;Orpheus&quot;, in which the neoclassicism took on an explicitly &quot;classical Grecian&quot; aura. Stravinsky&#x27;s neoclassicism culminated in his opera &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, with a libretto by W. H. Auden. Stravinskian neoclassicism was a decisive influence on the French composers Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, Arthur Honegger and Germaine Tailleferre, as well as on Bohuslav Martinů, who revived the Baroque concerto grosso form in his works. &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, as a subcategory of rearrangement of existing Baroque compositions, spawned a number of similar works, including Alfredo Casella&#x27;s &quot;Scarlattiana&quot; (1927), Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Suite Française&quot;, Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot; and &quot;Gli uccelli&quot;, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Dance Suite from Keyboard Pieces by François Couperin&quot; and the related &quot;Divertimento after Keyboard Pieces by Couperin&quot;, Op. 86 (1923 and 1943, respectively). Starting around 1926 Béla Bartók&#x27;s music shows a marked increase in neoclassical traits, and a year or two later acknowledged Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary&quot; accomplishment in creating novel music by reviving old musical elements while at the same time naming his colleague Zoltán Kodály as another Hungarian adherent of neoclassicism.

A German strain of neoclassicism was developed by Paul Hindemith, who produced chamber music, orchestral works, and operas in a heavily contrapuntal, chromatically inflected style, best exemplified by &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot;. Roman Vlad contrasts the &quot;classicism&quot; of Stravinsky, which consists in the external forms and patterns of his works, with the &quot;classicality&quot; of Busoni, which represents an internal disposition and attitude of the artist towards works. Busoni wrote in a letter to Paul Bekker, &quot;By &#x27;Young Classicalism&#x27; I mean the mastery, the sifting and the turning to account of all the gains of previous experiments and their inclusion in strong and beautiful forms&quot;.

Neoclassicism found a welcome audience in Europe and America, as the school of Nadia Boulanger promulgated ideas about music based on her understanding of Stravinsky&#x27;s music. Boulanger taught and influenced over 600 musicians, including many notable composers, including Grażyna Bacewicz, Lennox Berkeley, Elliott Carter, Francis Chagrin, Aaron Copland, David Diamond, Irving Fine, Harold Shapero, Jean Françaix, Roy Harris, Igor Markevitch, Darius Milhaud, Astor Piazzolla, Walter Piston, Ned Rorem, and Virgil Thomson.

In Spain, Manuel de Falla&#x27;s neoclassical Concerto for Harpsichord, Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Violin, and Cello of 1926 was perceived as an expression of &quot;universalism&quot; (&quot;universalismo&quot;), broadly linked to an international, modernist aesthetic. In the first movement of the concerto, Falla quotes fragments of the fifteenth-century villancico &quot;De los álamos, vengo madre&quot;. He had similarly incorporated quotations from seventeenth-century music when he first embraced neoclassicism in the puppet-theatre piece &quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot; (1919–23), an adaptation from Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Later neoclassical compositions by Falla include the 1924 chamber cantata &quot;Psyché&quot; and incidental music for Pedro Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s, &quot;El gran teatro del mundo&quot;, written in 1927. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Roberto Gerhard composed in the neoclassical style, including his Concertino for Strings, the Wind Quintet, the cantata &quot;L&#x27;alta naixença del rei en Jaume&quot;, and the ballet &quot;Ariel&quot;. Other important Spanish neoclassical composers are found amongst the members of the Generación de la República (also known as the Generación del 27), including Julián Bautista, Fernando Remacha, Salvador Bacarisse, and Jesús Bal y Gay.

A neoclassical aesthetic was promoted in Italy by Alfredo Casella, who had been educated in Paris and continued to live there until 1915, when he returned to Italy to teach and organize concerts, introducing modernist composers such as Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg to the provincially minded Italian public. His neoclassical compositions were perhaps less important than his organizing activities, but especially representative examples include &quot;Scarlattiana&quot; of 1926, using motifs from Domenico Scarlatti&#x27;s keyboard sonatas, and the &quot;Concerto romano&quot; of the same year. Casella&#x27;s colleague Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco wrote neoclassically inflected works which hark back to early Italian music and classical models: the themes of his &quot;Concerto italiano&quot; in G minor of 1924 for violin and orchestra echo Vivaldi as well as sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italian folksongs, while his highly successful Guitar Concerto No. 1 in D of 1939 consciously follows Mozart&#x27;s concerto style.

Portuguese representatives of neoclassicism include two members of the &quot;Grupo de Quatro&quot;, Armando José Fernandes and Jorge Croner de Vasconcellos, both of whom studied with Nadia Boulanger.

In South America, neoclassicism was of particular importance in Argentina, where it differed from its European model in that it did not seek to redress recent stylistic upheavals which had simply not occurred in Latin America. Argentine composers associated with neoclassicism include Jacobo Ficher, , Luis Gianneo, and Juan José Castro. The most important twentieth-century Argentine composer, Alberto Ginastera, turned from nationalistic to neoclassical forms in the 1950s (e.g., Piano Sonata No. 1 and the &quot;Variaciones concertantes&quot;) before moving on to a style dominated by atonal and serial techniques. Roberto Caamaño, professor of Gregorian chant at the Institute of Sacred Music in Buenos Aires, employed a dissonant neoclassical style in some works and a serialist style in others.

Although the well-known &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; of Heitor Villa-Lobos (composed between 1930 and 1947) are cast in the form of Baroque suites, usually beginning with a prelude and ending with a fugal or toccata-like movement and employing neoclassical devices such as ostinato figures and long pedal notes, they were not intended so much as stylized recollections of the style of Bach as a free adaptation of Baroque harmonic and contrapuntal procedures to music in a Brazilian style. Brazilian composers of the generation after Villa-Lobos more particularly associated with neoclassicism include Radamés Gnattali (in his later works), Edino Krieger, and the prolific Camargo Guarnieri, who had contact with but did not study under Nadia Boulanger when he visited Paris in the 1920s. Neoclassical traits figure in Guarnieri&#x27;s music starting with the second movement of the Piano Sonatina of 1928, and are particularly notable in his five piano concertos.

The Chilean composer Domingo Santa Cruz Wilson was so strongly influenced by the German variety of neoclassicism that he became known as the &quot;Chilean Hindemith&quot;.

In Cuba, José Ardévol initiated a neoclassical school, though he himself moved on to a modernistic national style later in his career.

Even the atonal school, represented for example by Arnold Schoenberg, showed the influence of neoclassical ideas. After his early style of &#x27;Late Romanticism&#x27; (exemplified by his string sextet &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot;) had been supplanted by his Atonal period, and immediately before he embraced twelve-tone serialism, the forms of Schoenberg&#x27;s works after 1920, beginning with opp. 23, 24, and 25 (all composed at the same time), have been described as &quot;openly neoclassical&quot;, and represent an effort to integrate the advances of 1908 to 1913 with the inheritance of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Schoenberg attempted in those works to offer listeners structural points of reference with which they could identify, beginning with the Serenade, op. 24, and the Suite for piano, op. 25. Schoenberg&#x27;s pupil Alban Berg actually came to neoclassicism before his teacher, in his Three Pieces for Orchestra, op. 6 (1913–14), and the opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, which uses closed forms such as suite, passacaglia, and rondo as organizing principles within each scene. Anton Webern also achieved a sort of neoclassical style through an intense concentration on the motif. However, his 1935 orchestration of the six-part ricercar from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Musical Offering&quot; is not regarded as neoclassical because of its concentration on the fragmentation of instrumental colours.

<text>Arthur Chichester, 2nd Earl of Donegall, PC (Ire) (died 26 October 1678), was an Anglo-Irish politician and peer.

==Early life==
Chichester was the eldest son of Lady Mary Jones and Lieutenant Colonel John Chichester (1609–1647), of Dungannon, County Tyrone, who was MP for Dungannon and fought in the English Civil War. Among his siblings were younger brother, the Hon. John Chichester, and Elizabeth Chichester (wife of Sir John Cole, 1st Baronet). After his father&#x27;s death, his mother married Col. Christopher Copley of Wadworth.

His father was a younger brother of Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall, both sons of Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester, and Anne Coplestone (a daughter of John Coplestone). His maternal grandfather was Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh.

==Career==

He was knighted at Whitehall in 1660, and served in the Irish House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Dungannon (1661–1666). He was also made an Irish Privy Counsellor in 1672.

In 1675, Chichester succeeded his uncle as second Earl of Donegall, inheriting the title under the special remainder granted with it to the male heirs of his grandfather, Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester. He was Custos Rotulorum for County Antrim and Governor of Carrickfergus for twelve years before dying in Ireland in 1678. His wife survived him and remarried.

==Personal life==
Chichester married Jane Ichyngham, daughter of John Ichyngham of Dunbrody, County Wexford, a descendant of Sir Edward Echyngham (died 1527) of Barsham, Suffolk.

* Arthur Chichester, 3rd Earl of Donegall (1666–1706), a Maj.-Gen. who married Lady Barbara Boyle, daughter of Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery, and Lady Margaret Howard (a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Suffolk), before 1682. After her death, he married Lady Catherine Forbes, daughter of Arthur Forbes, 1st Earl of Granard, and Catherine Newcomen (daughter of Sir Robert Newcomen), in 1685. He was killed in action at Fort Montjuïc on 20 April 1706.
* Lady Jane Chichester, who married Dacre Barrett.
* John Chichester, who lived at Dunbrody, County Wexford.
* Edward Chichester, the Rector at Clonenagh who married Elizabeth Chichester, daughter of Capt. John Chichester.
* Lady Mary Chichester, who married Sir Robert Newcomen, 6th Baronet, son of Sir Thomas Newcomen, 5th Baronet. 

Lord Donegall died on 26 October 1678 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Arthur.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Lady Jane, he was a grandfather of Richard Barrett (1682–1716), who married Anne Lennard, Baroness Dacre, parents of Thomas Barrett-Lennard, 17th Baron Dacre.
