<text>The term &quot;United States,&quot; when used in the geographic sense, refers to the contiguous United States (sometimes referred to as the Lower 48, including the District of Columbia not as a state), Alaska, Hawaii, the five insular territories of Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and minor outlying possessions. The United States shares land borders with Canada and Mexico and maritime borders with Russia, Cuba, the Bahamas, and many other countries, mainly in the Caribbeanin addition to Canada and Mexico. The northern border of the United States with Canada is the world&#x27;s longest bi-national land border.

==Area==
From 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as (land and inland water only). The listed total area changed to in 1997 (Great Lakes area and coastal waters added), to in 2004, to in 2006, and to in 2007 (territorial waters added). Currently, the CIA &quot;World Factbook&quot; gives , the United Nations Statistics Division gives , and the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; gives (Great Lakes area included but not coastal waters). These sources consider only the 50 states and the Federal District and exclude overseas territories. The US has the 2nd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of .

By total area (water as well as land), the United States is either slightly larger or smaller than the People&#x27;s Republic of China, making it the world&#x27;s third or fourth-largest country. Both countries are smaller than Russia and Canada in total area but are larger than Brazil. By land area only (exclusive of waters), the United States is the world&#x27;s third largest country, after Russia and China, with Canada in fourth. Whether the US or China is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors: (1) the validity of China&#x27;s claim on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract (both these territories are also claimed by India, so are not counted); and (2) how the US calculates its surface area. Since the initial publishing of the World Factbook, the CIA has updated the total area of the United States several times.

==General characteristics==


The United States shares land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, a territorial water border with Russia in the northwest, and two territorial water borders in the southeast between Florida and Cuba, and Florida and the Bahamas. The contiguous 48 states are otherwise bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest, the Bering Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north; Hawaii lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.

Forty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and Mexico. This group is referred to, with varying precision and formality, as the &quot;contiguous United States&quot;, and as the &quot;Lower 48&quot;. Alaska, which is included in the term &quot;continental United States&quot;, is located at the northwestern end of North America.

The nation&#x27;s capital city, Washington, D.C., was established in 1800 after being relocated there from Philadelphia. It was established as a federal district located on land donated by the state of Maryland; Virginia also donated land, but it was returned in 1849. The United States also has overseas territories with varying levels of autonomy and organization, including the Caribbean territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, formerly known as the Danish Virgin Islands and purchased by the United States at the beginning of World War II, the Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, and several uninhabited island territories. Some of the territories acquired were part of the territorial evolution of the United States or a product of the nation&#x27;s effort to gain access to the east.

Nearly all of the United States is in the Northern Hemisphere with the exception of American Samoa and Jarvis Island.

==Physiographic divisions==
Within the continental U.S. there are eight distinct physiographic divisions. These major divisions are:

* Laurentian Upland – part of the Canadian Shield that extends into the northern United States Great Lakes area.
* Atlantic Plain – the coastal regions of the eastern and southern parts include the continental shelf, the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast.
* Appalachian Highlands – lying on the eastern side of the United States, it includes the Appalachian Mountains, the Watchung Mountains, the Adirondacks and New England province originally containing the Great Eastern Forest, a stretch of mixed temperature and subtropical montane forests, some of which are rainforests.
* Interior Plains – part of the interior continental United States, it includes the Great Plains, as well as a number of highland and mountainous regions, like the Black Hills, dense cave systems, painted hills and badland features.
* Interior Highlands – also part of the interior continental United States, this division includes the Ozark Plateau, the Ouachita Mountains, and other smaller mountain systems. This region is located largely in the warm temperate/subtropical moist and dry forest biomes.
* Rocky Mountain System – one branch of the American Cordillera system lying far inland in the western states.
* Intermontane Plateaus – also divided into the Columbia Plateau, the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Province, it is a system of plateaus, basins, ranges and gorges between the Rocky and Pacific Mountain Systems. It is the setting for the Grand Canyon, the Great Basin and Death Valley.
* Pacific Mountain System – the coastal mountain ranges and features in the west coast of the United States.

The eastern United States has a varied topography. A broad, flat coastal plain lines the Atlantic and Gulf shores from the Texas-Mexico border to New York City, and includes the Florida peninsula. This broad coastal plain and barrier islands make up the widest and longest beaches in the United States, much of it composed of soft, white sands. The Florida Keys are a string of coral islands that reach the southernmost city on the United States mainland at Key West in South Florida.

Areas further inland feature rolling hills, mountains, and a diverse collection of temperate and subtropical moist and wet forests. Parts of interior Florida and South Carolina are also home to sandhill communities. The Appalachian Mountains form a line of low mountains separating the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basins. New England features rocky seacoasts and rugged mountains with peaks up to 6,200 feet and valleys dotted with rivers and streams. Offshore islands dot the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 6,622 km² of tidal flats in the United States, making it the 4th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

The five Great Lakes are located in the north-central portion of the country, four of them forming part of the border with Canada; only Lake Michigan is situated entirely within the United States. The southeast United States, generally stretching from the Ohio River southwards, includes a variety of warm temperate and subtropical moist and wet forests, as well as warm temperate and subtropical dry forests nearer the Great Plains in the west of the region. West of the Appalachians lies the lush Mississippi River basin and two large eastern tributaries, the Ohio River and the Tennessee River. The Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the Midwest consist largely of rolling hills, interior highlands and small mountains, jungle-like marsh and swampland near the Ohio River, and productive farmland, stretching south to the Gulf Coast. The Midwest also has a vast amount of cave systems.

The Great Plains lie west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains. A large portion of the country&#x27;s agricultural products are grown in the Great Plains. Before their general conversion to farmland, the Great Plains were noted for their extensive grasslands, from tallgrass prairie in the eastern plains to shortgrass steppe in the western High Plains. Elevation rises gradually from less than a few hundred feet near the Mississippi River to more than a mile high in the High Plains. The generally low relief of the plains is broken in several places, most notably in the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which form the U.S. Interior Highlands, the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.

The Great Plains come to an abrupt end at the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains form a large portion of the Western U.S., entering from Canada and stretching nearly to Mexico. The Rocky Mountain region is the highest region of the United States by average elevation. The Rocky Mountains generally contain fairly mild slopes and wider peaks compared to some of the other great mountain ranges, with a few exceptions, including the Teton Range in Wyoming and the Sawatch Range in Colorado. The highest peaks of the Rockies are found in Colorado, the tallest peak being Mount Elbert at . Instead of being one generally continuous and solid mountain range, it is broken up into several smaller intermittent mountain ranges, forming a large series of basins and valleys.

West of the Rocky Mountains lies the Intermontane Plateaus, also known as the Intermountain West, a large, arid desert lying between the Rockies and the Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges. The large southern portion, known as the Great Basin, consists of salt flats, drainage basins, and many small north–south mountain ranges. The Southwest is predominantly a low-lying desert region. A portion known as the Colorado Plateau, centered around the Four Corners region, is considered to have some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. It is accentuated in such national parks as Grand Canyon, Arches, Mesa Verde and Bryce Canyon, among others. Other smaller Intermontane areas include the Columbia Plateau, which covers eastern Washington state, western Idaho and northeast Oregon and the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho.

The Intermontane Plateaus come to an end at the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada. The Cascades consist of largely intermittent, volcanic mountains, many rising prominently from the surrounding landscape. The Sierra Nevada, further south, is a high, rugged, and dense mountain range. It contains the highest point in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney (). It is located at the boundary between California&#x27;s Inyo and Tulare counties, just west-northwest of the lowest point in North America at the Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park at below sea level. These areas contain some spectacular scenery as well, as evidenced by such national parks as Yosemite and Mount Rainier. West of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada is a series of valleys, such as the Central Valley in California and the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Along the coast is a series of low mountain ranges known as the Pacific Coast Ranges.

Alaska contains some of the most dramatic scenery in the country. Tall, prominent mountain ranges rise up sharply from broad, flat tundra plains. On the islands off the south and southwest coast are many volcanoes. Hawaii, far to the south of Alaska in the Pacific Ocean, is a chain of tropical, volcanic islands, popular as a tourist destination for many from East Asia and the mainland United States.

The territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands encompass a number of tropical isles in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. In the Pacific Ocean the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands occupy the limestone and volcanic isles of the Mariana archipelago, and American Samoa (the only populated US territory in the southern hemisphere) encompasses volcanic peaks and coral atolls in the eastern part of the Samoan Islands chain.

The Atlantic coast of the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast–southwest trend to crustal deformations which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian Mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea.

While the Atlantic coast is relatively low, the Pacific coast is, with few exceptions, hilly or mountainous. This coast has been defined chiefly by geologically recent crustal deformations, and hence still preserves a greater relief than that of the Atlantic. The low Atlantic coast and the hilly or mountainous Pacific coast foreshadow the leading features in the distribution of mountains within the United States.

The east coast Appalachian system, originally forest covered, is relatively low and narrow and is bordered on the southeast and south by an important coastal plain. The Cordilleran system on the western side of the continent is lofty, broad and complicated, having two branches, the Rocky Mountain System and the Pacific Mountain System. In between these mountain systems lie the Intermontane Plateaus. Both the Columbia River and Colorado River rise far inland near the easternmost members of the Cordilleran system, and flow through plateaus and intermontane basins to the ocean. Heavy forests cover the northwest coast, but elsewhere trees are found only on the higher ranges below the Alpine region. The intermontane valleys, plateaus and basins range from treeless to desert with the most arid region being in the southwest.

The Laurentian Highlands, the Interior Plains and the Interior Highlands lie between the two coasts, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico northward, far beyond the national boundary, to the Arctic Ocean. The central plains are divided by a hardly perceptible height of land into a Canadian and a United States portion. It is from the United States side that the great Mississippi system discharges southward to the Gulf of Mexico. The upper Mississippi and some of the Ohio basin is the semi-arid prairie region, with trees originally only along the watercourses. The uplands towards the Appalachians were included in the great eastern forested area, while the western part of the plains has an arid climate supporting only scanty native plant life, and in the south, it is practically barren.

Elevation extremes:
*Lowest point: Death Valley, Inyo County, California 
*Highest point: Denali/Mount McKinley, Denali Borough, Alaska 

==Climate==

Due to its large size and wide range of geographic features, the United States contains examples of nearly every global climate. The climate is subtropical in the Southern United States, continental in the north, tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida, polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great Plains west of the 100th meridian, Mediterranean in coastal California and arid in the Great Basin and the Southwest. Its comparatively favorable agricultural climate contributed (in part) to the country&#x27;s rise as a world power, with infrequent severe drought in the major agricultural regions, a general lack of widespread flooding, and a mainly temperate climate that receives adequate precipitation.

The main influence on U.S. weather is the polar jet stream which migrates northward into Canada in the summer months, and then southward into the US in the winter months. The jet stream brings in large low-pressure systems from the northern Pacific Ocean that enters the US mainland over the Pacific Northwest. The Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains pick up most of the moisture from these systems as they move eastward via the orographic effect, and they are greatly diminished by the time they reach the High Plains.

Once they move over the Great Plains, uninterrupted flat land allows them to reorganize and can lead to major clashes of air masses. In addition, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is often drawn northward. When combined with a powerful jet stream, this can lead to violent thunderstorms, especially during spring and summer. Sometimes during winter, these storms can combine with another low-pressure system as they move up the East Coast and into the Atlantic Ocean, where they intensify rapidly.
These storms are known as Nor&#x27;easters and often bring widespread, heavy rain, wind, and snowfall to New England. The uninterrupted grasslands of the Great Plains also lead to some of the most extreme climate swings in the world. Temperatures can rise or drop rapidly, winds can be extreme, and the flow of heat waves or Arctic air masses often advance uninterrupted through the plains.

The Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (the Intermontane Plateaus) are arid or semiarid regions that lie in the rain shadow of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Precipitation averages less than . The Southwest is a hot desert, with temperatures exceeding for several weeks at a time in summer. The Southwest and the Great Basin are also affected by the monsoon from the Gulf of California from July to September, which brings localized but often severe thunderstorms to the region.

Much of California consists of a Mediterranean climate, with sometimes excessive rainfall from October–April and nearly no rain the rest of the year. In the Pacific Northwest rain falls year-round but is much heavier during winter and spring. The mountains of the west receive abundant precipitation and very heavy snowfall. The Cascades are one of the snowiest places in the world, with some places averaging over of snow annually, but the lower elevations closer to the coast receive very little snow.

Florida has a subtropical climate in the northern part of the state and a tropical climate in the southern part of the state. Summers are wet and winters are dry in Florida. Annually, much of Florida and the deep southern states is frost-free. The mild winters of Florida allow a massive tropical fruit industry to thrive in the central part of the state, making the US second to only Brazil in citrus production worldwide.

Another significant (but localized) weather effect is lake-effect snow that falls south and east of the Great Lakes, especially in the hilly portions of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and on the Tug Hill Plateau in New York. The lake effect dumped well over of snow in the area of Buffalo, New York throughout the 2006–2007 winter. The Wasatch Front and Wasatch Range in Utah can also receive significant lake effect accumulations from the Great Salt Lake.

===Extremes===
In northern Alaska, tundra and arctic conditions predominate, and the temperature has fallen as low as . On the other end of the spectrum, Death Valley, California once reached , the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth.

On average, the mountains of the western states receive the highest levels of snowfall on Earth. The greatest annual snowfall level is at Mount Rainier in Washington, at ; the record there was in the winter of 1971–72. This record was broken by the Mt. Baker Ski Area in northwestern Washington which reported of snowfall for the 1998–99 snowfall season. Other places with significant snowfall outside the Cascade Range are the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, and the Sierra Nevada in California.

In the east, the region near the Great Lakes and the mountains of the Northeast receive the most snowfall, although they do not near snowfall levels in the western United States. Along the northwestern Pacific coast, rainfall is greater than anywhere else in the continental U.S., with Quinault Rainforest in Washington having an average of . Hawaii receives even more, with measured annually in the Big Bog, in Maui. Pago Pago Harbor in American Samoa is the rainiest harbor in the world (because of the 523 meter Rainmaker Mountain). The Mojave Desert, in the southwest, is home to the driest locale in the U.S. Yuma, Arizona, has an average of of precipitation each year.

In central portions of the U.S., tornadoes are more common than anywhere else on Earth and touch down most commonly in the spring and summer. Deadly and destructive hurricanes occur almost every year along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. The Appalachian region and the Midwest experience the worst floods, though virtually no area in the U.S. is immune to flooding. The Southwest has the worst droughts; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have hurt Ancestral Pueblo peoples. The West is affected by large wildfires each year.

==Natural disasters==
The United States is affected by a variety of natural disasters yearly. Although drought is rare, it has occasionally caused major disruption, such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942). Farmland failed throughout the Plains, entire regions were substantially depopulated, and dust storms ravaged the land.

===Tornadoes and hurricanes===
According to a 2023 Gallup survey, around one in three Americans said that they directly experienced a severe weather condition over the previous two years. The Great Plains and Midwest, due to the contrasting air masses, see frequent severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks during spring and summer with around 1,000 tornadoes occurring each year. The strip of land from north Texas north to Kansas and Nebraska and east into Tennessee is known as Tornado Alley, where many houses have tornado shelters and many towns have tornado sirens, due to the very frequent tornado formation in the region.

Hurricanes are another natural disaster found in the US, which can hit anywhere along the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast as well as Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Particularly at risk are the central and southern Texas coasts, the area from southeastern Louisiana east to the Florida Panhandle, peninsular Florida, and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, although any portion of the coast could be struck. The U.S. territories and possessions in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are also vulnerable to hurricanes due to their location in the Caribbean Sea.

Hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with a peak from mid-August through early October. Some of the more devastating hurricanes have included the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria in 2017.

Hurricanes (known as cyclones in the Pacific Ocean) fail to make landfall on the Pacific Coast of the United States due to water temperatures being too cool to sustain them. However, the remnants of tropical cyclones from the Eastern Pacific occasionally impact the western United States, bringing moderate to heavy rainfall.

===Flooding===
Occasional severe flooding is experienced in the United States. Significant floods throughout history include the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Great Flood of 1993, and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982–83 El Niño event in the western United States. Flooding is still prevalent, mostly on the Eastern Coast, during hurricanes or other inclement weather, for example in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy devastated the region. Localized flooding can, however, occur anywhere, and mudslides from heavy rain can cause problems in any mountainous area, particularly the Southwest. Large stretches of desert shrub in the west can fuel the spread of wildfires. The narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the summer lead to flash floods as well, which can sometimes be devastating, while nor&#x27;easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt throughout the Northeast (although heavy snowstorms can occur almost anywhere).

===Geologic===
The West Coast of the continental United States makes up part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of heavy tectonic and volcanic activity that is the source of 90% of the world&#x27;s earthquakes. The American Northwest sees the highest concentration of active volcanoes in the United States, in Washington, Oregon and northern California along the Cascade Mountains. There are several active volcanoes located in the islands of Hawaii, including Kilauea in ongoing eruption since 1983, but they do not typically adversely affect the inhabitants of the islands. There has not been a major life-threatening eruption on the Hawaiian Islands since the 17th century. Volcanic eruptions can occasionally be devastating, such as in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington.

The Ring of Fire makes California and southern Alaska particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Earthquakes can cause extensive damage, such as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake or the 1964 Good Friday earthquake near Anchorage, Alaska. California is well known for seismic activity and requires large structures to be earthquake resistant to minimize loss of life and property. Outside of devastating earthquakes, California experiences minor earthquakes on a regular basis.

There have been about 100 significant earthquakes annually from 2010 to 2012. Past averages were 21 a year. This is believed to be due to the deep disposal of wastewater from fracking. None have exceeded a magnitude of 5.6, and no one has been killed.

===Other natural disasters===
Other natural disasters include tsunamis around the Pacific Basin, mudslides in California, and forest fires in the western half of the contiguous U.S. Although drought is relatively rare, it has occasionally caused major economic and social disruption, such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942), which resulted in widespread crop failures and dust storms, beginning in the southern Great Plains and reaching to the Atlantic Ocean.

=== Consequences ===
According to report by U.S. Census Bureau, in 2022 natural disasters led to the forced displacement of 3.3 million people, more than 1.3% of the U.S. adult population, with half of the displacements being caused by the hurricanes. The survey-report stated that in Florida, the devastation caused by Hurricanes Ian and Nicole resulted in the relocation of around 1 million people, or about one in every 17 adult residents. In Louisiana, where inhabitants were still dealing with the devastating results of Hurricane Ida the year before, more than 409,000 people, or almost one in every eight residents, were moved. Despite this, the Louisiana state saw a relatively calm hurricane season in 2022.

<doc id="32021" wikidata="Q330963" url="?curid=32021" title="Politics of the United States">
<text>In the United States, politics functions within a framework of a constitutional federal republic. The three distinct branches share powers: the U.S. Congress which forms the legislative branch, a bicameral legislative body comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate; the executive branch, which is headed by the president of the United States, who serves as the country&#x27;s head of state and government; and the judicial branch, composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, and which exercises judicial power.

Each of the 50 individual state governments has the power to make laws within its jurisdiction that are not granted to the federal government nor denied to the states in the U.S. Constitution. Each state also has a constitution following the pattern of the federal constitution but differing in details. Each has three branches: an executive branch headed by a governor, a legislative body, and a judicial branch. At the local level, governments are found in counties or county-equivalents, and beneath them individual municipalities, townships, school districts, and special districts.

Officials are popularly elected at the federal, state and local levels, with the major exception being the President, who is instead elected indirectly by the people through the Electoral College. American politics is dominated by two parties which since the American Civil War have been the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, although other parties have run candidates. Since the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party has generally supported left-leaning policies, while the Republican Party has generally supported right-leaning ones. Both parties have no formal central organization at the national level that controls membership, elected officials or political policies; thus, each party has traditionally had factions and individuals that deviated from party positions. Almost all public officials in America are elected from single-member districts and win office by winning a plurality of votes cast (i.e. more than any other candidate, but not necessarily a majority). Suffrage is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older, with the notable exception of registered felons in some states.

==Federal government==

The United States is a constitutional federal republic, in which the president (the head of state and head of government), Congress, and judiciary share powers reserved to the national government, and the federal government shares sovereignty with the state governments.

The federal government is divided into three branches, as per the specific terms articulated in the U.S. Constitution:

* The executive branch is headed by the president and is independent of the legislature. 
* Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of Congress: the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
* The judicial branch (or judiciary), composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, exercises judicial power. The judiciary&#x27;s function is to interpret the United States Constitution and federal laws and regulations. This includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches.

The federal government&#x27;s layout is explained in the Constitution. Two political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, have dominated American politics since the American Civil War, although other parties have existed.

There are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of many other developed countries, including:

* an upper legislative house (the Senate), with far more power than is found in equivalent bodies in most other countries;
* a Supreme Court that also has a wider scope of power than is found in most countries; 
* a separation of powers between the legislature and the executive; and 
* a political landscape dominated by only two main parties. The United States is one of the world&#x27;s only developed countries where all additional parties have minimal or nonexistent influence and almost no representation at the national and state level. Causes for this mainly focus on the plurality-based first-past-the-post voting system, used in most elections, which encourages strategic voting and discourages vote splitting. This also results in both major parties having multiple internal factions.

The federal entity created by the U.S. Constitution is the dominant feature of the American governmental system, as citizens are also subject to a state government and various units of local government (such as counties, municipalities, and special districts).

==State government==

State governments have the power to make laws on all subjects that are not granted to the federal government nor denied to the states in the U.S. Constitution. These include education, family law, contract law, and most crimes. Unlike the federal government, which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitution.

Like the federal government, state governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The chief executive of a state is its popularly elected governor, who typically holds office for a four-year term (although in some states the term is two years). Except for Nebraska, which has unicameral legislature, all states have a bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the Senate and the lower house called the House of Representatives, the Assembly or something similar. In most states, senators serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year terms.

The constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution, including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government, and are generally more detailed.

At the state and local level, the process of initiatives and referendums allow citizens to place new legislation on a popular ballot, or to place legislation that has recently been passed by a legislature on a ballot for a popular vote. Initiatives and referendums, along with recall elections and popular primary elections, are signature reforms of the Progressive Era; they are written into several state constitutions, particularly in the Western states, but not found at the federal level.
==Local government==
The United States Census Bureau conducts the Census of Governments every five years, categorizing four types of local governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state:

# County governments
# Town or township governments
# Municipal governments
# Special-purpose local governments, including both school districts and other special districts

In 2010, there were 89,500 total local governments, including 3,033 counties, 19,492 municipalities, 16,500 townships, 13,000 school districts, and 37,000 other special districts. Local governments directly serve the needs of the people, providing everything from police and fire protection to sanitary codes, health regulations, education, public transportation, and housing. Typically local elections are nonpartisan — local activists suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing.

===County government===
The county is the administrative subdivision of the state, authorized by state constitutions and statutes. The county equivalents in Louisiana are called parishes, while those in Alaska are called boroughs.

The specific governmental powers of counties vary widely between the states. In some states, mainly in New England, they are primarily used as judicial districts. In other states, counties have broad powers in housing, education, transportation and recreation. County government has been eliminated throughout Connecticut, Rhode Island, and in parts of Massachusetts; while the Unorganized Borough area of Alaska (which makes up about a half of the area of the state) does not operate under a county-level government at all. In areas that do not have any county governmental function and are simply a division of land, services are provided either by lower level townships or municipalities, or the state.

Counties may contain a number of cities, towns, villages, or hamlets. Some cities—including Philadelphia, Honolulu, San Francisco, Nashville, and Denver—are consolidated city-counties, where the municipality and the county have been merged into a unified, coterminous jurisdiction—that is to say, these counties consist in their entirety of a single municipality whose city government also operates as the county government. Some counties, such as Arlington County, Virginia, do not have any additional subdivisions. Some states contain independent cities that are not part of any county; although it may still function as if it was a consolidated city-county, an independent city was legally separated from any county. Some municipalities are in multiple counties; New York City is uniquely partitioned into five boroughs that are each coterminous with a county.

In most U.S. counties, one town or city is designated as the county seat, and this is where the county government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meets. In small counties, boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors represent separate districts or townships. The board collects taxes for state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and county welfare programs. In very small counties, the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a sole commissioner, who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections.

===Town or township governments===
Town or township governments are organized local governments authorized in the state constitutions and statutes of 20 Northeastern and Midwestern states, established as minor civil divisions to provide general government for a geographic subdivision of a county where there is no municipality.
In New York, Wisconsin and New England, these county subdivisions are called &quot;towns&quot;.

In many other states, the term &quot;town&quot; does not have any specific meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities). Moreover, in some states, the term town is equivalent to how civil townships are used in other states.

Like counties, the specific responsibilities to townships vary based on each state. Many states grant townships some governmental powers, making them civil townships, either independently or as a part of the county government. In others, survey townships are non-governmental. Towns in the six New England states and townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are included in this category by the Census Bureau, despite the fact that they are legally municipal corporations, since their structure has no necessary relation to concentration of population, which is typical of municipalities elsewhere in the United States. In particular, towns in New England have considerably more power than most townships elsewhere and often function as legally equivalent to cities, typically exercising the full range of powers that are divided between counties, townships, and cities in other states.

Township functions are generally overseen by a governing board, whose name also varies from state to state.

=== Municipal governments ===
Municipal governments are organized local governments authorized in state constitutions and statutes, established to provide general government for a defined area, generally corresponding to a population center rather than one of a set of areas into which a county is divided. The category includes those governments designated as cities, boroughs (except in Alaska), towns (except in Minnesota and Wisconsin), and villages. This concept corresponds roughly to the &quot;incorporated places&quot; that are recognized in by the U.S. Census Bureau, although the Census Bureau excludes New England towns from their statistics for this category, and the count of municipal governments excludes places that are governmentally inactive.

About 28 percent of Americans live in cities of 100,000 or more population. Types of city governments vary widely across the nation. Almost all have a central council, elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various department heads, to manage the city&#x27;s affairs. Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politics.

There are three general types of municipal government: the mayor-council, the commission, and the council-manager. These are the pure forms; many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them.

==== Mayor-council ====

This is the oldest form of city government in the United States and, until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all American cities. Its structure is like that of the state and national governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch. The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials (sometimes with the approval of the council), has the power to veto over ordinances (the laws of the city), and often is responsible for preparing the city&#x27;s budget. The council passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions money among the various city departments. As cities have grown, council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood.

==== Commission ====
This combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials, usually three or more in number, elected city-wide. Each commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments. Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operated. One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor, although their power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners.

==== Council-manager ====
The city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials. The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a highly trained and experienced professional city manager.

The council-manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities. Under this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city manager, to carry out its decisions. The manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments. Usually, there is no set term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with their work.

=== Unincorporated areas ===
Some states contain unincorporated areas, which are areas of land not governed by any local authorities below that at the county level. Residents of unincorporated areas only need to pay taxes to the county, state and federal governments as opposed to the municipal government as well. A notable example of this is Paradise, Nevada, an unincorporated area where many of the casinos commonly associated with Las Vegas are situated.

=== Special-purpose local governments ===
In addition to general-purpose government entities legislating at the state, county, and city level, special-purpose areas may exist as well, provide one or more specific services that are not being supplied by other existing governments. School districts are organized local entities providing public elementary and secondary education which, under state law, have sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments.

Special districts are authorized by state law to provide designated functions as established in the district&#x27;s charter or other founding document, and with sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments; known by a variety of titles, including districts, authorities, boards, commissions, etc., as specified in the enabling state legislation.

== Unincorporated territories ==
The United States possesses a number of unincorporated territories, including 16 island territories across the globe. These are areas of land which are not under the jurisdiction of any state, and do not have a government established by Congress through an organic act. Citizens of these territories can vote for members of their own local governments, and some can also elect representatives to serve in Congress—though they only have observer status. The unincorporated territories of the U.S. include the permanently inhabited territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; as well as minor outlying islands such as Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, Navassa Island, Palmyra Atoll, Wake Island, and others. American Samoa is the only territory with a native resident population and is governed by a local authority. Despite the fact that an organic act was not passed in Congress, American Samoa established its own constitution in 1967, and has self governed ever since. Seeking statehood or independence is often debated in US territories, such as in Puerto Rico, but even if referendums on these issues are held, congressional approval is needed for changes in status to take place.

The citizenship status of residents in US unincorporated territories has caused concern for their ability to influence and participate in the politics of the United States. In recent decades, the Supreme Court has established voting as a fundamental right of US citizens, even though residents of territories do not hold full voting rights. Despite this, residents must still abide by federal laws that they cannot equitably influence, as well as register for the national Selective Service System, which has led some scholars to argue that residents of territories are essentially second-class citizens. The legal justifications for these discrepancies stem from the Insular Cases, which were a series of 1901 Supreme Court cases that some consider to be reflective of imperialism and racist views held in the United States. Unequal access to political participation in US territories has also been criticized for affecting US citizens who move to territories, as such an action requires forfeiting the full voting rights that they would have held in the 50 states.

==Elections==


As in the United Kingdom and in other similar parliamentary systems, in the U.S. Americans eligible to vote, vote for an individual candidate (there are sometimes exceptions in local government elections) and not a party list. The U.S. government being a federal government, officials are elected at the federal (national), state and local levels. All members of Congress, and the offices at the state and local levels are directly elected, but the president is elected indirectly, by an Electoral College whose electors represent their state and are elected by popular vote. (Before the Seventeenth Amendment was passed, Senators were also elected indirectly, by state legislatures.) These presidential electors were originally expected to exercise their own judgement. In modern practice, though, the electors are chosen by their party and pledged to vote for that party&#x27;s presidential candidate (in rare occurrences they may violate their pledge, becoming a faithless elector).

Both federal and state laws regulate elections. The United States Constitution defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are held, in Article One and Article Two and various amendments. State law regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state&#x27;s electoral college, and the running of state and local elections.

=== Suffrage ===
Who has the right to vote in the United States is regulated by the Constitution and federal and state laws. Suffrage is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older. Voting rights are sometimes restricted as a result of felony conviction, depending on the state.

The District, and other U.S. holdings like Puerto Rico and Guam, do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areas and can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of Representatives.
All states and the District of Columbia contribute to the electoral vote for president.

===Campaign finance===
Successful participation, especially in federal elections, often requires large amounts of money, especially for television advertising. This money can be very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base, although appeals for small donations over the Internet have been successful. Opponents of campaign finance laws allege they interfere with the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of free speech. Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other developed democracies such as the United Kingdom, France or Canada.

==Political parties, pressure groups==
===Political parties===


;Background
The United States Constitution never formally addressed the issue of political parties, primarily because the Founding Fathers opposed them. Nevertheless, parties—specifically, two competing parties in a &quot;two-party system&quot;—have been a fundamental part of American politics since shortly after George Washington&#x27;s presidency.

In partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as independents. Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated and thus eligible to appear on a given election ballot. Major party candidates are typically formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas candidates from minor parties and Independent candidates must complete a petitioning process.

The current two-party system in the United States is made up of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These two parties have won every United States presidential election since 1852 and have controlled the United States Congress since at least 1856. From time to time, a third party, such as the Green and Libertarian Parties, has achieved some minor representation at the national and state levels.

Since the Great Depression and the New Deal, and increasingly since the 1960s, the Democratic Party has generally positioned itself as a center-left party, while the Republican Party has generally positioned itself as center-right; there are other factions within each.

===Party organization===

Unlike in many other countries, the major political parties in America have no strong central organization that determines party positions and policies, rewards loyal members and officials, or expels rebels. A party committee or convention may endorse a candidate for office, but deciding who will be the party&#x27;s candidate in the general election is usually done in primaries open to voters who register as Democrats or Republicans. Furthermore, elected officials who fail to &quot;toe the party line&quot; because of constituent opposition said line and &quot;cross the aisle&quot; to vote with the opposition have (relatively) little to fear from their party.

Parties have state or federal committees that act as hubs for fundraising and campaigning (see Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee) and separate campaign committees that work to elect candidates at a specific level but do not direct candidates or their campaigns. In presidential elections, the party&#x27;s candidate serves as the de facto party leader, whose popularity or lack thereof helps or hinders candidates further down the ballot. Midterm elections are usually considered a referendum on the sitting president&#x27;s performance.

Some (e.g., Lee Drutman and Daniel J. Hopkins before 2018) argue that, in the 21st century, along with becoming overtly partisan, American politics has become overly focused on national issues and &quot;nationalized&quot; that even local offices, formerly dealing with local matters, now often mention the presidential election.

====Two-party system====
&quot;Third&quot; political parties have appeared from time to time in American history but seldom lasted more than a decade. They have sometimes been the vehicle of an individual (Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Bull Moose&quot; party, Ross Perot&#x27;s Reform Party); had considerable strength in particular regions (Socialist Party, the Farmer-Labor Party, Wisconsin Progressive Party, Conservative Party of New York State, and the Populist Party); or continued to run candidates for office to publicize some issue despite seldom winning even local elections (Libertarian Party, Natural Law Party, Peace and Freedom Party).

Factors reinforcing the two-party system include:
* The traditional American electoral format of single-member districts where the candidate with the most votes wins (known as the &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system), which according to Duverger&#x27;s law favors the two-party system. This is in contrast to multi-seat electoral districts and proportional representation found in some other democracies.
* The 19th-century innovation of printing &quot;party tickets&quot; to pass out to prospective voters to cast in ballot boxes (originally, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported) &quot;consolidated the power of the major parties&quot;.
* Printed party &quot;tickets&quot; (ballots) were eventually replaced by uniform ballots provided by the state when states began to adopt the Australian Secret Ballot Method. This gave state legislatures—dominated by Democrats and Republicans—the opportunity to hinder new rising parties with ballot access laws requiring a large number of petition signatures from citizens and giving the petitioners a short amount of time to gather the signatures.

===Political pressure groups===
Special-interest groups advocate the cause of their specific constituency. Business organizations, for example, will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions on the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for collective bargaining. Other private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are more concerned about broader policy issues affecting their organizations or beliefs.

One type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the political action committee or PAC. These are independent groups organized around a single issue or set of issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for United States Congress or the presidency. PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal elections. There are no restrictions on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office. As of 2008, 4,292 PACs were operating in the U.S..

The number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies. Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizens. Since many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens&#x27; dollars, time, and passion.

The amount of money these special interest groups spend continues to grow as campaigns become increasingly expensive. Many Americans feel that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions, or PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences.

A survey of members of the American Economic Association (i.e., the Association of Professional Economists) found the vast majority—regardless of political affiliation—felt the prevalence and influence of special interest groups in the political process led to benefits for the special interest groups and politicians at the expense of society as a whole.

==== Religious groups ====
Despite the First Amendment of the constitution&#x27;s Establishment Clause (&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion ...&quot;), for historical and demographic reasons, religious groups (primarily Christian groups) have frequently become political pressure groups and they have also become parts of political coalitions. In recent decades, conservative evangelicals have been particularly active within the broader Republican Party. This influence has often translated into the passing of laws related to morality and personal conduct. State alcohol and gambling laws, for example, are more restrictive in states with a higher percentage of conservative Christians.

==History, development and evolution==
===American political culture===
====Colonial origins====
The American political culture is rooted in the colonial experience and the American Revolution. The colonies were unique within the European world for their (relatively) widespread suffrage which was granted to white male property owners, and the relative power and activity of the elected bodies which they could vote for. These dealt with land grants, commercial subsidies, taxation, the oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools. Courts, (private lawsuits were very common) also provided Americans with experience in public affairs and law, and gave interest groups such as
merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers, etc. control over matters left to the royal court, aristocratic families and the established church in Great Britain. Finally, Americans were interested in the political values of Republicanism, which celebrated equal rights, civic virtue, and abhorred corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.

====Concepts of the Founding Fathers====
Two pivotal political ideas in the establishment of the United States were Republicanism and classical liberalism. Central documents of American thought include: the Declaration of Independence (1776), the Constitution (1787), the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers (1787–1790s), the Bill of Rights (1791), and Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Gettysburg Address&quot; (1863).

Among the core tenets were:

* Consent of the governed: the authority and legitimacy of the government is dependent upon the assent of the people as expressed in free and fair elections
* Civic duty/&quot;Positive liberty&quot;/&quot;republican virtue&quot;: the responsibility to understand and support the government, participate in elections, pay taxes, oppose political corruption, and perform military service.
* Democracy: government answerable to citizens, who may change who represents them through elections.
* Equality before the law: laws that attach no special privilege to any citizen and hold government officials subject just as any other person.
* Freedom of religion: government that neither supports nor suppresses any or all religion.
* Freedom of speech: government that restricts neither through law nor action the non-violent speech of a citizen; a marketplace of ideas.

====Post–World War II====
At the time of the United States&#x27; founding, the economy was predominantly one of agriculture and small private businesses, and state governments left welfare issues to private or local initiative. As in the UK and other industrialized countries, laissez-faire ideology was largely discredited during the Great Depression. Between the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus. After the &quot;Reagan revolution&quot; in the early 1980s, laissez-faire ideology once more became a powerful force in American politics. While the American welfare state expanded more than threefold after WWII, it held at 20% of GDP from the late 1970s to late 1980s. In the 21st century, modern American liberalism, and modern American conservatism are engaged in a continuous political battle, characterized by what &quot;The Economist&quot; describes as &quot;greater divisiveness [and] close, but bitterly fought elections.&quot; Since 2016, the United States has been recognized as a flawed democracy in the &quot;Democracy Index&quot; by the Economist Intelligence Unit, partially due to increased political polarization. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices the United States were 2023 the 27th most electoral democratic country and 3rd most participatory democracy in the world.

In foreign affairs, the United States generally pursued a noninterventionist policy of &quot;avoiding foreign entanglements&quot; before World War II. After the war, when America became a superpower, for many decades the country embraced internationalism, seeking allies to contain Communism and foster economic cooperation.

===Development and evolution of political parties===
====Background====
The United States Constitution never formally addressed the issue of political parties, primarily because the Founding Fathers—Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, George Washington—opposed them as domestic political factions leading to domestic conflict and stagnation.

Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American two-party system emerged from Washington&#x27;s immediate circle of advisers, including Hamilton and Madison. By the 1790s, different views of the new country&#x27;s proper course had already developed, with those holding the same views banding together. The followers of Alexander Hamilton (the &quot;Federalist&quot;) favored a strong central government that would support the interests of commerce and industry. The followers of Thomas Jefferson, (&quot;Democratic-Republicans&quot;) preferred a decentralized agrarian republic.

By 1828, the Federalists had disappeared as an organization, replaced first by the National Republican Party and then by the Whigs, while the Democratic Republicans evolved into the Democrats led by Andrew Jackson, and known for celebrating &quot;the common (white) man&quot; and the expansion of suffrage to most of them.

In the 1850s, it was the Whigs&#x27; turn to disappear, undone by the issue of whether slavery should be allowed to expand into the country&#x27;s new territories in the West. The Whigs were eventually replaced by the Republican Party which opposed slavery expansion and whose first successful candidate for the presidency was Abraham Lincoln.

====Democratic and Republican====
In the 150+ years since the Democratic and Republican parties have been America&#x27;s two major parties, though their policies, base of support and relative strength have changed considerably.

Some eras in American politics include:

* Reconstruction era (1865—1877) and Gilded Age (1870s—1900s). After the defeat of the Confederacy, the Republican Party, associated with the successful military defense of the Union and often known as &quot;the Grand Old Party&quot;, became the dominant party in America. The Democrats were dominant in the &quot;Solid South&quot; (i.e. solidly Democratic) where &quot;repressive legislation and physical intimidation&quot; of Jim Crow prevented the &quot;newly enfranchised African Americans from voting&quot;. They celebrated &quot;state&#x27;s rights&quot;, a principle dear to the heart of segregationists. Nationwide democrats supported cheap-money, and opposed banking and tariffs. Another element in its coalition were mostly urban Catholics.

* The Progressive Era (1896—1917). Progressive programs —municipal reforms, civil service reform, corrupt practices acts, and presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national conventions—strove to clean up politics, revitalize democracy, bringing to bear scientific solutions to social problems. Progressive leaders included Republicans Theodore Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette, and Charles Evans Hughes; Democrats William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, and Al Smith.

* The New Deal (1933—1938). These programs of Democratic president Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to deal with the disruption and suffering of the Great Depression — raising of the minimum wage, the establishment of the Social Security and other federal services — created a dramatic political shift in America. Roosevelt &quot;forged a broad coalition—including small farmers, Northern city dwellers, organized labor, European immigrants, liberals, intellectuals, and reformers&quot;. The Democratic party became the dominant party—retaining the presidency until 1952 and controlling both houses of Congress for most of the period until the mid-1990s.

* The Break up of New Deal coalition. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965—driven by Democratic president Lyndon B. Johnson—began the breaking off of the white segregationist Solid South from the Democratic party. Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Southern strategy&quot; began the process of winning white Southerners away to the G.O.P., and within a few decades created a solidly Republican south. Republican conservatives became victorious with the 1980 victory of Ronald Reagan, who campaigned on a theme of smaller government, free trade and tax cuts. These would stimulate economic growth which would then &quot;trickle down&quot; to the middle and lower classes (who might not benefit initially from these policies). The Republican party was now said to rest on &quot;three legs&quot; of Christian right/Social conservatism, fiscal conservatism/small government, and strong anti-communist military policy.

* Political polarization in the United States (1990s—present). Since the 1990s, the U.S. has experienced more &quot;partisan sorting&quot; (i.e. liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats began to disappear); as well as a greater surge in ideological polarization, and affective polarization than comparable democracies, with a shift away from focus on political success, toward the abhorrence and domination (&quot;owning&quot;) of supporters of the opposing party. This move away from the center and change in ideology has not been symmetrical, with Republicans moving farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left (based on rankings of congressional roll-call votes). Republican strategist Newt Gingrich introduced a &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; or &quot;no-holds-barred&quot; style in congress, that abandoned the norm whereby Democrats were opponents in elections but primarily colleagues to negotiate with in making good legislation. Gingrich taught that they were the enemy to be defeated, attacked as &quot;traitors ... liars ... cheaters&quot;. Karl Rove emphasized that elections are won by energizing the party &quot;base&quot; (core supporters), not reaching out to the persuadable or swing voter in the middle; attacking opponents strong points (for example running ads implying decorated veterans—Max Cleland and John Kerry—were actually treasonous). Conspiracy theories also began to become mainstream among Republicans during this time (for example accusing then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of ordering the military to not protect Americans at the U.S. compound in Benghazi).
* Presidency of Donald Trump (2017—2021). After decades of dominance, &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; rhetoric and policy, began to be replaced by new themes Reaganism had not emphasized, (cultural/attitudinal conservatism such as opposition to gay marriage, transgender rights). Themes it had not objected to (immigration from non-European countries) or had unequivocally supported (economic globalization and especially big business) were abandoned or attacked. Populism replaced gentility, and prudent Edmund Burke conservatism. In the party base, not only had conservative (white) blue collar workers migrated to the Republican Party, but a business class that had been part of the Republican Party since the post-Civil War Gilded Age, began to leave. Added to the louder and growing number of conspiracy theories were &quot;alternative facts&quot;. The &quot;bedrock principle of democracy, that losing candidates and their supporters accept the results&quot; was no longer supported by most Republicans. Not only did white southerners leave the Democratic party but eventually a large majority of rural and working class whites nationwide became the base of the Republican Party. Whereas for decades the college-educated voters skewed heavily toward the Republican party, eventually high educational attainment was a marker of Democratic support, (leading Donald Trump to proclaim to supporters, &quot;I love the poorly educated!&quot;). Post-2012 has also been characterized by even political division and a lack of a dominant political party.

===Development of voting===
In pre-colonial and post-revolutionary American times, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported, rather than voting secretly, which was considered &quot;cowardly&quot; and &quot;underhanded&quot;. Originally, state laws required voters to be property owners, but &quot;by the time Andrew Jackson was elected President, in 1828, nearly all white men could vote&quot;.

Later in the 19th century, voting was done by written paper ballot. A broadened franchise where many voters were illiterate or misspelling disqualified a vote, led to the use of printed ballots. Each political party would create its own ballot—preprinted &quot;party tickets&quot;—give them to supporters, and who would publicly put the party&#x27;s ballot into the voting box, or hand them to election judges through a window. The tickets indicated a vote for all of that party&#x27;s slate of candidates, preventing &quot;ticket splitting&quot;. (As of 1859 &quot;nowhere in the United States ... did election officials provide ballots&quot;, i.e. they all came from political parties.) In cities voters often had to make their way through a throng of partisans who would try to prevent supporters of the opposing party from voting, a practice generally allowed unless it &quot;clearly&quot; appeared &quot;that there was such a display of force as ought to have intimidated men of ordinary firmness.&quot; The practice was dangerous enough that in &quot;the middle decades of the nineteenth century,&quot; several dozen (89) were killed in Election Day riots.

It was not until the late nineteenth century that states began to adopt the Australian secret-ballot method (despite fears it &quot;would make any nation a nation of scoundrels&quot;), and it eventually became the national standard. The secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters), and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot.

====Suffrage====
Some key events of suffrage expansion are:

* 1792–1856: Abolition of property qualifications for white men were abolished.
* 1868: Citizenship was guaranteed to all persons born or naturalized in the United States by the Fourteenth Amendment, although Jim Crow laws prevented most African Americans from voting. 
* 1920: Women are guaranteed the right to vote in all US states by the Nineteenth Amendment.
* 1964-66: Civil Rights laws and Supreme Court rulings eliminate tax payment and wealth requirements and protect voter registration and voting for racial minorities.
* 1971: Adults aged 18 through 20 are granted the right to vote by the Twenty-sixth Amendment.

==Concerns, problems and criticism==
Ongoing concerns include lack of representation in the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia; fear that the interests of some are overrepresented, while others are underrepresented; a fear that certain features of the American political system make it less democratic, a fear that a small cultural elite has undermined traditional values, and whether policy and law-making is dominated by a small economic elite molding it to their interests. Greater representation given to small states in the Senate and the Electoral College, &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; voting, gerrymandering, etc.—have in recent years had a more extreme effect and have begun to create a disconnect between what the government does (in legislation and court rulings) and what the majority of Americans want.

In an August 31, 2022, poll by Quinnipiac University, 69 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of Republicans replied yes to the question &quot;Do you think the nation&#x27;s democracy is in danger of collapse&quot;.
A 2020 study, &quot;Global Satisfaction with Democracy&quot; by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge, found that

for the first time on record, polls show a majority of Americans dissatisfied with their system of government—a system of which they were once famously proud. Such levels of democratic dissatisfaction would not be unusual elsewhere. But for the United States, it marks an &quot;end of exceptionalism&quot;—a profound shift in America&#x27;s view of itself, and therefore, of its place in the world.
Concerns about the American political system include how well it represents and serves the interests of Americans. They include:

* underrepresentation of certain groups (women, Black people, Latin Americans, Native Americans, LGBT people, and those under 60 years old); 
* complete failure to represent other groups (citizens living in territories, in D.C. (for Congress), and felons in some states); 
* whether policy and law-making is dominated by a small economic elite molding it to their interests; 
* whether a small cultural elite has undermined traditional values;
* lack of a universal or single payer healthcare system, instead of the current system of reliance on employer provided for-profit private healthcare 
More recently, concerns have included:

* a significant disconnect between what the majority of Americans want and what its government does (in supreme court rulings, legislation, etc.). This has expanded since the 1990s due to systemic issues such as gerrymandering, the United States Electoral College, first-past-the-post voting, etc. 
* &quot;a growing movement inside one of the country&#x27;s two major parties—the Republican Party—to refuse to accept defeat in an election&quot;;
* a belief (without evidence) that voter fraud is &quot;being committed by minority voters on a massive scale&quot; preventing Republicans from being elected.

=== Underrepresentation by gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation===
Observations of historical trends and current governmental demographics have raised concerns about the equity of political representation in the United States. In particular, scholars have noted that levels of descriptive representation—which refers to when political representatives share demographic backgrounds or characteristics with their constituents—do not match the racial and gender makeup of the US. Descriptive representation is noted to be beneficial because of its symbolic representative benefits as a source of emotional identification with one&#x27;s representatives. Furthermore, descriptive representation can lead to more substantive and functional representation, as well as greater institutional power, which can result in minority constituents having both representatives with matching policy views and power in the political system. Serving as a congressional committee chair is considered to be a good example of this relationship, as chairs control which issues are addressed by committees, especially through hearings that bring substantial attention to certain issues. Though minorities like African Americans and Latinos have rarely served as committee chairs, studies have shown that their presence has directly led to significantly higher likelihoods of minority issues being addressed. Given that racial and ethnic minorities of all backgrounds have historically been marginalized from participating in the US political system, their political representation and access to policymaking has been limited. Similarly, women lack proportional representation in the United States, bringing into question the extent to which women&#x27;s issues are adequately addressed. Other minority groups, such as the LGBTQ community, have also been disadvantaged by an absence of equitable representation—especially since scholars have noted their gradual shift from originally being perceived as more of a moral political issue to being considered an actual constituency.

Political representation is also an essential part of making sure that citizens have faith that representatives, political institutions, and democracy take their interests into account. For women and minorities, this issue can occur even in the levels of government that are meant to be closest to constituents, such as among members of Congress in the House of Representatives. Scholars have noted that in positions such as these, even close proximity to constituents does not necessarily translate to an understanding of their needs or experiences and that constituents can still feel unrepresented. In a democracy, a lack of faith in one&#x27;s representatives can cause them to search for less-democratic alternative forms of representation, like unelected individuals or interest groups. For racial and ethnic minorities, the risk of seeking alternative representation is especially acute, as lived experiences often lead to different political perspectives that can be difficult for white representatives to fully understand or adequately address. Moreover, studies have begun to increasingly show that people of all races and genders tend to prefer having members of Congress who share their race or gender, which can also lead to more engagement between constituents and their representatives, as well as higher likelihoods of contacting or having faith in their congressperson. In addition to making it more likely that constituents will trust their representatives, having descriptive representation can help sustain an individual&#x27;s positive perceptions of government. When considering women in particular, it has been suggested that broader economic and social equality could result from first working toward ensuring more equitable political representation for women, which would also help promote increased faith between women and their representatives.

==== Race and ethnicity ====

===== African Americans =====
Although African Americans have begun to continually win more elected positions and increase their overall political representation, they still lack proportional representation across a variety of different levels of government. Some estimates indicate that most gains for African Americans—and other minorities in general—have not occurred at higher levels of government, but rather at sub-levels in federal and state governments. Additionally, congressional data from 2017 revealed that 35.7% of African Americans nationwide had a congressperson of the same race, while the majority of black Americans were represented by members of Congress of a different race. Scholars have partially explained this discrepancy by focusing on the obstacles that black candidates face. Factors like election type, campaign costs, district demographics, and historical barriers, such as voter suppression, can all hinder the likelihood of a black candidate winning an election or even choosing to enter into an election process. Demographics, in particular, are noted to have a large influence on black candidate success, as research has shown that the ratio of white-to-black voters can have a significant impact on a black candidate&#x27;s chance of winning an election and that large black populations tend to increase the resources available to African American candidates. Despite the variety of obstacles that have contributed to the lack of proportional representation for African Americans, other factors have been found to increase the likelihood of a black candidate winning an election. Based on data from a study in Louisiana, prior black incumbency, as well as running for an office that other black candidates had pursued in the past, increased the likelihood of African Americans entering into races and winning elections.

===== Hispanic and Latino Americans =====
As the most populous minority demographic identified in the 2010 US Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans have become an increasingly important constituency that is spread throughout the United States. Despite also constituting 15% of the population in at least a quarter of House districts, Latino representation in Congress has not correspondingly increased. Furthermore, in 2017, Latino members of Congress only represented about one-quarter of the total Latino population in the US. While there are many potential explanations for this disparity, including issues related to voter suppression, surveys of Latino voters have identified trends unique to their demographic—though survey data has still indicated that descriptive representation is important to Hispanic and Latino voters. While descriptive representation may be considered important, an analysis of a 2004 national survey of Latinos revealed that political participation and substantive representation were strongly associated with each other, possibly indicating that voters mobilize more on behalf of candidates whose policy views reflect their own, rather than for those who share their ethnic background. Moreover, a breakdown of the rationale for emphasizing descriptive representation reveals additional factors behind supporting Latino candidates, such as the view that they may have a greater respect and appreciation for Spanish or a belief that Latinos are &quot;linked&quot; together, indicating the significance of shared cultural experiences and values. Although the reasons behind choosing to vote for Latino candidates are not monolithic, the election of Latinos to Congress has been identified as resulting in benefits for minorities overall. While it has been argued that unique district-related issues can take equal or greater precedence than Latino interests for Hispanic and Latino members of Congress, studies have also shown that Latinos are more likely to support African American members of Congress—and vice versa—beyond just what is expected from shared party membership.

===== Native Americans =====
Similar to other minority groups, Native Americans often lack representation due to electoral policies. Gerrymandering, in particular, is noted as a method of concentrating Native voters in a limited number of districts to reduce their ability to influence multiple elections. Despite structural efforts to limit their political representation, some states with large Native American populations have higher levels of representation. South Dakota has a Native population of about 9% with multiple federally recognized tribal nations, and it has been used as a case study of representation. A 2017 study that conducted interviews of former state elected officials in South Dakota revealed that even though many felt that they were only able to implement a limited number of significant changes for tribal communities, they still considered it to be &quot;absolutely essential&quot; that Native Americans had at least some descriptive representation to prevent complete exclusion from the political process. Moreover, formerly elected state and local government officials asserted that ensuring that the issues and concerns of tribal nations were addressed and understood depended on politicians with Native backgrounds. Historically backed suspicion and skepticism of the predominantly white US government was also considered to be an important reason for having representatives that reflect the histories and views of Native Americans.

===== Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders =====
Relative to other, larger minority demographics in the United States, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) face different challenges related to political representation. Few congressional districts have a population that includes over 50% Asian Americans, which can elevate the likelihood of being represented by someone of a different race or ethnicity. As with other minorities, this can result in people feeling unrepresented by their member of Congress.

==== Gender and political representation ====

Women have made continual socioeconomic progress in many key areas of society, such as in employment and education, and in comparison to men, women have voted at higher rates for over forty years—making their lack of more proportional representation in the political system surprising. Some scholars have partially attributed this discrepancy to the electoral system in the United States, as it does not provide a mechanism for the types of gender quotas seen in other countries. Additionally, even though gerrymandering and concentrated political representation can essentially ensure at least some representation for minority racial and ethnic groups, women—who are relatively evenly spread throughout the United States—do not receive similar benefits from this practice. Identifying the source of unequal gender representation of individuals can be predicted along party and ideological lines. A survey of attitudes toward women candidates revealed that Democrats are more likely to attribute systemic issues to gender inequalities in political representation, while Republicans are less likely to hold this perspective. While identifying an exact source of inequality may ultimately prove unlikely, some recent studies have suggested that the political ambitions of women may be influenced by the wide variety of proposed factors attributed to the underrepresentation of women. In contrast to attributing specific reasons to unequal representation, political party has also been identified as a way of predicting if a woman running for office is more likely to receive support, as women candidates are more likely to receive votes from members of their party and Independents.

===== Social inequality and sexism =====
Social inequality and sexism have been noted by scholars as influencing the electoral process for women. In a survey of attitudes toward women candidates, women respondents were far more likely to view the process of running for office as &quot;hostile&quot; to women than men, especially when considering public hesitancy to support women candidates, media coverage, and public discrimination. Political fundraising for candidates is also an area of inequality, as men donate at a higher rate than women—which is compounded by gender and racial inequalities related to income and employment. Recent increases in woman-focused fundraising groups have started to alter this imbalance. Given that disproportionate levels of household labor often become the responsibility of women, discrimination within households has also been identified as a major influence on the capability of women to run for office. For women in the LGBTQ community, some scholars have raised concern about the unequal attention paid to the needs of lesbians compared to transgender, bisexual, and queer women, with lesbian civil rights described as receiving more of a focus from politicians.

===== Social pressures and influences =====
Social pressures are another influence on women who run for office, often coinciding with sexism and discrimination. Some scholars have argued that views of discrimination have prompted a decrease in the supply of women willing to run for office, though this has been partially countered by those who argue that women are actually just more &quot;strategic&quot; when trying to identify an election with favorable conditions. Other factors, like the overrepresentation of men, have been described as influencing perceptions of men as somehow inherently more effective as politicians or leaders, which some scholars argue could pressure women to stay out of elections. Others contend that the overrepresentation of men can actually result in &quot;political momentum&quot; for women, such as during the Year of the Woman. Within some racial and ethnic groups, social influences can also shape political engagement. Among Latinos, Latinas are more likely to partake in non-electoral activities, like community organizing, when compared to men. Despite differences in political activity and social pressures, elected women from both political parties have voiced their support for electing more women to Congress to increase the acceptance of their voices and experiences. Furthermore, studies have found that increasing the descriptive representation of women can provide positive social influences for democracy as a whole, such as improved perceptions of an individual&#x27;s political efficacy and government&#x27;s responsiveness to the needs of people. When women can vote for a woman candidate of the same party, studies have also found that these influences can be magnified.

==== LGBT political representation ====
Although some scholars have disputed the benefits of descriptive representation, only a small number have argued that this form of representation actually has negative impacts on the group it represents. Studies of bills relating to LGBT rights in state legislatures have provided a more nuanced analysis. Pro-LGBT bills tend to be introduced in higher numbers when more LGBT representatives are elected to state legislatures, which may also indicate an increased likelihood of substantive representation. Increases in openly LGBT state lawmakers have also been hypothesized to inadvertently result in more anti-LGBT legislation, potentially as the result of backlash to their presence. Despite the risk of negative consequences, at least one study has concluded that the LGBT community receives net-benefits from increased openly LGBT representation. On the federal level, the presence of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus has been identified as improving the ability of Congress to address the intersectional issues faced by the LGBT community, as well as provide a source of pressure other than constituency on members of Congress to address LGBT issues. Additionally, non-LGBT members of the caucus have been criticized for not sponsoring enough legislation, emphasizing the value of openly LGBT members of Congress. While descriptive representation has provided benefits overall, scholars have noted that some groups in the community, such as transgender and bisexual people, tend to receive less focus than gays and lesbians.

===Democratic backsliding===

At least two &quot;well-regarded&quot; global democracy indices — V-Dem Democracy indices, and Democracy Index (The Economist) — &quot;show an erosion of American democracy since 2016&quot;.

=== Disconnect between public opinion and government policy===
A disconnect between &quot;the power to set government policy&quot; and political opinions of the general public has been noted by commentators and scholars (such as David Leonhardt). The United States is &quot;far and away the most countermajoritarian democracy in the world,&quot; according to Steven Levitsky.

Before the 2000 election, only three candidates for president won &quot;while losing the popular vote (John Quincy Adams, Rutherford Hayes and Benjamin Harrison), and each served only a single term&quot;, while as of 2022 &quot;two of the past four presidents have taken office despite losing the popular vote&quot; - George W. Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016.

Leonhardt points out that in one branch of the federal government—the Supreme Court—conservative legal decisions &quot;both sweeping and, according to polls, unpopular&quot; were delivered in 2022, what is likely the beginning of a reshaping of &quot;American politics for years, if not decades&quot; to come by the court&#x27;s &quot;Republican appointees&quot;. This is despite the fact that the president appoints the nominees, and that presidential candidates of the Democratic Party have won the popular vote in seven out of eight last elections (from 1992 to 2020).

In the 2020 U.S. Senate, &quot;50 Democratic senators effectively represent 186 million Americans, while the 50 Republican senators effectively represent 145 million&quot;.

Explanations include:
* geographical sorting by ideology. &quot;Parts of the country granted outsize power by the Constitution&quot; (i.e. less populated states), formerly voted more or less similarly to the large states and urban areas that were granted less power. Thus &quot;the small-state bonus&quot; giving disproportionate power in &quot;the Senate and Electoral College had only a limited effect on national results&quot;. This is no longer the case. Rural areas are more uniformly conservative and urban areas liberal. More important is &quot;the winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College&quot; (all states except Maine and Nebraska), which gives greater bias to Republicans.
* faster population growth of large (population) states than small states. The state with the largest population in 1790 was Virginia with approximately 13 times as many residents as the smallest (Delaware). Today, &quot;California, which consistently votes for liberal candidates statewide, &quot;has 68 times as many residents as Wyoming; 53 times as many as Alaska; and at least 20 times as many as another 11 states&quot;. When a candidate wins a statewide election in California (or New York) by a landslide, these large numbers of popular votes mean nothing in the tally of Electoral College votes or Senate seats.
* while the House of Representatives would seem to have &quot;a more equitable system for allocating political power&quot;—dividing the country &quot;into 435 districts, each with a broadly similar number of people&quot; (760,000 as of 2022)—Leonhardt argues two features distort his equity:
** gerrymandering, i.e. the drawing of district boundaries by State legislatures for partisan advantage, something Republicans have been &quot;more forceful&quot; about in recent years.
** the phenomenon of &quot;wasted votes&quot;, whereby the increasing concentration of Democratic voters in large metro areas means Democrats often win elections in these districts by &quot;landslides&quot;, leading to the overall nationwide proportion of votes for Democrats significantly less than the proportion of seats for Democrats in the House.

====Oligarchy====

In 2014, United Press International reported that the political structure of the United States has become an oligarchy, where a small economic elite overwhelmingly dominate policy and law. Some academic researchers suggest a drift toward oligarchy has been occurring by way of the influence of corporations, wealthy, and other special interest groups, leaving individual citizens with less impact than economic elites and organized interest groups in the political process.

An April 2014 study by political scientists Martin Gilens (Princeton University) and Benjamin Page (Northwestern University) concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the interests of the majority of its citizens but instead is &quot;ruled by those of the rich and powerful&quot;. The researchers after analyzing nearly 1,800 U.S. policies between 1981 and 2002, stated that government policies tend to favour special interests and lobbying organizations, and that whenever a majority of citizens disagrees with the economic elites, the elites tend to prevail in getting their way. While not characterizing the United States as an &quot;oligarchy&quot; or &quot;plutocracy&quot; outright, Gilens and Page give weight to the idea of a &quot;civil oligarchy&quot; as used by Jeffrey A. Winters, saying, &quot;Winters has posited a comparative theory of &#x27;Oligarchy,&#x27; in which the wealthiest citizens—even in a &#x27;civil oligarchy&#x27; like the United States—dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth- and income-protection.&quot; In their study, Gilens and Page reached these conclusions:

E. J. Dionne Jr. described what he considers the effects of ideological and oligarchical interests on the judiciary. The journalist, columnist, and scholar interprets recent Supreme Court decisions as ones that allow wealthy elites to use economic power to influence political outcomes in their favor. In speaking about the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;McCutcheon v. FEC&quot; and &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; decisions, Dionne wrote: &quot;Thus has this court conferred on wealthy people the right to give vast sums of money to politicians while undercutting the rights of millions of citizens to cast a ballot.&quot;

Nobel Prize–winning economist Paul Krugman wrote:

A November 2022 study by Pew Research Center showed that majorities in both the Republican and Democratic parties held increasingly negative views of major financial institutions and large corporations.

==== Gerrymandering ====
Gerrymandering is the practice of shaping the boundaries of electoral districts for partisan advantage—those boundaries being reviewed and usually changed after every United States census, i.e. every ten years. Gerrymandering involves what&#x27;s commonly called &quot;cracking and packing&quot;.

* &quot;Cracking&quot; is the process of moving the boundaries of districts to spreads opposition voters thinly enough across many districts so that they constitute a safe margin below 50%. Cracking spreads opposition voters thinly across many districts to dilute their power. 
* &quot;Packing&quot; is the process of concentrating opposition voters in one or more (but always a minority of) districts, to &quot;waste&quot; opposition votes.

Used almost since the founding of the United States (the term was coined in 1810 after a review of Massachusetts&#x27;s redistricting maps of 1812 set by Governor Elbridge Gerry noted that one of the districts looked like a salamander), in the 21st century it has &quot;become a much more effective tool&quot;. Since 2010, detailed maps and high-speed computing have facilitated gerrymandering by political parties in the redistricting process, in order to gain control of state legislation and congressional representation and potentially to maintain that control over several decades, even against shifting political changes in a state&#x27;s population. It allows the drawing of districts &quot;with surgical precision&quot;.
According to Julia Kirschenbaum and Michael Li of the Brennan Center

In 2010, Republicans—in an effort to control the drawing of congressional maps—forged a campaign to win majorities in as many state legislatures as possible. It was wildly successful, giving them control over the drawing of 213 congressional districts. The redrawing of maps that followed produced some of the most extreme gerrymanders in history. In battleground Pennsylvania, for example, the congressional map gave Republicans a virtual lock on 13 of the state&#x27;s 18 congressional districts, even in elections where Democrats won the majority of the statewide congressional vote.

Attempts to appeal to the Supreme Court to disallow gerrymandering in cases such as &quot;Vieth v. Jubelirer&quot; in 2004 and its passing up of &quot;numerous opportunities&quot; in 2017 and 2018 &quot;to decide upon the constitutional legality or illegality of gerrymandering&quot; has &quot;emboldened ever more partisan gerrymandering&quot;.

In addition to giving one party power beyond its popular support, gerrymandering has been criticized for weakening the political power of minority voters by concentrated them into district(s) (though this process can also help ensure the election of a representative of the same race).

===Polarization increase===
Since the 1970s, the United States has grown more polarized, with rapid increases in polarization during the 2000s onward. As a general rule, urban areas and suburbs have become more &quot;blue&quot;, Democratic or liberal, while agricultural rural areas have become more &quot;red&quot;, Republican or conservative. Since many states have no large or extensive urban areas the result is that there are many &quot;red&quot; states in the south and Midwest, while coastal states which contain extensive urbanized areas tend to be &quot;blue.&quot; Rural areas with a recreational focus such as ski resorts are an exception to the general rule.
The polarization has been both ideological (differences between the policy positions) and affective (i.e. a dislike and distrust of opposing political groups), than comparable democracies.

Polarization among U.S. legislators is asymmetric, as it has primarily been driven by a substantial rightward shift among congressional Republicans, alongside a much smaller leftward shift among congressional Democrats. New Democrats advocated for neoliberal policies including financial deregulation and free trade, which is seen to have shifted the Democratic Party rightward on economic issues. Since the early 2010s, the party has shifted significantly to the left on social, cultural, and religious issues. According to the Pew Research Center, members of both parties who have unfavorable opinions of the opposing party have doubled since 1994, while those who have very unfavorable opinions of the opposing party are at record highs as of 2022.

=== Concerns about the refusal to accept defeat ===
 
Many commentators and scholars (such as David Leonhardt) have expressed alarm at the &quot;growing movement inside one of the country&#x27;s two major parties—the Republican Party—to refuse to accept defeat in an election&quot;. In a survey by journalists (of the Washington Post) less than two months before the 2022 congressional election, a &quot;majority of Republicans&quot; in &quot;important battleground&quot; election campaigns, refused &quot;to say they will accept the November election outcome&quot;. Six key Senate and gubernatorial Republican party nominees refused to commit to accepting the results of the November election: Blake Masters in Arizona, JD Vance in Ohio, Rep. Ted Budd in North Carolina, Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska, Tudor Dixon in Michigan and Geoff Diehl in Massachusetts.

While the claim by a losing candidate that they won &quot;despite clear evidence he lost&quot;, may have started with Donald Trump after his loss in 2020, during primaries leading up to the November 2022 general election, &quot;candidates across the country have refused to concede—even in races that are not remotely close&quot;.

The trend has been manifest in the violent January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol to prevent the certification of Joe Biden as president, the hundreds of elected Republican officials throughout the United States that the 2020 presidential election was &quot;rigged&quot;, some of whom &quot;are running for statewide offices that would oversee future elections, potentially putting them in position to overturn an election in 2024 or beyond&quot;. According to Yascha Mounk, &quot;There is the possibility, for the first time in American history, that a legitimately elected president will not be able to take office&quot;.

In part the phenomenon is international, democracies are struggling in other parts of the world led by the forces of &quot;digital media, cultural change, and economic stagnation in affluent countries&quot;. Leonhardt states that &quot;many experts point out that it is still not clear how the country will escape a larger crisis, such as an overturned election, at some point in the coming decade.&quot;

=== Deterioration of other norms ===
====Abandonment of campaign debates====
In the 2022 elections observers have noted lack of participation in debates between candidates, and in the &quot;retail politicking&quot; that has been a political &quot;cliché ... for generations&quot; in American politics: pressing the flesh at &quot;diners and state fairs ... town-hall-style meetings ... where citizens get to question their elected leaders and those running to replace them&quot;. Replacing these are &quot;safer spaces&quot; for candidates, &quot;partisan news outlets, fund-raisers with supporters, friendly local crowds&quot;, as the number of competitive House of Representative districts and &quot;swing voters&quot; grows smaller, and candidates concentrate on mobilizing the party loyalists rather than appealing to undecided voters (appeals touching on compromise and bipartisanship angering party hardliners).

Observers see a danger in candidates
Avoiding those tougher interactions cuts down on the opportunities for candidates&#x27; characters and limitations to be revealed, and for elected officials to be held accountable to those who elected them. For the politicians, it creates an artificial environment where their positions appear uniformly popular and opposing views are angrily denounced, making compromise seem risky.

====Other norms====
Under the campaign and presidency of Donald Trump, observers (such as political scientist Brendan Nyhan) noted some erosion of political norms and ethics, including:

* acceptable background for high level officials. (Jeff Sessions was rejected by the U.S. Senate in 1986 for a federal judgeship because his history on racial issues was considered to be disqualifying, but served as U.S. attorney general from February 9, 2017, to November 7, 2018.) 
* intolerance of criticism. &quot;Trump Threatens White House Protesters With &#x27;Vicious Dogs&#x27; and &#x27;Ominous Weapons
* tolerance for conflicts of interest in government. Public officials who are also businessmen (Donald Trump) accepting money for their business (Trump hotel in Washington) from foreign governments with interests before the United States. (&quot;The Trump hotel in Washington is pitching foreign diplomats on its services, which might violate a clause of the U.S. Constitution that is supposed to ensure that foreign governments can&#x27;t buy favor with federal officials.&quot;)
*partisan abuse of power. After a Democratic candidate for governor won, Republican majorities in the legislatures of North Carolina, and Wisconsin voted in 2018 to &quot;strip the legitimate powers of newly elected Democratic governors&quot; while the &quot;defeated or outgoing Republican incumbents are still around to sign the bills&quot;.
* Applying the rule of &quot;Because we can&quot;. Announced on February 13, 2016, the Republican controlled senate refused to hold hearings on the appointment of Merrick Garland (a Democratic nominee) for the Supreme Court, maintaining it was too close to the November 8, 2016 election (almost nine months away at the time), and would deny the American people a &quot;voice&quot; in the selection of the next justice. Four years later, with a Republican now president, a ceremony was held for the nomination of a conservative justice for Supreme Court (Amy Coney Barrett) on September 26, 2020, a little more than one month (38 days) before Election Day, with Mitch McConnell claiming, &quot;I think it&#x27;s very important that we have nine Justices.&quot;

=== Antiquated institutions ===
The US doesn&#x27;t recommend its own political system to its allies creating new constitutions. Democratic backsliding concerns have led to some academics on the other hand to warn that thanks in part to the rulings of the Supreme Court that exacerbated the flaws in these ancient institutions, the U.S. is already a one-party state, and no longer meets the minimum requirements to be considered a democracy.

===Suggested reforms===
====Electing Supreme Court justices====
With an implementation of term limits and holding elections for Supreme Court justices, the United States could solve the contentious battle for when Supreme Court members unexpectedly die. Packing the Supreme Court proposals would fade away if an election was going to decide the outcome. Thirty-three states already elect their state supreme courts. William Watkins Jr., a constitutional scholar from the Independent Institute on National Public Radio, stated his proposal for 8 to 10-year one-time term limits, he also said justices are supposed to be like umpires calling balls and strikes in the game but are acting more like coaches tinkering with starting lineups, and calling hit and runs. Local district attorneys and county sheriffs are elected and so could Supreme Court justices. The United States Senate used to be appointed by state legislatures before the 17th Amendment was passed in 1913 for them to be elected. A second constitutional convention of the states to amend the Constitution could be a way for this reform to proceed.


====Term limits for congress====


Term limits for members of Congress was a movement that gained a lot of traction in the early 1990s. 23 State Governments passed legislation that term limited US Congress representatives from each respective state. The Supreme Court decision U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton in 1995 invalidated the term limit legislation found in those 23 states. Newt Gingrich&#x27;s Contract with America promised legislation in the first 100 days for a constitutional amendment for term limits. However, the Term Limits Constitutional Amendment bill did not pass the 2/3 majority to move the bill forward and only passed with a simple majority of 227–204. It would have limited the House and Senate to 12 years total, six terms in the House, and two terms in the Senate. Today, U.S. Term Limits campaigns for 34 states to call for a Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution to create a Term Limits amendment.

<text>The United States has a highly developed mixed economy. It is the world&#x27;s largest economy by nominal GDP and second largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). As of 2024, it has the world&#x27;s sixth highest nominal GDP per capita and eighth highest GDP per capita by PPP). The U.S. accounted for 26% of the global economy in 2023 in nominal terms, and about 15.5% in PPP terms. The U.S. dollar is the currency of record most used in international transactions and is the world&#x27;s reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its role as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the &quot;de facto&quot; currency. Since the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology.

The American economy is fueled by high productivity, well developed transportation infrastructure, and extensive natural resources. Americans have the sixth highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. In 2021, they had the highest median household income among OECD countries although the country also had one of the world&#x27;s highest income inequalities among the developed countries. The largest U.S. trading partners are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. The U.S. is the world&#x27;s largest importer and second largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries, including Canada and Mexico (through the USMCA), Australia, South Korea, Israel, and several others that are in effect or under negotiation. The U.S. has a highly flexible labor market, where the industry adheres to a hire-and-fire policy, and job security is relatively low. Among OECD nations, the U.S. has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 30% of GDP. 

The United States is the world&#x27;s largest producer of petroleum and natural gas. In 2016, it was the world&#x27;s largest trading country and second largest manufacturer, with American manufacturing making up a fifth of the global total. The U.S. not only has the largest internal market for goods, but also dominates the services trade. Total U.S. trade was $4.2trillion in 2018. Of the world&#x27;s 500 largest companies, 139 are headquartered in the U.S. The U.S. has the world&#x27;s highest number of billionaires, with total wealth of $5.7trillion. U.S. commercial banks had $22.9trillion in assets in December 2022. U.S. global assets under management had more than $30trillion in assets. During the Great Recession of 2008, the U.S. economy suffered a significant decline. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was enacted by the United States Congress, and in the ensuing years the U.S. experienced the longest economic expansion on record by July 2019.

The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world&#x27;s largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume. The U.S. has the world&#x27;s largest gold reserve, with over 8,000 tonnes of gold. In 2014, the U.S. economy was ranked first in international ranking on venture capital and global research and development funding. The U.S. spends around 3.46% of GDP on cutting-edge research and development across various sectors of the economy. The U.S. has produced the world&#x27;s highest number of Nobel laureates in the economics field. It is also the world&#x27;s fourth largest high-technology exporter. Consumer spending comprised 68% of the U.S. economy in 2022, while its labor share of income was 44% in 2021. The U.S. has the world&#x27;s largest consumer market. The nation&#x27;s labor market has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in the world. The U.S. is one of the top-performing economies in studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index, the Global Competitiveness Report, and others.

==History==
===Colonial era and 18th century===
The economic history of the United States began with British settlements along the Eastern seaboard in the 17th and 18th centuries. After 1700, the United States gained population rapidly, and imports as well as exports grew along with it. Africa, Asia, and most frequently Europe, contributed to the trade of the colonies. These 13 colonies gained independence from the British Empire in the late 18th century and quickly grew from colonial economies towards an economy focused on agriculture.

===19th century===

In 180 years, the United States grew to become a huge, integrated, and industrialized economy, which made up about a fifth of the world economy. In that process, the U.S. GDP per capita rose past that of many other countries, supplanting the British Empire at the top. The economy maintained high wages, attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world. In the 1820s and 1830s, mass production shifted much of the economy from artisans to factories. New government regulations strengthened patents.

Early in the 19th century, more than 80 percent of Americans engaged in farming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of the transformation of raw materials, with lumber and sawmills, textiles, and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich natural resources contributed to the rapid economic expansion of the nineteenth century. Ample land allowed the number of farmers to keep growing; but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation, and other sectors grew much faster, so that by 1860 the population was only about 50 percent rural, down from over 80 percent.

In the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with financial crises. The Panic of 1837 was followed by a five-year depression, marked by bank failures and unprecedented unemployment. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, it is difficult to compare the severity of modern recessions to that of early recessions. Recessions after World War II appear to have been less severe than earlier recessions, but the reasons for this are unclear.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the century, new innovations and improvements in existing innovations opened the door for improvements in the standard of living among American consumers. Many firms grew large by taking advantage of economies of scale and better communication to run nationwide operations. Concentration in these industries raised fears of monopolies that would drive prices higher and output lower, but many of these firms were cutting costs so fast that trends were towards lower prices and more output in these industries. Many workers shared the success of these large firms, which typically offered the highest wages in the world.

The United States has been the world&#x27;s largest national economy in terms of GDP since around 1890. For many years following the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the danger of recession appeared most serious, the government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the New Deal era that began in 1933 to the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s, national policymakers relied principally on fiscal policy to influence the economy.

During the world wars of the twentieth century, the United States fared better than the rest of the combatants because none of the First World War and relatively little of the Second World War were fought on American territory (and none on the then-48 states). Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes, and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled, and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military and paid half their wages; roughly half of those were sent into harm&#x27;s way.

The approach, advanced by British economist John Maynard Keynes, gave elected officials a leading role in directing the economy since spending and taxes are controlled by the U.S. president and Congress. The &quot;Baby Boom&quot; saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period 1942–1957; it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during the depression years, a surge in prosperity, a demand for suburban single-family homes (as opposed to inner city apartments), and new optimism about the future. The boom peaked around 1957 and then began to fade. A period of high inflation, interest rates, and unemployment after 1973 weakened confidence in fiscal policy as a tool for regulating the overall pace of economic activity.

The U.S. economy grew by an average of 3.8% from 1946 to 1973, while real median household income surged by 74% (or 2.1% a year).

Since the 1970s, several emerging countries have begun to close the economic gap with the United States. In most cases, this has been due to moving the manufacture of goods formerly made in the U.S. to countries where they could be made for sufficiently less money to cover the cost of shipping plus a higher profit. In other cases, some countries have gradually learned to produce the same products and services that previously only the U.S. and a few other countries could produce. Real income growth in the U.S. has slowed. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was popular in the U.S. to believe that Japan&#x27;s economy would surpass that of the U.S., but this did not occur.

===21st century===
The United States economy experienced a recession in 2001 with an unusually slow jobs recovery, with the number of jobs not regaining the February 2001 level until January 2005. This &quot;jobless recovery&quot; overlapped with the building of a housing bubble and arguably a wider debt bubble, as the ratio of household debt to GDP rose from a record level of 70% in Q1 2001 to 99% in Q1 2008. Homeowners were borrowing against their bubble-priced homes to fuel consumption, driving up their debt levels while providing an unsustainable boost to GDP. When housing prices began falling in 2006, the value of securities backed by mortgages fell dramatically, causing the equivalent of a bank run in the essentially unregulated non-depository banking system, which had outgrown the traditional, regulated depository banking system. Many mortgage companies and other non-depository banks (e.g., investment banks) faced a worsening crisis in 2007–2008, with the banking crisis peaking in September 2008, with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and bailouts of several other financial institutions.

The Bush administration (2001–2009) and Obama administrations (2009–2017) applied banking bailout programs and Keynesian stimulus via high government deficits, while the Federal Reserve maintained near-zero interest rates. These measures helped the economy recover, as households paid down debts in 2009–2012, the only years since 1947 where this occurred, presenting a significant barrier to recovery. Real GDP regained its pre-crisis (late 2007) peak by 2011, household net worth by Q2 2012, non-farm payroll jobs by May 2014, and the unemployment rate by September 2015. Each of these variables continued into post-recession record territory following those dates, with the U.S. recovery becoming the second longest on record in April 2018.

A significant recession, as defined lost economic output, occurred during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, when GDP fell by 5.0% from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009. Other significant recessions took place in 1957–1958, when GDP fell 3.7% following the 1973 oil crisis, with a 3.1% fall from late 1973 to early 1975, and in the 1981–1982 recession, when GDP dropped by 2.9%. Recent, mild recessions have included the 1990–1991 downturn, when output fell by 1.3%, and the 2001 recession, in which GDP slid by 0.3%; the 2001 downturn lasted just eight months. The most vigorous, sustained periods of growth, on the other hand, took place from early 1961 to mid-1969, with an expansion of 53% (5.1% a year), from mid-1991 to late 2000, at 43% (3.8% a year), and from late 1982 to mid-1990, at 37% (4% a year).

Debt held by the public, a measure of national debt, has risen throughout the 21st century. Rising from 31% in 2000 to 52% in 2009, and reaching 77% of GDP in 2017, the U.S. ranked 43rd highest in debt out of 207 countries.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
In the first two quarters of 2020 amid Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency, the U.S. economy suffered major setbacks beginning in March 2020, due to the novel coronavirus and having to &quot;shut-down&quot; major sectors of the American economy. As of March 2020, US exports of automobiles and industrial machines had plummeted as a result of the worldwide pandemic. Social distancing measures which took effect in March 2020, and which negatively impacted the demand for goods and services, resulted in the US GDP declining at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since the fourth quarter of 2008. US retails sales dropped a record 8.7% in March alone. The US airline industry had also been hit hard, seeing a sharp decline in its revenues. The COVID-19 recession has been widely described as the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression and &quot;far worse&quot; than the Great Recession.
In May 2020, CNN gave an analysis based on unemployment data that the US economy was perhaps the worst that it had been since the 1930s. By May 8, the US had reached a record 14.7 percent unemployment, with 20.5 million jobs lost in April. The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, warned that it may take &quot;an extended time&quot; before the US economy fully recovers from weak economic growth, due to the pandemic, and that in the foreseeable future the US can expect &quot;low productivity growth and stagnant incomes&quot;. By May 31, 2020, more than forty million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.

By June 2020, the slump in US continental flights due to the coronavirus pandemic had resulted in the US government temporarily halting service of fifteen US airlines to 75 domestic airports. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on June 10, 2020, that &quot;the United States budget deficit grew to a record $1.88trillion for the first eight months of this fiscal year.&quot;

The US economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, growing by 5.7%, which was its best performance since Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency (1981–1989).

2021–2022 marked a historical inflation surge in the United States, with the Consumer Price Index inflation rate hitting 9.1% higher in June 2022 than June 2021, constituting a 41-year high inflation rate with critics blaming the Federal Reserve among other factors. Inflation rate reached 4.9% in April 2023, which was roughly 3% above the Federal Reserve&#x27;s 2% target rate.

==Data==

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2023 (with IMF staff estimates in 2024–2029). Inflation below 5% is in green.


==GDP==


U.S. nominal GDP was $19.5trillion in 2017, the largest in the world. Annualized, nominal GDP reached $20.1trillion in Q1 2018, the first time it exceeded $20trillion. About 70% of U.S. GDP is personal consumption, with business investment 18%, government 17% (federal, state and local but excluding transfer payments such as Social Security, which is in consumption) and net exports a negative 3% due to the U.S. trade deficit. Real gross domestic product, a measure of both production and income, grew by 2.3% in 2017, vs. 1.5% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. Real GDP grew at a quarterly annualized rate of 2.2% in Q1 2018, 4.2% in Q2 2018, 3.4% in Q3 2018, and 2.2% in Q4 2018; the Q2 rate was the best growth rate since Q3 2014, and the overall yearly GDP growth of 2.9% in 2018 was the best performance of the economy in a decade. In 2020, the growth rate of the GDP has started to drop as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the GDP shrinking at a quarterized annual growth rate of −5.0% in Q1 2020 and −32.9% in Q2 2020, respectively.

As of 2014, China passed the U.S. as the largest economy in GDP (PPP) terms, measured at purchasing power parity conversion rates. The U.S. had the highest GDP (PPP) figures for more than a century prior to that milestone; China has more than tripled the U.S. growth rate for each of the past 40 years. As of 2017, the European Union as an aggregate had a GDP roughly 5% larger than the U.S., although the former is a political union not a country. The United States&#x27;, however, remained the world&#x27;s largest economy with the highest nominal GDP.

Real GDP per capita (measured in 2009 dollars) was $52,444 in 2017 and has been growing each year since 2010. It grew 3.0% per year on average in the 1960s, 2.1% in the 1970s, 2.4% in the 1980s, 2.2% in the 1990s, 0.7% in the 2000s, and 0.9% from 2010 to 2017. Reasons for slower growth since 2000 are debated by economists and may include aging demographics, slower population and growth in labor force, slower productivity growth, reduced corporate investment, greater income inequality reducing demand, lack of major innovations, and reduced labor power. The U.S. ranked 20th out of 220 countries in GDP per capita in 2017. Among the modern U.S. Presidents, Bill Clinton had the highest cumulative percent real GDP increase during his two terms, Reagan second and Obama third.

The development of the nation&#x27;s GDP according to World Bank: U.S. real GDP grew by an average of 1.7% from 2000 to the first half of 2014, a rate around half the historical average up to 2000.

==Employment==


There were approximately 160.4 million people in the U.S. labor force in 2017, the fourth largest labor force in the world behind China, India, and the European Union.
The government (federal, state and local) employed 22 million in 2010. Small businesses are the nation&#x27;s largest employer, representing 37% of American workers. The second-largest share of employment belongs to large businesses employing 36% of the U.S. workforce. White collar workers comprise 44% of the workforce as of 2022, up from 34% in 2000.

The nation&#x27;s private sector employs 85% of working Americans. Government accounts for 14% of all U.S. workers. Over 99% of all private employing organizations in the U.S. are small businesses. The 30 million small businesses in the U.S. account for 64% of newly created jobs (those created minus those lost). Jobs in small businesses accounted for 70% of those created in the last decade.

The proportion of Americans employed by small business versus large business has remained relatively the same year by year as some small businesses become large businesses and just over half of small businesses survive for more than five years. Amongst large businesses, several of the largest companies and employers in the world are American companies. Amongst them are Walmart, which is both the largest company and the largest private sector employer in the world. Walmart employs 2.1 million people worldwide and 1.4 million in the U.S. alone.
There are nearly thirty million small businesses in the U.S.. Minorities such as Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans (35% of the country&#x27;s population), own 4.1 million of the nation&#x27;s businesses. Minority-owned businesses generate almost $700billion in revenue, and they employ almost five million workers in the U.S.
Americans have the highest average employee income among OECD nations. The median household income in the U.S. as of 2008 is $52,029. About 284,000 working people in the U.S. have two full-time jobs and 7.6 million have part-time ones in addition to their full-time employments. Out of all working individuals in the U.S., 12% belong to a labor union and most union members work for the government. The decline of union membership in the U.S. over the last several decades parallels that of labor&#x27;s share of the economy. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is the only advanced economy that does not legally guarantee its workers paid vacation or paid sick days, and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. In 2014 and again in 2020, the International Trade Union Confederation graded the U.S. a 4out of5+, its third-lowest score, on the subject of powers and rights granted to labor unions. Similarly, a 2023 study published by Oxfam found that the United States ranks among the worst among developed countries for labor protections. Some scholars, including business theorist Jeffrey Pfeffer and political scientist Daniel Kinderman, posit that contemporary employment practices in the United States relating to the increased performance pressure from management, and the hardships imposed on employees such as toxic working environments, precarity, and long hours, could be responsible for 120,000 excess deaths annually, making the workplace the fifth leading cause of death in the United States.

===Unemployment===
As of December 2017, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was 4.1% or 6.6 million people. The government&#x27;s broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the part-time underemployed, was 8.1% or 8.2 million people. These figures were calculated with a civilian labor force of approximately 160.6 million people, relative to a U.S. population of approximately 327 million people.

Between 2009 and 2010, following the Great Recession, the emerging problem of jobless recoveries resulted in record levels of long-term unemployment with more than six million workers looking for work for more than six months as of January 2010. This particularly affected older workers. A year after the recession ended in June 2009, immigrants gained 656,000 jobs in the U.S., while U.S.-born workers lost more than a million jobs, due in part to an aging country (relatively more white retirees) and demographic shifts. In April 2010, the official unemployment rate was 9.9%, but the government&#x27;s broader U-6 unemployment rate was 17.1%. Between February 2008 and February 2010, the number of people working part-time for economic reasons (i.e., would prefer to work full-time) increased by 4.0 million to 8.8 million, an 83% increase in part-time workers during the two-year period.

By 2013, although the unemployment rate had fallen below 8%, the record proportion of long term unemployed and continued decreasing household income remained indicative of a jobless recovery. However, the number of payroll jobs returned to its pre-recession (November 2007) level by May 2014 as the economy recovered.

After being higher in the post-war period, the U.S. unemployment rate fell below the rising eurozone unemployment rate in the mid-1980s and has remained significantly lower almost continuously since. In 1955, 55% of Americans worked in services, between 30% and 35% in industry, and between 10% and 15% in agriculture. By 1980, over 65% were employed in services, between 25% and 30% in industry, and less than 5% in agriculture. Male unemployment continued to be significantly higher than those of females (at 9.8% vs. 7.5% in 2009). The unemployment among Caucasians continues being much lower than those for African-Americans (at 8.5% vs. 15.8% also in 2009).

The youth unemployment rate was 18.5% in July 2009, the highest rate in that month since 1948. The unemployment rate of young African Americans was 28.2% in May 2013.

The unemployment rate reached an all-time high of 14.7% in April 2020 before falling back to 11.1% in June 2020. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Q2 GDP in the US fell 32.9% in 2020. The unemployment rate continued its rapid decline falling to 3.9% in 2021.
It reached 3.7% in May 2023.

===Employment by sector===
U.S. employment, as estimated in 2012, is divided into 79.7% in the service sector, 19.2% in the manufacturing sector, and 1.1% in the agriculture sector.

==Income and wealth==


===Income measures===
Real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) median household income, a good measure of middle-class income, was $59,039 in 2016, a record level. However, it was just above the previous record set in 1998, indicating the purchasing power of middle-class family income has been stagnant or down for much of the past twenty years. During 2013, employee compensation was $8.969trillion, while gross private investment totals $2.781trillion.

Americans have the highest average household income among OECD nations, and in 2010 had the fourth-highest median household income, down from second-highest in 2007. According to one analysis middle-class incomes in the United States fell into a tie with those in Canada in 2010, and may have fallen behind by 2014, while several other advanced economies have closed the gap in recent years.

===Income inequality===
===Household net worth and wealth inequality===

As of Q4 2017, total household net worth in the United States was a record $99trillion, an increase of $5.2trillion from 2016. This increase reflects both stock market and housing price gains. This measure has been setting records since Q4 2012. If divided evenly, the $99trillion represents an average of $782,000 per household (for about 126.2 million households) or $302,000 per person. However, median household net worth (i.e., half of the families above and below this level) was $97,300 in 2016. The bottom 25% of families had a median net worth of zero, while the 25th to 50th percentile had a median net worth of $40,000.

Wealth inequality is more unequal than income inequality, with the top 1% households owning approximately 42% of the net worth in 2012, versus 24% in 1979. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, wealth inequality is at record highs; the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country&#x27;s wealth in 2016. The Boston Consulting Group posited in June 2017 report that 1% of the Americans will control 70% of country&#x27;s wealth by 2021.

The top 10% wealthiest possess 80% of all financial assets. Wealth inequality in the U.S. is greater than in most developed countries other than Sweden. Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a &quot;substantial head start&quot;. In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, &quot;over 60 percent&quot; of the Forbes richest 400 Americans &quot;grew up in substantial privilege&quot;. Median household wealth fell 35% in the U.S., from $106,591 to $68,839 between 2005 and 2011, due to the Great Recession, but has since recovered as indicated above.

About 30% of the entire world&#x27;s millionaire population resides in the United States (). The Economist Intelligence Unit estimated in 2008 that there were 16,600,000 millionaires in the U.S. Furthermore, 34% of the world&#x27;s billionaires are American (in 2011).

===Home ownership===

The U.S. home ownership rate in Q1 2018 was 64.2%, well below the all-time peak of 69.2% set in Q4 2004 during a housing bubble. Millions of homes were lost to foreclosure during the Great Recession of 2007–2009, bringing the ownership rate to a trough of 62.9% in Q2 2016. The average ownership rate from 1965 to 2017 was 65.3%.

The average home in the United States has more than 700 square feet per person (65 square meters), which is 50%–100% more than the average in other high-income countries. Similarly, ownership rates of gadgets and amenities are relatively high compared to other countries.

It was reported by Pew Research Center in 2016 that, for the first time in 130 years, Americans aged 18 to 34 are more likely to live with their parents than in any other housing situation.

In one study by ATTOM Data Solutions, in 70% of the counties surveyed, homes are increasingly unaffordable for the average U.S. worker.

As of 2018, the number of U.S. citizens residing in their vehicles increased in major cities with significantly higher than average housing costs such as Los Angeles, Portland and San Francisco.

According to CNBC, the median sale price for a U.S. home in 2017 was US$199,200. By February 2023, the median U.S. home sale price grew to US$392,000 according to Statista. The US has a country-wide housing shortage caused by insufficient housing construction (which declined severely after the 2008 Great Recession), and has caused rents and home prices to rise to increasingly unaffordable levels, with one estimate of the shortage being 3.8 million units in 2019, with this shortage having gotten worse during and since the pandemic.

As of January 2024, in roughly half of cities in the U.S., workers need incomes of $100,000 or more in order to purchase a home as a result of rising housing prices and interest rate hikes.

===Profits and wages===

Real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) for most workers in the United States and median incomes have either declined or remained stagnant for the last twenty to forty years. A 2020 microanalysis demonstrated that in the preceding four decades labor&#x27;s share of national output declined while over the same period the profit share of the same output increased.

In 1970, wages represented more than 51% of the U.S. GDP and profits were less than 5%. But by 2013, wages had fallen to 44% of the economy, while profits had more than doubled to 11%. Inflation-adjusted (&quot;real&quot;) per capita disposable personal income rose steadily in the U.S. from 1945 to 2008, but has since remained generally level.

In 2005, median personal income for those over the age of 18 ranged from $3,317 for an unemployed, married Asian American female to $55,935 for a full-time, year-round employed Asian American male. According to the U.S. Census men tended to have higher income than women while Asians and Whites earned more than African Americans and Hispanics. The overall median personal income for all individuals over the age of 18 was $24,062 ($32,140 for those age 25 or above) in the year 2005.

As a reference point, the minimum wage rate in 2009 and 2017 was $7.25 per hour or $15,080 for the 2080 hours in a typical work year. The minimum wage is a little more than the poverty level for a single person unit and about 50% of the poverty level for a family of four.

According to an October 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, real wages have been flat or falling for the last five decades for most U.S. workers, regardless of job growth. Bloomberg reported in July 2018 that real GDP per capita has grown substantially since the Great Recession.

An August 2017 survey by CareerBuilder found that eight out of ten U.S. workers live paycheck to paycheck. CareerBuilder spokesman Mike Erwin blamed &quot;stagnant wages and the rising cost of everything from education to many consumer goods&quot;. According to a survey by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the financial well-being of U.S. citizens, roughly half have trouble paying bills, and more than one third have faced hardships such as not being able to afford a place to live, running out of food, or not having enough money to pay for medical care. According to journalist and author Alissa Quart, the cost of living is rapidly outpacing the growth of salaries and wages, including those for traditionally secure professions such as teaching. She writes that &quot;middle-class life is now 30% more expensive than it was 20 years ago.&quot;

In February 2019, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that seven million U.S. citizens are three months or more behind on their car payments, setting a record. This is considered a red flag by economists, that Americans are struggling to pay bills in spite of a low unemployment rate. A May 2019 poll conducted by NPR found that among rural Americans, 40% struggle to pay for healthcare, food and housing, and 49% could not pay cash for a $1,000 emergency, and would instead choose to borrow in order to pay for such an unexpected emergency expense. Some experts assert that the US has experienced a &quot;two-tier recovery&quot;, which has benefitted 60% of the population, while the other 40% on the &quot;lower tier&quot; have been struggling to pay bills as the result of stagnant wages, increases in the cost of housing, education and healthcare, and growing debts.

A 2021 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that workers would have to make at least $24.90 an hour to be able to afford (meaning 30% of a person&#x27;s income or less) renting a standard two-bedroom home or $20.40 for a one-bedroom home anywhere in the US. The former is 3.4 times higher than the current federal minimum wage.

The USCB reported in September 2023 that incomes fell last year by 2.3% from 2021, which is the third consecutive year incomes have declined.

===Poverty===
Starting in the 1980s relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations, though analyses using a common data set for comparisons tend to find that the U.S. has a lower absolute poverty rate by market income than most other wealthy nations. Extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits, doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011, including 2.8 million children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels. As of 2015, 44 percent of children in the United States live with low-income families.

In 2016, 12.7% of the U.S. population lived in poverty, down from 13.5% in 2015. The poverty rate rose from 12.5% in 2007 before the Great Recession to a 15.1% peak in 2010, before falling back to just above the 2007 level. In the 1959–1962 period, the poverty rate was over 20%, but declined to the all-time low of 11.1% in 1973 following the War on Poverty begun during the Lyndon Johnson presidency. In June 2016, The IMF warned the United States that its high poverty rate needs to be tackled urgently.
The population in extreme-poverty neighborhoods rose by one third from 2000 to 2009. People living in such neighborhoods tend to suffer from inadequate access to quality education; higher crime rates; higher rates of physical and psychological ailment; limited access to credit and wealth accumulation; higher prices for goods and services; and constrained access to job opportunities. As of 2013, 44% of America&#x27;s poor are considered to be in &quot;deep poverty&quot;, with an income 50% or more below the government&#x27;s official poverty line.

According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were around 771,480 homeless people in the United States on a given night, or about 23 of every 10,000 people. Almost two thirds stayed in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program and the other third were living on the street, in an abandoned building, or another place not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2009. Around 44% of homeless people are employed. Homelessness increased from 2016 to 2020, along with deaths among the homeless population.

The United States has one of the least extensive social safety nets in the developed world, reducing both relative poverty and absolute poverty by considerably less than the mean for wealthy nations. Some experts posit that those in poverty live in conditions rivaling the developing world. A May 2018 report by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights found that over five million people in the United States live &quot;in &#x27;Third World&#x27; conditions&quot;. Poverty is the fourth leading risk factor for premature death annually, according to a 2023 study published in &quot;JAMA&quot;. Over the last three decades the poor in America have been incarcerated at a much higher rate than their counterparts in other developed nations, with penal confinement being &quot;commonplace for poor men of working age&quot;. Some scholars contend that the shift to neoliberal social and economic policies starting in the late 1970s has expanded the penal state, retrenched the social welfare state, deregulated the economy and criminalized poverty, ultimately &quot;transforming what it means to be poor in America&quot;.

Sociologist Matthew Desmond writes in his 2023 book &quot;Poverty, by America&quot; that the US &quot;offers some of the lowest wages in the industrialized world,&quot; which has &quot;swelled the ranks of the working poor, most of whom are thirty-five or older.&quot; Social scientist Mark Robert Rank asserts that the high rates of poverty in the U.S. can largely be explained as structural failures at the economic and political levels.

==Health care==


===Coverage===

The American system is a mix of public and private insurance. The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via Medicare, 62 million lower-income persons via Medicaid, and 15 million military veterans via the Veteran&#x27;s Administration. About 178 million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the Affordable Care Act or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran&#x27;s Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.

Multiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded Medicaid eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the &quot;ACA&quot; or &quot;Obamacare&quot;. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. This figure fell by 18.3 million (40%) to 27.3 million (8.6% of the under-65 population) by 2016.

However, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The Commonwealth Fund estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by four million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the North and East. Further, those 18 states that have not expanded Medicaid had a higher uninsured rate than those that did.

According to Physicians for a National Health Program, this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year. The group&#x27;s methodology has been criticized by John C. Goodman for not looking at cause of death or tracking insurance status changes over time, including the time of death. A 2009 study by former Clinton policy adviser Richard Kronick found no increased mortality from being uninsured after certain risk factors were controlled for.

===Outcomes===
The U.S. lags in overall healthcare performance but is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to nine of the top ten most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five. Since 1966, Americans have received more Nobel Prizes in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.

Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in 2013, the United States ranked at or near the top in obesity rate, frequency of automobile use and accidents, homicides, infant mortality rate, incidence of heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, recreational drug or alcohol deaths, injuries, and rates of disability. Together, such lifestyle and societal factors place the U.S. at the bottom of that list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country, though Americans who reach age 75 live longer than those who reach that age in peer nations. One consumption choice causing several of the maladies described above are cigarettes. Americans smoked 258 billion cigarettes in 2016. Cigarettes cost the United States $326billion each year in direct healthcare costs ($170billion) and lost productivity ($156billion).

A comprehensive 2007 study by European doctors found the five-year cancer survival rate was significantly higher in the U.S. than in all 21 European nations studied, 66.3% for men versus the European mean of 47.3% and 62.9% versus 52.8% for women. Americans undergo cancer screenings at significantly higher rates than people in other developed countries, and access MRI and CT scans at the highest rate of any OECD nation. People in the U.S. diagnosed with high cholesterol or hypertension access pharmaceutical treatments at higher rates than those diagnosed in other developed nations, and are more likely to successfully control the conditions. Diabetics are more likely to receive treatment and meet treatment targets in the U.S. than in Canada, England, or Scotland.

According to a 2018 study of 2016 data by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the U.S. was ranked 27th in the world for healthcare and education, down from 6th in 1990.

===Cost===
U.S. healthcare costs are considerably higher than other countries as a share of GDP, among other measures. According to the OECD, U.S. healthcare costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1trillion, about $3,000 per person or one-third higher relative to the next most expensive country.

The high cost of health care in the United States is attributed variously to technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than people in other countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from the full cost of treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to receive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a notable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more likely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other countries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to the fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private insurers and drug companies. Government plans often pay less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the privately insured through higher prices.

==Composition of economic sectors==


The United States is the world&#x27;s second-largest manufacturer, with a 2013 industrial output of US$2.4trillion. Its manufacturing output is greater than of Germany, France, India, and Brazil combined.
Its main industries include financials, information technology, petroleum, steel, automobiles, construction machinery, aerospace, agricultural machinery, telecommunications, chemicals, electronics, food processing, consumer goods, lumber, mining and armaments.

The U.S. leads the world in airplane manufacturing, which represents a large portion of U.S. industrial output. American companies such as Boeing, Cessna (see: Textron), Lockheed Martin (see: Skunk Works), and General Dynamics produce a majority of the world&#x27;s civilian and military aircraft in factories across the United States.

The manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has experienced substantial job losses over the past several years. In January 2004, the number of such jobs stood at 14.3 million, down by 3.0 million jobs (17.5%) since July 2000 and about 5.2 million since the historical peak in 1979. Employment in manufacturing was its lowest since July 1950. The number of steel workers fell from 500,000 in 1980 to 224,000 in 2000.

The U.S. produces approximately 18% of the world&#x27;s manufacturing output, a share that has declined as other nations developed competitive manufacturing industries. The job loss during this continual volume growth is the result of multiple factors including increased productivity, trade, and secular economic trends. In addition, growth in telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, heavy machinery and other industries along with declines in low end, low skill industries such as clothing, toys, and other simple manufacturing have resulted in some U.S. jobs being more highly skilled and better paying. There has been much debate within the United States on whether the decline in manufacturing jobs are related to American unions, lower foreign wages, or both.

Products include wheat, corn, other grains, fruits, vegetables, cotton; beef, pork, poultry, dairy products, forest products, and fish.

==Energy, transportation, and telecommunications==


===Transportation===
====Road====
The U.S. economy is heavily dependent on road transport for moving people and goods. Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of four million miles (6.4 million km) of public roads, including one of the world&#x27;s longest highway systems at 57,000 miles (91,700km). The world&#x27;s second-largest automobile market, the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans. About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.

====Rail====
Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partially due to the low population density throughout much of the nation. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. The state of California is currently constructing the nation&#x27;s first high-speed rail system.

====Airline====
The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by U.S. Airways. Of the world&#x27;s thirty busiest passenger airports, twelve are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

===Energy===

The US is the second-largest energy consumer in total use. The U.S. ranks seventh in energy consumption per capita after Canada and a number of other countries. The majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels: in 2005, it was estimated that 40% of the nation&#x27;s energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 23% from natural gas. Nuclear power supplied 8.4% and renewable energy supplied 6.8%, which was mainly from hydroelectric dams although other renewables are included.

American dependence on oil imports grew from 24% in 1970 to 65% by the end of 2005. Transportation has the highest consumption rates, accounting for approximately 69% of the oil used in the United States in 2006, and 55% of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report.

In 2013, the United States imported 2.808 billion barrels of crude oil, compared to 3.377 billion barrels in 2010. While the U.S. is the largest importer of fuel, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in 2011 that the country was about to become a net fuel exporter for the first time in 62 years. The paper reported expectations that this would continue until 2020. In fact, petroleum was the major export from the country in 2011.

===Telecommunications===

The Internet was developed in the U.S. and the country hosts many of the world&#x27;s largest hubs.

==International trade==


The United States is the world&#x27;s second-largest trading nation. There is a large amount of U.S. dollars in circulation all around the planet; about 60% of funds used in international trade are U.S. dollars. The dollar is also used as the standard unit of currency in international markets for commodities such as gold and petroleum.

The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, created one of the largest trade blocs in the world in 1994.

Since 1976, the U.S. has sustained merchandise trade deficits with other nations, and since 1982, current account deficits. The nation&#x27;s long-standing surplus in its trade in services was maintained, however, and reached a record US$231billion in 2013.

The U.S. trade deficit increased from $502billion in 2016 to $552billion in 2017, an increase of $50billion or 10%. During 2017, total imports were $2.90trillion, while exports were $2.35trillion. The net deficit in goods was $807billion, while the net surplus in services was $255billion.

Americas ten largest trading partners are China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Germany, South Korea, United Kingdom, France, India and Taiwan. The goods trade deficit with China rose from $347billion in 2016 to $376billion in 2017, an increase of $30billion or 8%. In 2017, the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $71billion with Mexico and $17billion with Canada.

According to the KOF index of globalization and the globalization index by A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Magazine, the U.S. has a relatively high degree of globalization. U.S. workers send a third of all remittances in the world.

==Financial position==

The U.S. public debt was $909billion in 1980, an amount equal to 33% of America&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP); by 1990, that number had more than tripled to $3.2trillion56% of GDP. In 2001 the national debt was $5.7trillion; however, the debt-to-GDP ratio remained at 1990 levels. Debt levels rose quickly in the following decade, and on January 28, 2010, the U.S. debt ceiling was raised to $14.3trillion. Based on the 2010 United States federal budget, total national debt will grow to nearly 100% of GDP, versus a level of approximately 80% in early 2009. The White House estimates that the government&#x27;s tab for servicing the debt will exceed $700billion a year in 2019, up from $202billion in 2009.

U.S. household and non-profit net worth exceeded $100trillion for the first time in Q1 2018; it has been setting records since Q4 2012. The U.S. federal government or &quot;national debt&quot; was $21.1trillion in May 2018, just over 100% GDP. Using a subset of the national debt called &quot;debt held by the public&quot;, U.S. debt was approximately 77% GDP in 2017. By this measure, the U.S. ranked 43rd highest among 2017 nations. Debt held by the public rose considerably as a result of the Great Recession and its aftermath. It is expected to continue rising as the country ages towards 100% GDP by 2028. In February 2024, the total federal government debt grew to $34.4 trillion after having grown by approximately $1 trillion in both of two separate 100-day periods since the previous June.

The U.S. Treasury statistics indicate that, at the end of 2006, non-US citizens and institutions held 44% of federal debt held by the public. , China, holding $1.26trillion in treasury bonds, is the largest foreign financier of the U.S. public debt.

The overall financial position of the United States as of 2014 includes $269.6trillion of assets owned by households, businesses, and governments within its borders, representing more than 15.7 times the annual gross domestic product of the United States. Debts owed during this same period amounted to $145.8trillion, about 8.5 times the annual gross domestic product.

Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates on government debt. Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate, occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk. American economist Lawrence Summers argues that at such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money, and improves creditworthiness.

In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low. In January 2012, the U.S. Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association unanimously recommended that government debt be allowed to auction even lower, at negative absolute interest rates.

==Currency and central bank==

The United States dollar is the unit of currency of the United States. The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions. Several countries use it as their official currency, and in many others it is the de facto currency.

The federal government attempts to use both monetary policy (control of the money supply through mechanisms such as changes in interest rates) and fiscal policy (taxes and spending) to maintain low inflation, high economic growth, and low unemployment. An independent central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was formed in 1913 to provide a stable currency and monetary policy. The U.S. dollar has been regarded as one of the more stable currencies in the world and many nations back their own currency with U.S. dollar reserves.

The U.S. dollar has maintained its position as the world&#x27;s primary reserve currency, although it is gradually being challenged in that role. Almost two thirds of currency reserves held around the world are held in U.S. dollars, compared to around 25% for the next most popular currency, the euro. Rising U.S. national debt and quantitative easing has caused some to predict that the U.S. dollar will lose its status as the world&#x27;s reserve currency; however, these predictions have not yet come to fruition.

==Climate change==

==Corruption==

In 2019, the United States was ranked 23rd on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index with a score of 69 out of 100.
This is a decrease from its score in 2018 which was 71 out of 100.

==Law and government==
The United States ranked 4th in the ease of doing business index in 2012, 18th in the Economic Freedom of the World index by the Fraser Institute in 2012, 10th in the Index of Economic Freedom by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and The Heritage Foundation in 2012, 15th in the 2014 Global Enabling Trade Report, and 3rd on the Global Competitiveness Report.

According to the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, released by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and The Heritage Foundation, the U.S. has dropped out of the top ten most economically free countries. The U.S. has been on a steady seven-year economic freedom decline and is the only country to do so. The index measures each nation&#x27;s commitment to free enterprise on a scale of 0 to 100. Countries losing economic freedom and receiving low index scores are at risk of economic stagnation, high unemployment rates, and diminishing social conditions. The 2014 Index of Economic Freedom gave the United States a score of 75.5 and is listed as the twelfth-freest economy in world. It dropped two rankings and its score is half a point lower than in 2013.

Economist Alan S. Blinder criticizes democratic government regulation of the U.S. economy as too short-sighted (targeting either the next election or the next news cycle rather than making difficult choices that favor long-term benefits despite short-term pain) and favoring policies that sound good and avoiding those that sound bad, regardless of merit when examined rigorously by economists.

===Regulations===


The U.S. federal government regulates private enterprise in numerous ways. Regulation falls into two general categories.

Some efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated monopolies such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries—trucking and, later, airlines—successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called regulatory capture.

Another form of economic regulation, antitrust law, seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government—and, sometimes, private parties—have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.

Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared to other G10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.

Since the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public&#x27;s health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.

American attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.

While leaders of America&#x27;s two most influential political parties generally favored economic deregulation during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with free enterprise, increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.

Where legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the 1990s, individuals, and eventually the government itself, sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement provided states with long-term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking-related illnesses.

Between 2000 and 2008, economic regulation in the United States saw the most rapid expansion since the early 1970s. The number of new pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, rose from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100million a year, increased by 70%. Spending on regulation increased by 62% from $26.4billion to $42.7billion.

===Taxation===
Taxation in the United States is a complex system which may involve payment to at least four different levels of government and many methods of taxation. Taxes are levied by the federal government, by the state governments, and often by local governments, which may include counties, municipalities, township, school districts, and other special-purpose districts, which include fire, utility, and transit districts.

Forms of taxation include taxes on income, property, sales, imports, payroll, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. When taxation by all government levels taken into consideration, the total taxation as percentage of GDP was approximately a quarter of GDP in 2011. Share of black market in the U.S. economy is very low compared to other countries.

Although a federal wealth tax is prohibited by the United States Constitution unless the receipts are distributed to the States by their populations, state and local government property tax amount to a wealth tax on real estate, and because capital gains are taxed on nominal instead of inflation-adjusted profits, the capital gains tax amounts to a wealth tax on the inflation rate.

U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially at the federal level, and is among the most progressive in the developed world. There is debate over whether taxes should be more or less progressive.

According to the Tax Justice Network in 2022, the US fuels more global financial secrecy than Switzerland, Cayman and Bermuda combined.

===Expenditure===

The United States public-sector spending amounts to about 38% of GDP (federal is around 21%, state and local the remainder). Each level of government provides many direct services. The federal government, for example, is responsible for national defense, research that often leads to the development of new products, conducts space exploration, and runs numerous programs designed to help workers develop workplace skills and find jobs (including higher education). Government spending has a significant effect on local and regional economies, and on the overall pace of economic activity.

State governments, meanwhile, are responsible for the construction and maintenance of most highways. State, county, or city governments play the leading role in financing and operating public schools. Local governments are primarily responsible for police and fire protection. In 2016, U.S. state and local governments owed $3trillion and have another $5trillion in unfunded liabilities.

The welfare system in the United States began in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, with the passage of the New Deal. The welfare system was later expanded in the 1960s through Great Society legislation, which included Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act and federal education funding.

Overall, federal, state, and local spending accounted for almost 28% of gross domestic product in 1998.

===Federal budget and debt===

During FY2017, the federal government spent $3.98trillion on a budget or cash basis, up $128billion or 3.3% vs. FY2016 spending of $3.85trillion. Major categories of FY 2017 spending included: Healthcare such as Medicare and Medicaid ($1,077B or 27% of spending), Social Security ($939B or 24%), non-defense discretionary spending used to run federal Departments and Agencies ($610B or 15%), Defense Department ($590B or 15%), and interest ($263B or 7%).

During FY2017, the federal government collected approximately $3.32trillion in tax revenue, up $48billion or 1.5% versus FY2016. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,587billion or 48% of total receipts), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,162billion or 35%), and corporate taxes ($297billion or 9%). Other revenue types included excise, estate and gift taxes. FY 2017 revenues were 17.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), versus 17.7% in FY 2016. Tax revenues averaged approximately 17.4% GDP over the 1980–2017 period.

The federal budget deficit (i.e., expenses greater than revenues) was $665billion in FY2017, versus $585billion in 2016, an increase of $80billion or 14%. The budget deficit was 3.5% GDP in 2017, versus 3.2% GDP in 2016. The budget deficit is forecast to rise to $804billion in FY 2018, due significantly to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other spending bills. An aging country and healthcare inflation are other drivers of deficits and debt over the long-run.

Debt held by the public, a measure of national debt, was approximately $14.7trillion or 77% of GDP in 2017, ranked the 43rd highest out of 207 countries. This debt, as a percent of GDP, is roughly equivalent to those of many western European nations.

==Business culture==
A central feature of the U.S. economy is the economic freedom afforded to the private sector by allowing the private sector to make the majority of economic decisions in determining the direction and scale of what the U.S. economy produces. This is enhanced by relatively low levels of regulation and government involvement, as well as a court system that generally protects property rights and enforces contracts. Today, the United States is home to 29.6 million small businesses, thirty percent of the world&#x27;s millionaires, forty percent of the world&#x27;s billionaires, and 139 of the world&#x27;s 500 largest companies.
From its emergence as an independent nation, the United States has encouraged science and innovation. In the early 20th century, the research developed through informal cooperation between U.S. industry and academia grew rapidly and by the late 1930s exceeded the size of that taking place in Britain (although the quality of U.S. research was not yet on par with British and German research at the time). After World War II, federal spending on defense R&amp;D and antitrust policy played a significant role in U.S. innovation.

The United States is rich in mineral resources and fertile farm soil, and it is fortunate to have a moderate climate. It also has extensive coastlines on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as on the Gulf of Mexico. Rivers flow from far within the continent and the Great Lakes (the five large inland lakes along the Canadian border) provide additional shipping access. These extensive waterways have helped shape the country&#x27;s economic growth over the years and helped bind America&#x27;s fifty individual states together in a single economic unit.

The number of workers and, more importantly, their productivity help determine the health of the U.S. economy. Consumer spending in the U.S. rose to about 62% of GDP in 1960, where it stayed until about 1981, and has since risen to 71% in 2013. Throughout its history, the United States has experienced steady growth in the labor force, a phenomenon that is both cause and effect of almost constant economic expansion. Until shortly after World War I, most workers were immigrants from Europe, their immediate descendants, or African Americans who were mostly slaves taken from Africa, or their descendants.

==Demographic shift==

Beginning in the late 20th century, many Latin Americans immigrated, followed by large numbers of Asians after the removal of nation-origin based immigration quotas. The promise of high wages brings many highly skilled workers from around the world to the United States, as well as millions of illegal immigrants seeking work in the informal economy. More than 13 million people officially entered the United States during the 1990s alone.
Labor mobility has also been important to the capacity of the American economy to adapt to changing conditions. When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from southern farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the Great Migration.

In the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of mass production, corporations, such as General Electric, have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Today in the era of globalization, American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the Hoover Dam), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.

===Aging===

The U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve&#x27;s ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).

The Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages. The population aged 65 or older is projected to rise by one-third from 2019–2029. Mandatory program spending (outlays) in 2019 were 12.7% of GDP and are projected to average 14.4% GDP from 2025–2029.

==Entrepreneurship==


The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison&#x27;s laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. Edison&#x27;s company would also pioneer (direct current based) electric power delivery and market it around the world, followed on by companies such as Westinghouse Electric Corporation which would rapidly develop alternating current power delivery. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.

American society highly emphasizes entrepreneurship and business. Entrepreneurship is the act of being an entrepreneur, which can be defined as &quot;one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to transform innovations into economic goods&quot;. This may result in new organizations or may be part of revitalizing mature organizations in response to a perceived opportunity. American entrepreneurs are even engaged in public services delivery through public-private partnerships.

The most obvious form of entrepreneurship refers to the process and engagement of starting new businesses (referred to as startup companies); however, in recent years, the term has been extended to include social and political forms of entrepreneurial activity. When entrepreneurship is describing activities within a firm or large organization it is referred to as intra-preneurship and may include corporate venturing, when large entities spin-off organizations.

According to Paul Reynolds, entrepreneurship scholar and creator of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, &quot;by the time they reach their retirement years, half of all working men in the United States probably have a period of self-employment of one or more years; one in four may have engaged in self-employment for six or more years. Participating in a new business creation is a common activity among U.S. workers over the course of their careers.&quot; And in recent years, business creation has been documented by scholars such as David Audretsch to be a major driver of economic growth in both the United States and Western Europe.
==Venture capital investment==

Venture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States, which it still dominates. According to the National Venture Capital Association 11% of private sector jobs come from venture capital backed companies and venture capital backed revenue accounts for 21% of U.S. GDP.

Total U.S. investment in venture capital amounted to $48.3billion in 2014, for 4,356 deals. This represented &quot;an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year&quot;, reported the National Venture Capital Association. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully recovered by 2014 to pre-recession levels. The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1,799, for an investment of $19.8billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9billion in investment through 1,005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the state of California, which alone concentrates 28% of U.S. research.

Some new American businesses raise investments from angel investors (venture capitalists). In 2010 healthcare/medical accounted for the largest share of angel investments, with 30% of total angel investments (vs. 17% in 2009), followed by software (16% vs. 19% in 2007), biotech (15% vs. 8% in 2009), industrial/energy (8% vs. 17% in 2009), retail (5% vs. 8% in 2009) and IT services (5%). 

Americans are &quot;venturesome consumers&quot; who are unusually willing to try new products of all sorts, and to pester manufacturers to improve their products.

==Mergers and acquisitions==

Since 1985 there have been three major waves of M&amp;A in the U.S. (see graph &quot;Mergers and Acquisitions in the U.S. since 1985&quot;). 2017 has been the most active year in terms of number of deals (12,914), whereas 2015 cumulated to the biggest overall value of deals ($24billion).

The biggest merger deal in U.S. history was the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online Inc. in 2000, where the bid was over $164billion. Since 2000 acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese investors increased by 368%. The other way round—U.S. companies acquiring Chinese Companies—showed a decrease of 25%, with a short upwards trend until 2007.

==Research and development==
The U.S. invests more funds in research and development (R&amp;D) in absolute terms than the other G7 nations combined: 17.2% more in 2012. Since 2000, gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) in the U.S. has increased by 31.2%, enabling it to maintain its share of GERD among the G7 nations at 54.0% (54.2% in 2000).

===Impact of recession on research spending===
Generally speaking, U.S. investment in R&amp;D rose with the economy in the first years of the century before receding slightly during the economic recession then rising again as growth resumed. At its peak in 2009, GERD amounted to US$406billion (2.82% of GDP). Despite the recession, it was still at 2.79% in 2012 and will slide only marginally to 2.73% in 2013, according to provisional data, and should remain at a similar level in 2014.

The federal government is the primary funder of basic research, at 52.6% in 2012; state governments, universities and other non-profits funded 26%. Experimental development, on the other hand, is primarily funded by industry: 76.4% to the federal government&#x27;s 22.1% in 2012.

While U.S. investment in R&amp;D is high, it failed to reach President Obama&#x27;s target of 3% of GDP by the end of his presidency in 2016. Between 2009 and 2012, the United States&#x27; world share of research expenditure receded slightly from 30.5% to 28.1%. Several countries now devote more than 4% of GDP to R&amp;D (Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and others plan to raise their own GERD/GDP ratio to 4% by 2020 (Finland and Sweden).

===Business spending on research===
Business enterprises contributed 59.1 % of U.S. GERD in 2012, down from 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute a small fraction of total R&amp;D, 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively. The United States has historically been a leader in business R&amp;D and innovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&amp;D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business &#x27;deaths&#x27; began overtaking the number of business &#x27;births&#x27; and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&amp;D spending were in agriculture production: −3.5% compared to the average R&amp;D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&amp;D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&amp;D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&amp;D had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.

===Research spending at the state level===

The level of research spending varies considerably from one state to another. Six states (New Mexico, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, California and Michigan) each devoted 3.9% or more of their GDP to R&amp;D in 2010, together contributing 42% of national research expenditure. In 2010, more than one quarter of R&amp;D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts (5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas (5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%). Seven states (Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming) devoted less than 0.8% of GDP to R&amp;D.
California is home to Silicon Valley, the name given to the area hosting the leading corporations and start-ups in information technology. This state also hosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are the cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington, DC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&amp;D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

New Mexico&#x27;s high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland&#x27;s position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.

===Research spending by multinational corporations===
The federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&amp;D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by &quot;[[The Wall Street Journal]]&quot; in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&amp;D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.

In 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&amp;D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.

===Exports of high-tech goods and patents===

Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.

The United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States&#x27; technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States&#x27; scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.

When it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6billion in 2013. The United States&#x27; payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4billion).

==Notable companies and markets==

America&#x27;s largest companies are ranked every year by revenue in the &quot;[[Fortune 500]]&quot;. Between 2000 and 2022&#x27;s edition of the list, the top spot on the Fortune 500 was occupied by either the auto manufacturer [[General Motors]] (GM), the oil and gas giant [[ExxonMobil]], or the retailer [[Walmart]]. The US is also home of many of the world&#x27;s largest companies by [[market capitalization]]; , the largest American companies by market cap are [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] (through holding company [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]]), [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[Nvidia]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], ExxonMobil, and [[Meta Platforms]]. Moreover, many of these companies are the most valuable brands, with many of the largest companies by revenue and market cap on the annual ranking of most valuable brands by [[Forbes]] being joined by [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], and [[McDonald&#x27;s]].

Some industries within America are defined by a few major companies, often deriving terms such as &quot;Big Three&quot; or &quot;Big Four&quot;. Examples of this phenomenon include the Big Three credit reporting agencies ([[Equifax]], [[Experian]], and [[TransUnion]]), the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile makers]] ([[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors]], and [[Stellantis]]), the [[Big Four accounting firms]] ([[Deloitte]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[KPMG]], and [[PwC]]), and the Big Four communications carriers ([[Verizon Communications|Verizon]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]]/[[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], and [[Dish Network]]).
The [[Energy in the United States|American energy industry]] is among the largest and consists of large companies in [[Petroleum industry|oil, natural gas]], [[Coal mining in the United States|coal]], and renewable energy sources. America&#x27;s largest energy companies by market are in oil and gas, with ExxonMobil being joined by [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[ConocoPhillips]], and [[Schlumberger]]; British oil companies [[BP]] and [[Shell plc|Shell]] also have significant presence in the United States and trade on both the [[London Stock Exchange]] and [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Many large American petroleum companies, as well as BP, can trace some origin back to [[Standard Oil]], a former monopoly run by [[John D. Rockefeller]]. In coal, the $30 billion industry is dominated by [[Peabody Energy]], which is the largest coal company in the world with almost $23 billion in revenue for 2021. Much of the nation&#x27;s coal mining occurs in Wyoming and Appalachian states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.

A 2012 Deloitte report published in &quot;STORES&quot; magazine indicated that of the world&#x27;s top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010, 32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32% accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.

America is the foremost country in the world when it comes to semiconductor production. In 2011, half of the world&#x27;s 20 largest semiconductor manufacturers by sales were based in America. More recently, Congress under the [[presidency of Joe Biden]] passed a bipartisan bill, the [[CHIPS and Science Act]], which bolstered semiconductor production. Some of America&#x27;s largest semiconductor firms and chip companies are [[Broadcom Inc.|Broadcom]], [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and [[Qualcomm]].

Many of the United States&#x27; largest firms by market cap are technology companies. These companies are dominated by the [[Big Tech|Big Five tech giants]] (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta), though numerous software firms also dominate the American technology industry. These firms range from hardware manufacturers like [[Dell Technologies]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and [[Cisco]], to software and computing infrastructure programmers like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Salesforce]], [[Adobe Inc.|Adobe]], and [[Intuit]].

In film, American producers create nearly all of [[List of highest-grossing films|the world&#x27;s highest-grossing films]]. Many of [[List of best-selling music artists|the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists]] are based in the United States. Some of America&#x27;s largest media companies are The Walt Disney Company, [[Warner Bros. Discovery]], [[Netflix]], [[Comcast]], [[Paramount Global]], and [[Fox Corporation|Fox]].

==Finance==

Measured by [[market capitalization|value]] of its listed companies&#x27; [[Security (finance)|securities]], the [[New York Stock Exchange]] is more than three times larger than any other stock exchange in the world. As of October 2008, the combined [[Market capitalization|capitalization]] of all domestic NYSE listed companies was US$10.1trillion. [[NASDAQ]] is another American [[stock exchange]] and the world&#x27;s third-largest exchange after the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and Japan&#x27;s [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. However, NASDAQ&#x27;s [[Market value|trade value]] is larger than Japan&#x27;s TSE. NASDAQ is the largest [[Electronic visual display|electronic screen-based]] [[Share capital|equity securities]] trading market in the U.S. With approximately 3,800 companies and corporations, it has more trading volume per hour than any other stock exchange.

Because of the influential role that the U.S. stock market plays in [[international finance]], a [[New York University]] study in late 2014 interprets that in the short run, stocks that affect the willingness to bear risk independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most of the variation in the U.S. stock market. In the long run, the U.S. stock market is profoundly affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks, however, play a small role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the U.S. stock market.

The U.S. [[finance industry]] comprised only 10% of total non-farm business profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry&#x27;s proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City&#x27;s finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.

Top ten U.S. banks by assets

A 2012 [[International Monetary Fund]] study concluded that the U.S. financial sector has grown so large that it is slowing [[economic growth]]. New York University economist [[Thomas Philippon]] supported those findings, estimating that the U.S. spends $300billion too much on financial services per year, and that the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of Chicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers in research and development add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry workers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 for every dollar they are paid. A study by the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reached similar conclusions, saying the finance industry impedes economic growth and research and development based industries.

<text>Communications in the United States include extensive industries and distribution networks in print and telecommunication. The primary telecom regulator of communications in the United States is the Federal Communications Commission.

== History ==

American inventors and entrepreneurs made substantial contributions to development and commercialization of the radio, telephone, and television. The Internet protocol suite was developed with U.S. government funding.

== Regulation ==
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent government agency responsible for regulating the radio, television and phone industries. The FCC regulates all interstate communications, such as wire, satellite and cable, and international communications originating or terminating in the United States.

Significant laws in the history of U.S. telecommunications include:
* Wireless Ship Act of 1910, the first radio regulations
* Mann–Elkins Act of 1910, granting the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to regulate telephones, telegraphs, and wireless telegraphs
* Radio Act of 1912, the first to require radio licenses
* Radio Act of 1927, which created the Federal Radio Commission
* Communications Act of 1934, creating the FCC and moving phone and radio regulation there
* All-Channel Receiver Act (1962), requiring that televisions include UHF and not just VHF receivers
* Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, establishing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funded the creation of PBS and NPR
* Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, requiring carriage of local broadcast channels free of charge
* Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which gave municipalities the power to grant cable television monopolies
* Satellite Home Viewer Act (US) (1988)
* Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which required telecom providers assist the government in authorized wiretapping
* Telecommunications Act of 1996, including the Communications Decency Act
* Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (1998)
* Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998)
* Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act (1999), updating regulations for 9-1-1

Several laws relate to unsolicited commercial communications:
* Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991
* CAN-SPAM Act of 2003
* Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005
* Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009

The FCC fairness doctrine regulation was in place from 1949 to 1987.

== Press ==

Newspapers declined in their influence and penetration into American households in the late 20th century. Most newspapers are local, having little circulation outside their particular metropolitan area. The closest thing to a national paper the U.S. has is &quot;USA Today&quot;. Other influential dailies include &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; which are sold in most U.S. cities.

The largest newspapers (by circulation) in the United States are &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

== Mail ==

The legal monopoly of the government-owned United States Postal Service has narrowed during the 20th and 21st centuries due to competition from companies such as UPS &amp; FedEx, although still delivers the vast majority of US mail.

== Telephone ==

In 1890, 1 percent of U.S. households owned at least one telephone while a majority did by 1946 and 75 percent did by 1957.

Telephone system:
&quot;General assessment&quot;: A large, technologically advanced, multipurpose communications system.
&quot;Domestic:&quot; A large system of fiber-optic cable, microwave radio relay, coaxial cable, and domestic satellites carries every form of telephone traffic; a rapidly growing cellular system carries mobile telephone traffic throughout the country.
&quot;International:&quot; Country code - 1; 24 ocean cable systems in use; satellite earth stations - 61 Intelsat (45 Atlantic Ocean and 16 Pacific Ocean), 5 Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region), and 4 Inmarsat (Pacific and Atlantic Ocean regions) (2000).

=== Landlines ===
Telephones - main lines in use: 141 million (2009)

* Most of the American telephone system was formerly operated by a single monopoly, AT&amp;T, which was divided in 1984 into a long-distance telephone company and seven regional &quot;Baby Bells&quot;.
* Landline telephone service continues to be divided between incumbent local exchange carriers and several competing long-distance companies. As of 2005, some of the Baby Bells are beginning to merge with long-distance phone companies. A small number of consumers are currently experimenting with Voice over Internet Protocol phone service.
* Most local loop service to homes is provided through old-fashioned copper wire, although many of the providers have upgraded the so-called &quot;last mile&quot; to fiber optic.
* Early in the 21st century the number of wire lines in use stopped growing and in some markets began to decline.

=== Cellular/Wireless communication ===
Telephones - mobile cellular: 286 million (2009)
* Most states have several competing cellular phone networks.
* The major cellphone companies in the U.S. are Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T Mobility, and T-Mobile US.

== Radio ==

In 1923, 1 percent of U.S. households owned at least one radio receiver while a majority did by 1931 and 75 percent did by 1937.

Radio broadcast stations: AM: 4,669; FM commercial stations: 6,746; FM educational stations: 4,101; FM translators &amp; boosters: 7,253; low-power FM stations: 1,678 (as of December 31, 2016, according to the Federal Communications Commission)

* Most broadcast stations are controlled by large media conglomerates like iHeartMedia. There are also many small independent local stations. National Public Radio (NPR) is the public radio network.

Radios: 575 million (1997)

== Television ==

In 1948, 1 percent of U.S. households owned at least one television while 75 percent did by 1955, and by 1992, 60 percent of all U.S. households received cable television subscriptions. In 1980, 1 percent of U.S. households owned at least one videocassette recorder while 75 percent did by 1992.

Television broadcast stations: 7,533 (of which 1,778 are full-power TV stations; 417 are class-A TV stations; 3,789 are TV translators; and 1,966 are other low-power TV stations) (as of December 31, 2016, according to the Federal Communications Commission); in addition, there are about 12,000 cable TV systems.

* Most local commercial television stations are owned-and-operated by or affiliated with the large national broadcast networks such as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), CBS, the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and The CW Television Network. Some television networks are aimed at ethnic minorities, including Spanish-language networks Univisión and Telemundo. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is the country&#x27;s main public broadcasting network, with over 300 non-profit affiliated stations across the United States. Besides the large broadcast networks (which are &quot;free&quot; for anyone with a TV and an antenna), there are also many networks available only with a subscription to cable or satellite television, like CNN.

Televisions: 219 million (1997)

== Internet ==
In 1984, 8 percent of U.S. households owned at least one personal computer, while 18 percent of U.S. households had internet access in 1997. In 2000, a majority of U.S. households owned at least one personal computer and had internet access the following year, while more than 75 percent of U.S. households owned a personal computer by 2011 and had internet access by 2014. By 2021, more than 95 percent of U.S. households owned a personal computer and 90 percent had internet access.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs): 7,600 (1999 est.)

* Because of aggressive lobbying and the United States&#x27; strong libertarian traditions, the Internet service provider industry remains relatively unregulated in comparison to other communications industries.

Country code (Top level domain): US

* For various historical reasons, the .us domain was never widely used outside of a small number of government agencies and school districts. Most companies signed up for top level domains like .com instead.
* NeuStar Inc. now has control over the .us registry and is trying to promote the domain as an option for American-oriented Web sites.

<doc id="32024" wikidata="Q1203915" url="?curid=32024" title="Transportation in the United States">
<text>The vast majority of passenger travel in the United States occurs by automobile for shorter distances and airplane or railroad for longer distances. Most cargo in the U.S. is transported by, in descending order, railroad, truck, pipeline, or boat; air shipping is typically used only for perishables and premium express shipments. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

==Ownership and jurisdiction==
The overwhelming majority of roads in the United States are owned and maintained by state and local governments. Federally maintained roads are generally found only on federal lands (such as national parks) and at federal facilities (like military bases). The Interstate Highway System is partly funded by the federal government but owned and maintained by individual state governments. There are a few private highways in the United States, which use tolls to pay for construction and maintenance. There are many local private roads, generally serving remote or insular residences.

Passenger and freight rail systems, bus systems, water ferries, and dams may be under either public or private ownership and operation. Civilian airlines are all privately owned. Most airports are owned and operated by local government authorities, but there are also some private airports. The Transportation Security Administration has provided security at most major airports since 2001.

The U.S. Department of Transportation and its divisions provide regulation, supervision, and funding for all aspects of transportation, except for customs, immigration, and security, which are the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Each state has its own Department of Transportation, which builds and maintains state highways, and depending upon the state, may either directly operate or supervise other modes of transportation.

Aviation law is almost entirely the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal government, and automobile traffic laws are enacted and enforced by state and local authorities except on highways or roads on federal property or in unorganized territories. Economic jurisdiction over tidelands is shared between the state and federal governments, while the United States Coast Guard is the primary enforcer of law and security on U.S. waterways.

==Mode share==
===Passenger===

Passenger transportation is dominated by a network of over 3.9 million miles of highways which is pervasive and highly developed by global standards. Passenger transportation is dominated by passenger vehicles (including cars, trucks, vans, and motorcycles), which account for 86% of passenger-miles traveled. The remaining 14% was handled by planes, trains, and buses. Public transit use is highly concentrated in large older cities, with only six above 25% and only New York City above 50% of trips on transit. Airlines carry almost all non-commuter intercity traffic, except the Northeast Corridor where Amtrak carries more than all airlines combined.

The world&#x27;s second largest automobile market, the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 865 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.

Bicycle usage is minimal with the American Community Survey reporting that bicycle commuting had a 0.61% mode share in 2012 (representing 856,000 American workers nationwide).
===Cargo===
Freight transportation is carried by a variety of networks. The largest percentage of US freight is carried by trucks (60%), followed by pipelines (18%), rail (10%), ship (8%), and air (0.01%). Other modes of transportation, such as parcels and intermodal freight accounted for about 3% of the remainder. Air freight is commonly used only for perishables and premium express shipments. The difference in percentage of rail&#x27;s share by ton-miles and by weight (10% vs 38%) is accounted for by the extreme efficiency of trains. A single railroad locomotive may pull fifty boxcars full of freight while a truck only pulls one. Trucks surpass trains in the weight category due their greater numbers, while trains surpass trucks in the ton-miles category due to the vast distances they travel carrying large amounts of freight.

Usually cargo, apart from petroleum and other bulk commodities, is imported in containers through seaports, then distributed by road and rail. The quasi-governmental United States Postal Service has a monopoly on letter delivery (except for express services) but several large private companies such as FedEx and UPS compete in the package and cargo delivery market.

==Safety==
The U.S. government&#x27;s National Center for Health Statistics reported 33,736 motor vehicle traffic deaths in 2014. This exceeded the number of firearm deaths, which was 33,599 in 2014.

In 2020 there was % more road fatalities in the US than in the European Union, or % less in the EU than in the US, with nearly 38,680 in the US, and nearly 18,800 in the EU.

==History==
===18th century===
In the late 18th century, overland transportation was by horse, while water and river transportation was primarily by sailing vessel. The United States population was centered on its Atlantic coast, with all major population centers located on a natural harbor or navigable waterway. Low population density between these centers resulted in a heavy reliance on coastwise and riverboat shipping. 

The first government expenditures on highway transportation were funded to speed the delivery of overland mail, such as the Boston Post Road between New York City and Boston. Due to the distances between these population centers and the cost to maintain the roads, many highways in the late 18th century and early 19th century were private turnpikes. 

Other highways were mainly unimproved and impassable by wagon at least some of the year. Economic expansion in the late 18th century to early 19th century spurred the building of canals to speed goods to market. One such prominent example was the Erie Canal.

=== 19th century ===
Numerous modes of transportation fought for supremacy throughout the Industrial revolution of the 19th century. Canals swiftly took the role of turnpikes, stagecoaches, and wagon routes, which in turn were shortly replaced by steam-powered riverboats. During this period, the advancement in transportation inspired many artists to display the grand contrast from the past to the new. Taking a look at Samuel Colman&#x27;s work, one piece in particular, &quot;Storm King on the Hudson&quot; (1866) displayed both the older sailboats and the grand steamboats that were overtaking the Hudson River.

Access to water transportation shaped the geography of early settlements and boundaries. For example, the Erie Canal escalated the boundary dispute called the Toledo War between Ohio and Michigan in the 1830s. The disputed Erie Triangle was awarded to Pennsylvania, giving that state access to Lake Erie. Most of West Florida was given to Mississippi and Alabama to guarantee their access to the Gulf of Mexico.

Development of the mid-western and southern states drained by the Mississippi River system (Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri Rivers) was accelerated by the introduction of steamboats on these rivers in the early 19th Century. These three rivers (among others) also form the borders of several states. Prior to the introduction of steamboats, transit upstream was impractical because of strong currents on parts of these waterways. Steamboats provided both passenger and freight transportation until the development of railroads later in the 19th Century gradually reduced their presence.

The rapid expansion of railroads brought the canal boom to a sudden end, providing a quick, scheduled and year-round mode of transportation that quickly spread to interconnect the states by the mid-19th century. During the industrialization of the United States after the Civil War, railroads, led by the transcontinental rail system in the 1860s, expanded quickly across the United States to serve industries and the growing cities. During the late 19th century, railroads often had built redundant routes to a competitor&#x27;s road or built through sparsely populated regions that generated little traffic. These marginal rail routes survived the pricing pressures of competition, or the lack of revenue generated by low traffic, as long as railroads provided the only efficient economical way to move goods and people across the United States. In addition to the intercity passenger network running on Class I and II railroads, a large network of interurban (trolley or &quot;street running&quot;) rail lines extended out from the cities and interchanged passenger and freight traffic with the railroads and also provided competition.

===20th century===
The advent of the automobile signaled the end of railroads as the predominant transportation for people and began a new era of mobility in the United States. The early 20th century Lincoln Highway and other auto trails gave way in the 1920s to an early national highway system making the automobile the primary mode of travel for most Americans. Interurban rail service declined, followed by trolley cars due in part to the advent of motorized buses and the lack of dedicated rights-of-way but also by deliberate efforts to dismantle urban rail infrastructure.

The scarcity of industrial materials during World War II slowed the growth of automobile manufacturing briefly and contributed to the nation&#x27;s declining rail network. In the 1950s, however, the United States renewed building a network of high-capacity, high-speed highways to link its vast territory. The most important element is the Interstate Highway system, first commissioned in the 1950s by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and modeled partly after the Italian autostrada and the German Autobahn system.

By 1945, after the end of World War II, nearly every city in America had at least one electric tram company providing intra-city transportation. There were an estimated 36,377 light rail vehicles in operation. Increased automobile ownership cut this number by 1/3 by 1965.

The airline industry began to successfully compete with intercity rail as a result of government investment, which suffered a loss of ridership. As the civil air transportation network of airports and other infrastructure expanded, air travel became more accessible to the general population. Technological advances ushered in the jet age, which increased airline capacity, while decreasing travel times and the cost of flights. The costs of flying rapidly decreased intercity rail ridership by the late 1960s to a point where railroads could no longer profitably operate networks of passenger trains. By the early 1970s almost all passenger rail operation and ownership had been transferred to various federal, municipal and state agencies.

Freight railroads continued to decline as motor freight captured a significant portion of the less-than-carload business. This loss of business, when combined with the highly regulated operating environment and constrained pricing power, forced many railroads into receivership and the nationalization of several critical eastern carriers into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Deregulation of the railroads by the Staggers Act in 1980 created a regulatory environment more favorable to the economics of the railroad industry.

In the 1990s, the increase in foreign trade and intermodal container shipping led to a revival of the freight railroads, which have effectively consolidated into two eastern and two western private transportation networks: Union Pacific and BNSF in the west, and CSX and Norfolk Southern in the east. Canadian National Railway took over the Illinois Central route down the Mississippi River valley.

===21st century===
In 2014, freight transportation establishments serving for-hire transportation and warehousing operations employed nearly 4.6 million workers and comprised 9.5 percent of the Nation&#x27;s economic activity as measured by GDP. Truck driving is by far the largest freight transportation occupation, with approximately 2.83 million truck drivers. About 57.5 percent of these professional truck drivers operate heavy or tractor-trailer trucks and 28.2 percent drive light or delivery service trucks.

According to &quot;Freight Facts and Figures 2015&quot;, U.S. freight transportation system handled a record amount of freight in 2014. A daily average of approximately 55 million tons of freight valued at $49.3 billion moved across the transportation system in 2014 to meet the needs of the nation&#x27;s 122.5 million households, 7.5 million business establishments, and 90,056 Government units.

Wartime expediency encouraged long distance pipeline transport of petroleum and natural gas, which was greatly expanded in the middle 20th century to take over most of the domestic long-haul market.

==Road transportation==
===Infrastructure and private automobile use===

In comparison to some parts of the Western world, both the United States and Canada rely more heavily on motorized transit over walking and bicycling with 86% of American workers commuting to work via private vehicle, costing an estimated additional $1500 per year commuting compared to Western European counterparts. Car ownership is on the decline but still 91% nationally. Car ownership is universal, except in the largest cities where extensive mass transit and railroad systems have been built, with lowest car ownership rates in New York City (44%), Washington, D.C. (62%), Boston (63%), Philadelphia (67%), San Francisco (69%), and Baltimore (69%).

With the development of the extensive Eisenhower Interstate Highway System in the 1950s, both long distance trips and daily commutes were mostly by private automobile. This network was designed to exacting federal standards in order to receive federal funding. The system, , has a total length of , making it the world&#x27;s second longest after China&#x27;s, and the largest public works project in US history.

The Interstate system joined an existing National Highway System, a designation created for the legacy highway network in 1995, comprising 160,000 miles (256,000 kilometers) of roadway, a fraction of the total mileage of roads. The Interstate system serves nearly all major U.S. cities, often through the downtown areas, which triggered freeway and expressway revolts in the 1960s and 1970s. The distribution of many goods and services involves Interstate highways at some point. Residents of American cities commonly use urban Interstates to travel to their places of work. The vast majority of long-distance travel, whether for vacation or business, is by the national road network; of these trips, about one-third (by the total number of miles driven in the country in 2003) utilize the Interstate system.

In addition to the routes of the Interstate system, there are those of the U.S. highway system. These routes, which are unrelated to those of the National Highway System, are supplemented by State Highways, and the local roads of counties, municipal streets, and federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The five inhabited U.S. territories also have their own road networks. There are approximately of roads in the United States, paved and unpaved. State highways are constructed by each state, but frequently maintained by county governments aided by funding from the state, where such counties exist as governing entities in mostly every state outside of the northeast. Counties construct and maintain all remaining roads outside cities, except in private communities. Local, unnumbered roads are often constructed by private contractors to local standards, then maintenance is assumed by the local government.

All federal highways are maintained by state governments, although they receive federal aid to build and maintain freeways signed as part of the 46,000 mile (75,000 km) nationwide Interstate highway network. Changes by state initiative may be made with federal approval. A large number of expressways are actually government or privately operated toll roads in many East Coast and Midwestern states. West Coast freeways are generally free to users, which is the basis of their name, since freeways have no toll charged per use, although since the 1990s there have been some small experiments with toll roads operated by private companies.

After the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minnesota in August 2007, the backlog of road and bridge maintenance across the country became an issue in transportation funding. The collapse prompted a tax increase in Minnesota to speed up bridge repairs, and action in other states, such as the Accelerated Bridge Program in Massachusetts, but after some debate no increase in federal funding.

The I-5 Skagit River bridge collapse in 2013, caused by a collision with an over-height truck, highlighted fracture critical bridges in which the failure of only one structural member will lead to complete collapse. According to the National Bridge Inventory, there are at least 600,000 bridges of 20 feet or more in length in the United States, all subject to deterioration in the absence of preventative maintenance. In December 2008, 72,868 bridges in the United States (12.1%) were categorized as &quot;structurally deficient&quot;, representing an estimated $48 billion in repairs. President Barack Obama proposed $50 billion of spending on road and bridge repair, plus a national infrastructure bank, but Congress did not act on these proposals. President Donald Trump also failed to get infrastructure funding approved. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill with about $110 billion for roads and bridges.

As of 2010, seat belt use is mandatory in all states except New Hampshire. Seat belt use is also mandatory in Washington, D.C., the national capital, and the five inhabited U.S. territories.

Greyhound Lines is the largest intercity bus company in the United States, with routes in all parts of the contiguous U.S. There are also many smaller regional bus companies, many of which use the terminal and booking facilities provided by Greyhound. Intercity bus is, in most cases, the least expensive way to travel long distances in the United States.

===Congestion===

Traffic congestion, especially at rush hour, is often considered a problem in many of the country&#x27;s larger cities. A 2009 study claimed that traffic congestion costs the United States almost $87.2 billion. The economic costs of traffic congestion have increased 63% over the past decade, and despite the declining traffic volumes caused by the economic downturn, Americans still waste more than of fuel each year as a result of traffic congestion. Motorists also waste 4.2 billion hours annually, or one full workweek per traveler. Moreover, it is estimated that drivers are wasting 6.9 billion hours per year or about 42 hours per driver in traffic congestion as a result of aging infrastructure and poor road conditions.

The United States continues to follow a method of attempting to resolve congestion by widening roadways. From 1993 to 2017, the nation&#x27;s largest 100 urbanized areas added 42% more freeway lane milage, despite population growing by only 32%. However, this policy of widening roadways resulted in a 144% increase in congestion, due to the concept of induced demand.

===Cargo===
The trucking industry (also referred to as the transportation or logistics industry) involves the transport and distribution of commercial and industrial goods using commercial motor vehicles (CMV). In this case, CMVs are most often trucks; usually semi trucks, box trucks, or dump trucks. A truck driver (commonly referred to as a &quot;trucker&quot;) is a person who earns a living as the driver of a CMV.

The trucking industry provides an essential service to the American economy by transporting large quantities of raw materials, works in process, and finished goods over land—typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers. Trucks are also important to the construction industry, as dump trucks and portable concrete mixers are necessary to move the large amounts of rocks, dirt, concrete, and other construction material. Trucks in America are responsible for the majority of freight movement over land, and are vital tools in the manufacturing, transportation, and warehousing industries.

Large trucks and buses require a commercial driver&#x27;s license (CDL) to operate. Obtaining a CDL requires extra education and training dealing with the special knowledge requirements and handling characteristics of such a large vehicle. Drivers of CMVs must adhere to the hours of service, which are regulations governing the driving hours of commercial drivers. These, and all other rules regarding the safety of interstate commercial driving, are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The FMCSA is also a division of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which governs all transportation-related industries such as trucking, shipping, railroads, and airlines. Some other issues are handled by another branch of the USDOT, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

Developments in technology, such as computers, satellite communication, and the internet, have contributed to many improvements within the industry. These developments have increased the productivity of company operations, saved the time and effort of drivers, and provided new, more accessible forms of entertainment to men and women who often spend long periods of time away from home. In 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented revised emission standards for diesel trucks (reducing airborne pollutants emitted by diesel engines) which promises to improve air quality and public health.

===Roadway links with adjacent countries and non-contiguous parts of the United States===

&quot;Within the United States:&quot;

*Alaska – Yes, via Canada and the Alaska Marine Highway in Washington
*Hawaii – No.
*American Samoa – No.
*Guam – No.
*Northern Mariana Islands – No.
*Puerto Rico – No.
*U.S. Virgin Islands – No.

&quot;With adjacent countries:&quot;

*Canada – Yes.
*Mexico – Yes.
*Russia – No, but proposed via Bering Strait crossing
*Cuba – No. Since the American embargo against Cuba, car ferry service from Florida and New Orleans to Havana ceased in 1962.
*Bahamas – No, but ferries travel to the Bahamas

===Traffic codes===

Each state has its own traffic code, although most of the rules of the road are similar for the purpose of uniformity, given that all states grant reciprocal driving privileges (and penalties) to each other&#x27;s licensed drivers.

==Air transportation==


The United States has advanced air transportation infrastructure which utilizes approximately 5,000 paved runways. In terms of passenger traffic, 17 of the world&#x27;s 30 busiest airports in 2004 were in the United States, including the world&#x27;s busiest, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. In terms of cargo, in the same year, twelve of the world&#x27;s thirty busiest airports were in the United States, including the world&#x27;s busiest, Memphis International Airport. Private aircraft are also used for medical emergencies, government agencies, large businesses, and individuals, see general aviation.

There is no single national flag airline; passenger airlines in the United States have always been privately owned. There are over 200 domestic passenger and cargo airlines and a number of international carriers. The major international carriers of the United States are Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and United Airlines. Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines operates few international routes, but has grown its domestic operations to a size comparable to the major international carriers. There is currently no government regulation of ticket pricing, although the federal government retains jurisdiction over aircraft safety, pilot training, and accident investigations (through the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board). The Transportation Security Administration provides security at airports.

==Rail==
===Passenger===
Passenger trains were the dominant mode of transportation until the mid-twentieth century. The introduction of jet airplanes on major U.S. routes and the completion of the Interstate Highway System accelerated a decline in intercity rail passenger demand during the 1960s, resulting in the sharp curtailment of passenger service by private railroads. This led to the creation of National Railroad Passenger Corporation, now called Amtrak, by the U.S. federal government in 1971 to maintain limited intercity rail passenger service in most parts of the country. Amtrak serves most major cities but, outside of the Northeast, California, and Illinois, often by only a few trains per day. Amtrak does not serve several major destinations, including Las Vegas, and Phoenix, Arizona. Frequent service is available in regional corridors between certain major cities, particularly the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, between New York City and Albany, around Chicago, and in parts of California and the Pacific Northwest.

Private intercity rail ended in the United States in 1983 with the discontinuation of the Rio Grande Zephyr, until Brightline started in South Florida in 2018. The state-owned Alaska Railroad is the only other intercity passenger railroad still operating. It has only rail ferry connections with other railroads.

====Rapid transit====

There are 15 heavy rail rapid transit systems in the United States. The New York City Subway is the largest rapid transit system in the world by number of stations.

===Cargo===
The United States makes extensive use of its rail system for freight. According to the Association of American Railroads, &quot;U.S. freight railroads are the world&#x27;s busiest, moving more freight than any rail system in any other country. In fact, U.S. railroads move more than four times as much freight as do all of Western Europe&#x27;s freight railroads combined.&quot;

Nearly all railroad corridors not including local transit rail systems are owned by private companies that provide freight service. Amtrak pays these companies for the right to use the tracks for passenger service. There are approximately of mainline track in the United States—the world&#x27;s longest national railroad network.

Rail freight has a major national bottleneck in Chicago and the Midwest, representing approximately one-third of the nation&#x27;s freight trains pass through the region, which is the subject of an ongoing $4.6 billion infrastructure improvement project which started in 2003.

===Railway links with adjacent countries===
*Canada – Amtrak connections run daily between New York City and Montreal, Quebec, Toronto, Ontario, and Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. Alaska is currently rail-accessible by train ferry from Bellingham, Washington and narrow gauge railroad from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory to Skagway. A proposed link to the contiguous United States would link Alaska and Canada via the Yukon and British Columbia. The Canadian National Railway system includes the former Illinois Central route from Chicago via Memphis to New Orleans.
*Mexico – Several private firms run touristic trains from near El Paso, Texas, through Chihuahua, Chihuahua and the Copper Canyon to El Fuerte, Sinaloa. Such trains also run from Nogales, Sonora, but no U.S. passenger trains run near Nogales, Arizona, on the other side of the border. Another touristic train runs occasional trains between Campo, California, and Tecate, Baja California.

With few exceptions, the rail gauge is standard gauge . The White Pass and Yukon Route from Skagway, Alaska to Whitehorse, Yukon by way of Bennett, British Columbia is gauge.

==Mass transit==

The miles traveled by passenger vehicles in the United States fell by 3.6% in 2008, while the number of trips taken on mass transit increased by 4.0%. At least part of the drop in urban driving can be explained by the 4% increase in the use of public transportation.

Most medium-sized cities have some sort of local public transportation, usually a network of fixed bus routes. Among larger cities many of the older cities also have metro rail systems (also known as heavy rail in the United States) and/or extensive light rail systems, while the newer cities found in the Sun Belt either have modest light rail systems or have no intracity rail at all.

===Legislation===
On June 26, 2008, the House passed the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act (H.R. 6052), which gives grants to |mass transit authorities to lower fares for commuters at the pump and expand transit services. The bill also:

*Requires that all Federal agencies offer their employees transit pass transportation fringe benefits. Federal agencies within the National Capital Region have successful transit pass benefits programs.
*Increases the federal cost-share of grants for construction of additional parking facilities at the end of subway lines from 80 to 100% to cover an increase in the number of people taking mass transit.
*Creates a pilot program for vanpool demonstration projects in urban and rural areas.
*Increases federal help for local governments to purchase alternative fuel buses, locomotives, and ferries from 90 to 100%.

==Water transportation==

Water transport is largely used for freight. Fishing and pleasure boats are numerous, and passenger service connects many of the nation&#x27;s islands and remote coastal areas, crosses lakes, rivers, and harbors, and provides alternative access to Alaska which bypasses Canada. Several major seaports in the United States include New York City on the east coast, New Orleans and Houston on the gulf coast, and Los Angeles on the west coast. The interior of the U.S. also has major shipping channels, via the Great Lakes Waterway, St. Lawrence Seaway and the Mississippi River System. Freight on the Mississippi River system is carried on barges pushed by approximately 8000 &quot;towboats&quot; and largely consists of bulk goods, such as petrochemicals, grain and cement.

Many U.S. ports are served by cruise ships. Popular destinations include the Caribbean, the Mexican Riviera, Hawaii and the Inside Passage to Alaska. Automobile ferries operate in many locations where bridges are impractical and in congested metropolitan areas, including New York City and San Francisco Bay. Ferries also operate in Sounds that have populated areas surrounding it, such as Puget Sound. Washington State Ferries operates the ferries in Puget Sound and has the second largest ferry fleet in the world. Washington State ferries even offer ferries from Anacortes, Washington to Sidney, British Columbia.

===Waterways===

The United States has of navigable inland channels (rivers and canals), exclusive of the Great Lakes. Out of this is used in commerce. About of the Mississippi River System are presently navigable, although not all is used for commerce. The Saint Lawrence Seaway of , including the Saint Lawrence River of , is shared with Canada.

===Ports and harbors===

United States ports and harbors include:
*Anchorage, Alaska
*Baltimore, Maryland
*Boston, Massachusetts
*Charleston, South Carolina
*Chicago, Illinois
*Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands
*Detroit, Michigan
*Erie, Pennsylvania
*Gulfport, Mississippi
*Hampton Roads, Virginia
*Honolulu, Hawaii
*Houston, Texas

*Jacksonville, Florida
*Long Beach, California
*Los Angeles, California
*Miami, Florida
*Mobile, Alabama
*New Orleans, Louisiana
*Newark-New York City
*Pago Pago, American Samoa
*Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
*Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
*Port Canaveral, Florida

*Portland, Oregon
*Providence, Rhode Island
*Oakland, California
*Sacramento, California
*Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands
*San Diego, California
*San Juan, Puerto Rico
*Savannah, Georgia
*Seattle, Washington
*Tacoma, Washington
*Tampa, Florida
*Toledo, Ohio
*Valdez, Alaska
===Merchant marine===
Most U.S. exports and imports are on foreign ships. The 1920 Jones Act bars foreign ships from trade within the United States, thus creating a domestic &quot;Jones Act fleet&quot;. Deck officers and ship&#x27;s engineers of U.S.-flagged ships are usually trained at one of the established maritime academies.

==Military==
The federal military has a dedicated system of bases with runways, aircraft, watercraft, conventional cars and trucks, and armored and special-purpose vehicles. During times of war, it may commandeer private infrastructure and vehicles as authorized by Congress and the President.

==Pipeline statistics==
* Petroleum products: 224,620 km
* Natural gas: 548,665 km (2006)

==Policy==

As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population – according to the United Nations, 55% of the world&#x27;s population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%. Public transportation policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world. The institution of policy enforces order in transportation, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.

===Pedestrian===
A key component of a suitable urban environment is support for pedestrian traffic, including people on foot as well as human propelled vehicles like bikes, skateboards, and scooters. Pedestrian policy is implemented at the state level, but consistent across states is the fact that the pedestrian has the right-of-way. If someone on foot is crossing the street, legally or illegally, any vehicular traffic is required to stop—under no circumstance does a driver have a right to hit a pedestrian. The exact details with respect to when a vehicle has to stop differ between the states, some requiring that all vehicles at an intersection yield to a pedestrian, while others requiring only those vehicles perpendicular to the motion of the crossing to stop. California requires all vehicles at an intersection to yield to a pedestrian walking in any direction.

There are also rules for pedestrian conduct. Though they have the right-of-way, pedestrians are not permitted to leave a curb into a crosswalk close enough to a vehicle to “constitute hazard.” Pedestrians must also yield to mass transit like light-rail cars and trains, as these forms of transportation operate on a schedule and are often moving too quickly to yield to a pedestrian. Pedestrians are also not permitted to delay traffic more than necessary while in a crosswalk. When not using a crosswalk, pedestrians must yield their right-of-way to vehicles who are close enough to constitute hazard. One of the issues with this kind of policy is how vague it is. A pedestrian is expected to determine on the fly what “constitutes hazard,” which can create dangerous situations leading to pedestrian injury or even death. As technology continues to advance, embedded technology like sensors and computer chips in vehicles should be able to process data very quickly and thus prevent collisions, as discussed in the Internet section found below.

===Complete Street===
A complete street is a roadway that is safe for people of any ability or age utilizing any form of transportation. The concept revolves around the fact that streets are communal spaces, so anyone has a right to access them. In order to ensure universal safety, however, policy exists to ensure that these complete streets are maintained and utilized properly.
* Funding policies refer to the process with which state funds are allocated to the creation of pedestrian areas, bike lanes, and street markings.
* Planning policies refer to the process by which a street is expanded to include support for human powered transportation and how * this expansion fits into the urban planning as a whole.
* Engineering and design policies refer to the implementation of a complete street, including how to differentiate between bike lanes and car lanes.
* Maintenance policies refer to the process with which state funds are allocated to street maintenance to ensure that they remain safe places of travel.
* Use policies refer to the proper use of a complete street to allow efficient transportation for all.

Other supporting policies indirectly related to complete streets include parking policies and vehicle restrictions. Complete streets are an important development for urban transportation because they equally support all forms of transportation, enforce safety, and ensure that everyone can navigate the busy city streets to arrive at their destination as fast as possible.

===Traffic flow===
In order to ensure that traffic flow is uniformly dispersed across roadways and does not interfere with existing pedestrian and public transportation infrastructure, traffic flow policy is put in place in order to get everyone to their destination in the most efficient way possible. Traffic flow policy includes everything from how spaced out two cars should be on a highway to which cars have priority at stop signs and street lights to the proper use of bus, taxi, and carpool lanes.

=== Parking lots ===

Parking policy has a strong impact on the transportation mode. Efforts to reduce the amount of space dedicated to parking are diminishing the dependence on cars, encouraging walking, biking, public transit, lowering the cost of housing and increase the amount of housing units that can be built in the city territory. Such efforts has been taken in different cities in California and in September 2023 the state abolished the requirement of minimum parking space &quot;within a half-mile of major public transit stops&quot;. From 2017 more than 200 towns and cities in the USA abolished or changed the requirement for parking minimum. Those include Portland, Minneapolis, Austin. As of 2 November 2023, Austin (Texas) is the biggest city in the USA that did it. Some cities including Nashville, begun to impose parking maximum.

==Funding==

Federal, state, and local tax revenues support upkeep of most roads, which are generally free to drivers. There are also some toll roads and toll bridges. Most other forms of transportation charge a fee for use as they are not given much, if any, tax support by Congress.

Government funding of transportation exists at many levels. Federal funding for highway, rail, bus, water, air, and other forms of transportation is allocated by Congress for several years at a time. The current authorization bill is the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which runs from 2005 to 2009. A Congressionally chartered committee is considering future funding issues.

Though earmarks are often made for specific projects, the allocation of most federal dollars is controlled by metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and state governments. Usually &quot;matching&quot; funds are required from local sources. All projects have a sponsoring agency that will receive the funding from the various federal and local sources, and be responsible for implementing the project directly or through contracts. Large projects require a Major Investment Study&#x27; and both a draft and final Environmental Impact Review. A patchwork of federal laws and accounts govern the allocation of federal transportation dollars, most of which is reserved for capital projects, not operating expenses. Some roads are federally designated as part of the National Highway System and get preferential funding as a result, but there are few federally maintained roads outside of Washington, D.C., and national parks.

State governments are sovereign entities which use their powers of taxation both to match federal grants, and provide for local transportation needs. Different states have different systems for dividing responsibility for funding and maintaining road and transit networks between the state department of transportation, counties, municipalities, and other entities. Cities or counties are typically responsible for local roads, financed with block grants and local property taxes, and the state is responsible for major roads that receive state and federal designations. Many mass transit agencies are quasi-independent and subsidized branches of a state, county, or city government.

==Economic impact==
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT): &quot;Transportation&#x27;s vital importance to the U.S. economy is underscored by the fact that more than $1 out of every $10 produced in the U.S. gross domestic product is related to transportation activity. This includes all aspects of transportation, including the movement of goods and the purchase of all transportation-related products and services as well as the movement of people&quot;. Employment in the transportation and material moving industry accounted for 7.4% of all employment, and was the 5th largest employment group in the United States.

The United States invests 0.6% of its GDP on transportation annually.

==Environmental impacts==

Two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption is due to the transportation sector. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 has an impact on U.S. Energy Policy. The United States, an important export country for food stocks, converted 18% of its grain output to ethanol in 2008. Across the United States, 25% of the whole corn crop went to ethanol in 2007. The percentage of corn going to biofuel is expected to go up. In 2006, U.S. Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act, which would mandate the production of dual-fuel vehicles and the sale of E85 ethanol fuel.

===Carbon dioxide emission===

In 2016, transportation became the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions (28.5%), exceeding electricity generation (28.4%). In a report conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, an amount of 1.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide was emitted by the transportation sector in 2019. Of the 1.8 billion metric tons, 58% was emitted by personal vehicles, 25% was emitted by commercial trucks and busses, 10% was emitted by air, 3% is emitted by pipeline, 2% is by rail, and 2% is by water. To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emission from personal vehicles, people can switch to public transportation as an alternative form of transportation. A switch of lifestyle to active transportation will can reduce the pollution from the transportation sector to zero. The use of walking and cycling will encourage exercising, which can help combat the negative health effects of a sedentary lifestyle.

<text>This list of political parties in the United States, both past and present, does not include independents.

Not all states allow the public to access voter registration data. Therefore, voter registration data should not be taken as the correct value and should be viewed as an underestimate.

The abbreviations given come from state ballots used in the most recent elections. Not all political parties have abbreviations.

==Active parties==
===Major parties===

=== Third parties ===

==== Represented in state legislatures ====
&quot;The following third parties have members in state legislatures affiliated with them.&quot;

===== Ballot access in multiple states =====
===== Ballot access in a single state =====

== Non-electoral organizations ==
===Active===

These organizations generally do not nominate candidates for election, but some of them have in the past; they otherwise function similarly to political parties.

===Historical===
These historical organizations did not officially nominate candidates for election but may have endorsed or supported campaigns; they otherwise functioned similarly to political parties.

==Party registration==
Officially recognized parties in states are not guaranteed have ballot access, membership numbers of some parties with ballot access are not tracked, and vice versa. Not all of these parties are active, and not all states record voter registration by party. Boxes in gray mean that the specific party&#x27;s registration is not reported.

<doc id="32028" wikidata="Q7598367" url="?curid=32028" title="Standard of living in the United States">
<text>The standard of living in the United States is high by the standards that most economists use, and for most of the 20th century, the United States was widely recognized as having the highest standard of living in the world. Per capita income is high but also less evenly distributed than in most other developed countries; as a result, the United States fares particularly well in measures of average material well being that do not place weight on equality aspects.

==Measures==
In the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education, and per capita income levels, the United States is relatively high, currently ranking 8th. However, the Human Development Index is not considered a measure of living standards, but a measure of &quot;potential&quot; living standards were there no inequality: rather, the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is considered the actual level of human development, taking inequality into account. On the inequality-adjusted HDI, the United States ranked 27th in 2014, tied with Poland.

In 2013, the &quot;Economist Intelligence Unit&#x27;s&quot; Where-to-be-born Index, which takes into account material well-being as measured by GDP per capita, life expectancy, political stability, the quality of family life based on divorce rates, community life, crime and terrorism rates, gender equality, the quality of governance, climate, and unemployment rates, ranked the United States at 16th place, tied with Germany.

The OECD Better Life Index, which measures quality of life according to 11 factors, ranks the United States as 7th among 34 OECD countries.

The homeownership rate is relatively high compared to other post-industrial nations. In 2005, 69% of Americans resided in their own homes, roughly the same percentage as in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Israel and Canada. In 2007, Americans enjoyed more cars and radios per capita than any other nation and more televisions and personal computers per capita than any other nation with more than 200 million people.

==Changing over the past==
In colonial America, the standard of living was high by 18th century standards. Americans could choose their diet from a diverse range of plants and animals from Europe and the Western Hemisphere, and this, combined with favorable weather conditions, ensured that Americans never had to deal with harvest failures. There was little exposure to epidemic diseases, and low wealth inequality, ensuring that even the poor were well-fed.

Historians have used height to measure living standards during this time as average adult heights can point to a population&#x27;s net nutrition – the amount of nutrition people grew up with as compared to biological stress which can cause lower heights in adulthood, stemming from things like food deprivation, hard work, and disease. According to military records of American and European men, Americans were on average two to three inches taller than Europeans.

Average heights showed little change until the second quarter of the 19th century, with the Industrial Revolution. The growth of canals, steamboats, and railways, as well as the public school system, mass immigration, and urbanization, increased exposure to diseases. Food prices rose in the 1830s, and industrialization brought along with it growing wealth inequality and business depressions that further worsened the situations of the poor. As a result, average stature and life expectancy declined, and only rebounded from 1910 to 1950, as incomes rose, urban conditions became less crowded, and public health measures were put in place.

From the 1930s up until 1980, the average American after-tax income adjusted for inflation tripled, which translated into higher living standards for the American population. Between 1949 and 1969, real median family income grew by 99.3%. From 1946 to 1978, the standard of living for the average family more than doubled. Average family income (in real terms) more than doubled from 1945 up until the 1970s, while unemployment steadily fell until it reached 4% in the 1960s. Between 1949–50 and 1965–66, median family income (in constant 2009 dollars) rose from $25,814 to $43,614, and from 1947 to 1960, consumer spending rose by a full 60%, and for the first time, as noted by Mary P. Ryan, &quot;the majority of Americans would enjoy something called discretionary income, earnings that were secure and substantial enough to permit them to enter sectors of the marketplace that were once reserved for the affluent.&quot; In 1960, Americans were, on average, the richest people in the world by a massive margin.

During the 1960s, median family incomes increased by over 33%, while per capita expenditures on recreation and meals grew by over 40%. From 1959 to 1969, median family income (in 1984 dollars) increased from $19,300 to $26,700. By 1969, 79.6% of all households owned at least one car, 82.6% owned a refrigerator or freezer, 79% owned a black and white television set, 31.9% owned a color television set, and 70% owned a washing machine. Leisure time also increased. By 1970, it was estimated that the average workingman in America had 140 days off work each year. US work hours fell by 10.7% between 1950 and 1979, though the decline was still around half that of Western Europe.

In 1980, the American standard of living was the highest among the industrial countries, according to the OECD. Out of the 85 million households in the United States, 64% owned their own living quarters, 55% had at least two TV sets, and 51% had more than one vehicle. In terms of possession of telephones, TV sets, school enrollments, animal protein in diets, and energy consumption, the United States was far ahead of other industrialized countries. Wealthy and middle class and a majority of poor Americans had higher after-tax incomes than their counterparts almost anywhere else in the world. By 1985, the US per capita income was $11,727, one of the highest among industrialized countries. By the mid-1980s, 98% of all households had a telephone service, 77% a washing machine, 45% a freezer, and 43% a dishwasher.

In the 1990s, the average American standard of living was regarded as amongst the highest in the world, and middle class and poor Americans were still, on average, richer than their counterparts in almost all other countries, though the gap with some European countries had noticeably narrowed.

===Current===
In 2006, median income was $43,318 per household ($26,000 per household member) with 42% of households having two income earners. Meanwhile, the median income of the average American age 25+ was roughly $32,000 ($39,000 if only counting those employed full-time between the ages of 25 and 64) in 2005. According to the CIA the gini index which measures income inequality (the higher the less equal the income distribution) was clocked at 41.5 in 2019, compared to 30.8 in the European Union and 31.7 in Germany.

The US has... a per capita GDP [PPP] of $42,000... The [recent] onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a &quot;two-tier labor market&quot;... Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households... The rise in GDP in 2004 and 2005 was undergirded by substantial gains in labor productivity... Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups.

In 2014, median wealth in the United States was $44,900, which put the United States in 19th place, behind many other developed countries. In 2015, median wealth in the United States was $55,775.

The United States has one of the widest rich-poor gaps of any high-income nation today, and that gap continues to grow. Some prominent economists have warned that the widening rich-poor gap in the U.S. population is a problem that could undermine and destabilize the country&#x27;s economy and standard of living. In 2006, Alan Greenspan wrote that &quot;The income gap between the rich and the rest of the US population has become so wide, and is growing so fast, that it might eventually threaten the stability of democratic capitalism itself&quot;. In 2013, George Friedman, the head of Stratfor, wrote that the middle class&#x27; standard of living was declining, and that &quot;If we move to a system where half of the country is either stagnant or losing ground while the other half is surging, the social fabric of the United States is at risk, and with it the massive global power the United States has accumulated.&quot;

Since 1971, the middle income was above 50% of the population in the U.S. In 2015, the middle class income was 49.9% of the population. The middle class continues to shrink and standard of living continues to decrease.
In 2020 Falcettoni and Nygaard wrote a paper and released a policy brief and a FEDS Note on the standard of living across the United States of America. Motivated by the fact that economists mainly focus on income per capita in their analyses of standards of living, but that states across the United States differ along many other dimensions, they build a measure of living standards (à la Jones and Klenow 2016) that accounts for cross-state variations in mortality, consumption, education, inequality, and cost of living. They find that per-capita income is a good indicator of the level of living standards across the United States, but that deviations can be significant for some states. They also find that the level of living standards in most states appears closer to the level of living standards in the richest state, Connecticut, than the difference in their per-capita income levels would imply. In particular, their measure highlights that high-income states benefit from higher life expectancy, consumption, and college attainment, while low-income states benefit from lower cost of living. The state with the highest living standards according to their measure is Minnesota.

Finally, Falcettoni and Nygaard conclude by analyzing whether and how living standards have been rising across the United States between 1999 and 2015. They find that every state has experienced a rise in living standards, but that states differ significantly in how fast their living standards are rising. They find that the main reason for the difference in how fast living standards are rising across the United States is due to varying gains in life expectancy, consumption, and college attainment in the different states. This is a cautionary tale for economists using per-capita income growth as a proxy for how fast living standards are rising in any given state in the United States. In fact, Falcettoni and Nygaard find that per-capita income growth is only weakly correlated with how fast living standards are rising and deviations can be significantly large.

<text>The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin, UT, or Texas) is a public research university in Austin, Texas, United States. Founded in 1883, it is the flagship institution of the University of Texas System. With 53,082 students as of fall 2023, it is also the largest institution in the system.

The university is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures totaling $1.06 billion for the 2023 fiscal year. It joined the Association of American Universities in 1929. The university houses seven museums and seventeen libraries, including the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and the Blanton Museum of Art, and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus and McDonald Observatory.

UT Austin&#x27;s athletics constitute the Texas Longhorns. The Longhorns have won four NCAA Division I National Football Championships, six NCAA Division I National Baseball Championships, thirteen NCAA Division I National Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Championships, and the school has claimed more titles in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports than any other member in the Big 12.

 13 Nobel Prize winners, 25 Pulitzer Prize winners, 3 Turing Award winners, 2 Fields Medal recipients, 2 Wolf Prize winners, and 3 Abel Prize winners have been affiliated with the school as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. The university has also been affiliated with three Primetime Emmy Award winners, and as of 2021, its students and alumni have earned a total of 155 Olympic medals.

==History==
===Establishment===
The idea of a public university in Texas was first mentioned in the 1827 constitution of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas, which promised public education in the arts and sciences under Title 6, Article 217, but no action was taken. After Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, the Constitution of the Republic emphasized Congress&#x27;s duty, in Section 5 of its General Provisions, to establish a general system of education when circumstances allowed.

After Texas was annexed, the Seventh Texas Legislature passed O.B. 102 on February 11, 1858, allocating $100,000 in United States bonds from the Compromise of 1850 for the University of Texas. The Civil War delayed fund repayment, leaving the university with only $16,000 by 1865. Nevertheless, the Texas Constitution of 1876 reaffirmed the mandate to establish &quot;The University of Texas&quot; by popular vote.

On March 30, 1881, the Texas legislature organized the structure of the university and called for a popular vote to determine its location. Austin was chosen as the site with 30,913 votes, while Galveston was designated for the medical department. On November 17, 1882, the cornerstone of the Old Main building was laid at the original &quot;College Hill&quot; location, and University President Ashbel Smith expressed optimism about Texas&#x27;s untapped resources. The University of Texas officially opened its doors on September 15, 1883.

===Expansion and growth===
The old Main Building of the university was built in a Victorian-Gothic style and served as the central point of the campus&#x27;s site, and was used for nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934, despite the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.
In 1916, a contentious dispute erupted between Texas Governor James E. Ferguson and the University of Texas over faculty appointments. Ferguson&#x27;s attempt to influence these appointments led to a retaliatory veto of the university&#x27;s budget, jeopardizing its operations. Subsequently, Ferguson was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate on charges including misapplication of public funds, and removed from office.

In 1921, the legislature appropriated $1.35 million to purchase land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution. With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well and the discovery of oil on university-owned lands in 1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund. The additional income from Permanent University Fund investments allowed for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, which allowed the legislature to address funding for the university along with the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as Texas A&amp;M University). With sufficient funds to finance construction on both campuses, on April 8, 1931, the Forty Second Legislature passed H.B. 368. which dedicated the Agricultural and Mechanical College a 1/3 interest in the Available University Fund, the annual income from Permanent University Fund investments.

In 1929, the University of Texas was inducted into the Association of American Universities.

During World War II, the University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. Additionally, to facilitate the wartime effort, academic calendars were compressed, allowing for accelerated graduation.

After &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954, Houston, Texas, area teen Marion Ford had been accepted to become one of the first Black attendees. In an interview with a reporter he announced his desire to try-out for the football team. The Ford Crisis would begin and all Black admissions at the time were rescinded until policy could be drawn up.

In the fall of 1956, the first Black students entered the university&#x27;s undergraduate class. Black students were permitted to live in campus dorms, but were barred from campus cafeterias. The University of Texas integrated its facilities and desegregated its dormitories in 1965. UT, which had had an open admissions policy, adopted standardized testing for admissions in the mid-1950s, at least in part as a conscious strategy to minimize the number of Black undergraduates, given that they were no longer able to simply bar their entry after the Brown decision.

Following growth in enrollment after World War II, the university unveiled an ambitious master plan in 1960 designed for &quot;10 years of growth&quot; that was intended to &quot;boost the University of Texas into the ranks of the top state universities in the nation.&quot; In 1965, the Texas Legislature granted the university Board of Regents to use eminent domain to purchase additional properties surrounding the original . The university began buying parcels of land to the north, south, and east of the existing campus, particularly in the Blackland neighborhood to the east and the Brackenridge tract to the southeast, in hopes of using the land to relocate the university&#x27;s intramural fields, baseball field, tennis courts, and parking lots.

On March 6, 1967, the Sixtieth Texas Legislature changed the university&#x27;s official name from &quot;The University of Texas&quot; to &quot;The University of Texas at Austin&quot; to reflect the growth of the University of Texas System.

===1966 shooting===
On August 1, 1966, Texas student Charles Whitman barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the Main Building. Armed with multiple firearms, he killed 14 people on campus, 11 from the observation deck and below the clocks on the tower, and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two others inside the observation deck. The massacre ended when Whitman was shot and killed by police after they breached the tower.

After the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and then closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public. There is a turtle pond park near the tower dedicated to those affected by the tragedy.

The first presidential library on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971, with former President Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson and then-President Richard Nixon in attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum is one of 13 presidential libraries administered by the National Archives and Records Administration.

A statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was unveiled on campus in 1999 and subsequently vandalized. By 2004, John Butler, a professor at the McCombs School of Business suggested moving it to Morehouse College, a historically black college, &quot;a place where he is loved&quot;.

===Recent history===
The University of Texas at Austin has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the Blanton Museum of Art. In August 2008, the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center opened, with the hotel and conference center forming part of a new gateway to the university. Also in 2008, Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium (by capacity) in the state of Texas at the time.

On Tuesday, September 28, 2010, a shooting occurred at the Perry–Castañeda Library (PCL) where student Colton Tooley, armed with an AK-47, fired shots on his walk from Guadalupe Street to the library&#x27;s front entrance. The student ascended to the sixth floor, before killing himself. No one else was injured, except for one sprained ankle suffered by a student fleeing the scene.

In early 2020, following a major outbreak of the new coronavirus, the university restricted travel to Wuhan province in China, aligning with the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s recommendation. By March 17, 2020, then-UT President Gregory L. Fenves announced a transition to online classes for the rest of the spring semester after 49 confirmed COVID-19 cases emerged from students&#x27; travels to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, during spring break. Throughout the summer, the university reported over 400 cases and its first COVID-19-related death, a custodial worker.

The fall 2020 semester consisted of a majority of online courses through platforms like Zoom. On August 6, 2020, UT Austin initiated plans for free COVID-19 tests for all students. UT Austin returned to primarily in-person classes and campus activities for the fall 2021 semester, implementing safety protocols like testing requirements and vaccination incentives to ensure a safe return amid the ongoing pandemic.

In 2024, after four years of test-optional admissions for undergraduate applications due to the COVID-19 pandemic, standardized testing scores were once again made a mandatory part of admissions, beginning with applications for the fall 2025 semester. Jay Hartzell commented that the SAT and ACT standardized exams were &quot;a proven differentiator that is in each student&#x27;s and the University&#x27;s best interest.&quot;

On April 2, 2024, the University of Texas at Austin announced additional adjustments in compliance with Senate Bill 17, particularly in response to a letter from March 26, 2024, from Texas State Senator Brandon Creighton, which led to the layoff of approximately 60 individuals, most of whom formerly worked in DEI-related programs, and the elimination of the newly renamed Division of Campus and Community Engagement. Students, faculty, staff, and outside critics denounced the university&#x27;s over-compliance with the anti-DEI law, since the university had already been compliant since January 1, 2024. At a UT Austin Faculty Council meeting on April 15, 2024, in response to mounting criticism, President Jay Hartzell stated the additional changes were made in response to the threats from the Republican-led State Legislature and the University of Texas System Board of Regents, and to restore &quot;confidence&quot; in the university, reacting to changing tides in public opinion towards higher education amongst Republicans. The university&#x27;s Division of Campus and Community Engagement operated the University of Texas-University Charter School, a charter school system with 23 campuses across Texas, until the closure on April 2, 2024, leading the charter school to be moved to the College of Education.

==== 2024 pro-Palestinian protests ====
On February 4, 2024, a Palestinian-American student at a pro-Palestinian protest at the campus was stabbed, receiving non-life-threatening injuries. The attacker used a racial slur against the protestors and the attack was investigated as a hate crime. A month later the attacker was indicted by a grand jury on an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge but was not charged with any additional hate crime charge.

A large student and faculty Pro-Palestinian protest occurred on April 24, 2024, demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas War and that the university divest from companies profiting from Israel&#x27;s actions. The protests occurred amidst the ongoing nationwide demonstrations on college campuses.

In response, the university, under the explicit direction of President Hartzell, requested the assistance of the Austin Police Department (APD) and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), in coordination with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, in an attempt to quell said protests and an &quot;occupation&quot; of the university, in contrast to free speech on campus laws praised by Abbott and the university in prior years. The deployment of multiple police units led to the confirmed arrest of 57 protesters, including a photojournalist for Fox 7 Austin, with several more detained. Charges were then dismissed against 46 protesters the next day, leading to their subsequent release, with the charges against the remaining 11 protesters dropped on April 26, 2024.

This decision received sharp backlash, including from general faculty, staff, students, several Democratic legislators for the region, and First Amendment advocacy groups, including an official statement from the UT Faculty Council Executive Committee denouncing it, in part due to the extreme, chaotic, and violent police response that ensued and alleged violations of First Amendment rights. The university additionally set new rules for protests on campus, such as banning masks and face coverings and instituting a 10 PM curfew for all protests, directly contradicting prior guidelines. Initially, the university told students and faculty that arrested protestors would no longer be allowed on campus, but retracted the statement two hours later, stating that they would be allowed &quot;academic&quot; access, only to then announce a change to full access for university affiliates. Additionally, the university temporarily suspended the student organization that organized the protests, the Palestine Solidarity Committee. Travis County Attorney Delia Garza stated that the way that the university handled the protests put a strain on the local criminal justice system, specifically reprimanding the sending of protestors to jail for low-level charges.

A report later released by the UT Austin Committee of Counsel on Academic Freedom and Responsibility (CCAFR) on July 17, 2024, found that UT Austin administrators violated its own institutional rules in clear disregard of freedom of speech and expression protections.

==Campus==

The university&#x27;s property totals , comprising the for the Main Campus in central Austin and the J. J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin and the other properties throughout Texas. The main campus has 150 buildings totaling over .

One of the university&#x27;s most visible features is the Beaux-Arts Main Building, including a tower designed by Paul Philippe Cret. Completed in 1937, the Main Building is in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit burnt orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments; conversely, it is darkened for solemn occasions. At the top of the tower is a carillon of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by student carillonneurs, in addition to the usual pealing of Westminster Quarters every quarter-hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. In 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public indefinitely for weekend tours.

The university&#x27;s seven museums and seventeen libraries hold over nine million volumes, making it the seventh-largest academic library in the country. The holdings of the university&#x27;s Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the Gutenberg Bible and the first permanent photograph, &quot;View from the Window at Le Gras&quot;, taken by Nicéphore Niépce. The newest museum, the Blanton Museum of Art, is the largest university art museum in the United States and hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. The Perry–Castañeda Library, which houses the central University Libraries operations and the Perry–Castañeda Library Map Collection, is at the heart of campus. The Benson Latin American Collection holds the largest collection of Latin American materials among US university libraries, and maintains substantial digital collections.

The University of Texas at Austin has an extensive tunnel system that links the buildings on campus. Constructed under the supervision of UT engineering professor Carl J. Eckhardt Jr., then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along with the campus. They measure approximately six miles in length. The tunnel system is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the public and guarded by silent alarms. Since the late 1940s, the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a TRIGA nuclear reactor at the J. J. Pickle Research Campus.

The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In 2010, the university opened the state-of-the-art Norman Hackerman building (on the site of the former Experimental Sciences Building) housing chemistry and biology research and teaching laboratories. In 2010, the university broke ground on the $120 million Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall and the $51 million Belo Center for New Media, both of which are now complete. The new LEED gold-certified, Student Activity Center (SAC) opened in January 2011, housing study rooms, lounges and food vendors. The SAC was constructed as a result of a student referendum passed in 2006 which raised student fees by $65 per semester. In 2012, the Moody Foundation awarded the College of Communication $50 million, the largest endowment any communication college has received, so naming it the Moody College of Communication.

The university operates two public radio stations, KUT with news and information, and KUTX with music, via local FM broadcasts as well as live streaming audio over the Internet. The university uses CapMetro to provide bus transportation for students around the campus on the UT Shuttle system and throughout Austin, and UT students, faculty, and staff with an active UT ID card are able to ride public transportation without paying a fare.

==Academics==

The University of Texas at Austin offers more than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2009–2010 academic year, the university awarded a total of 13,215 degrees: 67.7% bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 22.0% master&#x27;s degrees, 6.4% doctoral degrees, and 3.9% Professional degrees.

In addition, the university has nine honors programs, eight of which span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Science, Engineering Honors, the Dean&#x27;s Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Health Science Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Polymathic Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, and the Undergraduate Nursing Honors Program in School of Nursing. The ninth is the Plan II Honors Program, a rigorous interdisciplinary program that is a major in and of itself. Many Plan II students pursue a second major, often participating in another department&#x27;s honors program in addition to Plan II. The university also offers programs such as the Freshman Research Initiative and Texas Interdisciplinary Plan.

===Admissions===

====Undergraduate====

The University of Texas at Austin encourages applicants to submit SAT/ACT scores, but it is not required. However, for students applying for admission from fall 2025 onwards, submission of SAT/ACT scores is mandatory as part of their undergraduate admission application. As of 2011, the university was one of the most selective universities in the region. Relative to other universities in the state of Texas, UT Austin was second to Rice University in selectivity according to a &quot;Business Journal&quot; study weighing acceptance rates and the mid-range of the SAT and ACT. The University of Texas at Austin was ranked as the 18th most selective in the South.

As a state public university, UT Austin was subject to Texas House Bill 588, which guaranteed Texas high school seniors graduating in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT Austin (but no other state university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modified this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011. The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university currently admits the top 6 percent. Furthermore, students admitted under Texas House Bill 588 are not guaranteed their choice of college or major, but rather only guaranteed admission to the university as a whole. Many colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission.

For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed &quot;more selective&quot; according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For fall 2017, 51,033 applied and 18,620 were accepted (36.5%), and of those accepted, 45.2% enrolled. Among freshman students who enrolled in fall 2017, SAT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 570 to 690 for critical reading and 600–710 for math. ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 26 to 31. In terms of class rank, 74.4% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes and 91.7% ranked in the top quarter. For fall 2019, 53,525 undergraduate students applied, 17,029 undergraduate students were admitted, and 8,170 undergraduate students enrolled in the university full or part time, making the acceptance rate 31.8% and enrollment rate 48% overall. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 79 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.

===Rankings===

The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) was ranked 30th among all universities in the U.S. and 7th among public universities according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2025 rankings. Internationally, UT Austin was tied for 56th in the 2024 &quot;Best Global Universities&quot; ranking by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, 45th in the world by Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) in 2024, 52nd worldwide by Times Higher Education World University Rankings (2024), and 66th globally by QS World University Rankings (2024). UT Austin was also ranked 35th in the world by the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) in 2024.

The University of Texas at Austin is considered to be a &quot;Public Ivy&quot;—a public university that provides an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price, having been ranked in virtually every list of &quot;Public Ivies&quot; since Richard Moll coined the term in his 1985 book &quot;Public Ivies: A Guide to America&#x27;s best public undergraduate colleges and universities&quot;. The seven other &quot;Public Ivy&quot; universities, according to Moll, were the College of William &amp; Mary, Miami University, the University of California, the University of Michigan, the University of North Carolina, the University of Vermont, and the University of Virginia.

The Accounting and Latin American History programs are consistently ranked top in the nation by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, most recently in their 2023 and 2021 editions, respectively. More than 50 other science, humanities, and professional programs rank in the top 25 nationally. The College of Pharmacy is listed as the third-best in the nation and The School of Information (iSchool) is sixth-best in Library and Information Sciences. Among other rankings, the School of Social Work is 7th, the Jackson School of Geosciences is 8th for Earth Sciences, the Cockrell School of Engineering is tied for 10th-best (with the undergraduate engineering program tied for 11th-best in the country), the Nursing School is tied for 13th, the University of Texas School of Law is 15th, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs is 7th, and the McCombs School of Business is tied for 16th-best (with the undergraduate business program tied for 5th-best in the country).

The University of Texas School of Architecture was ranked second among national undergraduate programs in 2012.

A 2005 Bloomberg survey ranked the school 5th among all business schools and first among public business schools for the largest number of alumni who are S&amp;P 500 CEOs. Similarly, a 2005 &quot;USA Today&quot; report ranked the university as &quot;the number one source of new Fortune 1000 CEOs&quot;. A &quot;payback&quot; analysis published by SmartMoney in 2011 comparing graduates&#x27; salaries to tuition costs concluded the school was the second-best value of all colleges in the nation, behind only Georgia Tech. A 2013 College Database study found that UT Austin was 22nd in the nation in terms of increased lifetime earnings by graduates.

==Research==

UT Austin is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.&quot; For the 2014–2015 cycle, the university was awarded over $580 million in sponsored projects, and has earned more than 300 patents since 2003. The University of Texas at Austin houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, a technology transfer center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development. In 2009, the university created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years. License agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009. In January 2020, the University of Texas Austin&#x27;s Texas Innovation Center was established to provide support for startups.

Research at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering and physical sciences, and the university is a world-leading research institution in fields such as computer science. Energy is a major research thrust, with federally funded projects on biofuels, battery and solar cell technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage, water purification membranes, among others. In 2009, the University of Texas founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science Raymond L. Orbach, to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research. In addition to its own medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and others.

In 2010, the University of Texas at Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in Austin.

The university operates several major auxiliary research centers. The world&#x27;s third-largest telescope, the Hobby–Eberly Telescope, and three other large telescopes are part of the university&#x27;s McDonald Observatory, west of Austin. The university manages nearly of biological field laboratories, including the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin. The Center for Agile Technology focuses on software development challenges. The J.J. Pickle Research Campus (PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates a series of supercomputers, such as Ranger (from 2008 to 2013), Stampede (2013–2017), Stampede2 (since 2017), and Frontera (since 2019). The Pickle campus also hosts the Microelectronics Research Center which houses micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a cleanroom for device fabrication.

Founded in 1946, the university&#x27;s Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has developed or tested the vast majority of the Navy&#x27;s high-frequency sonar equipment. In 2007, the Navy granted it a research contract funded up to $928 million over ten years. The Institute for Advanced Technology, founded in 1990 and located in the West Pickle Research Building, supports the U.S. Army with basic and applied research in several fields.

The Center for Transportation Research is a nationally recognized research institution focusing on transportation research, education, and public service. Established in 1963 as the Center for Highway Research, its projects address virtually all aspects of transportation, including economics, multimodal systems, traffic congestion relief, transportation policy, materials, structures, transit, environmental impacts, driver behavior, land use, geometric design, accessibility, and pavements.

In 2013, the University of Texas at Austin announced the naming of the O&#x27;Donnell Building for Applied Computational Engineering and Sciences. The O&#x27;Donnell Foundation of Dallas, headed by Peter O&#x27;Donnell and his wife, Edith Jones O&#x27;Donnell, has given more than $135 million to the university between 1983 and 2013. University president William C. Powers declared the O&#x27;Donnells &quot;among the greatest supporters of the University of Texas in its 130-year history. Their transformative generosity is based on the belief in our power to change society for the better.&quot; In 2008, O&#x27;Donnell pledged $18 million to finance the hiring of university faculty members undertaking research in mathematics, computers, and multiple scientific disciplines; his pledge was matched by W. A. &quot;Tex&quot; Moncrief Jr., an oilman and philanthropist from Fort Worth.
In addition, UT Austin and Amazon established a new science hub in 2023.
The University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute is located on the Gulf coast in Port Aransas. Established in 1941, UTMSI was the first permanent marine research facility in the state of Texas and has since contributed significantly to our understanding of marine ecosystems. Research at the Marine Science Institute ranges from locally-important work on mariculture and estuarine ecosystems to the investigation of global issues in marine science, from the Arctic to the tropics.

===Endowment===
The University of Texas System is entitled to at least 30% of the distributions from the Permanent University Fund (PUF), with over $33 billion in assets as of year-end 2021. The University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the &quot;Available University Fund&quot; (the name of the annual distribution of PUF&#x27;s income), and the Texas A&amp;M University System gets the other third. A regental policy requires &quot;at least&quot; 45 percent of UT System&#x27;s share of this money go to the University of Texas at Austin for &quot;program enrichment&quot;. By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, UT gets 30 percent, which is the &quot;minimum&quot; amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies. The Regents, however, can decide to allocate additional amounts to the university. Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service bonds, some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus. The Regents can change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share that goes to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.

Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas&#x27; two university systems, the University of Texas System and the Texas A&amp;M University System; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities&#x27; annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the university&#x27;s total endowment.

The University of Texas System also has about $22 billion of assets in its General Endowment Fund.

==Student life==
===Student profile===
For fall 2023, the university enrolled 42,444 undergraduate students and 10,638 postgraduate students, bringing the total student count to 53,082. Out-of-state students accounted for 9.4% of the undergraduate student body, and international students comprised 9.6% of the total student body.

For fall 2015, the undergraduate student body was 48.9% male and 51.1% female. In 2022, the three most popular undergraduate majors were Biology/Biological Sciences, Psychology, and Computer and Information Sciences. For graduate studies, the top choices were Business Administration and Management, Accounting, and Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods.

===Residential life===
The campus has fourteen residence halls, the newest of which opened in spring 2007. As of 2024, there are a total of fifteen on-campus residence halls, with eight located in North Campus and seven in South Campus. Residence Hall Rates for the 2024–25 fall and spring terms vary across eleven different rates, ranging from the lowest rate of $13,504 to the highest rate of $20,447, each corresponding to different room types. On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100 students. Jester Center is the largest residence hall with its capacity of 2,945. Academic enrollment exceeds the on-campus housing capacity; as a result, most students must live in private residence halls, housing cooperatives, apartments, or with Greek organizations and other off-campus residences. University Housing and Dining, which already has the largest market share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds.

===Greek life===

The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community. Approximately 14 percent of undergraduate students are in fraternities or sororities. With more than 65 national chapters, the university&#x27;s Greek community is one of the nation&#x27;s largest. These chapters are under the authority of one of the school&#x27;s six Greek council communities, Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Texas Asian Pan-Hellenic Council, Latino Pan-Hellenic Council, Multicultural Greek Council and University Panhellenic Council. Other registered student organizations also name themselves with Greek letters and are called affiliates. They are not a part of one of the six councils but have all of the same privileges and responsibilities of any other organization. Most Greek houses are west of the Drag in the West Campus neighborhood.

===Media===

Students express their opinions in and out of class through periodicals including &quot;Study Breaks&quot; magazine, Longhorn Life, &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United States), and the &quot;Texas Travesty&quot;. Over the airwaves students&#x27; voices are heard through Texas Student Television (K29HW-D) and KVRX Radio.

The Computer Writing and Research Lab of the university&#x27;s Department of Rhetoric and Writing also hosts &quot;the Blogora&quot;, a blog for &quot;connecting rhetoric, rhetorical methods and theories, and rhetoricians with public life&quot; by the Rhetoric Society of America.

===Traditions===

Traditions at the University of Texas are perpetuated through several school symbols and mediums. At athletic events, students frequently sing &quot;Texas Fight&quot;, the university&#x27;s fight song while displaying the Hook &#x27;em Horns hand gesture—the gesture mimicking the horns of the school&#x27;s mascot, Bevo the Texas Longhorn.

==== Smokey the Cannon ====

The University of Texas is also represented by the Texas Cowboys, who maintain Smokey, the university&#x27;s replica 1,200-pound Civil War artillery cannon.

==Athletics==

The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs.

===Varsity sports===

The university&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletics teams are nicknamed the Longhorns. Texas has won 50 total national championships, 42 of which are NCAA national championships.

The football team experienced its greatest success under coach Darrell Royal, winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, and 1970. It won a fourth title under head coach Mack Brown in 2005 after a 41–38 victory over previously undefeated Southern California in the 2006 Rose Bowl.

The university&#x27;s baseball team has made more trips to the College World Series (35) than any other school, and won championships in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, and 2005.

The Texas Longhorns men&#x27;s basketball has qualified for the NCAA Final Four three times and achieved 28 conference championships and 38 total appearances in the NCAA tournament.

Rick Barnes led the Texas Longhorns men&#x27;s basketball from 1998 to 2015. Under his leadership, the team achieved 16 NCAA Tournament appearances, including a Final Four appearance in 2003.

Shaka Smart coached the Texas Longhorns men&#x27;s basketball from 2015 to 2021. While at UT Austin, Smart&#x27;s teams made 3 NCAA Tournament appearances.

Additionally, the university&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles, with the men&#x27;s team having 13 of those titles, more than any other Division 1 team. The swim team was first developed under Coach Tex Robertson.

On June 12, 2020, UT student-athletes banded together with their #WeAreOne statement on Twitter. Among the list of changes included: renaming certain campus buildings, replacing statues, starting outreach programs, and replacing &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot;. UT Interim President Jay Hartzell released a statement on July 13, 2020, announcing the changes to be implemented in light of these demands from UT student-athletes. Hartzell said the university would make a multi-million dollar investment to programs that recruit, retain and support Black students; rename the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics, Math and Astronomy Building; honor Heman M. Sweatt in numerous ways, including placing a statue of Sweatt near the entrance of  T.S. Painter Hall; honor the Precursors, the first Black undergraduates to attend the University of Texas at Austin, by commissioning a new monument on the East Mall; erect a statue for Julius Whittier, the Longhorns&#x27; first Black football letterman, at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium; and more. However, one of the most controversial topics on the list – replacing &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; as UT&#x27;s alma mater – remained untouched.

<doc id="32035" wikidata="Q14663" url="?curid=32035" title="Unix shell">
<text>A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a terminal emulator; however, direct operation via serial hardware connections or Secure Shell are common for server systems. All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.

==Concept==
Generally, a &quot;shell&quot; is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands. A sophisticated shell can also change the environment in which other programs execute by passing named variables, a parameter list, or an input source.

In Unix-like operating systems, users typically have many choices of command-line interpreters for interactive sessions. When a user logs into the system interactively, a shell program is automatically executed for the duration of the session. The type of shell, which may be customized for each user, is typically stored in the user&#x27;s profile, for example in the local file or in a distributed configuration system such as NIS or LDAP; however, the user may execute any other available shell interactively.

On operating systems with a windowing system, such as macOS and desktop Linux distributions, some users may never use the shell directly. On Unix systems, the shell has historically been the implementation language of system startup scripts, including the program that starts a windowing system, configures networking, and many other essential functions. However, some system vendors have replaced the traditional shell-based startup system (init) with different approaches, such as systemd.

==Early shells==
The first Unix shell was the Thompson shell, &quot;sh&quot;, written by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs and distributed with Versions 1 through 6 of Unix, from 1971 to 1975. Though rudimentary by modern standards, it introduced many of the basic features common to all later Unix shells, including piping, simple control structures using codice_1 and codice_2, and filename wildcarding. Though not in current use, it is still available as part of some Ancient UNIX systems.

It was modeled after the Multics shell, developed in 1965 by American software engineer Glenda Schroeder. Schroeder&#x27;s Multics shell was itself modeled after the RUNCOM program Louis Pouzin showed to the Multics Team. The &quot;rc&quot; suffix on some Unix configuration files (for example, &quot;.vimrc&quot;), is a remnant of the RUNCOM ancestry of Unix shells.

The PWB shell or Mashey shell, &quot;sh&quot;, was an upward-compatible version of the Thompson shell, augmented by John Mashey and others and distributed with the Programmer&#x27;s Workbench UNIX, circa 1975–1977. It focused on making shell programming practical, especially in large shared computing centers. It added shell variables (precursors of environment variables, including the search path mechanism that evolved into $PATH), user-executable shell scripts, and interrupt-handling. Control structures were extended from if/goto to if/then/else/endif, switch/breaksw/endsw, and while/end/break/continue. As shell programming became widespread, these external commands were incorporated into the shell itself for performance.

But the most widely distributed and influential of the early Unix shells were the Bourne shell and the C shell. Both shells have been used as the coding base and model for many derivative and work-alike shells with extended feature sets.

===Bourne shell===
The Bourne shell, &quot;sh&quot;, was a new Unix shell by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs. Distributed as the shell for UNIX Version 7 in 1979, it introduced the rest of the basic features considered common to all the later Unix shells, including here documents, command substitution, more generic variables and more extensive builtin control structures. The language, including the use of a reversed keyword to mark the end of a block, was influenced by ALGOL 68. Traditionally, the Bourne shell program name is and its path in the Unix file system hierarchy is . But a number of compatible work-alikes are also available with various improvements and additional features. On many systems, sh may be a symbolic link or hard link to one of these alternatives:

* Almquist shell (ash): written as a BSD-licensed replacement for the Bourne Shell; often used in resource-constrained environments. The sh of FreeBSD, NetBSD (and their derivatives) are based on ash that has been enhanced to be POSIX conformant.
** Busybox: a set of Unix utilities for small and embedded systems, which includes 2 shells: ash, a derivative of the Almquist shell; and hush, an independent implementation of a Bourne shell.
** Debian Almquist shell (dash): a modern replacement for ash in Debian and Ubuntu
* Bourne-Again shell (bash): written as part of the GNU Project to provide a superset of Bourne Shell functionality. This shell can be found installed and is the default interactive shell for users on most Linux systems.
* KornShell (ksh): written by David Korn based on the Bourne shell sources while working at Bell Labs
* Public domain Korn shell (pdksh)
** MirBSD Korn shell (mksh): a descendant of the OpenBSD /bin/ksh and pdksh, developed as part of MirOS BSD
* Z shell (zsh): a relatively modern shell that is backward compatible with bash. It&#x27;s the default shell in Kali Linux since 2020.4 and macOS since 10.15 Catalina.

The POSIX standard specifies its standard shell as a strict subset of the Korn shell, an enhanced version of the Bourne shell. From a user&#x27;s perspective the Bourne shell was immediately recognized when active by its characteristic default command line prompt character, the dollar sign ().

===C shell===
The C shell, &quot;csh&quot;, was modeled on the C programming language, including the control structures and the expression grammar. It was written by Bill Joy as a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley, and was widely distributed with BSD Unix.

The C shell also introduced many features for interactive work, including the history and editing mechanisms, aliases, directory stacks, tilde notation, cdpath, job control and path hashing. On many systems, csh may be a symbolic link or hard link to TENEX C shell (tcsh), an improved version of Joy&#x27;s original version. Although the interactive features of csh have been copied to most other shells, the language structure has not been widely copied. The only work-alike is Hamilton C shell, written by Nicole Hamilton, first distributed on OS/2 in 1988 and on Windows since 1992.

==Configuration files==
Shells read configuration files in various circumstances. These files usually contain commands for the shell and are executed when loaded; they are usually used to set important variables used to find executables, like $PATH, and others that control the behavior and appearance of the shell. The table in this section shows the configuration files for popular shells.

Explanation:
* blank means a file is not read by a shell at all.
* &quot;yes&quot; means a file is always read by a shell upon startup.
* &quot;login&quot; means a file is read if the shell is a login shell.
* &quot;n/login&quot; means a file is read if the shell is not a login shell.
* &quot;int.&quot; means a file is read if the shell is interactive.
==Other shells==
Variations on the Unix shell concept that don&#x27;t derive from Bourne shell or C shell include the following:

* Bash
* es – A functional programming rc-compatible shell written in the mid-1990s.
* Friendly interactive shell (fish) – First released in 2005.
* KornShell (ksh) – KornShell is backward-compatible with the Bourne shell and comes standard with AIX.
* PowerShell – An object-oriented shell developed originally for Windows OS and now available to macOS and Linux.
* Qshell – A shell on the IBM i operating system based on POSIX and X/Open standards.
* rc – The default shell on Plan 9 from Bell Labs and Version 10 Unix written by Tom Duff. Ports have been made to various Unix-like operating systems.
* scsh – A Scheme Shell.
* wish – A windowing shell for Tcl/Tk.

<text>Ursula Kroeber Le Guin ( ; Kroeber; October 21, 1929 – January 22, 2018) was an American author. She is best known for her works of speculative fiction, including science fiction works set in her Hainish universe, and the &quot;Earthsea&quot; fantasy series. Her work was first published in 1959, and her literary career spanned nearly sixty years, producing more than twenty novels and over a hundred short stories, in addition to poetry, literary criticism, translations, and children&#x27;s books. Frequently described as an author of science fiction, Le Guin has also been called a &quot;major voice in American Letters&quot;. Le Guin said she would prefer to be known as an &quot;American novelist&quot;.

Le Guin was born in Berkeley, California, to author Theodora Kroeber and anthropologist Alfred Louis Kroeber. Having earned a master&#x27;s degree in French, Le Guin began doctoral studies but abandoned these after her marriage in 1953 to historian Charles Le Guin. She began writing full-time in the late 1950s and achieved major critical and commercial success with &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; (1969), which have been described by Harold Bloom as her masterpieces. For the latter volume, Le Guin won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel, becoming the first woman to do so. Several more works set in Earthsea or the Hainish universe followed; others included books set in the fictional country of Orsinia, several works for children, and many anthologies.

Cultural anthropology, Taoism, feminism, and the writings of Carl Jung all had a strong influence on Le Guin&#x27;s work. Many of her stories used anthropologists or cultural observers as protagonists, and Taoist ideas about balance and equilibrium have been identified in several writings. Le Guin often subverted typical speculative fiction tropes, such as through her use of dark-skinned protagonists in Earthsea, and also used unusual stylistic or structural devices in books such as the experimental work &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; (1985). Social and political themes, including race, gender, sexuality, and coming of age were prominent in her writing. She explored alternative political structures in many stories, such as in the philosophical short story &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; (1973) and the anarchist utopian novel &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; (1974).

Le Guin&#x27;s writing was enormously influential in the field of speculative fiction, and has been the subject of intense critical attention. She received numerous accolades, including eight Hugos, six Nebulas, and twenty-five Locus Awards, and in 2003 became the second woman honored as a Grand Master of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. The U.S. Library of Congress named her a Living Legend in 2000, and in 2014, she won the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Le Guin influenced many other authors, including Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, David Mitchell, Neil Gaiman, and Iain Banks. After her death in 2018, critic John Clute wrote that Le Guin had &quot;presided over American science fiction for nearly half a century&quot;, while author Michael Chabon referred to her as the &quot;greatest American writer of her generation&quot;.

== Life ==
=== Childhood and education ===

Ursula Kroeber was born in Berkeley, California, on October 21, 1929. Her father, Alfred Louis Kroeber, was an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Le Guin&#x27;s mother, Theodora Kroeber (born Theodora Covel Kracaw), had a graduate degree in psychology, but turned to writing in her 60s, developing a successful career as an author. Among her works was &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot; (1961), a biographical volume about Ishi, an Indigenous American who had been studied by Alfred Kroeber. Ishi was the last known member of the Yahi tribe after the rest of its members died or (mostly) were killed by white colonizers.

Le Guin had three older brothers: Karl, who became a literary scholar, Theodore, and Clifton. The family had a large book collection, and the siblings all became interested in reading while they were young. The Kroeber family had a number of visitors, including well-known academics such as Robert Oppenheimer; Le Guin would later use Oppenheimer as the model for Shevek, the physicist protagonist of &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;. The family divided its time between a summer home in the Napa Valley, and a house in Berkeley during the academic year.

Le Guin&#x27;s reading included science fiction and fantasy: she and her siblings frequently read issues of &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. She was fond of myths and legends, particularly Norse mythology, and of Native American legends that her father would narrate. Other authors she enjoyed were Lord Dunsany and Lewis Padgett. Le Guin also developed an early interest in writing; she wrote a short story when she was nine, and submitted her first short story to &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; when she was 11. The piece was rejected, and she did not submit anything else for another 10 years.

Le Guin attended Berkeley High School. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Renaissance French and Italian literature from Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1951, and graduated as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. As a child she had been interested in biology and poetry, but had been limited in her choice of career by her difficulties with mathematics. Le Guin undertook graduate studies at Columbia University, and earned a Master of Arts degree in French in 1952. Soon after, she began working towards a PhD, and won a Fulbright grant to continue her studies in France from 1953 to 1954.

=== Married life and death ===
In 1953, while traveling to France aboard the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, Ursula met historian Charles Le Guin. They married in Paris in December 1953. According to Le Guin, the marriage signaled the &quot;end of the doctorate&quot; for her. While her husband finished his doctorate at Emory University in Georgia, and later at the University of Idaho, Le Guin taught French: first at Mercer University, then at the University of Idaho after their move. She also worked as a secretary until the birth of her daughter Elisabeth in 1957. A second daughter, Caroline, was born in 1959. Also in that year, Charles became an instructor in history at Portland State University, and the couple moved to Portland, Oregon, where their son Theodore was born in 1964. They would live in Portland for the rest of their lives, although Le Guin received further Fulbright grants to travel to London in 1968 and 1975.

Le Guin&#x27;s writing career began in the late 1950s, but the time she spent caring for her children constrained her writing schedule. She would continue writing and publishing for nearly 60 years. She also worked as an editor, and taught undergraduate classes. She served on the editorial boards of the journals &quot;Paradoxa&quot; and &quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot;, in addition to writing literary criticism herself. She taught courses at Tulane University, Bennington College, and Stanford University, among others. In May 1983, she delivered a commencement speech entitled &quot;A Left-handed Commencement Address&quot; at Mills College in Oakland, California. It is listed as in &quot;American Rhetoric&quot;″s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century, and was included in her nonfiction collection &quot;Dancing at the Edge of the World&quot;.

Le Guin died on January 22, 2018, at her home in Portland, at the age of 88. Her son said that she had been in poor health for several months, and stated that it was likely she had had a heart attack. Private memorial services for her were held in Portland. A public memorial service, which included speeches by the writers Margaret Atwood, Molly Gloss, and Walidah Imarisha, was held in Portland on June 13, 2018.

=== Views and advocacy ===
Le Guin refused a Nebula Award for her story &quot;The Diary of the Rose&quot; in 1977, in protest at the Science Fiction Writers of America&#x27;s revocation of Stanisław Lem&#x27;s membership. Le Guin attributed the revocation to Lem&#x27;s criticism of American science fiction and willingness to live in the Eastern Bloc, and said she felt reluctant to receive an award &quot;for a story about political intolerance from a group that had just displayed political intolerance&quot;.

Le Guin once said she was &quot;raised as irreligious as a jackrabbit&quot;. She expressed a deep interest in Taoism and Buddhism, saying that Taoism gave her a &quot;handle on how to look at life&quot; during her adolescent years. In 1997, she published a translation of the &quot;Tao Te Ching.&quot;

In December 2009, Le Guin resigned from the Authors Guild in protest over its endorsement of Google&#x27;s book digitization project. &quot;You decided to deal with the devil&quot;, she wrote in her resignation letter. &quot;There are principles involved, above all the whole concept of copyright; and these you have seen fit to abandon to a corporation, on their terms, without a struggle.&quot; In a speech at the 2014 National Book Awards, Le Guin criticized Amazon and the control it exerted over the publishing industry, specifically referencing Amazon&#x27;s treatment of the Hachette Book Group during a dispute over ebook publication. Her speech received widespread media attention within and outside the United States, and was broadcast twice by National Public Radio.

== Chronology of writings ==
=== Early work ===
Le Guin&#x27;s first published work was the poem &quot;Folksong from the Montayna Province&quot; in 1959, while her first published short story was &quot;An die Musik&quot;, in 1961; both were set in her fictional country of Orsinia. Between 1951 and 1961 she also wrote five novels, all set in Orsinia, which were rejected by publishers on the grounds that they were inaccessible. Some of her poetry from this period was published in 1975 in the volume &quot;Wild Angels&quot;. Le Guin turned her attention to science fiction after a lengthy period of receiving rejections from publishers, knowing that there was a market for writing that could be readily classified as such. Her first professional publication was the short story &quot;April in Paris&quot; in 1962 in &quot;Fantastic Science Fiction&quot;, and seven other stories followed in the next few years, in &quot;Fantastic&quot; or &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Among them were &quot;The Dowry of Angyar&quot;, which introduced the fictional Hainish universe, and &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; and &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot;, which introduced the world of Earthsea. These stories were largely ignored by critics.

Ace Books released &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot;, Le Guin&#x27;s first published novel, in 1966. Two more Hainish novels, &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; and &quot;City of Illusions&quot; were published in 1966 and 1967, respectively, and the three books together would come to be known as the Hainish trilogy. The first two were each published as half of an &quot;Ace Double&quot;: two novels bound into a paperback and sold as a single low-cost volume. &quot;City of Illusions&quot; was published as a standalone volume, indicating Le Guin&#x27;s growing name recognition. These books received more critical attention than Le Guin&#x27;s short stories, with reviews being published in several science fiction magazines, but the critical response was still muted. The books contained many themes and ideas also present in Le Guin&#x27;s better known later works, including the &quot;archetypal journey&quot; of a protagonist who undertakes both a physical journey and one of self-discovery, cultural contact and communication, the search for identity, and the reconciliation of opposing forces.

When publishing her story &quot;Nine Lives&quot; in 1968, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine asked Le Guin whether they could run the story without her full first name, to which Le Guin agreed: the story was published under the name &quot;U. K. Le Guin&quot;. She later wrote that it was the first and only time she had experienced prejudice against her as a woman writer from an editor or publisher, and reflected that &quot;it seemed so silly, so grotesque, that I failed to see that it was also important.&quot; In subsequent printings, the story was published under her full name.

=== Critical attention ===
Le Guin&#x27;s next two books brought her sudden and widespread critical acclaim. &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, published in 1968, was a fantasy novel written initially for teenagers. Le Guin had not planned to write for young adults, but was asked to write a novel targeted at this group by the editor of Parnassus Press, who saw it as a market with great potential. A coming of age story set in the fictional archipelago of Earthsea, the book received a positive reception in both the U.S. and Britain.

Her next novel, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, was a Hainish universe story exploring themes of gender and sexuality on a fictional planet where humans have no fixed sex. The book was Le Guin&#x27;s first to address feminist issues, and according to scholar Donna White, it &quot;stunned the science fiction critics&quot;; it won both the Hugo and the Nebula Awards for best novel, making Le Guin the first woman to win these awards, and a number of other accolades. &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; have been described by critic Harold Bloom as Le Guin&#x27;s masterpieces. She won the Hugo Award again in 1973 for &quot;The Word for World Is Forest&quot;. The book was influenced by Le Guin&#x27;s anger over the Vietnam War, and explored themes of colonialism and militarism: Le Guin later described it as the &quot;most overt political statement&quot; she had made in a fictional work.

Le Guin continued to develop themes of equilibrium and coming-of-age in the next two installments of the &quot;Earthsea&quot; series, &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; and &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;, published in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Both books were praised for their writing, while the exploration of death as a theme in &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; also drew praise. Her 1974 novel &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; again won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards for best novel, making her the first person to win both awards for each of two books. Also set in the Hainish universe, the story explored anarchism and utopianism. Scholar Charlotte Spivack described it as representing a shift in Le Guin&#x27;s science fiction towards discussing political ideas. Several of her speculative fiction short stories from the period, including her first published story, were later anthologized in the 1975 collection &quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot;. The fiction of the period 1966 to 1974, which also included &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;, the Hugo Award-winning &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas&quot; and the Nebula Award-winning &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot;, constitutes Le Guin&#x27;s best-known body of work.

=== Wider exploration ===
Le Guin published a variety of work in the second half of the 1970s. This included speculative fiction in the form of the novel &quot;The Eye of the Heron&quot;, which, according to Le Guin, may be a part of the Hainish universe. She also published &quot;Very Far Away from Anywhere Else&quot;, a realistic novel for adolescents, as well as the collection &quot;Orsinian Tales&quot; and the novel &quot;Malafrena&quot; in 1976 and 1979, respectively. Though the latter two were set in the fictional country of Orsinia, the stories were realistic fiction rather than fantasy or science fiction. &quot;The Language of the Night&quot;, a collection of essays, was released in 1979, and Le Guin also published &quot;Wild Angels&quot;, a volume of poetry, in 1975.

Between 1979, when she published &quot;Malafrena&quot;, and 1994, when the collection &quot;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot; was released, Le Guin wrote primarily for a younger audience. In 1985 she published the experimental work &quot;Always Coming Home&quot;. She wrote 11 children&#x27;s picture books, including the &quot;Catwings&quot; series, between 1979 and 1994, along with &quot;The Beginning Place&quot;, an adolescent fantasy novel, released in 1980. Four more poetry collections were also published in this period, all of which were positively received. She also revisited Earthsea, publishing &quot;Tehanu&quot; in 1990: coming eighteen years after &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;, during which Le Guin&#x27;s views had developed considerably, the book was grimmer in tone than the earlier works in the series, and challenged some ideas presented therein. It received critical praise, won Le Guin a third Nebula Award for Best Novel, and led to the series being recognized among adult literature.

=== Later writings ===
Le Guin returned to the Hainish Cycle in the 1990s after a lengthy hiatus with the publication of a series of short stories, beginning with &quot;The Shobies&#x27; Story&quot; in 1990. These stories included &quot;Coming of Age in Karhide&quot; (1995), which explored growing into adulthood and was set on the same planet as &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. It was described by scholar Sandra Lindow as &quot;so transgressively sexual and so morally courageous&quot; that Le Guin &quot;could not have written it in the &#x27;60s&quot;. In the same year she published the story suite &quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot;, and followed it up with &quot;Old Music and the Slave Women&quot;, a fifth, connected, story in 1999. All five of the stories explored freedom and rebellion within a slave society. In 2000 she published &quot;The Telling&quot;, which would be her final Hainish novel, and the next year released &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Other Wind&quot;, the last two &quot;Earthsea&quot; books. The latter won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 2002.

From 2002 onwards several collections and anthologies of Le Guin&#x27;s work were published. A series of her stories from the period 1994–2002 was released in 2002 in the collection &quot;The Birthday of the World and Other Stories&quot;, along with the novella &quot;Paradises Lost&quot;. The volume examined unconventional ideas about gender, as well as anarchist themes. Other collections included &quot;Changing Planes&quot;, also released in 2002, while the anthologies included &quot;The Unreal and the Real&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Hainish Novels and Stories&quot;, a two-volume set of works from the Hainish universe released by the Library of America.

Other works from this period included &quot;Lavinia&quot; (2008), based on a character from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, and the &quot;Annals of the Western Shore&quot; trilogy, consisting of &quot;Gifts&quot; (2004), &quot;Voices&quot; (2006), and &quot;Powers&quot; (2007). Although &quot;Annals of the Western Shore&quot; was written for an adolescent audience, the third volume, &quot;Powers&quot;, received the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 2009. In her final years, Le Guin largely turned away from fiction, and produced a number of essays, poems, and some translation. Her final publications included the non-fiction collections &quot;Dreams Must Explain Themselves&quot; and &quot;Ursula K Le Guin: Conversations on Writing&quot;, and the poetry volume &quot;So Far So Good: Final Poems 2014–2018&quot;, all of which were released after her death.

== Style and influences ==
=== Influences ===
Le Guin read both classic and speculative fiction widely in her youth. She later said that science fiction did not have much impact on her until she read the works of Theodore Sturgeon and Cordwainer Smith, and that she had sneered at the genre as a child. Authors Le Guin describes as influential include Victor Hugo, William Wordsworth, Charles Dickens, Boris Pasternak, and Philip K. Dick. Le Guin and Dick attended the same high-school, but did not know each other; Le Guin later described her novel &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot; as an homage to him. She also considered J. R. R. Tolkien and Leo Tolstoy to be stylistic influences, and preferred reading Virginia Woolf and Jorge Luis Borges to well-known science-fiction authors such as Robert Heinlein, whose writing she described as being of the &quot;white man conquers the universe&quot; tradition. Several scholars state that the influence of mythology, which Le Guin enjoyed reading as a child, is also visible in much of her work: for example, the short story &quot;The Dowry of Angyar&quot; is described as a retelling of a Norse myth.

The discipline of cultural anthropology had a powerful influence on Le Guin&#x27;s writing. Her father Alfred Kroeber is considered a pioneer in the field, and was a director of the University of California Museum of Anthropology: as a consequence of his research, Le Guin was exposed to anthropology and cultural exploration as a child. In addition to myths and legends, she read such volumes as &quot;The Leaves of the Golden Bough&quot; by Elizabeth Grove Frazer, a children&#x27;s book adapted from &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, a study of myth and religion by her husband James George Frazer. She described living with her father&#x27;s friends and acquaintances as giving her the experience of the other. The experiences of Ishi, in particular, were influential on Le Guin, and elements of his story have been identified in works such as &quot;Planet of Exile&quot;, &quot;City of Illusions&quot;, and &quot;The Word for World Is Forest&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;.

Several scholars have commented that Le Guin&#x27;s writing was influenced by Carl Jung, and specifically by the idea of Jungian archetypes. In particular, the shadow in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is seen as the Shadow archetype from Jungian psychology, representing Ged&#x27;s pride, fear, and desire for power. Le Guin discussed her interpretation of this archetype, and her interest in the dark and repressed parts of the psyche, in a 1974 lecture. She stated elsewhere that she had never read Jung before writing the first &quot;Earthsea&quot; books. Other archetypes, including the Mother, Animus, and Anima, have also been identified in Le Guin&#x27;s writing. the planetary forests featured in multiple Hainish works are described as a metaphor for the mind, and of Jungian &quot;collective unconscious.

Philosophical Taoism had a large role in Le Guin&#x27;s world view, and the influence of Taoist thought can be seen in many of her stories. Many of Le Guin&#x27;s protagonists, including in &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;, embody the Taoist ideal of leaving things alone. The anthropologists of the Hainish universe try not to meddle with the cultures they encounter, while one of the earliest lessons Ged learns in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is not to use magic unless it is absolutely necessary. Taoist influence is evident in Le Guin&#x27;s depiction of equilibrium in the world of Earthsea: the archipelago is depicted as being based on a delicate balance, which is disrupted by somebody in each of the first three novels. This includes an equilibrium between land and sea, implicit in the name &quot;Earthsea&quot;, between people and their natural environment, and a larger cosmic equilibrium, which wizards are tasked with maintaining. Another prominent Taoist idea is the reconciliation of opposites such as light and dark, or good and evil. A number of Hainish novels, &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; prominent among them, explored such a process of reconciliation. In the Earthsea universe, it is not the dark powers, but the characters&#x27; misunderstanding of the balance of life, that is depicted as evil, in contrast to conventional Western stories in which good and evil are in constant conflict.

=== Genre and style ===
Although Le Guin is primarily known for her works of speculative fiction, she also wrote realistic fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and several other literary forms, and as a result her work is difficult to classify. Her writings received critical attention from mainstream critics, critics of children&#x27;s literature, and critics of speculative fiction. Le Guin herself said that she would prefer to be known as an &quot;American novelist&quot;. Le Guin&#x27;s transgression of conventional boundaries of genre led to literary criticism of Le Guin becoming &quot;Balkanized&quot;, particularly between scholars of children&#x27;s literature and speculative fiction. Commentators have noted that the &quot;Earthsea&quot; novels specifically received less critical attention because they were considered children&#x27;s books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of children&#x27;s literature, describing it as &quot;adult chauvinist piggery&quot;. In 1976, literature scholar George Slusser criticized the &quot;silly publication classification designating the original series as &#x27;children&#x27;s literature, while in Barbara Bucknall&#x27;s opinion Le Guin &quot;can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age.&quot;

Several of her works have a premise drawn from sociology, psychology, or philosophy. As a result, Le Guin&#x27;s writing is often described as &quot;soft&quot; science fiction, and she has been described as the &quot;patron saint&quot; of this sub-genre. A number of science fiction authors have objected to the term &quot;soft science fiction&quot;, describing it as a potentially pejorative term used to dismiss stories not based on problems in physics, astronomy, or engineering, and also to target the writing of women or other groups under-represented in the genre. Le Guin suggested the term &quot;social science fiction&quot; for some of her writing, while pointing out that many of her stories were not science fiction at all. She argued that the term &quot;soft science fiction&quot; was divisive, and implied a narrow view of what constitutes valid science fiction.

The influence of anthropology can be seen in the setting Le Guin chose for a number of her works. Several of her protagonists are anthropologists or ethnologists exploring a world alien to them. This is particularly true in the stories set in the Hainish universe, an alternative reality in which humans did not evolve on Earth, but on Hain. The Hainish subsequently colonized many planets, before losing contact with them, giving rise to varied but related biology and social structure. Examples include Rocannon in &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; and Genly Ai in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. Other characters, such as Shevek in &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, become cultural observers in the course of their journeys on other planets. Le Guin&#x27;s writing often examines alien cultures, and particularly the human cultures from planets other than Earth in the Hainish universe. In discovering these &quot;alien&quot; worlds, Le Guin&#x27;s protagonists, and by extension the readers, also journey into themselves, and challenge the nature of what they consider &quot;alien&quot; and what they consider &quot;native&quot;.

Several of Le Guin&#x27;s works have featured stylistic or structural features that were unusual or subversive. The heterogeneous structure of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, described as &quot;distinctly post-modern&quot;, was unusual for the time of its publication. This was in marked contrast to the structure of (primarily male-authored) traditional science fiction, which was straightforward and linear. The novel was framed as part of a report sent to the Ekumen by the protagonist Genly Ai after his time on the planet Gethen, thus suggesting that Ai was selecting and ordering the material, consisting of personal narration, diary extracts, Gethenian myths, and ethnological reports. &quot;Earthsea&quot; also employed an unconventional narrative form described by scholar Mike Cadden as &quot;free indirect discourse&quot;, in which the feelings of the protagonist are not directly separated from the narration, making the narrator seem sympathetic to the characters, and removing the skepticism towards a character&#x27;s thoughts and emotions that are a feature of more direct narration. Cadden suggests that this method leads to younger readers sympathizing directly with the characters, making it an effective technique for young-adult literature.

A number of Le Guin&#x27;s writings, including the &quot;Earthsea&quot; series, challenged the conventions of epic fantasies and myths. Many of the protagonists in &quot;Earthsea&quot; were dark-skinned individuals, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used; some of the antagonists, in contrast, were white-skinned, a switching of race roles that has been remarked upon by multiple critics. In a 2001 interview, Le Guin attributed the frequent lack of character illustrations on her book covers to her choice of non-white protagonists. She explained this choice, saying: &quot;most people in the world aren&#x27;t white. Why in the future would we assume they are?&quot; Her 1985 book &quot;Always Coming Home&quot;, described as &quot;her great experiment&quot;, included a story told from the perspective of a young protagonist, but also included poems, rough drawings of plants and animals, myths, and anthropological reports from the matriarchal society of the Kesh, a fictional people living in the Napa valley after a catastrophic global flood.

== Themes ==
=== Gender and sexuality ===
Gender and sexuality are prominent themes in a number of Le Guin&#x27;s works. &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, published in 1969, was among the first books in the genre now known as feminist science fiction, and is the most famous examination of androgyny in science fiction. The story is set on the fictional planet of Gethen, whose inhabitants are ambisexual humans with no fixed gender identity, who adopt female or male sexual characteristics for brief periods of their sexual cycle. Which sex they adopt can depend on context and relationships. Gethen was portrayed as a society without war, as a result of this absence of fixed gender characteristics, and also without sexuality as a continuous factor in social relationships. Gethenian culture was explored in the novel through the eyes of a Terran, whose masculinity proves a barrier to cross-cultural communication. Outside the Hainish Cycle, Le Guin&#x27;s use of a female protagonist in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, published in 1971, was described as a &quot;significant exploration of womanhood&quot;.
Le Guin&#x27;s attitude towards gender and feminism evolved considerably over time. Although &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; was seen as a landmark exploration of gender, it also received criticism for not going far enough. Reviewers pointed to its usage of masculine gender pronouns to describe its androgynous characters, the lack of androgynous characters portrayed in stereotypical feminine roles, and the portrayal of heterosexuality as the norm on Gethen. Le Guin&#x27;s portrayal of gender in &quot;Earthsea&quot; was also described as perpetuating the notion of a male-dominated world; according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Le Guin saw men as the actors and doers in the [world], while women remain the still centre, the well from which they drink&quot;. Le Guin initially defended her writing; in a 1976 essay &quot;Is Gender Necessary?&quot; she wrote that gender was secondary to the primary theme of loyalty in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. Le Guin revisited this essay in 1988, and acknowledged that gender was central to the novel; she also apologized for depicting Gethenians solely in heterosexual relationships.

Le Guin responded to these critiques in her subsequent writing. She intentionally used feminine pronouns for all sexually latent Gethenians in her 1995 short story &quot;Coming of Age in Karhide&quot;, and in a later reprinting of &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot;, which was first published in 1969. &quot;Coming of Age in Karhide&quot; was later anthologized in the 2002 collection &quot;The Birthday of the World&quot;, which contained six other stories featuring unorthodox sexual relationships and marital arrangements. She also revisited gender relations in &quot;Earthsea&quot; in &quot;Tehanu&quot;, published in 1990. This volume was described as a rewriting or reimagining of &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, because the power and status of the female protagonist Tenar are the inverse of what they were in the earlier book, which was also focused on her and Ged. During this later period she commented that she considered &quot;The Eye of the Heron&quot;, published in 1978, to be her first work genuinely centered on a woman.

=== Moral development ===
Le Guin explores coming of age, and moral development more broadly, in many of her writings. This is particularly the case in those works written for a younger audience, such as &quot;Earthsea&quot; and &quot;Annals of the Western Shore&quot;. Le Guin wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose to explore coming-of-age in &quot;Earthsea&quot; since she was writing for an adolescent audience: &quot;Coming of age ... is a process that took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It&#x27;s their main occupation, in fact.&quot; She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing coming of age, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of &quot;rational daily life&quot;.

The first three &quot;Earthsea&quot; novels together follow Ged from youth to old age, and each of them also follow the coming of age of a different character. &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; focuses on Ged&#x27;s adolescence, while &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; and &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; explore that of Tenar and the prince Arren, respectively. &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is frequently described as a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, in which Ged&#x27;s coming of age is intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes through the novel. To Mike Cadden the book was a convincing tale &quot;to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him&quot;. Reviewers have described the ending of the novel, wherein Ged finally accepts the shadow as a part of himself, as a rite of passage. Scholar Jeanne Walker writes that the rite of passage at the end was an analogue for the entire plot of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, and that the plot itself plays the role of a rite of passage for an adolescent reader.

Each volume of &quot;Annals of the Western Shore&quot; also describes the coming of age of its protagonists, and features explorations of being enslaved to one&#x27;s own power. The process of growing up is depicted as seeing beyond narrow choices the protagonists are presented with by society. In &quot;Gifts&quot;, Orrec and Gry realize that the powers their people possess can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin&#x27;s short story &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot;. Similarly, Ged helps Tenar in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; to value herself and to find choices that she did not see, leading her to leave the Tombs with him.

=== Political systems ===
Alternative social and political systems are a recurring theme in Le Guin&#x27;s writing. Critics have paid particular attention to &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; and &quot;Always Coming Home&quot;, although Le Guin explores related themes in a number of her works, such as in &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas&quot;. &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; is an anarchist utopian novel, which according to Le Guin drew from pacifist anarchists, including Peter Kropotkin, as well as from the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. Le Guin has been credited with anarchism from the cultural ghetto to which it has been consigned&quot;, and helping to bring it into the intellectual mainstream. Fellow author Kathleen Ann Goonan wrote that Le Guin&#x27;s work confronted the &quot;paradigm of insularity toward the suffering of people, other living beings, and resources&quot;, and explored &quot;life-respecting sustainable alternatives&quot;.

&quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, set on the twin planets of Urras and Anarres, features a planned anarchist society depicted as an &quot;ambiguous utopia&quot;. The society, created by settlers from Urras, is materially poorer than the wealthy society of Urras, but more ethically and morally advanced. Unlike classical utopias, the society of Anarres is portrayed as neither perfect nor static; the protagonist Shevek finds himself traveling to Urras to pursue his research. Nonetheless, the misogyny and hierarchy present in the authoritarian society of Urras is absent among the anarchists, who base their social structure on cooperation and individual liberty. &quot;The Eye of the Heron&quot;, published a few years after &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, was described as continuing Le Guin&#x27;s exploration of human freedom, through a conflict between two societies of opposing philosophies: a town inhabited by descendants of pacifists, and a city inhabited by descendants of criminals.

&quot;Always Coming Home&quot;, set in California in the distant future, examines a warlike society, resembling contemporary American society, from the perspective of the Kesh, its pacifist neighbors. The society of the Kesh has been identified by scholars as a feminist utopia, which Le Guin uses to explore the role of technology. Scholar Warren Rochelle stated that it was &quot;neither a matriarchy nor a patriarchy: men and women just are&quot;. &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas&quot;, a parable depicting a society in which widespread wealth, happiness, and security, comes at the cost of the continued misery of a single child, has also been read as a critique of contemporary American society. &quot;The Word for World is Forest&quot; explored the manner in which the structure of society affects the natural environment; in the novel, the natives of the planet of Athshe have adapted their way of life to the ecology of the planet. The colonizing human society, in contrast, is depicted as destructive and uncaring; in depicting it, Le Guin also critiqued colonialism and imperialism, driven partly by her disapproval for U.S. intervention in the Vietnam War.

Other social structures are examined in works such as the story cycle &quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot;, and the short story &quot;Old Music and the Slave Women&quot;, occasionally described as a &quot;fifth way to forgiveness&quot;. Set in the Hainish universe, the five stories together examine revolution and reconstruction in a slave-owning society. According to Rochelle, the stories examine a society that has the potential to build a &quot;truly human community&quot;, made possible by the Ekumen&#x27;s recognition of the slaves as human beings, thus offering them the prospect of freedom and the possibility of utopia, brought about through revolution. Slavery, justice, and the role of women in society are also explored in &quot;Annals of the Western Shore&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Reception ===
Le Guin received rapid recognition after the publication of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; in 1969, and by the 1970s she was among the best known writers in the field. Her books sold many millions of copies, and were translated into more than 40 languages; several remain in print many decades after their first publication. Her work received intense academic attention; she has been described as being the &quot;premier writer of both fantasy and science fiction&quot; of the 1970s, the most frequently discussed science fiction writer of the 1970s, and over her career, as intensively studied as Philip K. Dick. Later in her career, she also received recognition from mainstream literary critics: in an obituary, Jo Walton stated that Le Guin &quot;was so good that the mainstream couldn&#x27;t dismiss SF any more&quot;. According to scholar Donna White, Le Guin was a &quot;major voice in American letters&quot;, whose writing was the subject of many volumes of literary critique, more than two hundred scholarly articles, and a number of dissertations.

Le Guin was unusual in receiving most of her recognition for her earliest works, which remained her most popular; a commentator in 2018 described a &quot;tendency toward didacticism&quot; in her later works, while John Clute, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stated that her later writing &quot;suffers from the need she clearly felt to speak responsibly to her large audience about important things; an artist being responsible can be an artist wearing a crown of thorns&quot;. Not all of her works received as positive a reception; &quot;The Compass Rose&quot; was among the volumes that had a mixed reaction, while the &quot;Science Fiction Encyclopedia&quot; described &quot;The Eye of the Heron&quot; as &quot;an over-diagrammatic political fable whose translucent simplicity approaches self-parody&quot;. Even the critically well-received &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, in addition to critique from feminists, was described by Alexei Panshin as a &quot;flat failure&quot;.

Her writing was recognized by the popular media and by commentators. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented in 2009 that after the death of Arthur C. Clarke, Le Guin was &quot;arguably the most acclaimed science fiction writer on the planet&quot;, and went on to describe her as a &quot;pioneer&quot; of literature for young people. In an obituary, Clute described Le Guin as having &quot;presided over American science fiction for nearly half a century&quot;, and as having a reputation as an author of the &quot;first rank&quot;. In 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as &quot;America&#x27;s greatest living science fiction writer&quot;. Praise for Le Guin frequently focused on the social and political themes her work explored, and for her prose; literary critic Harold Bloom described Le Guin as an &quot;exquisite stylist&quot;, saying that in her writing, &quot;Every word was exactly in place and every sentence or line had resonance&quot;. According to Bloom, Le Guin was a &quot;visionary who set herself against all brutality, discrimination, and exploitation&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as using &quot;a lean but lyrical style&quot; to explore issues of moral relevance. Prefacing an interview in 2008, &quot;Vice&quot; magazine described Le Guin as having written &quot;some of the more mind-warping [science fiction] and fantasy tales of the past 40 years&quot;.

Le Guin&#x27;s fellow authors also praised her writing. After Le Guin&#x27;s death in 2018, writer Michael Chabon referred to her as the &quot;greatest American writer of her generation&quot;, and said that she had &quot;awed [him] with the power of an unfettered imagination&quot;. Author Margaret Atwood hailed Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;sane, smart, crafty and lyrical voice&quot;, and wrote that social injustice was a powerful motivation through Le Guin&#x27;s life. Her prose, according to Zadie Smith, was &quot;as elegant and beautiful as any written in the twentieth century&quot;. Academic and author Joyce Carol Oates highlighted Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;outspoken sense of justice, decency, and common sense&quot;, and called her &quot;one of the great American writers and a visionary artist whose work will long endure&quot;. China Miéville described Le Guin as a &quot;literary colossus&quot;, and wrote that she was a &quot;writer of intense ethical seriousness and intelligence, of wit and fury, of radical politics, of subtlety, of freedom and yearning&quot;.

=== Awards and recognition ===

The accolades Le Guin has received include numerous annual awards for individual works. She won eight Hugo Awards from twenty-six nominations, and six Nebula Awards from eighteen nominations, including four Nebula Awards for Best Novel from six nominations, more than any other writer. &quot;Locus Magazine&quot; subscribers have voted Le Guin to receive 25 Locus Awards. At the time of her death she was third for total wins, as well as second behind Neil Gaiman for awards for fiction. For her novels alone she won five Locus Awards, four Nebula Awards, two Hugo Awards, and one World Fantasy Award, and won each of those awards in short fiction categories as well. Her third &quot;Earthsea&quot; novel, &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;, won the 1973 National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature, and she was a finalist for ten Mythopoeic Awards, nine in Fantasy and one for Scholarship. Her 1996 collection &quot;Unlocking the Air and Other Stories&quot; was one of three finalists for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Other awards won by Le Guin include three James Tiptree Jr. Awards, and three Jupiter Awards. She won her final Hugo award a year after her death, for a complete edition of &quot;Earthsea&quot;, illustrated by Charles Vess; the same volume also won a Locus award.

Other awards and accolades have recognized Le Guin&#x27;s contributions to speculative fiction. She was voted a Gandalf Grand Master Award by the World Science Fiction Society in 1979. The Science Fiction Research Association gave her its Pilgrim Award in 1989 for her &quot;lifetime contributions to SF and fantasy scholarship&quot;. At the 1995 World Fantasy Convention she won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, a judged recognition of outstanding service to the fantasy field. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted her in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named her its 20th Grand Master in 2003: she was the second, and at the time of death one of only six, women to receive that honor. In 2013, she was given the Eaton Award by the University of California, Riverside, for lifetime achievement in science fiction.

Later in her career Le Guin also received accolades recognizing her contributions to literature more generally. In April 2000, the U.S. Library of Congress named Le Guin a Living Legend in the &quot;Writers and Artists&quot; category for her significant contributions to America&#x27;s cultural heritage. The American Library Association granted her the annual Margaret Edwards Award in 2004, and also selected her to deliver the annual May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture. The Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work: the 2004 panel cited the first four &quot;Earthsea&quot; volumes, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Beginning Place&quot;. The panel said that Le Guin &quot;has inspired four generations of young adults to read beautifully constructed language, visit fantasy worlds that inform them about their own lives, and think about their ideas that are neither easy nor inconsequential&quot;. A collection of Le Guin&#x27;s works was published by the Library of America in 2016, an honor only rarely given to living writers. The National Book Foundation awarded Le Guin its Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2014, stating that she had &quot;defied conventions of narrative, language, character, and genre, and transcended boundaries between fantasy and realism to forge new paths for literary fiction&quot;. The American Academy of Arts and Letters made her a member in 2017. On July 27, 2021, Le Guin was honored by the US Postal Service with the 33rd stamp in the Postal Service&#x27;s Literary Arts series. The stamp features a portrait of the author taken from a 2006 photograph against a background image inspired by her book &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. The stamp was designed by Donato Gionacola. A crater on the planet Mercury was named in Le Guin&#x27;s honor in November 2024.

=== Legacy and influence ===
Le Guin had a considerable influence on the field of speculative fiction; Jo Walton argued that Le Guin played a large role in both broadening the genre and helping genre writers achieve mainstream recognition. The &quot;Earthsea&quot; books are cited as having a wide impact, including outside the field of literature. Atwood considers &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; one of the &quot;wellsprings&quot; of fantasy literature, and modern writers have credited the book for the idea of a &quot;wizard school&quot;, later made famous by the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. The notion that names can exert power is a theme in the Earthsea series; critics have suggested that this inspired Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s use of the idea in his 2001 film &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.

Le Guin&#x27;s writings set in the Hainish universe also had a wide influence. Le Guin coined the name &quot;ansible&quot; for an instantaneous interstellar communication device in 1966; the term was later adopted by several other writers, including Orson Scott Card in the &quot;Ender Series&quot; and Neil Gaiman in a script for a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode. Suzanne Reid wrote that at the time &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; was written, Le Guin&#x27;s ideas of androgyny were unique not only to science fiction, but to literature in general. That volume is specifically cited as leaving a large legacy; in discussing it, literary critic Harold Bloom wrote &quot;Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time&quot;. Bloom followed this up by listing the book in his &quot;The Western Canon&quot; (1994) as one of the books in his conception of artistic works that have been important and influential in Western culture. This view was echoed in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, which wrote that &quot;No single work did more to upend the genre&#x27;s conventions than &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;&quot;, while White argued that it was one of the seminal works of science fiction, as important as Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818).

Commentators have also described Le Guin as being influential in the field of literature more generally. Literary critic Elaine Showalter suggested that Le Guin &quot;set the pace as a writer for women unlearning silence, fear, and self-doubt&quot;, while writer Brian Attebery stated that &quot;[Le Guin] invented us: science fiction and fantasy critics like me but also poets and essayists and picture book writers and novelists&quot;. Le Guin&#x27;s own literary criticism proved influential; her 1973 essay &quot;From Elfland to Poughkeepsie&quot; led to renewed interest in the work of Kenneth Morris, and eventually to the publication of a posthumous novel by Morris. Le Guin also played a role in bringing speculative fiction into the literary mainstream by supporting journalists and scholarly endeavors examining the genre.

Several prominent authors acknowledge Le Guin&#x27;s influence on their own writing. Jo Walton wrote that &quot;her way of looking at the world had a huge influence on me, not just as a writer but as a human being&quot;. Other writers she influenced include Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, as well as David Mitchell, Gaiman, Algis Budrys, Goonan, and Iain Banks. Mitchell, author of books such as &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, described &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; as having a strong influence on him, and said that he felt a desire to &quot;wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin&quot;. Le Guin is also credited with inspiring several female science fiction authors in the 1970s, including Vonda McIntyre. When McIntyre established a writers&#x27; workshop in Seattle in 1971, Le Guin was one of the instructors. Film-maker Arwen Curry began production on a documentary about Le Guin in 2009, filming &quot;dozens&quot; of hours of interviews with the author as well as many other writers and artists who have been inspired by her. Curry launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to finish the documentary in early 2016 after winning a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The Ursula K. Le Guin Prize for Fiction was announced in October 2021. The award is managed by the Ursula K. Le Guin Literary Trust and a panel of jurors. The prize is worth and is awarded annually to &quot;a single book-length work of imaginative fiction.&quot; The inaugural winner was Khadija Abdalla Bajaber for her book &quot;The House of Rust&quot;.

=== Adaptations of her work ===
Le Guin&#x27;s works have been adapted for radio, film, television, and the stage. Her 1971 novel &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot; has been released on film twice, in 1979 by WNET with Le Guin&#x27;s participation, and then in 2002 by the A&amp;E Network. In a 2008 interview, she said she considered the 1979 version as &quot;the only good adaptation to film&quot; of her work to date. In the early 1980s Hayao Miyazaki asked to create an animated adaptation of &quot;Earthsea&quot;. Le Guin, who was unfamiliar with his work and anime in general, initially turned down the offer, but later accepted after seeing &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;. The third and fourth &quot;Earthsea&quot; books were used as the basis of &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot;, released in 2006. Rather than being directed by Hayao Miyazaki himself, the film was directed by his son Gorō, which disappointed Le Guin. Le Guin was positive about the aesthetic of the film, writing that &quot;much of it was beautiful&quot;, but was critical of the film&#x27;s moral sense and its use of physical violence, and particularly the use of a villain whose death provided the film&#x27;s resolution. In 2004, the Sci Fi Channel adapted the first two books of the &quot;Earthsea&quot; trilogy as the miniseries &quot;Legend of Earthsea&quot;. Le Guin was highly critical of the miniseries, calling it a &quot;far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned&quot;, objecting to the use of white actors for her red-, brown-, and black-skinned characters.

Le Guin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; was adapted for the stage in 1995 by Chicago&#x27;s Lifeline Theatre. Reviewer Jack Helbig at the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote that the &quot;adaptation is intelligent and well crafted but ultimately unsatisfying&quot;, in large measure because it is extremely difficult to compress a complex 300-page novel into a two-hour stage presentation. &quot;Paradises Lost&quot; was adapted into an opera by the opera program of the University of Illinois. The opera was composed by Stephen A. Taylor; the libretto has been attributed both to Kate Gale and to Marcia Johnson. Created in 2005, the opera premiered in April 2012. Le Guin described the effort as a &quot;beautiful opera&quot; in an interview, and expressed hopes that it would be picked up by other producers. She also said she was better pleased with stage versions, including &quot;Paradises Lost&quot;, than screen adaptations of her work to that date. In 2013, the Portland Playhouse and Hand2Mouth Theatre produced a play based on &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, directed and adapted by Jonathan Walters, with text written by John Schmor. The play opened May 2, 2013, and ran until June 16, 2013, in Portland, Oregon.

== Written works ==
Le Guin&#x27;s career as a professional writer spanned nearly sixty years, from 1959 to 2018. During this period, she wrote more than twenty novels, more than a hundred short stories, more than a dozen volumes of poetry, five translations, and thirteen children&#x27;s books. Her writing encompassed speculative fiction, realistic fiction, non-fiction, screenplays, librettos, essays, poetry, speeches, translations, literary critiques, chapbooks, and children&#x27;s fiction. Le Guin&#x27;s first published work was the poem &quot;Folksong from the Montayna Province&quot; in 1959, while her first published short story was &quot;An die Musik&quot;, in 1961. Her first professional publication was the short story &quot;April in Paris&quot; in 1962, while her first published novel was &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot;, released by Ace Books in 1966. Her final publications included the non-fiction collections &quot;Dreams Must Explain Themselves&quot; and &quot;Ursula K Le Guin: Conversations on Writing&quot;, both released after her death. Her best-known works include the six volumes of the &quot;Earthsea&quot; series, and the many novels of the Hainish Cycle.

<text>The Dispossessed (subtitled An Ambiguous Utopia) is a 1974 anarchist utopian science fiction novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, one of her seven Hainish Cycle novels. It is one of a small number of books to win all three Hugo, Locus and Nebula Awards for Best Novel. It achieved a degree of literary recognition unusual for science fiction due to its exploration of themes such as anarchism and revolutionary societies, capitalism, utopia, individualism, and collectivism.

It features the development of the mathematical theory underlying a fictional &quot;ansible&quot;, a device capable of faster-than-light communication (it can send messages without delay, even between star systems) that plays a critical role in the Hainish Cycle. The invention of the ansible places the novel first in the internal chronology of the Hainish Cycle, although it was the fifth published.

==Background==
In her introduction to the Library of America reprint in 2017, Le Guin reflected on her past 40 years by writing: 
Le Guin&#x27;s parents, anthropologist Alfred and writer Theodora Kroeber, were friends with J. Robert Oppenheimer; Le Guin stated that Oppenheimer was the model for Shevek, the book&#x27;s protagonist.

==Meaning of the title==
It has been suggested that Le Guin&#x27;s title is a reference to Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel about anarchists, &quot;Demons&quot; (, &quot;Bésy&quot;), one popular English-language translation of which is titled &quot;The Possessed&quot;. Many of the philosophical underpinnings and ecological concepts came from Murray Bookchin&#x27;s &quot;Post-Scarcity Anarchism&quot; (1971), according to a letter Le Guin sent to Bookchin. Anarres citizens are &quot;dispossessed&quot; not just by political choice, but by the very lack of actual resources to possess. Here, again, Le Guin draws a contrast with the natural wealth of Urras, and the competitive behaviors this fosters.

==Setting==

&quot;The Dispossessed&quot; is set on Anarres and Urras, the twin inhabited worlds of Tau Ceti. Urras is divided into several states, but is dominated by two rival superpowers, A-Io and Thu. While on Urras, the main character spends most of his time in A-Io, a state with a capitalist economy and a patriarchal system. The state of Thu is never actually visited, but is said to have an authoritarian system that claims to rule in the name of the proletariat. A-Io has dissent in its borders, including a few different oppositional left-wing parties, one of which is closely linked to the rival society of Thu. When a revolution is sparked in Benbili, the third major, yet undeveloped, area of Urras, A-Io invades the Thu-supported revolutionary area, generating a proxy war.

The moon, Anarres, represents a more idealist ideological structure: anarcho-syndicalism. The Anarresti, who call themselves Odonians after the founder of their political philosophy, arrived on Anarres from Urras around 200 years ago. In order to forestall an anarcho-syndicalist rebellion, the major Urrasti states gave the revolutionaries the right to live on Anarres, along with a guarantee of non-interference. Before this, Anarres had had no permanent settlements, apart from some mining facilities.

Anarres is settled after a revolution on Urras by the followers of Odo, the central character of Le Guin&#x27;s 1974 short story &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot;. 

The economic and political situation of Anarres and its relation to Urras is ambiguous. The people of Anarres consider themselves as being free and independent, having broken off from the political and social influence of the old world. However, the powers of Urras consider Anarres as being essentially their mining colony, as the annual consignment of Anarres&#x27;s precious metals and their distribution to major powers on Urras is a major economic event of the old world.

=== Theoretical timeline ===
In the last chapter of &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, we learn that the Hainish people arrived at Tau Ceti 60 years previously, which is more than 100 years after the secession of the Odonians from Urras and their exodus to Anarres. Terrans are also there, and the novel occurs some time in the future, according to an elaborate chronology worked out by science fiction author Ian Watson in 1975: &quot;the baseline date of AD 2300 for &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; is taken from the description of Earth in that book (§11) as having passed through an ecological and social collapse with a population peak of 9 billion to a low-population but highly centralized recovery economy.&quot; In the same article, Watson assigns a date of AD 4870 to &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;; both dates are problematic — as Watson says himself, they are contradicted by &quot;Genly Ai&#x27;s statement that Terrans &#x27;were ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero&#x27;&quot;.

== Story ==
The chapters alternate between the two planets and between the present and the past. The even-numbered chapters, which are set on Anarres, chronologically take place first and are followed by the odd-numbered chapters, which take place on Urras. The only exceptions occur in the first and last chapters: the first takes place on both the moon and the planet; the last takes place in a spaceship.
===Anarres (chapters 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)===
Chapter One begins in the middle of the story. The protagonist Shevek is an Anarresti physicist attempting to develop a General Temporal Theory. The physics of the book, Principles of Simultaneity, describes time as having a much deeper, more complex structure than as it is understood. It incorporates not only mathematics and physics, but also philosophy and ethics. Shevek finds his work blocked by a jealous superior, Sabul, who controls the publication of Anarresti manuscripts. As his theories conflict with the prevailing political philosophy, Shevek believes that his ideas are discordant with Anarresti society. Throughout his time in Abbenay, he runs into old acquaintances from his adolescence and his mother, Rulag. One of his old female acquaintances, Takver, becomes involved with Shevek and the two start a relationship and have their first child together.

Shevek&#x27;s work is further disrupted by his social obligation to perform manual labor during a drought in Anarres&#x27;s anarchist society. To ensure survival in a harsh environment, the people of Anarres must put the needs of society ahead of their own personal desires, so Shevek performs hard agricultural labor in a dusty desert for four years instead of working on his research. After the drought, he arranges to go to Urras, having won a prestigious award for his work there, to finish and publish his theory with the help of the syndicate he set up to distribute his works. His contact with scholars on Urras and his decision to travel results in political turmoil on Anarres. Shevek is accused of being a traitor by Sabul and threatening the political separation between the two worlds. Believing that his theory will benefit the Anarresti and the wider society, Shevek embarks to Urras.

===Urras (chapters 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)===
Shevek&#x27;s journey to the only spaceport in Anarres is eventful. Having been deemed a traitor by some groups on the planet, Shevek is nearly killed as an angry mob tries to stop him getting on the spaceship to A-Io. Arriving in A-Io, Urras, Shevek is feted. He soon finds himself disgusted with the social, sexual, and political conventions of the hierarchical capitalist society of Urras. His grievances are further explored with the outbreak of war in neighbouring Benbili, of which A-Io is involved with rivalling Thu. At Ieu Eun University, Shevek struggles with teaching the Urrasti students and is manipulated by the physicists there, who hope that his breakthrough on the General Temporal Theory will allow them to build a faster-than-light ship. A mysterious note asking him to join his &#x27;brothers&#x27; spooks Shevek, knowing that fellow like-minded anarchists are on Urras - in the shadows. Eventually, at a dinner party, a drunken Shevek publicly denounces his peers on A-Io, scolding them for their materialistic lives and taking their splendor for granted, before leading to a disastrous sexual encounter that further alienates Shevek from his peers. He has a sobering realisation that the theory he proposes will be capitalised by the Urrasti for potential warfare, not for the benefit of society. Shevek escapes the university, contacts an underground revolutionary group from the note he found, joining in a labor protest in Nio Esseia that is violently suppressed. He flees to the Terran embassy, where he asks them to transmit his theory to all worlds. The Terrans provide him safe passage back to Anarres.

===Onboard the &quot;Davenant&quot; (chapter 13)===
For interplanetary travel to his world, Anarres, Shevek is shown around a Hainish spaceship. Hainish culture is described. A Hainishman named Ketho, who sympathizes with Odonian thought, wants to disembark with Shevek when they land on Anarres. Not knowing if the Anarresti will welcome him back with open arms, Shevek remains content thinking about his family as the spaceship begins to land.

==Themes==

=== Symbolism ===
The ambiguity of Anarres&#x27;s economic and political situation in relation to Urras is symbolically manifested in the low wall surrounding Anarres&#x27;s single spaceport. This wall is the only place on the anarchist planet where &quot;No Trespassing!&quot; signs may be seen, and it is where the book begins and ends. The people of Anarres believe that the wall divides a free world from the corrupting influence of an oppressor&#x27;s ships. On the other hand, the wall could be a prison wall keeping the rest of the planet imprisoned and cut off. Shevek&#x27;s life attempts to answer this question.

In addition to Shevek&#x27;s journey to answer questions about his society&#x27;s true level of freedom, the meaning of his theories themselves weave their way into the plot; they not only describe abstract physical concepts, but they also reflect ups and downs of the characters&#x27; lives, and the transformation of the Anarresti society. An oft-quoted saying in the book is &quot;true journey is return.&quot; The meaning of Shevek&#x27;s theories—which deal with the nature of time and simultaneity—have been subject to interpretation. For example, there have been interpretations that the non-linear nature of the novel is a reproduction of Shevek&#x27;s theory.

=== Anarchism and capitalism ===
In her foreword to the collected Hainish novels, Le Guin notes her &quot;great, immediate affinity&quot; with anarchist thinkers Peter Kropotkin and Paul Goodman. Elsewhere, she writes that &quot;Odonism is anarchism,&quot; mentioning parallels with Emma Goldman, Taoism and Percy Bysshe Shelley. For Le Guin, anarchism&#x27;s &quot;principal target is the authoritarian State (capitalist or socialist); its principal moral-practical theme is cooperation (solidarity, mutual aid).&quot;

Both on Anarres and Urras, many conflicts occur between these anarchist principles and the constraints imposed by authority and society. On Anarres, there are no written laws. However, in practice, there are strong conventions about how most things should be done, which frustrate Shevek throughout the novel. Money is also not used, and instead the Anarresti rely on the DivLab database to match volunteer labor with work assignments. Via these conventions and institutions, &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; depicts an anarchist-syndicalist alternative to capitalism. Le Guin&#x27;s computational economy combines a central economic plan for society with democratic decision-making on a syndicalist model, bureaucratic and computational efficiency, and a negotiated tension among syndicate federalism, individual autonomy, and the danger of centralized authority.&quot;

The language spoken on Anarres also reflects anarchism. Pravic is a constructed language in the tradition of Esperanto. Pravic reflects many aspects of the philosophical foundations of utopian anarchism. For instance, the use of the possessive case is strongly discouraged, a feature that also is reflected by the novel&#x27;s title. Children are trained to speak only about matters that interest others; anything else is &quot;egoizing&quot; (pp. 28–31). There is no property ownership of any kind. Shevek&#x27;s daughter, upon meeting him for the first time, tells him, &quot;You can share the handkerchief I use&quot; rather than &quot;You may borrow my handkerchief&quot;, thus conveying the idea that the handkerchief is not owned by the girl, but is merely used by her.

=== Utopianism ===
The work is sometimes said to represent a modern revival of the utopian genre. When first published, the book included the tagline: &quot;The magnificent epic of an ambiguous utopia!&quot; which was shortened by fans to &quot;An ambiguous utopia&quot; and adopted as a subtitle in certain editions.

Le Guin brings her own innovations to the literary tradition of utopia. Many earlier utopian novels featured a visitor to utopia, as a device to teach the reader about its institutions. However &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; inverts this, by having Shevek, dissatisfied with his life in Anarres, travel to Urras. &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; also does not seek to portray Anarres as a society that is absolutely good, but only as &quot;ambiguously good&quot;.

Tom Moylan describes &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; as &quot;the best known and the most popular of the critical utopias published in the 1970s.&quot; &#x27;Critical&#x27; utopian fiction continues to embrace utopian ideals, but it is cautious of being too prescriptive, and tends to focus on &quot;the continuing presence of difference and imperfection within utopian society itself.&quot; &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; shares with many later critical utopias, including Iain M. Banks&#x27;s Culture series and Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s &quot;Trouble on Triton&quot;, a focus on utopia&#x27;s discontents, and an interest in how utopian society interacts with its neighbors.

=== Feminism ===
Some critics disagree as to whether &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; should be considered a feminist utopia or a feminist science fiction novel. According to Mary Morrison of the &quot;State University of New York at Buffalo&quot; (SUNY), the anarchist themes in this book help to promote feminist themes as well. Other critics, such as William Marcellino of SUNY and Sarah LeFanu, writer of &quot;Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction,&quot; argue that there are distinct anti-feminist undertones throughout the novel.

Morrison argues that Le Guin&#x27;s portrayed ideals of Taoism, the celebration of labor and the body, and desire for sexual freedom in an anarchist society contribute greatly to the book&#x27;s feminist message. Taoism, which rejects dualisms and divisions in favor of a Yin and Yang balance, brings attention to the balance between not only the two planets, but between the male and female inhabitants. The celebration of labor on Anarres stems from a celebration of a mother&#x27;s labor, focusing on creating life rather than on building objects. The sexual freedom on Anarres also contributes to the book&#x27;s feminist message.

On the other hand, some critics believe that Le Guin&#x27;s feminist themes are either weak or not present. Some believe that the Taoist interdependence between the genders actually weakens Le Guin&#x27;s feminist message. Marcellino believes that the anarchist themes in the novel take precedence and dwarf any feminist themes. Lefanu adds that there is a difference between the feminist messages that the book explicitly presents and the anti-feminist undertones. For example, the book says that women created the society on Anarres. However, female characters seem secondary to the male protagonist, who seems to be a traditional male hero; Lefanu asserts that this subversion weakens any feminist message that Le Guin was trying to convey.

=== Prison abolition ===

Odo, the founder of Anarresti society, wrote her most influential works during a nine-year imprisonment. Anarres itself has no prisons. Its post-carceral nature becomes apparent in chapter two, when a group of Annaresti schoolchildren learn about prisons in their history lesson. The teacher describes prisons &quot;with the reluctance of a decent adult forced to explain an obscenity to children. Yes, he said, a prison was a place where a State put people
who disobeyed its Laws.&quot; Fascinated by this &quot;perversity&quot;, the schoolchildren construct their own prison and detain one of their own inside. They are ultimately horrified by the experience.

Figurative imprisonment is an important theme in the novel too. In both the Urrasti and Anarresti parts of the novel, &quot;time after time the question of who is being locked out or in, which side of the wall one is on, is the focus of the narrative.&quot; Mark Tunik emphasises that &quot;the wall&quot; is the dominant metaphor for social constraints in &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;. While on Urras, Shevek hits &quot;the wall of charm, courtesy, indifference.&quot; He later notes that he let a &quot;wall be built around him&quot; that kept him from seeing the poor people on Urras. He had been co-opted, with walls of smiles of the rich, and he didn&#x27;t know how to break them down. Shevek at one point speculates that the people on Urras are not truly free, precisely because they have so many walls built between people and are so possessive. He says, &quot;You are all in jail. Each alone, solitary, with a heap of what he owns. You live in prison, die in prison. It is all I can see in your eyes – the wall, the wall!&quot; &#x27;

It is not just the state of mind of those inside the prisons that concerns Shevek, he also notes the effect on those outside the walls. Steve Grossi says, &quot;by building a physical wall to keep the bad in, we construct a mental wall keeping ourselves, our thoughts, and our empathy out, to the collective detriment of all.&quot; Shevek himself later says, &quot;those who build walls are their own prisoners.&quot;

== Publication ==

In Le Guin&#x27;s book-writing process, the story always came to her through a character rather than an event, idea, plot, or society. The story behind &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; first occurred to Le Guin through a vision, revealed as if seen from a distance, first as a male physicist, his thin face, clear eyes, large ears, possibly recalling a memory of Robert Oppenheimer, and a vivid personality. She attempted to capture the character in a short story in what she recalled as one of her worst in 30 years of writing, in which the physicist escapes a gulag planet for a nearby wealthy sister planet, where he has a love affair but likes the planet even less, and so nobly returns to the gulag. She proceeded to rewrite the story, beginning with his name and origin—Shevek, from Utopia—which she considered reasonable based on his intelligence and disarming naivety. Knowing only bits of Thomas More (&quot;Utopia&quot;), William Morris (&quot;News from Nowhere&quot;), William Henry Hudson (&quot;A Crystal Age&quot;), and H. G. Wells (&quot;A Modern Utopia&quot;), Le Guin&#x27;s reading of modern libertarian socialists rounded Shevek&#x27;s prison planet into a place where she saw he would want to return: Marx and Engels, William Godwin, Emma Goldman, Paul Goodman and, foremost, Peter Kropotkin and Mary Shelley.

Le Guin wrote &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; in 1973 for publication in May or June 1974.

==Critical reception==
The novel received generally positive reviews. On the positive side, Baird Searles characterized the novel as an &quot;extraordinary work&quot;, saying Le Guin had &quot;created a working society in exquisite detail&quot; and &quot;a fully realized hypothetical culture [as well as] living breathing characters who are inevitable products of that culture&quot;. Gerald Jonas, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that &quot;Le Guin&#x27;s book, written in her solid, no-nonsense prose, is so persuasive that it ought to put a stop to the writing of prescriptive Utopias for at least 10 years&quot;. Theodore Sturgeon praised &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; as &quot;a beautifully written, beautifully composed book&quot;, saying &quot;it performs one of [science fiction&#x27;s] prime functions, which is to create another kind of social system to see how it would work. Or if it would work.&quot;

Lester del Rey, however, gave the novel a mixed review, citing the quality of Le Guin&#x27;s writing but claiming that the ending &quot;slips badly&quot;, a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; that &quot;destroy[s] much of the strength of the novel&quot;.

==Awards==

==Adaptations==
In 1987, the CBC Radio anthology program &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; adapted &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; into a series of six 30 minute episodes.

On October 5, 2021, it was announced that 1212 Entertainment and Anonymous Content would adapt the novel into a limited series.

<text>The Hainish Cycle consists of a number of science fiction novels and stories by Ursula K. Le Guin. It is set in a future history in which civilizations of human beings on planets orbiting a number of nearby stars, including (&quot;Earth&quot;), are contacting each other for the first time and establishing diplomatic relations, and setting up a confederacy under the guidance of the oldest of the human worlds, peaceful Hain. In this history, human beings did not evolve on Earth but were the result of interstellar colonies planted by Hain long ago, which was followed by a long period when interstellar travel ceased. Some of the races have new genetic traits, a result of ancient Hainish experiments in genetic engineering, including people who can dream while awake, and a world of hermaphroditic people who only come into active sexuality once a month, not knowing which sex will manifest in them. In keeping with Le Guin&#x27;s style, she uses varied social and environmental settings to explore the anthropological and sociological outcomes of human evolution in those diverse environments.

The Hainish novels &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; (1974) have won literary awards, as have the novella &quot;The Word for World Is Forest&quot; (1972) and the short stories &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Matter of Seggri&quot; (1994).

Le Guin herself often discounted the characterization of a &quot;Hainish Cycle&quot;, writing on her website that &quot;The thing is, they aren&#x27;t a cycle or a saga. They do not form a coherent history. There are some clear connections among them, yes, but also some extremely murky ones.&quot;

==Story chronology==

In the first three novels—&quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; (1966), &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; (1966), and &quot;City of Illusions&quot; (1967)—there is a League of All Worlds; by &quot;City of Illusions&quot;, the League seems to have been conquered or fragmented by an alien race, the Shing, from beyond the League. In the fourth, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; (1969), it seems that the planets of the former League have reunited as the &quot;Ekumen&quot;, which was founded by the Hainish people. The fifth, &quot;The Word for World Is Forest&quot; (1972), part of the anthology &quot;Again, Dangerous Visions&quot; (and only published as a separate book in 1976) is set before any of the first four books, and in it the League of All Worlds and the &quot;ansible&quot; are new, and the term &quot;Ekumen&quot; is not used. The sixth, &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; (1974), is the earliest Hainish novel, chronologically; in it, the Cetians have been visited by people from other planets, including Terra (Earth) and Hain, and while the various planets are separate, there is some talk of a union (and the ansible concept is known, but none yet exist). The seventh and final novel, &quot;The Telling&quot; (2000), and the later short stories only speak of the Ekumen—which now includes the Gethenians, who were the subject of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;—and not of the League.

===LeGuin&#x27;s reading guidance===
Le Guin offers the following thoughts on the order in which readers should approach the series:

==Universe of the stories==

===Backstory===
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the people of Hain colonized a large number of worlds, including Earth, known as Terra. Most of these were similar enough that humans from one world can pass as natives of another, but on some the old Hainish &#x27;colonisers&#x27; used genetic engineering. At least one of the various species of &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; are the product of genetic engineering, as are the &quot;hilfs&quot; (&quot;highly intelligent life forms&quot;) of Planet S(whose story has not been told), and probably the androgynous humans of Gethen in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. The Ekumen do not know whether the colonisers sought to adapt humans to varied worlds, were conducting various experiments, or had other reasons.

Hainish civilization subsequently collapsed, and the colony planets (including Earth) forgot that other human worlds existed. The Ekumen stories tell of the efforts to re-establish a civilization on a galactic scale through NAFAL (Nearly As Fast As Light) interstellar travel taking years to travel between stars (although only weeks or months from the viewpoint of the traveler because of time dilation), and through instantaneous interstellar communication using the ansible.

This seems to have happened in two phases: First, the League of All Worlds was formed, as an alliance of planets, mostly descended from colonization efforts from the planet Hain, uniting the &quot;nine known worlds&quot; — presumably along with new colonies. By the time of &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; it has grown but is also under threat from a distant enemy. In &quot;City of Illusions&quot; it is recalled as having been a league of some 80 worlds at the time it was destroyed by aliens called the Shing, who are uniquely able to lie in mindspeech. After the apparent overthrow of the Shing by the descendants of marooned Terrans and the inhabitants of Alterra / Werel who have succeeded in interbreeding (as related in &quot;Planet of Exile&quot;) and are capable of detecting Shing lies, the alliance is eventually reconstructed.

A second phase begins with &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. The 80 plus planets seem to have reunited as the &quot;Ekumen&quot; – a name derived from the Greek &quot;oikoumene&quot;, meaning &quot;the inhabited world&quot;, although characters occasionally refer to it as &quot;the Household&quot;, which is in turn a reference to the Greek &quot;oikos&quot;, a word which developed from the same root as &quot;oikoumene&quot;. Unexplained references are made by the protagonist from Terra in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; to a long-past &quot;Age of the Enemy&quot;, which presumably refers to the time that the Shing controlled Terra, portrayed in &quot;City of Illusions&quot;.

===Planets===

The Ekumen (or the League of All Worlds, though that is also believed to be the previous planetary coalition, before some sort of galactic crisis) contains a very large number of planets and is continually exploring new ones. Genly Ai in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; explains that there are 83 planets in the Ekumen, with Gethen a candidate for becoming the 84th. The process of reaching out to potential civilizations is a tedious and sometimes dangerous one.

===Technology===
Societies tend to use sophisticated but unobtrusive technologies. Most notable is the ansible, an instant-communication device that keeps worlds in touch with each other.

Physical communication is by NAFAL (Nearly As Fast As Light) ships. The physics is never explained; the ship vanishes from where it was and reappears somewhere else many years later. The trip takes slightly longer than it would to cross the same distance at the speed of light, but ship-time is just a few hours for those on board. It cannot be used for trips within a solar system. Trips can begin or end close to a planet, but if used without a &quot;retemporalizer&quot;, there are drastic physical effects at the end of long trips, at least according to the Shing, whose information may be suspect. It is also lethal if the traveler is pregnant.

&quot;City of Illusions&quot; mentions automatic death-machines that work on the same principle as the ansible and can strike instantly at distant worlds. Such a device is clearly used in the events of &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot;. The weapons are not mentioned again in later books.

Churten theory, as developed by the physicists of Anarres, should allow people to go instantly from solar system to solar system. It is a development of the work of Shevek, whose tale is told in &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;. Shevek&#x27;s work made the ansible possible—it is mentioned in his tale that engineers decided they could build it once the correct theory was found. Churten theory offers a way to move people and spacecraft instantaneously, but there are side effects. These are described in three short stories, &quot;The Shobies&#x27; Story,&quot; &quot;Dancing to Ganam&quot;, and &quot;Another Story, or, A Fisherman of the Inland Sea,&quot; all collected in &quot;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot; (1994).

The ansible has been adopted by other science fiction and fantasy authors, such as Orson Scott Card, Elizabeth Moon, and Vernor Vinge.

===Post-technological worlds===
The ideas of post-technological societies and social and ecological collapse are in several of the stories. These are portrayed as the end result of the wrong kind of civilizations, i.e., competitive, capitalist, patriarchal, &quot;dynamic, aggressive, ecology-breaking cultures,&quot; while successful societies are close to the land, peaceful, non-authoritarian, non-competitive, static, communitarian, with the holistic outlook of Eastern religions. The Earth, called &quot;Terra&quot; in the Cycle, is mentioned as one of the failed civilizations.
*In &quot;City of Illusions&quot;, Earth has suffered some sort of collapse in a distant future, losing contact with the stars.
*In &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, the ecological disaster of Earth is described; it has become &quot;a planet spoiled by the human species&quot; through wars and runaway industrial development. Pollution has turned it into a desert and ruined the carrying capacity of the land. The population has fallen from nine billion to half a billion, who only survive by rationing, labor conscription, euthanasia, forced birth control, and the charity of the Hainish. 
*In &quot;Another Story&quot; in &quot;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot;, it is mentioned that Earth still suffers badly from pollution.
*Eleven-Soro had a high level of technology and then a massive crash, as is told in the short story &quot;Solitude&quot; in &quot;The Birthday of the World&quot;.
*Hain itself has gone back to a simpler life, with high technology used only where it can be justified, as is told in the first part of &quot;A Man of the People&quot; in &quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness.&quot; This also seems to apply to the planet Ve.
*Orint and Kheakh are mentioned in passing as worlds that have totally destroyed themselves.
*In &quot;The Left Hand Of Darkness&quot;, the planet Gde is described as extremely hot rock and desert, the result of a technological society that &quot;wrecked its ecological balance&quot; some millennia previous, and &quot;burned up its forests for kindling.&quot;

===Biology===
Most of the people in the tales have a common descent from the planet Hain, whose people settled many worlds. Some of them are genetically similar enough to produce children together. The unusual hairiness of the Cetians is mentioned in &quot;The Word for World Is Forest&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;. &quot;The Telling&quot; includes the detail that the people of Chiffewar are all bald.

There are some cases of ancient biological manipulation:
*Unique among known humans, the Hainish have complete voluntary control of their fertility. In order for a Hainish man and woman to reproduce, they must both consciously choose to produce viable genetic material, which they learn to do in adolescence. The required genetic changes to the Hainish population were made in the far distant past, and apparently took many generations to accomplish.
*&quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; mentions that the hilfs of S must have been produced by human genetic manipulation by the ancient Hainish people, along with the Gethenians and the degenerate winged hominoids of Rokanan. We hear no more about the hilfs of S, unless these are the same as the small furry natives of Athshe, who are also of Hainish descent.
*The ambisexual humans of Gethen may have been produced as an adaptation to a harsh climate, or an experiment to see how people would live without gender. Both ideas are mentioned and nothing is definitely settled.
*The degenerate winged hominoids are seen in Rocannon&#x27;s World. They live in cities that require much higher technology to build than the rest of the races on Rokanan, but live in bat-like societies, hunting for humans and animals on which their larvae feed by sucking their blood.
*&quot;The Matter of Seggri&quot; tells us that the extreme gender imbalance of the people of Seggri may be another case of genetic manipulation.
* Alterrans have distinctive cat-like eyes. While normally unable to breed with Earth-humans, the latter become sufficiently genetically similar within a few centuries on their planet due to unspecified natural factors. This almost drives the Earth-descended colony to extinction due to the genetic differences between mothers and fetuses causing miscarriages. The Alterrans may be another case of genetic manipulation, or a similar natural adaptation themselves.
* The Shing of &quot;City of Illusions&quot; are not of Hainish origin and cannot interbreed with Earth-humans. They dismiss the report about the human adaptation on Alterra as impossible.

<text>The University of Tulsa (TU) is a private research university in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It has a historic affiliation with the Presbyterian Church, although it is now nondenominational, and the campus architectural style is predominantly Collegiate Gothic. The school traces its origin to the Presbyterian School for Indian Girls, which was established in 1882 in Muskogee, Oklahoma, then a town in Indian Territory, and which evolved into an institution of higher education named Henry Kendall College by 1894. The college moved to Tulsa, another town in the Creek Nation in 1904, before the state of Oklahoma was created. In 1920, Kendall College was renamed the University of Tulsa.

The University of Tulsa is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It manages the Gilcrease Museum, which includes one of the largest collections of American Western art and indigenous American artifacts in the world. TU also hosts the &quot;Tulsa Studies in Women&#x27;s Literature&quot;, founded by former TU professor and noted feminist critic Germaine Greer (now at the University of Cambridge).

TU&#x27;s athletic teams are collectively known as the Tulsa Golden Hurricane and compete in Division I of the NCAA as members of the American Athletic Conference (The American). The University of Tulsa is designated as a National Security Agency Center of Academic Excellence in both Information Assurance and Cyber Defense. The McDougall School of Petroleum Engineering is ranked 6th among petroleum engineering graduate schools and 10th among undergraduate PE schools by U.S. News &amp; World report.

==History==
===Frontier Origins===
The Presbyterian School for Indian Girls (also known as &quot;Minerva Home&quot;) was founded in Muskogee, Indian Territory, in 1882 to offer a primary education to young women of the Creek Nation.

In 1894, the young school expanded to become Henry Kendall College, named in honor of Reverend Henry Kendall, secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions. The first president was William A. Caldwell, who served a brief two-year term, which ended in 1896.

Caldwell was succeeded by William Robert King, a Presbyterian minister and co-founder of the college, who had come to Oklahoma from Tennessee, by way of the Union Theological Seminary in New York City (affiliated with Columbia University). Kendall College, while still in Muskogee, granted the first post-secondary degree in Oklahoma in June 1898. Under King, the college was moved from its original location in downtown Muskogee to a larger campus on lands donated by Creek Nation Chief Pleasant Porter.

Kendall College students, faculty and administrators were instrumental in efforts to get the State of Sequoyah recognized; they wrote most of the proposed constitution and designed the seal among other things.

The opening of the new campus coincided with the start of the tenure of the third president, A. Grant Evans. Over the next 10 years, Evans oversaw the struggling school&#x27;s growth. In most years, class sizes remained small and although the academy, the attached elementary, middle, and high school was more successful; by the end of the 1906–07 year Kendall College had had only 27 collegiate graduates. At the request of the administration, the Synod of Indian Territory assumed control as trustees and began to look at alternatives for the future of the school. When the administration was approached by the comparatively smaller town of Tulsa and offered a chance to move, the decision was made to relocate.

===Relocation to Tulsa===
The Tulsa Commercial Club (a forerunner of the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce) decided to bid for the college. Club members who packaged a bid in 1907 to move the college to Tulsa included: B. Betters, H. O. McClure, L. N. Butts, W. L. North, James H. Hall (&quot;sic&quot;), Grant C. Stebbins, Rev. Charles W. Kerr, C. H. Nicholson. The offer included $100,000, 20 acres of real estate, and a guarantee for utilities and street car service.

The college opened to 35 students in September 1907, two months before Oklahoma became a state. These first students attended classes at the First Presbyterian Church until permanent buildings could be erected on the new campus. This became the start of higher education in Tulsa. Kendall Hall, the first building of the new school, was completed in 1908 and was quickly followed by two other buildings. All three buildings have since been demolished, with Kendall the last to be razed in 1972. The bell that once hung in the Kendall Building tower was saved and displayed in Bayless Plaza.

The Kendall College presidents during 1907–1919 were Arthur Grant Evans, Levi Harrison Beeler, Seth Reed Gordon, Frederick William Hawley, Ralph J. Lamb, Charles Evans, James G. McMurtry and Arthur L. Odell.

In 1918, the Methodist Church proposed building a college in Tulsa, using money donated by a Tulsa oilman Robert M. McFarlin. The proposed college was to be named McFarlin College. However, it was soon apparent that Tulsa could not yet support two competing schools. In 1920, Henry Kendall College merged with the proposed McFarlin College to become the University of Tulsa. The McFarlin Library of TU was named for the principal donor of the proposed college. The name of Henry Kendall has lived on to the present as the Kendall College of Arts and Sciences.

===20th century===
The University of Tulsa opened its School of Petroleum Engineering in 1928.

The Great Depression hit the university hard. By 1935, the school was about to close because of its poor financial condition. It had a debt of $250,000, enrollment had fallen to 300 students (including many who could not pay their tuition), the faculty was poorly paid and morale was low. It was then that the oil tycoon and TU-patron Waite Phillips offered the school presidency to Clarence Isaiah (&quot;Cy&quot;) Pontius, a former investment banker. His primary focus would be to rescue the school&#x27;s finances. A dean&#x27;s council would take charge of academic issues.

However, Pontius&#x27; accomplishments went beyond raising money. During his tenure, the following events occurred:
*In 1935, the university opened the College of Business Administration, which it renamed the Collins College of Business in 2008.
*The Tulsa Law School, located in downtown Tulsa, became part of the university in 1943.
*In 1948, oil magnate William G. Skelly donated funds to found the university radio station, KWGS (named for his initials), now known as Public Radio Tulsa.
After William G. Skelly died, his widow donated the Skelly Mansion, at the corner of 21st Street and Madison Avenue, to the University of Tulsa. The school sold the mansion and its furnishings to private owners in 1959. On July 5, 2012, the university announced that it would repurchase the house as a residence for its president. TU sold the property in 2021.

In 1958, Ben Graf Henneke, a scholar of theater and communications, became the first alumnus to hold the presidency of the University of Tulsa. During his tenure, the university established new doctoral programs, increased the proportion of faculty with doctorates, started new publications including &quot;Petroleum Abstracts&quot; and the &quot;James Joyce Quarterly&quot;, developed a North Campus center for petroleum engineering research, and expanded many main campus facilities. He was succeeded by Eugene L. Swearingen, a Stanford University-trained economist and Oklahoma native who served on the National Finance Committee for the Jimmy Carter Presidential Campaign. Swearingen increased TU&#x27;s endowment and expanded the footprint of its campus.

===21st century===
In 2004, anthropologist Steadman Upham joined the University of Tulsa as president, having served in faculty and leadership positions at the University of Oregon and Arizona State University. Within five years of his arrival, TU saw 13 major construction projects and renovations on campus, ranging from the construction of the Roxana Rozsa and Robert Eugene Lorton Performance Center to the overhaul of Keplinger Hall, and plans for seven more major projects finalized (despite the nationwide recession).

The university also launched the Oxley College of Health Sciences, in downtown Tulsa, named in recognition of a major gift from Tulsa&#x27;s Oxley Foundation. In 2023, the unit was renamed the Oxley College of Health &amp; Natural Sciences. The university also partnered with the George Kaiser Family Foundation to temporarily house The Bob Dylan Archive at TU in 2016. Under Upham&#x27;s leadership, the University of Tulsa assumed management of the famous Gilcrease Museum in northwest Tulsa.

In 2016, President Upham retired and was succeeded by Gerard Clancy, who previously served as a psychiatry professor and held leadership positions at the University of Iowa and the University of Oklahoma. About two and a half years into his presidency, in the spring of 2019, President Clancy and Provost Janet K. Levit announced a restructuring of academic programs at the university that would eliminate several academic programs. The plan was met with resistance from some faculty who believed it was formulated without adequate input from faculty. Although faculty members voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in the president and provost in November, the university&#x27;s board of trustees publicly affirmed their support of the plan.

In January 2020, President Clancy informed the board that he needed to cut back on his activities because of unspecified medical issues. The board named Provost Levit as interim president of the school, effective in January 2020.

Former Congressman Brad R. Carson became president of the University of Tulsa on July 1, 2021.

==Academics==
The University of Tulsa offers liberal arts, music, film, and professional programs, including engineering, English, computer science, natural sciences, social sciences, health sciences, business, law, and other disciplines.

The university has an undergraduate research program, evidenced by 45 students receiving Goldwater Scholarships since 1995. The Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge (TURC) allows undergraduates to conduct advanced research with the guidance of top TU professors.

===Rankings===


&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2025 edition of &quot;Best Colleges&quot; ranked the University of Tulsa tied for 179th among &quot;national universities&quot; and tied at 90th for &quot;Best Value&quot;.

===Scholarship and fellowship recipients===
TU students have won 67 Goldwater Scholarships, 5 Marshall Scholarships, 3 Rhodes Scholarships (9 Rhodes finalists), 28 Fulbright Scholarships, and numerous Department of Defense, National Science Foundation, and Morris K. Udall Fellowships.

==Campus==
The campus of the University of Tulsa centers on a wide, grassy, quad-like space known as Dietler Commons, formerly called &quot;The U.&quot; The predominant architectural style is English Gothic. Most of the buildings are constructed from tan and rose-colored Crab Orchard sandstone from Tennessee interspersed with stone quarried in Arkansas. Other materials include Bedford limestone from Indiana and slate quarried in Vermont. The university&#x27;s campus borders Tulsa&#x27;s Kendall Whittier neighborhood and is not far from Tulsa&#x27;s downtown and midtown neighborhoods. The campus, in particular its football venue Skelly Field, is located on the historic U.S. Route 66, America&#x27;s &quot;Mother Road&quot; stretching from Chicago to Los Angeles.

===Skelly Field at H. A. Chapman Stadium===

Tulsa Golden Hurricane football has played home games at Skelly Field at H. A. Chapman Stadium since 1930.

===Museums and libraries===

McFarlin Library: Resources and Notable Collections

The library&#x27;s Department of Special Collections and University Archives houses over 12 million archival items and has over 1,000 collections on a wide-ranging array of topics including 20th-century British, Irish, and American literature, which includes the world&#x27;s second-largest collection of materials by James Joyce. It also houses the papers of Nobel Prize winners V.S. Naipaul and Doris Lessing, as well as novelists and poets Jean Rhys, Eliot Bliss, David Plante, Anna Kavan, and Stevie Smith, just to name a few. In addition to these famous novelists, McFarlin Library houses the papers of Congresswoman Alice Mary Robertson, literary critic Richard Ellmann, comic book innovator E. Nelson Bridwell, Cherokee Principal Chief J.B. Milam, and writer/sexologist Edward Charles, among others. The Department of Special Collections also contains a vast collection of books on Native American history.

===Partnership with Gilcrease Museum===
In July 2008, the University of Tulsa took over management of Gilcrease Museum in a public-private partnership with the City of Tulsa. The museum has one of the largest collections of American Western art in the world (including famous works by Frederic Remington, Thomas Moran, and others) and houses growing collections of artifacts from Central and South America. The museum sits on in northwest Tulsa.

===The Bob Dylan Archive===
The Bob Dylan Archive is a collection of documents and objects relating to iconic American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan (whose mentor was Oklahoman Woody Guthrie). It was announced on March 2, 2016, that the archive had been acquired by the George Kaiser Family Foundation (GKFF) and the University of Tulsa. The university has since relinquished ownership to GKFF.

==Student body and student life==

Students at the University of Tulsa represent 47 states and over 79 foreign countries, of which 58% are Oklahoma residents. Among the most common countries of origin for TU international students are China, Iran, Azerbaijan, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom.

The University of Tulsa is home to more than 150 student organizations, registered with and partially funded by the Student Government Association.

===Diversity and campus life===
Several groups exist to support diversity on the University of Tulsa campus. There are at least 25 campus organizations existing to support and sustain a diverse campus community. In addition, TU hosts the Chevron Multicultural Resource Center, funded by a gift from the energy company, which hosts events and programming to promote diversity on campus.

Although TU has historic ties to the Presbyterian Church, the university has long embraced religious diversity. In 2002, TU was home to the first mosque built on an American university campus. TU also hosts a chapter of Hillel International, an organization to support Jewish life on campus. The university also hosts several organizations reflecting different streams of Christian spiritual practice, including Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox.

===2015 student speech controversy===
In February 2015, after the University of Tulsa suspended a student under its zero-tolerance policy for harassment for threatening and defamatory Facebook postings by his fiancée against multiple faculty members and a female student, administrators attempted to discourage the campus newspaper from publishing information the university deemed &quot;confidential&quot;. The controversy was picked up by two websites that claimed the administration used &quot;threats&quot; and &quot;intimidation&quot; to &quot;cover up&quot; their handling of the disciplinary issue. In January 2016, the former student filed a lawsuit against the university, claiming his dismissal was unfair and was a breach of the institution&#x27;s commitment to due process. The incident earned the university a spot on the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) 2016 &quot;10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech&quot;. By 2023, however, the University of Tulsa had received a &quot;green light&quot; rating from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression in recognition of the university&#x27;s commitment to free speech.

==Athletics==

Tulsa&#x27;s sports teams participate in NCAA Division I as a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American); its football team is part of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Tulsa has the smallest undergraduate enrollment of any FBS school. TU has had a rivalry with the slightly larger Rice University and a football rivalry with the substantially larger University of Houston. It also has two current rivalries with D-I schools that do not sponsor football—an in-conference rivalry with Wichita State University, especially in men&#x27;s basketball, and a crosstown rivalry, most prominently in basketball, with Summit League member Oral Roberts University.

The university&#x27;s nickname is the Golden Hurricane (it was originally the Golden Tornadoes). The Sound of the Golden Hurricane marching band plays at all home football and basketball games as well as traveling to championships in support of the Golden Hurricane. Tulsa has won six national championships (three NCAA): four in women&#x27;s golf and two in men&#x27;s basketball. The University of Tulsa currently fields a varsity team in seven men&#x27;s sports and ten women&#x27;s sports.

==Symbols==
The school&#x27;s colors are old gold (PMS 7502), royal blue (PMS 661C), and crimson (PMS 186).

The university&#x27;s original motto was, in full: &quot;Faith, Wisdom, Service: For Christ, For State.&quot;

==Publications==
The &quot;University of Tulsa Collegian&quot; is the long-standing independent and student-run newspaper on campus.

The following scholarly journals are published by the university:
* &quot;Nimrod International Journal of Prose and Poetry&quot;
* &quot;James Joyce Quarterly&quot;
* &quot;Tulsa Studies in Women&#x27;s Literature&quot;
* &quot;Energy Law Journal&quot;
* &quot;Tulsa Law Review&quot;

In 2003 Tulsa joined the efforts of Brown University on the Modernist Journals Project, an online archive of early 20th-century periodicals. Tulsa has contributed various modernist texts from McFarlin Library&#x27;s Special Collections to the project&#x27;s website.

Sean Latham, then-editor of the &quot;James Joyce Quarterly&quot;, brought the 2003 North American James Joyce Conference to the University of Tulsa.

<text>The Libertarian Party (LP) is a libertarian political party in the United States that promotes civil liberties, non-interventionism, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, and limiting the size and scope of government. The world&#x27;s first explicitly libertarian party, it was conceived in August 1971 at meetings in the home of David F. Nolan in Westminster, Colorado, and was officially formed on December 11, 1971, in Colorado Springs. The organizers of the party drew inspiration from the works and ideas of the prominent Austrian school economist Murray Rothbard. The founding of the party was prompted in part due to concerns about the Nixon administration&#x27;s wage and price controls, the Vietnam War, conscription, and the introduction of fiat money.

The party generally supports a classical liberal platform, much different from the Democratic Party&#x27;s modern liberalism and progressivism and the Republican Party&#x27;s conservatism and right-wing populism. Gary Johnson, the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016, claims that the Libertarian Party is more socially liberal than Democrats, and more fiscally conservative than Republicans. Its fiscal policy positions include lowering taxes and abolishing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), decreasing the national debt, allowing people to opt out of Social Security, and eliminating the welfare state, in part by utilizing private charities. Its social policy positions include ending the prohibition of illegal drugs, advocating criminal justice reform, supporting same-sex marriage, ending capital punishment, and supporting the right to keep and bear arms.

 it is the third-largest political party in the United States by voter registration. In the 2020 election, the Libertarians gained a state legislative seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives, the first such win for the party since 2000. The first and only Libertarian in the United States Congress was Justin Amash, who joined the Libertarian Party in 2020 and left the U.S. House of Representatives in 2021 after choosing not to seek re-election.

In 2022, the Mises Caucus (LPMC) became the dominant faction on the Libertarian National Committee, leading to internal conflicts and significant policy changes, such as regarding immigration and abortion. Some classical liberalism-minded dissidents split from the Libertarian party to form the Association of Liberty State Parties.

== History ==

The first Libertarian National Convention was held in June 1972. In 1978, Dick Randolph of Alaska became the first elected Libertarian state legislator. Following the 1980 federal elections, the Libertarian Party assumed the title of being the third-largest party for the first time after the American Independent Party and the Conservative Party of New York (the other largest minor parties at the time) continued to decline. In 1994, over 40 Libertarians were elected or appointed which was a record for the party at that time. 1995 saw a soaring membership and voter registration for the party. In 1996, the Libertarian Party became the first third party to earn ballot status in all 50 states two presidential elections in a row. By the end of 2009, 146 Libertarians were holding elected offices.

Tonie Nathan, running as the Libertarian Party&#x27;s vice presidential candidate in the 1972 presidential election with John Hospers as the presidential candidate, was the first female candidate in the United States to receive an electoral vote.

The 2012 election Libertarian Party presidential candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson and his running mate, former judge Jim Gray, received the highest number of votes—more than 1.2 million—of any Libertarian presidential candidate at the time. He was renominated for president in 2016, this time choosing former Massachusetts Governor William Weld as his running mate. Johnson/Weld shattered the Libertarian record for a presidential ticket, earning over 4.4 million votes. Both Johnson and Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein received significantly more news coverage in 2016 than third-party candidates usually get, with polls showing both candidates potentially increasing their support over the last election, especially among younger voters.

The Libertarian Party has had significant electoral success in the context of state legislatures and other local offices. Libertarians won four elections to the Alaska House of Representatives between 1978 and 1984 and another four to the New Hampshire General Court in 1992. Neil Randall, a Libertarian, won the election to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1998 running on both the Libertarian and Republican lines. In 2000, Steve Vaillancourt won election to the New Hampshire General Court running on the Libertarian ballot line. Rhode Island State Representative Daniel P. Gordon was expelled from the Republicans and joined the Libertarian Party in 2011. In July 2016 and June 2017, the Libertarians tied their 1992 peak of four legislators when four state legislators from four different states left the Republican Party to join the Libertarian Party: Nevada Assemblyman John Moore in January, Nebraska Senator Laura Ebke (although the Nebraska Legislature is officially non-partisan) and New Hampshire Representative Max Abramson in May and Utah Senator Mark B. Madsen in July. In the 2016 election cycle, Madsen and Abramson did not run for re-election to their respective offices while Moore lost his race after the Libertarian Party officially censured him over his support of taxpayer stadium funding. Ebke was not up for re-election in 2016. New Hampshire Representative Caleb Q. Dyer changed party affiliation to the Libertarian Party from the Republican Party in February 2017. New Hampshire Representative Joseph Stallcop changed party affiliation to the Libertarian Party from the Democratic Party in May 2017. New Hampshire State Legislator Brandon Phinney joined with the Libertarian Party from the Republican Party in June 2017, the third to do so in 2017 and matching their 1992 and 2016 peaks of sitting Libertarian state legislators.

In January 2018, sitting New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands Aubrey Dunn Jr. changed party affiliation from Republican to the Libertarian Party, becoming the first Libertarian statewide officeholder in history.

In April 2020, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan became the first Libertarian member of Congress after leaving the Republican Party and spending time as an independent. In June 2020, Amash, with Ayanna Pressley of the Democratic Party, introduced the Ending Qualified Immunity Act in response to the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The bill was the first to gain support of members from the Democratic, Republican and Libertarian parties in the history of the United States Congress.

===Dallas Accord===
The Dallas Accord is an implicit agreement that was made at the 1974 Libertarian National Convention as a compromise between the party&#x27;s larger minarchist and smaller anarcho-capitalist factions by adopting a platform that explicitly did not say whether it was desirable for the state to exist.

The purpose of this agreement was to make the Libertarian Party a &quot;big tent&quot; that would welcome more ideologically diverse groups of people interested in reducing the size and scope of government. Consequently, the 1974 platform included a &quot;Statement of Principles&quot; which focused on statements arguing for getting government out of various activities, and used phrases such as &quot;where governments exist they must not violate the rights of any individual.&quot; The previous version of the Statement of Principles adopted at the party&#x27;s first convention in 1972, in contrast, affirmatively endorsed the minarchist perspective with statements such as &quot;Since government has only one legitimate function, the protection of individual rights...&quot; It was agreed that the topic of anarchism would not even be on the table for discussion until a limited government was achieved.

During the 2006 Libertarian National Convention, delegates deleted a large portion of the very detailed platform. The phrase &quot;Government exists to protect the rights of every individual including life, liberty and property&quot; was added. This development was described as the &quot;Portland Massacre&quot; by its opponents. Some took this as meaning the Dallas Accord was dead.

Whether the Dallas Accord remains in effect, and if so whether it should, or what limits it places on the party&#x27;s public statements or candidates, all remain disputed within the party.

===Mises takeover===
At the 2022 Libertarian National Convention, members of the Mises Caucus, a paleolibertarian group affiliated with the beliefs of Ron Paul successfully staged a takeover of the Party, with over two-thirds of delegates becoming members of the Caucus, shifting the party in a right-ward direction. The caucus successfully swept leadership positions, including electing Angela McArdle as chairwomen and Joshua Smith as vice-chairman. The 2022 convention had an unusually high number of delegates, with the last recorded number for an off-election year convention in 2006 being just 300 delegates. The 2022 convention by contrast saw over 1,000 delegates. After the takeover, non-Mises affiliated members walked out, criticizing the group for lacking in libertarian orthodoxy, as well as condemning several racist statements that members of the Caucus had made in the past. More ardent members of the party started to splinter, with Pennsylvania, that state with the most elected Libertarian officeholders, seeing a hardliner Mises-affiliated member, Rob Cowburn being named chairman, resulting in dissidents splitting to form the Keystone Party of Pennsylvania.

After the Mises-dominated Party adopted a so called &quot;national divorce&quot; as part of the party&#x27;s official core platform, many of the state-level affiliated parties began to disassociate from the national Party or dissolve themselves altogether. The New Mexico state party also argued that according to LP bylaws, there can never be more than two executive positions overturned in a single convention, making the Mises sweep illegal. The Mises-dominated Party quickly changed the bylaws after their sweep to amend this. After Mises-affiliated libertarians in Virginia reformed their branch of the party, seeking backing from the national party, the dissidents then formed a splinter group, the Virginia Classical Liberal Party. Additionally, the Libertarian Association of Massachusetts disaffiliated, however Mises hardliners formed the Libertarian Party of Massachusetts, which the national party recognized as the official branch party in the state. The Mises Caucus also blocked the disaffiliation of the New Hampshire party.

The Association of Liberty State Parties was officially formed on December 3, 2022 as a national party committee between the Massachusetts and New Mexico parties, and the Virginian splinters. The party&#x27;s first goal was to organize a national convention for the nomination of candidates for President and Vice President of the United States, and to expand into more states.

During the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the party leadership grew closer to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, with Trump addressing the Libertarian Party convention and party chair Angela McArdle expressing support for a Trump victory in the election.

== Name and symbols ==
In 1972, &quot;Libertarian Party&quot; was chosen as the party&#x27;s name, selected over &quot;New Liberty Party&quot;. The first official slogan of the Libertarian Party was &quot;There ain&#x27;t no such thing as a free lunch&quot; (abbreviated &quot;TANSTAAFL&quot;), a phrase popularized by Robert A. Heinlein in his 1966 novel &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, sometimes dubbed &quot;a manifesto for a libertarian revolution&quot;. The slogan of the party has since become &quot;The Party of Principle&quot;.

Also in 1972, the &quot;Libersign&quot;—an arrow angling upward through the abbreviation &quot;TANSTAAFL&quot;—was adopted as a party symbol. By the end of the decade, this was replaced with the Lady Liberty until 2015, with the adoption of the &quot;Torch Eagle&quot; logo.

In the 1990s, several state Libertarian parties adopted the Liberty Penguin (&quot;LP&quot;) as their official mascot. Another mascot is the Libertarian porcupine, an icon that was originally designed by Kevin Breen in March 2006 and inspired by the logo of the Free State Project (FSP).

== Structure and composition ==
The Libertarian Party is democratically governed by its members, with state affiliate parties each holding annual or biennial conventions at which delegates are elected to attend the party&#x27;s biennial national convention. National convention delegates vote on changes to the party&#x27;s national platform and bylaws and elect officers and &quot;at-large&quot; representatives to the party&#x27;s National Committee. The National Committee also has &quot;regional representatives&quot;, some of whom are appointed by delegate caucuses at the national convention whereas others are appointed by the chairpersons of LP state affiliate chapters within a region.

=== National committee ===
The Libertarian National Committee (LNC) is a 27-member body including alternates, or 17 voting members. Since February 2, 2025, the chair is currently Steven Nekhalia of Florida, who was elected by the LNC in a special election.

=== State chapters ===
The Libertarian Party is organized in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.
=== Membership ===
Since the Libertarian Party&#x27;s inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization&#x27;s non-aggression pledge, which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an &quot;instant&quot; membership, but these are referred to as &quot;signature members&quot;. People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year. Dues-paying members receive a subscription to the party&#x27;s national newspaper, &quot;LP News&quot;. Since 2006, membership in the party&#x27;s state affiliates has been separate from membership in the national party, with each state chapter maintaining its own membership rolls.

Most rights to participate in the governance of the party are limited to &quot;bylaws-sustaining members&quot; who have either purchased a lifetime membership or donated at least $25 within the past year. Most state parties maintain separate membership, which may be tied to either payment of dues to the state party, or voter registration as a Libertarian, depending on the state&#x27;s election laws.

== Platform ==
The preamble outlines the party&#x27;s goals: &quot;As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others. [...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands&quot;. Its Statement of Principles begins: &quot;We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual&quot;. The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.

The platform emphasizes individual liberty in personal and economic affairs, avoidance of &quot;foreign entanglements&quot; and military and economic intervention in other nations&#x27; affairs, and free trade and migration. The party opposes gun control measures that restrict the rights of civilians to keep and bear arms. It calls for Constitutional limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a &quot;Self-determination&quot; section which quotes from the Declaration of Independence and reads: &quot;Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty&quot;. It also includes an &quot;Omissions&quot; section which reads: &quot;Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval&quot;.

The party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful federal government, strong civil liberties (including LGBT rights, with the party supporting same-sex marriage), the liberalization of drug laws, separation of church and state, open immigration, non-interventionism and neutrality in diplomatic relations, free trade and free movement to all foreign countries and a more representative republic. In 2018, the Libertarian Party became the first in the United States to call for the decriminalization of sex work. The party since 2022 has no official stance on abortion. Before this, the party&#x27;s stance was ambiguous, supporting the prerogative of individual politicians and voters to vote their conscience, but &quot;de facto&quot; pro-choice since it called for government to stay out of the matter.

The Statement of Principles was written by John Hospers. The Libertarian Party&#x27;s bylaws specify that a ths supermajority of delegates is required to change the Statement of Principles. Any proposed platform plank found by the Judicial Committee to conflict with the Statement requires approval by a three-fourths supermajority of delegates. Early platform debates included at the second convention whether to support tax resistance and at the 1974 convention whether to support anarchism. In both cases, a compromise was reached.

== Size and influence ==
=== Influence ===
The Libertarian Party has attracted influential politicians who attempt to sway the party&#x27;s voting base. In May 2024, Donald Trump spoke at the Libertarian Party&#x27;s convention in Washington D.C. with his speech focusing on libertarian issues such as his stances on anti-war policies, Bitcoin, and First and Second Amendment rights. This was the first time a current or former U.S. president had spoken at a Libertarian Party convention.

=== Presidential candidate performance ===

The first Libertarian presidential candidate, John Hospers, received one electoral vote in 1972 when Roger MacBride, a Virginia Republican faithless elector pledged to Richard Nixon, cast his ballot for the Libertarian ticket. His vote for Theodora (&quot;Tonie&quot;) Nathan as vice president was the first electoral college vote ever to be cast for a woman in a United States presidential election. MacBride became the Libertarian presidential nominee himself in 1976. This was the last time that the Libertarian Party won an electoral vote until 44 years later, in the 2016 presidential election, when Texas Republican faithless elector Bill Greene, who was pledged to cast his vote for Donald Trump, instead cast his vote for Libertarian Party member, 1988 presidential nominee, and former Republican representative Ron Paul for president.

During the 2016 presidential election, Gary Johnson and vice presidential candidate Bill Weld received a record percentage of 3.3% of the popular vote (4,489,233 votes), getting 9.3% in New Mexico, where Johnson had previously been elected governor. In the 2012 presidential election, Johnson and running mate Jim Gray received 1,275,821 votes (1.0%).

=== Earning ballot status ===
Historically, Libertarians have achieved 50-state ballot access for their presidential candidate five times: in 1980, 1992, 1996, (in 2000, L. Neil Smith was on the Arizona ballot instead of the nominee, Harry Browne) 2016, and have reached 50-state ballot access for the 2020 election.

In April 2012, the Libertarian Party of Nebraska successfully lobbied for a reform in ballot access with the new law requiring parties to requalify every four years instead of two. Following the 2012 election, the party gained automatic ballot status in 30 states.

Following the 2016 election, the party announced that it had achieved automatic ballot status in 37 or 38 states and the District of Columbia.

=== Party supporters ===
In the Libertarian Party, some donors are not necessarily &quot;members&quot; because the party since its founding in 1972 has defined a &quot;member&quot; as being someone who agrees with the party&#x27;s membership statement. The precise language of this statement is found in the party Bylaws. As of the end of 2017, there were 138,815 Americans who were on record as having signed the membership statement. A survey by David Kirby and David Boaz found a minimum of 14 percent of American voters to have libertarian-leaning views.

There is another measure the party uses internally as well. Since its founding, the party has apportioned delegate seats to its national convention based on the number of members in each state who have paid minimum dues (with additional delegates given to state affiliates for good performance in winning more votes than normal for the party&#x27;s presidential candidate). This is the most-used number by party activists. As of December 2017, the Libertarian Party reported that there were 14,445 donating members.

Historically, dues were $15 throughout the 1980s; in 1991, they were increased to $25. Between February 1, 2006, and the close of the 2006 Libertarian party convention on May 31, 2006, dues were set to $0. The latter was controversial and &quot;de facto&quot; reversed by the 2006 Libertarian National Convention in Portland, Oregon, at which the members re-established a basic $25 dues category (now called Sustaining membership) and further added a requirement that all National Committee officers must henceforth be at least sustaining members (which was not required prior to the convention).

=== Registered voters ===
Ballot access expert and editor of &quot;Ballot Access News&quot; Richard Winger periodically compiles and analyzes voter registration statistics as reported by state voter agencies and he reports that as of early 2020 the party ranked third in voter registration nationally with 693,634 .

=== Libertarians in office ===

Libertarians have had limited success in electing candidates at the state and local level. Since the party&#x27;s creation, 10 Libertarians have been elected to state legislatures and some other state legislators have switched parties after being originally elected as Republicans or Democrats. The most recent Libertarian candidate elected to a state legislature was Marshall Burt to the Wyoming House of Representatives in 2020. The party elected multiple legislators in New Hampshire during the 1990s as well as in Alaska during the 1980s. One of the party&#x27;s Alaska state legislators, Andre Marrou was nominated for vice president in 1988 and for president in 1992.

As of 2017, there were 168 Libertarians holding elected office: 58 of them partisan offices and 110 of them non-partisan offices. In addition, some party members, who were elected to public office on other party lines, explicitly retained their Libertarian Party membership and these include former Representative Ron Paul, who has repeatedly stated that he remains a life member of the Libertarian Party.

Previously, the party has had four sitting members of state legislatures. Laura Ebke served in the nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature and announced her switch from being a Republican to a Libertarian in 2016. Three members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives who were elected as either Republicans or Democrats in the 2016 election announced their switch to the Libertarian Party in 2017.

State Senator Mark B. Madsen of Utah announced his switch from Republican to Libertarian in 2016, but also did not seek re-election that year. State Representative Max Abramson of New Hampshire switched from Republican to Libertarian before running as the party&#x27;s gubernatorial candidate in 2016 instead of seeking re-election. State Representative John Moore of Nevada briefly switched parties, but he was defeated for re-election in 2016.

Aubrey Dunn Jr., the New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands, switched his voter registration from Republican to Libertarian in January 2018. In doing so, Dunn became the first official elected to a statewide partisan office to have Libertarian voter registration.

=== Best major race results ===

==== Other statewide elections ====
In 2012, Mike Fellows received 43% of the vote in a two-way race in Montana for clerk of the Montana Supreme Court, the best ever for a Libertarian candidate in a statewide election. In 2008, John Monds received 33% of the vote in a race in Georgia for Georgia Public Service Commission, joining William Strange (running for Texas Court of Criminal Appeals) that same year as the first Libertarians to ever to receive more than one million votes. Two later candidates for the same position, David Staples in 2012 and Eric Hoskins in 2016, received 34% and 33% of the vote, respectively.

==== State Senate elections ====
In 2018, Laura Ebke received 44% of the vote in a non-partisan race in Nebraska&#x27;s 32nd Legislative district in the Nebraska Legislature, the best ever for a Libertarian candidate in a state senate election. Also in 2018, Bobbi Hicks received 38% of the vote in a race in Arkansas&#x27;s 10th Senate district in the Arkansas Senate, the best ever for a Libertarian candidate in a partisan state senate election. There have been 14 candidates elected to state senate who had a Libertarian and major party cross endorsement: 1 in New Hampshire in 1992, 6 in New Hampshire in 1994, 3 in New Hampshire in 1996, 1 in Oregon in 2014, 1 in Oregon in 2018, 1 in New York in 2019, and 1 in New York in 2020.

==== State House elections ====
Libertarians have been elected as state representatives without a major party cross-endorsement six times: Dick Randolph in Alaska in 1978, Ken Fanning and Randolph again in Alaska in 1980, Andre Marrou in Alaska in 1984, Steve Vaillancourt in New Hampshire in 2000, and in 2020, Marshall Burt received 54% of the vote in a two-way race in Wyoming&#x27;s 39th House district in the Wyoming House of Representatives. As of the end of 2020, there have also been 67 candidates elected with a Libertarian and a major party cross endorsement: 37 in New Hampshire in 1992, 5 in New Hampshire in 1994, 4 in New Hampshire in 1996, 1 in Vermont in 1998, 5 in Oregon in 2014, 4 in Oregon in 2018, 4 in Oregon in 2020, and 7 in New York in 2020.






=== 2016 election ===

A Monmouth University opinion poll conducted on March 24, 2016, found Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson polling in double digits with 11% in a three-way race against Donald Trump (34%) and Hillary Clinton (42%). Later, a CNN poll from July 16, 2016, found Johnson with a personal best 13% of the vote. To be included in any of the three main presidential debates, a candidate must be polling at least 15% in national polls.

Following Trump&#x27;s win in the Indiana Republican primary, making him the presumptive Republican nominee, the Libertarian Party received a rise in attention. Between 7 p.m. on May 3 and Noon on May 4, the Libertarian Party received 99 new memberships and an increase in donors as well as a rise in Google searches of &quot;Libertarian Party&quot; and &quot;Gary Johnson&quot;. On May 5, Mary Matalin, a longtime Republican political strategist, switched parties to become a registered Libertarian, expressing her dislike of Trump.

Several Republican elected officials publicly stated that were considering voting for the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016. That included 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. It had been a common question and concern that the Libertarian ticket would exclusively draw away votes from Donald Trump and not the Democratic ticket. In response, Libertarian 2016 nominee Gary Johnson noted that analysis of national polls shows more votes drawn from Hillary Clinton.

Johnson would go on to receive 3.3% of the nationwide popular vote, with his best performance (9.3%) coming in New Mexico, where he previously served as a two-term governor.

After the conclusion of the Electoral College in 2016, the Libertarian Party received one electoral college vote from a faithless elector in Texas. The party&#x27;s 2016 nominee Gary Johnson did not receive the vote. The single faithless vote went instead to former Republican Congressman Ron Paul, who had rejoined the Libertarian Party in 2015. He is the first Libertarian to receive an electoral vote since John Hospers in 1972.

=== Defections from other parties ===

After presidential candidate Donald Trump won Indiana&#x27;s 2016 Republican primary, several Republican officeholders left the Party and changed their affiliation to the Libertarian Party. The first to do so was John Moore, a then-sitting Assemblyman in Nevada. Following the 2016 Nebraska State Legislative Session, state Senator Laura Ebke announced her displeasure with the Republican Party and announced she was registering as a Libertarian. After that, Mark B. Madsen, a Utah State Senator, switched from the Republican Party to the Libertarian Party. From February to June 2017, three New Hampshire State Representatives (Caleb Q. Dyer, Joseph Stallcop and Brandon Phinney) left the Republican and Democratic Parties and joined the Libertarian Party.

In January 2018, New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands Aubrey Dunn Jr. switched his party registration from Republican to Libertarian and subsequently announced he would run as the Libertarian nominee for the Senate election in New Mexico. Dunn was the first Libertarian in a partisan statewide office and was the highest ever official from the Libertarian Party until US Representative Justin Amash switched his party registration from independent to Libertarian on April 29, 2020. In December 2020, Maine House of Representatives member John Andrews changed his party registration to Libertarian after winning re-election as a Republican.

Several politicians joined the Libertarian Party, sometimes only briefly, after having left office, including former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, former Massachusetts Governor William Weld, former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee, former Alaska United States Senator Mike Gravel, former Georgia Congressman Bob Barr, and former Texas Congressman Ron Paul.

== Presidential ballot access ==
The Libertarian Party has placed a presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, as well as D.C., six times: 1980, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2016, and 2020. That level of ballot access has only been achieved by a third-party candidate four other times (John Anderson in 1980, Lenora Fulani in 1988, and Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996.) Although the territory of Guam has no electoral votes, it began holding presidential preference elections in 1980. The Libertarian Party presidential candidate has appeared on the ballot in Guam in every election from 1980 through 2020, except for 2016. Anderson and Fulani were also on the ballot in Guam.

The following is a table comparison of ballot status for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee from 1972 to 2020. In some instances the candidate appeared on the ballot as an independent.

The Libertarian Party supports &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism and the abolition of the modern welfare state. It adopts pro-civil liberties and pro-cultural liberal approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at Emory University, believes that while liberal Democrats generally seek to control economic activities and conservative Republicans generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what it deems &quot;social&quot; and &quot;economic&quot; issues.

=== Economic ===
The &quot;poverty and welfare&quot; issues page of the Libertarian Party&#x27;s website says that it opposes regulation of capitalist economic institutions and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.According to the party platform: &quot;The only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights, adjudicate disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected&quot; (adopted May 2008).

The Libertarian Party believes government regulations in the form of minimum wage laws drive up the cost of employing additional workers. That is why Libertarians favor loosening minimum wage laws so that overall unemployment rate can be reduced and low-wage workers, unskilled workers, visa immigrants and those with limited education or job experience can find employment.

==== Education ====
The party supports ending the public school system. The party&#x27;s official platform states that education is best provided by the free market, achieving greater quality, accountability and efficiency with more diversity of school choice. Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending corporal punishment within public schools. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children&#x27;s education.

==== Environment ====

The Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of natural resources, believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources. The party has also expressed that &quot;governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection&quot;. The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that free markets and property rights (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and social pressure are the most effective means of changing public behavior.

==== Fiscal policies ====

The Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, prices, rents, profits, production and interest rates and advocates the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of prices, products, or services. The party&#x27;s recent platform calls for the repeal of the income tax, the abolition of the Internal Revenue Service and all federal programs and services, such as the Federal Reserve System. The party supports the passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the national debt, provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to inflationary monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government subsidies to business, labor, or any other .

==== Healthcare ====
The Libertarian Party favors a free market health care system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it &quot;recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of health insurance they want, the level of health care they want, the care providers they want, the medicines and treatments they will use and all other aspects of their medical care, including end-of-life decisions.&quot; They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as Medicare and Medicaid and favor &quot;consumer-driven health care&quot;. The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans&#x27; ability to purchase health insurance across state lines and medicine across international borders.

==== Immigration and trade agreements ====
The Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that &quot;political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries.&quot; To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders. The party encourages blocking immigration of those with violent backgrounds or violent intents.

==== Labor ====
The Libertarian Party supports the repeal of all laws which impede the ability of any person to find employment while opposing government-fostered/forced retirement and heavy interference in the bargaining process. The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in labor unions and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.

==== Retirement and Social Security ====
The party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the government-sponsored Social Security system and transition to a private voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.

=== Social ===
The Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all victimless crimes, including drugs, pornography, prostitution, polygamy, and gambling, has always supported the removal of restrictions on homosexuality, opposes any kind of censorship and supports freedom of speech, and supports the right to keep and bear arms while opposing Federal capital punishment. The Libertarian Party&#x27;s platform states: &quot;Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict personal relationships. Consenting adults should be free to choose their own sexual practices and personal relationships.&quot;

==== Abortion ====
Libertarians have differing opinions on the issue. Some, like the group Libertarians for Life, consider abortion to be an act of aggression against a child, therefore necessitating government intervention to prevent it. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her. The party has nominated both anti-abortion and abortion rights candidates. Their 2012 and 2016 presidential nominee Gary Johnson and their 2020 nominee Jo Jorgensen are pro-choice, as were past presidential nominees other than 1988 nominee Ron Paul and 2008 nominee Bob Barr. The platform had been pro-choice from 1972 until May 2022 when the abortion plank was deleted.

==== Crime and capital punishment ====

Shortly before the 2000 elections, the party released a &quot;Libertarian Party Program on Crime&quot; in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of capital crimes. Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the rights of the accused in legal settings as well as limit the use of excessive force by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum restitution given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons. In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.

==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====
The Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of censorship, as it claims it is the only party that fully supports the First Amendment. The party describes the issue in its website: &quot;We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of individuals to dissent from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media.&quot; The party claims it is the only political party in the United States &quot;with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform&quot;.

==== Government reform ====
The Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the electorate at the federal, state and local levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a minor party, it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny ballot access, gerrymander districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of direct democracy through the referendum and recall processes.

==== LGBT rights====
The Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality. According to the Libertarian Party&#x27;s platform: &quot;Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government&#x27;s treatment of individuals, such as in marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws.&quot;

Gay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported same-sex marriage since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012). Many LGBT political candidates have run for office on the Libertarian Party ticket and there have been numerous LGBT caucuses in the party, with the most active in recent years being the Outright Libertarians. With regard to non-discrimination laws protecting LGBT people, the party is more divided, with some Libertarians supporting such laws, and others opposing them on the grounds that they violate freedom of association.

In 2009, the Libertarian Party of Washington encouraged voters to approve Washington Referendum 71 that extended LGBT relationship rights. According to the party, withholding domestic partnership rights from same-sex couples is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. In September 2010, in the light of the failure to repeal the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy (which banned openly gay people from serving in the military) during the Obama administration, the Libertarian Party urged gay voters to stop supporting the Democratic Party and vote Libertarian instead. The policy was repealed at the end of 2010.

==== Pornography and prostitution ====
The Libertarian Party views attempts by government to control obscenity or pornography as &quot;an abridgment of liberty of expression&quot; and opposes any government intervention to regulate it. According to former Libertarian National Committee chairman Mark Hinkle, &quot;Federal anti-obscenity laws are unconstitutional in two ways. First, because the Constitution does not grant Congress any power to regulate or criminalize obscenity, and second, because the First Amendment guarantees the right of free speech.&quot; This also means that the party supports the legalization of prostitution. Many men and women with backgrounds in prostitution and activists for sex workers&#x27; rights, such as Norma Jean Almodovar and Starchild, have run for office on the Libertarian Party ticket or are active members of the party. Norma Jean Almodovar, a former officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and former call girl who authored the book &quot;From Cop to Call Girl&quot; about her experiences, ran on the Libertarian Party ticket for California lieutenant governor in 1986 and was actively supported by the party. Mark Hinkle described her as being the most able &quot;of any Libertarian&quot; &quot;to generate publicity&quot;. The Massachusetts Libertarian Party was one of the few organizations to support a 1980s campaign to repeal prostitution laws.

==== Second and Fourth Amendment rights ====
The Libertarian Party affirms an individual&#x27;s right recognized by the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms and opposes the prosecution of individuals for exercising their rights of self-defense. The party opposes laws at any level of government requiring registration of or restricting the ownership, manufacture, or transfer or sale of firearms or ammunition. The Libertarian Party has also shown support in the past for the abolition of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and support for Constitutional carry.

The party also affirms an individual&#x27;s right to privacy through reforms that would give back rights of the Fourth Amendment of the United States of America&#x27;s Bill of Rights to the citizens. Often this coincides with a citizen&#x27;s right against covert surveillance by the government of their privacy.

=== Foreign policy ===

Libertarians generally prefer an attitude of mutual respect between all nations. Libertarians believe that free trade engenders positive international relationships. Libertarian candidates have promised to cut foreign aid and withdraw American troops from the Middle East and other areas throughout the world.

The Libertarian Party opposed the 2011 military intervention in Libya and LP Chair Mark Hinkle in a statement described the position of the Libertarian Party: &quot;President Obama&#x27;s decision to order military attacks on Libya is only surprising to those who actually think he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. He has now ordered bombing strikes in six different countries, adding Libya to Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen.&quot; It has also called for withdrawal from NATO. In a statement on February 7, 2023, the party came out in support of the Rage Against the War Machine rally in Washington, D.C., and denounced American aid to Ukraine.

== Internal debates ==

As of 2024, notable caucuses within the party include the hard-line and paleolibertarian Mises Caucus, the traditionalist and more left-leaning Classical Liberal Caucus, and the Radical Caucus.

=== Radicalism versus pragmatism ===
A longstanding debate within the party is one referred to by libertarians as the anarchist–minarchist debate. In 1974, anarchists and minarchists within the party agreed to officially take no position on whether or not government should exist at all and to not advocate either particular view. This agreement has become known as the Dallas Accord, having taken place at the party&#x27;s convention that year in Dallas, Texas.

Libertarian members often cite the departure of Ed Crane (of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank) as a key turning point in the early party history. Crane (who in the 1970s had been the party&#x27;s first executive director) and some of his allies resigned from the party in 1983 when their preferred candidates for national committee seats lost in the elections at the national convention. Others like Mary Ruwart say that despite this apparent victory of those favoring radicalism, the party has for decades been slowly moving away from those ideals.

In the mid-2000s, groups such as the Libertarian Party Reform Caucus generally advocated revising the party&#x27;s platform, eliminating or altering the membership statement and focusing on a politics-oriented approach aimed at presenting libertarianism to voters in what they deemed a &quot;less threatening&quot; manner. LPRadicals emerged in response and was active at the 2008 and 2010 Libertarian National Conventions. In its most recent incarnation, the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus was founded with the stated goal to &quot;support the re-radicalization of the LP.&quot;

At the 2016 Libertarian National Convention, the Radical Caucus endorsed Darryl W. Perry for President and Will Coley for Vice President, who respectively won 7% and 10% of the vote on the first ballot, both taking fourth place. Though not explicitly organized as such, most self-identified pragmatists or moderates supported the nomination of Gary Johnson for president and Bill Weld for vice president. Johnson and Weld were both nominated on the second ballot with a narrow majority after having both placed just shy of the required 50% on the first ballots. After the convention, the Libertarian Pragmatist Caucus (&quot;LPC&quot;) was founded and organized with the goal &quot;[t]o promote realistic, pragmatic, and practical libertarian candidates and solutions.&quot; LPC supported Nicholas Sarwark in his successful bid for re-election as Chair of the party&#x27;s national committee at the 2018 convention in New Orleans.

=== Platform revision ===
In 1999, a working group of leading Libertarian Party activists proposed to reformat and retire the platform to serve as a guide for legislative projects (its main purpose to that point) and create a series of custom platforms on issues for different purposes, including the needs of the growing number of Libertarians in office. The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus. Their agenda was partially successful in that the platform was much shortened (going from 61 to 15 planks—11 new planks and 4 retained from the old platform) over the previous one.

Members differ as to the reasons why the changes were relatively more drastic than any platform actions at previous conventions. Some delegates voted for changes so the party could appeal to a wider audience, while others simply thought the entire document needed an overhaul. It was also pointed out that the text of the existing platform was not provided to the delegates, making many reluctant to vote to retain the planks when the existing language was not provided for review.

Not all party members approved of the changes, some believing them to be a setback to libertarianism and an abandonment of what they see as the foremost purpose of the Libertarian Party.

At the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, the changes went even further with the approval of an entirely revamped platform. Much of the new platform recycles language from pre-millennial platforms. While the planks were renamed, most address ideas are found in earlier platforms and run no longer than three to four sentences.

===Free State Project versus Mises Caucus===

Proponents of the Free State Project, a movement dedicated to concentrating libertarians in the state of New Hampshire, argue that the Libertarian Party strategy of a national victory has been proven ineffective in stark contrast to libertarian concentration and focus on local races in New Hampshire. The founder of the Free State movement, Jason Sorens, stated in the movement&#x27;s announcement, &quot;Partisan politics has clearly failed: Libertarian presidential candidates consistently fail to break the one per cent barrier, while no Libertarian candidate has ever won election to a federal office.&quot;

At Porcfest 2021, an annual libertarian festival held in New Hampshire, Executive Director of the Free State Project (Jeremy Kauffman) and chair of the Libertarian Party (Angela McArdle) debated which strategy is more effective. Kauffman argued that, &quot;There are more people in this room that are elected members to the NH House of Representatives and former members of the Libertarian Party than there are Libertarian Party members nationwide.&quot; Meanwhile, Angela McArdle argued that while she wants to see the Free State Project succeed, she argues that the Free State Project could not have existed without the political infrastructure provided by the LP developed over the course of five decades.

<text>The University of Sussex is a public research university located in Falmer, East Sussex, England. It lies mostly within the city boundaries of Brighton and Hove. Its large campus site is surrounded by the South Downs National Park, and provides convenient access to central Brighton away. The university received its royal charter in August 1961, the first of the plate glass university generation.

More than a third of its students are enrolled in postgraduate programmes and approximately a third of staff are from outside the United Kingdom. Sussex has a diverse community of nearly 20,000 students, with around one in three being foreign students, and over 1,000 academics, representing over 140 different nationalities. The annual income of the institution for 2022–23 was £380.1 million with an expenditure of £345.1 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sussex Financial Statement 22/23&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sussex counts five Nobel Prize winners, 15 Fellows of the Royal Society, 10 Fellows of the British Academy, 24 fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences and a winner of the Crafoord Prize among its faculty. By 2011, many of its faculty members had also received the Royal Society of Literature Prize, the Order of the British Empire and the Bancroft Prize. Alumni include heads of states, diplomats, politicians, eminent scientists and activists.

==History==
===20th century===
In an effort to establish a university to serve Sussex, a public meeting was held in December 1911 at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton to discover ways to fund the construction of a university; the project was halted by World War I, and the money raised was used instead for books for the Municipal Technical College.

The idea was revived in the 1950s, and in June 1958 the government approved the corporation&#x27;s scheme for a university at Brighton, to be the first of a new generation of what came to be known as plate glass universities. The university was established as a company in 1959, with a Royal Charter being granted on 16 August 1961. This was the first university to be established in the UK since the Second World War, apart from Keele University. The university&#x27;s organisation broke new ground in seeing the campus divided into Schools of Study, with students able to benefit from a multidisciplinary teaching environment. Sussex would emphasise cross-disciplinary activity, so that students would emerge from the university with a range of background or &#x27;contextual&#x27; knowledge to complement their specialist &#x27;core&#x27; skills in a particular subject area. For example, arts students spent their first year taking sciences while science students took arts.This experimental interdisciplinary educational model was famously described by Professor Asa Briggs as pioneering &quot;a new map of learning&quot;.

The university grew from 52 students in 1961–62 to 3,200 in 1967–68. After starting at Knoyle Hall in Brighton, the Falmer campus was gradually built with Falmer House opening in 1962. The campus was praised as gorgeously modernist and groundbreaking, receiving numerous awards. The student union, as is typical, organised events and concerts, bringing in acts like Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Chuck Berry to perform at the University Common Room.

Academically, Sussex was home to figures such as Asa Lord Briggs, Helmut Pappe, Gillian Rose, Jennifer Platt and Tom Bottomore. In its first years, the university attracted a number of renowned academics such as Sir John Cornforth, John Maynard Smith, Martin Wight, David Daiches, Roger Blin-Stoyle and Colin Eaborn. Similarly, renowned scholars like Marcus Cunliffe, Gabriel Josipovici, Quentin Bell, Dame Helen Wallace, Stuart Sutherland and Marie Jahoda also became central figures at the university and founded many of its current departments. Additionally, a number of initiatives at the university were started at this time, such as the Subaltern Studies Group, founded by Ranajit Guha who was Reader in History at Sussex between 1962 and 1981.

In the late 1960s, the United Nations asked for science policy recommendations from a team of renowned academics at Sussex. The ensuing report became known as the Sussex Manifesto.

Sussex came to be identified with student radicalism. In 1973, a group of students prevented United States government adviser Samuel P. Huntington from giving a speech on campus, because of his involvement in the Vietnam War. Similarly, when the spokesperson for the US embassy, Robert Beers, visited to give a talk to students entitled &#x27;Vietnam in depth&#x27; three students were waiting outside Falmer House and threw a bucket of red paint over the diplomat as he was leaving.

In both 1967 and 1969, Sussex won the television quiz &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

In 1980, Sussex edged out the University of Oxford to become the university with the highest income from research grants and contracts.

===21st century===

In an attempt to appeal to a modern audience, the university chose in 2004 to cease using its coat of arms and to replace it with the &quot;US&quot; logo.

In 2011, Sussex celebrated its 50th anniversary and saw the production of a number of works including a book on the university&#x27;s history and an oral history and photography project. The university launched its first major fundraising campaign, Making the Future, and gathered over £51.3 million.

The university underwent a number of changes with the Sussex Strategic Plan 2009–2015, including the introduction of new academic courses, the opening of new research centres, the renovation and refurbishment of a number of its schools and buildings as well as the ongoing expansion of its student housing facilities. 

In 2018, the university moved all of its investments out of fossil fuels (known as fossil fuel divestment) after a four-year student union run campaign.

In October 2021 a student campaign called for Kathleen Stock&#x27;s dismissal. In October 2021, the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor Professor Adam Tickell gave his support to Stock who has been accused of transphobia. &quot;The Times&quot; reported students have called for Stock&#x27;s dismissal and claimed that she has been victimised. Following Tickell&#x27;s statement, the Sussex branch of the University and College Union (UCU) called for an investigation into &quot;institutional transphobia&quot; at the University of Sussex. Students have accused the university management of being &quot;anti-student and pro-transphobia&quot;. Taiwo Owatemi, the Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, called UCU&#x27;s statement &quot;strong and principled&quot;.

In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sussex was one of few universities that returned to real-world teaching. Most lectures at other universities chose to remain online-only.

==Campus==

The University of Sussex is situated near the city of Brighton and Hove, next to the Stanmer Park reserve, and extends into the Lewes District in its eastern fringe. The closest train station is Falmer railway station, located at about nine minutes from Brighton station. The campus is also close to the medieval town of Lewes and is approximately an hour away from London. Located within the South Downs National Park, it is the only English university existing in a National Park.

The campus, designed by Sir Basil Spence, is next to the village of Falmer but mostly within the city boundaries of Brighton and Hove. It is close to the South Downs, which influenced Spence&#x27;s design of the campus. In 1959, the Basil Spence and Partners company began planning and designing the campus, to be built over a 15-year period. In 1971, 17 buildings had been designed and built winning numerous awards including a medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects and a Civic Trust award. Spence expressed his awe at the beauty of the surrounding region and designed the campus as a stream of low buildings so as not to disturb the natural scenery around. Brick was chosen throughout as it was the dominant material used across Sussex. As the campus developed, Spence connected the buildings by a series of &#x27;green, interlocking courtyards that he felt created a sense of enclosure&#x27;.

The campus is self-contained, with facilities including eights cafes/restaurants, a post office, a Co-op Food store, a market, a bank, a pharmacy, a health centre (including a dentist) and childcare facilities. Spence&#x27;s designs were appreciated by architects; many of the campus buildings won awards. A number of features define these buildings, including the materials used and the fact that many of them have planted and tree-filled courtyards. The gatehouse-inspired Falmer House won a bronze medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. Another campus building, The Meeting House, won the Civic Trust award in 1969. In 1993, the buildings which made up the core of Spence&#x27;s designs were given listed building status, with Falmer House being awarded the highest designation, Grade 1, as a building of &quot;exceptional interest&quot;. A number of the original buildings are now Grade II listed buildings.

Sussex laid claim to being the &quot;only English university located entirely within a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot;. It is now entirely surrounded by the newly founded South Downs National Park.
The Gardner Arts Centre, another of Basil Spence&#x27;s designs, was opened in 1969 as the first university campus arts centre. It had a 480-seat purpose-built theatre, a visual art gallery and studio space, and was frequently used for theatre and dance as well as showing a range of films on a modern cinema screen. The Centre closed in the summer of 2007: withdrawal of funding and the cost of renovating the building were given as the key reasons. Following an extensive refurbishment, the Centre reopened as the Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts (ACCA) in the autumn of 2015, and a public performance programme started in Spring 2016. The centre is now a national arts and performance hub hosting various kinds of performances year-round.

The campus has facilities such as the Genome Damage and Stability Centre; the medical imaging equipment at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS); and the university&#x27;s Library, until 2013 the home of the Mass Observation Archive, which relocated to The Keep, a purpose-built archive facility nearby.

===Library===
The university&#x27;s main library is at the centre of its campus. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 November 1964. The Royal Literary fund office is based at the Library, providing support for students around academic writing. The Library also houses a research support centre and a research hive for PhD students and research staff. There is also a Skills Hub, training facilities, a support centre, a café and a Careers and Employability Centre.

There are also smaller libraries within individual schools and research centres, as well as The Keep.

The university holds a number of acclaimed collections and archives, mostly related to twentieth-century literary, political and cultural history. Collections include original manuscripts and first editions by Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen and Rudyard Kipling as well as The New Statesman Archive and the Mass-Observation Archive.

==Organisation and administration==

===Schools of Studies===
The university was founded with the unusual structure of &quot;Schools of Study&quot; (ubiquitously abbreviated to &quot;schools&quot;) rather than traditional university departments within arts and science faculties.

In the early 1990s, the university promoted the system by claiming &quot;[c]lusters of faculty [come] together within schools to pursue new areas of intellectual enquiry. The schools also foster broader intellectual links. &quot;Physics with Management Studies, Science and Engineering with European Studies, Economics with Mathematics&quot; all reach beyond conventional Arts/Science divisions.&quot; By this time the original schools had been developed somewhat and were:
* African and Asian Studies &quot;(abbreviated to AFRAS)&quot;
* Biological Sciences &quot;(BIOLS)&quot;
* Chemistry and Molecular Sciences &quot;(MOLS)&quot;
* Cognitive and Computing Sciences &quot;(COGS)&quot;
* Cultural and Community Studies &quot;(CCS)&quot;
* Engineering and Applied Sciences &quot;(ENGG, formerly EAPS)&quot;
* English and American &quot;(ENGAM or EAM)&quot;
* European Studies &quot;(EURO)&quot;
* Mathematical and Physical Sciences &quot;(MAPS)&quot;
* Social Sciences &quot;(SOC)&quot;

There was also the Institute of Development Studies &quot;(IDS)&quot;. This is still located on Sussex&#x27;s campus, but is now a separate institution.

In 2001, as the university celebrated its 40th anniversary, the then Vice-Chancellor Alasdair Smith proposed major changes to the curriculum across the &quot;Arts schools&quot;, and the senate agreed to structural changes which would create two Arts schools and a &quot;Sussex Institute&quot; in place of the five schools then in place. Corresponding changes would be made in Sciences.

The changes were finally implemented in September 2003. After discussion in senate and the schools, disciplinary departments which had been located across the different schools, were located firmly within one school, and undergraduates were offered straightforward degree subjects. The multi-disciplinarity provided by the school courses was now to be achieved through elective courses from other departments and schools.

In 2009 the university adopted a new organisational structure. The term &quot;Schools of Studies&quot; was retained, but each was headed by a &quot;Head of School&quot; rather than the traditional &quot;Dean&quot;.

In 2020 the School of English, School of History, Art History and Philosophy, and School of Media, Film and Music were merged to create the School of Media, Arts and Humanities.

The schools as of 2020 are listed below.
The term &quot;department&quot; has been retained in some cases, where a school contains separate disciplines.

* School of Engineering and Informatics (two separate schools before 2011)
* School of Life Sciences (includes Biology, Environmental Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry and houses the Centre for Genome Damage and Stability)
* School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) (includes Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy) 
* School of Psychology
* School of Education and Social Work (ESW)
* School of Global Studies (includes Anthropology, Geography, International Development and International Relations, as well as interdisciplinary programmes in Development Studies)
* School of Law, Politics and Sociology (LPS)
*School of Media, Arts and Humanities (MAH) (three separate schools before 2020)
* University of Sussex Business School

None of these changes have affected the Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS).

The Doctoral School supports PhD student and Post-docs across all schools and departments and supports PhD students and Post-Docs through the Sussex Research hive, the Researcher Development Program, funding schemes as well as its own partnerships.

===Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors===
The current and fifth Chancellor of the university is Sanjeev Bhaskar, who succeeded Lord Attenborough in 2009.
The university has had nine Vice-Chancellors:
==Academic profile==

The university, a member of the Erasmus charter, offers over 400 Undergraduate programs, over 210 Postgraduate taught programs and over 70 PhD programs.

===Research===
In 2017, Sussex&#x27;s research income was around £65 million. This primarily came from funding body grants and research grants and contracts.

In addition to being home to Institute of Development Studies, Sussex has over 40 university research centres, over 15 strategic research centres and many smaller research clusters. IDS is ranked as 1st in the UK, 2nd International Development Think Tank and 4th university affiliated Think Tank in the world (out of 8,000 think tanks ranked) by the University of Pennsylvania Global Go To Think Tank Index Report 2017.

Sussex research centres include SPRU, the Science Policy Research Unit, which is ranked as 3rd best Science and technology Think Tank in the World (out of 8,000 think tanks ranked by the University of Pennsylvania Global Go To Think Tank Index Report 2017) Other notable centres include the STEPS Centre, the Centre for American Studies and the Sussex European Institute.
The university is one of the UK ESRC&#x27;s 21 Centres for Doctoral Training, the only institutions accredited in 2010 and capable of receiving ESRC doctoral studentships and funding. The system was updated in 2016 and Doctoral Training Partnerships were established to replace the DTC. In this respect, Sussex is now a member of the Consortium of the Humanities and the Arts-South East England (CHASE) and the South East Network for Social Sciences.

The results of the Research Excellence Framework 2014 show that 98% of research activity at Sussex is categorised as &#x27;world-leading&#x27; (28%), &#x27;internationally excellent&#x27; (48%) or &#x27;internationally recognised&#x27; (22%) in terms of originality, significance and rigour.

Sussex has a number of research collaborations with other Higher Education institutions as well as governmental and non-governmental organisations and institutes around the world. For example, the Harvard Sussex program is a long-standing research collaboration between Sussex and Harvard University focusing on public policy towards chemical and biological weapons. The CBW Conventions Bulletin is a quarterly newsletter published by the HSP. Sussex-Cornell Partnership, the Sussex-Bocconi-Renmin Intrapreneurship Hub and the Sussex-Lund Partnership in Middle Eastern and North African Studies are recent examples. Sussex also co-coordinates the Consortium for the Humanities and the Arts. Sussex is also one of the eight universities of the Tyndall Centre network.

In Europe, Sussex is one of the collaborating institutions of the Paul Scherrer Institute, the largest research institute in Switzerland, focusing on issues of technology and the natural sciences. Sussex is involved with many projects with the EU and with European countries. For example, BAR research is an Anglo-French collaboration between the Sussex, the East Sussex County Council and three French universities.

Nationally, Sussex is involved in a number of partnerships including the Nexus Network (A partnership between Sussex, University of Cambridge and the University of East Anglia) and CIED (a collaboration between Sussex, Oxford University and University of Manchester). The university is also a partner of the Metropolitan Police, with Demos (UK think tank) and Palantir Technologies.

In recent years, the institutes for the study of consciousness science, Centre for Advanced International Theory (CAIT), the institute for the study of corruption and the Middle East studies institute were opened at the university. The university also has a Genome Damage and Stability Centre, a nuclear magnetic resonance facility and a purpose-built apparatus in cryogenic research.

In terms of policy, Sussex is highly involved with the UK government, the UN and governments around the world. For example, the university is a UN Habitat partner. Nationally, the UK Trade Policy Observatory was set up at the university to offer the UK government, the UK industry as well as the public advice in addressing trade issues resulting from Brexit. The university is also one of the UK government&#x27;s partner institutions on the Arctic Research Program. Similarly, SPRU and IDS are involved in policy recommendations with countries on all five continents.

In 2016, the Transformative Innovation Policy Consortium (TIPC) was set up as a collaboration between the university and the governments of Sweden, Norway, Finland, South Africa and Colombia to research social and economic issues.

The university is also home to a number of academic journals from the IDS Bulletin to The Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies (JEMS), Journal of Experimental Psychopathology, The World Trade Review, Journal of Banking and Finance, International Journal of Innovation Management, Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies, European Journal of International Relations and the Child and Family Social Work Journal, among many others.

===Admissions===

New students entering the university in 2021 had an average of 133 points (the equivalent of AAB at A Level). According to the 2023 &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, approximately 11% of Sussex&#x27;s undergraduates come from independent schools.

===Educational partners===
Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) results from a partnership between the University of Brighton and the University of Sussex. The school, the first medical school in the South East outside London, gained its licence in 2002 and opened in 2003. The Guardian ranked the medical school as 16th in the UK in 2018.

The Institute of Development Studies offers research, teaching and communications related to international development. IDS originated in 1966 as a research institute based at the university. It is financially and constitutionally independent under the status of a charitable company limited by guarantee.

The Centre for Research in Innovation Management, a research-based school of the University of Brighton, dates from 1990. It was located in the Freeman Centre building but has now moved to the University of Brighton campus.

The Sussex Innovation Centre, an on-campus commercial business centre, opened in 1996. It provides services for the formation and growth of technology- and knowledge-based companies in the South East. It offers a business environment to over 40 companies in the IT, biotech, media and engineering sectors.

Nationally, the university has a number of partner institutions across the UK including Bellerbys College, British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM), University Centre Croydon (UCC, also known as Croydon College), Highbury College Portsmouth, International Study Centre (Study Group), Roffey Park Institute, University of Brighton and West Dean College. These partnerships include both validated courses (designed and delivered by the partner institution but awarded and quality assured by the university) and franchised courses (designed and assessed by the university, but delivered by another institution).

Study Group works in partnership with the university to provide the University of Sussex International Study Centre (ISC). It offers a course of academic subjects, study skills and English-language training for students who wish to study a degree at the university but who do not yet possess the necessary qualifications to start a degree. The ISC course provides students with English-language and academic skills to start at Sussex the following year. In 2018, ISC announced that they will increase their postgraduate and undergraduate offerings by adding 50 new courses across the pre-masters and pathway options on offer.

The British and Irish Modern Music Institute offers BA courses in Modern Musicianship – validated by the university – at its centres in London, Berlin, Hamburg, Brighton, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham.

Internationally, the university has over 160 partner institutions including the University of British Columbia, University of California, George Washington University, Georgetown University, University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina at Asheville, University of Pittsburgh, Purdue University, University of Rochester, State University of New York, University of Texas at Austin, University of Washington, Kyoto University, Peking University, Korea University, National Taiwan University (NTU), Université Grenoble Alpes, Aix-Marseille Université, Paris-Sorbonne University, Sciences Po Aix, Sciences Po Paris, University of Strasbourg, Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. These are institutions where there are formal agreements for student exchange, research collaborations, staff and faculty mobility and study abroad schemes.

==Student life==
=== University of Sussex Students&#x27; Union ===
Sussex Students Union is the main body responsible for the representation of Sussex students. It runs two bars (Falmer Bar, which once hosted bands such as The Who, and Northfield Bar), two shops, a cafe and a number of other outlets and schemes (such as the buddy scheme). There are 261 student clubs and societies at Sussex, all functioning under the Student Union. 

Like many campus universities, many of the students studying at Sussex live in the city. Students are highly involved in Brighton&#x27;s life, from its cultural scene to community service. In 2016, Sussex won the AGCAS award for Student engagement. 

In 2017, Sussex was ranked as top in the UK for political scene (tied with Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Goldsmith and LSE).

=== Student support ===
A wide range of support is offered by the university, with key student support services (e.g. financial, counselling, careers, exceptional circumstances, disability support) offered via the Student Centre, which replaced the Student Life Centre in 2022. The building also acts as a hub for a wide range of student opportunities, such as employer fairs, academic skills workshops and wellbeing- and community-building activities.

All students at Sussex have access to a wide variety of Careers and employability support, in addition to the opportunities embedded in their degree programme. The Spirit of Sussex Award also encourages students to build their employability by recognising and recording their co-curricular achievements and skills. 

=== Access and participation initiatives ===
Like most UK Universities, Sussex deliver a number of initiatives to improve equality of opportunity for home-fees students from underrepresented backgrounds to access and succeed in undergraduate higher education. These are delivered by teams including Widening Participation, who work with local schools and colleges, and many teams within the Student Experience division. 

The University was previously known for its First-Generation Scholars scheme, an award-winning initiative to support students from lower-economic backgrounds and those who are the first to pursue higher education in their families. In 2017, Britain&#x27;s Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn met some First-Generation Scholar students during his visit to the university. More recently, the Sussex Access Programme supports students from a diverse range of backgrounds including mature students, care-experienced and estranged students, and many others. 

===Student research===
At undergraduate level, Sussex runs a Junior Researcher scheme in which undergraduate students can receive funding and spend 8 weeks during their summer vacation doing research alongside Sussex researchers and academics. Additionally, a number of independent bursaries for undergraduates to conduct research projects exist within Schools and research centres. In parallel, a competitive International Junior researcher scheme exists to allow students from Sussex&#x27;s institutional partners, such as Georgetown University, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of California, Santa Cruz to receive funding and come to Sussex to work on research projects alongside researchers and academics. Additionally, a number of research groups and networks incorporate advanced undergraduate students into their projects offering them the opportunity to both shadow and actively participate in ongoing research at the university.

At postgraduate level, Sussex offers MA, MS, MRes, PGCert, PGDip, CLNDIP and LLM degrees. All master&#x27;s degrees are research based and master&#x27;s students are incorporated with PhD students in the different research centres, clusters and networks across the university and many master&#x27;s degrees are based in research centres instead of being based in University departments. Further, student research mobility schemes are in place to allow students to conduct research at other institutions across the world. The university has a number of research-oriented funding schemes (scholarships and fellowships) for master&#x27;s students, including a Sussex Graduate Scholarship for current undergraduate students at the university. There are also country scholarships for postgraduate students applying from India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Malaysia and Vietnam.

===International students and opportunities===
In 2016–2017, there were 17,319 students at Sussex, with under 12,000 undergraduates and over 5,000 postgraduates. In total, there are around 5,000 students from outside the EU, the majority of whom are postgraduates. It also has many students from mainland Europe. One in five of its undergraduates study abroad at some point of their education: the majority of its undergraduate courses offer a study abroad year and/or placement. 
Sussex students may also spend a year abroad as part of their degree, in a variety of European institutions through the Erasmus+ programme, as well as North America, Asia, Central and South America, Australia and North Africa.
English Language courses for speakers of other languages are provided by the Language Institute. &quot;English in the Vacation&quot; gives intensive practice in spoken and written English. An International Foundation Year offered by the ISC (Sussex University International Study Centre) offers direct routes to Sussex degrees.

The Sussex International Summer School runs for four and eight weeks starting in July, providing intensive courses. It is predominantly attended by foreign students. The ISS trips office provides excursions to prominent cities, theatres, and activities. Sussex is also home to the Fulbright Sussex Summer institute, a four-week academic program on British culture designed for American Students.

The International Study Centre, run by Study Group International at Sussex offers international Foundation courses, pre-masters and an International Year 1 scheme to prepare students for their degrees. The centre also offers a &quot;Pre-masters&quot; degree for international students.

The Sussex Student Union also runs a series of events in support of international students at Sussex. The union has a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions policy in all its shops, bars and cafes.

=== Housing ===
Overall, there are nine on-campus university managed accommodations, one off-campus university managed block of flats, one off-campus university managed study lodge and a number of university houses within Brighton and Hove. Around 5000 undergraduate and postgraduate students live in University-managed accommodation, but many live in private accommodation or with family members. 

After the initial campus opening, accommodation on campus was expanded in the 1970s with the construction of Kulukundis House, for students with physical disabilities, and the unusual split-level flats of East Slope, a development that included a social building with a porter&#x27;s office and bar. Two newer accommodation areas were completed in the 2000s: one next to Falmer railway station, named Stanmer Court, and the other next to East Slope, opposite Bramber House, known as Swanborough. Northfield was constructed at the top end of campus, beyond Lewes Court, and opened in September 2011. In 2017, the old East Slope buildings were demolished to create up to date accommodation (also called East Slope) and a new Student Centre, which opened in phases between 2021 and 2022 

In 2020, the university announced that they plan to replace Park Village and Park Houses (excluding Norwich House) with the new West Slope development, as well as creating new facilities including a new library, cafe, supermarket, additional study spaces, and flexible green space. The first phase is projected to be completed by autumn 2022 and this work is projected to be fully completed by 2025. The new accommodation will provide approximately 1000 additional bedrooms. The university&#x27;s Sustainability Action Plan released in June 2021 includes plans for increasing the energy efficiency of campus housing and ancillary facilities in an effort to reach net zero by 2035. The plan includes upgrading building energy management systems by August 2022 and assessing if the BREEAM Excellent environmental construction standards are sufficient for new construction by December 2022.

===Sport===
The university has two sports centres on its campus: the Sussex Sports Centre and the Falmer Sports Complex. There is also one sports shop within the sports centre and one in the Falmer sports complex. The Falmer sports centre alone has over 40 acres of playing field. The university also has agreements with Freedom Leisure, granting its students access to sports centres across West Sussex.
The university competes in the following sports, usually with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams:

*Team sports: basketball, cricket, football, field hockey, lacrosse, netball, American football, rugby union, ultimate Frisbee, rowing, and volleyball.
*Racquet sports: tennis, table tennis, badminton, and squash.
*Individual sports: archery, fencing, swimming, and trampolining.
*Outdoor pursuits: sailing, mountain biking, mountaineering, skiing and snowboarding, sub aqua, surfing, and windsurfing.
*Martial arts: mixed martial arts, kickboxing, Shaolin Kung Fu, aikido, and sport aikido.

The Falmer Stadium, home to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C., is located near the Sussex campus. A mutual relationship of benefits, including potential usage of the stadium&#x27;s sporting facilities by the university, was established very early on.

In 2018, the university had 42 sports teams competing in the BUCS.

The Sussex Sports centre also runs a number of courses, from Yoga to Cycling challenges, as well as fundraisers, children&#x27;s activities and specialized workshops for students and staff. The university also offers sports scholarships, including ones for basketball and Hockey.

===Campus media===
&quot;University Radio Falmer&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;URF)&quot; is one of the first student radio stations in the country, founded in 1976. It now broadcasts via digital audio broadcasting and via the internet. The station is unplaylisted, and broadcasts twenty-four hours a day from its studio in the Grade I listed Falmer House. &quot;URF&quot; also publishes student articles, interviews and news on its website. It won a bronze award in the &quot;best scripted programming&quot; category in the 2008 UK Student Radio Awards. Alumni of the station include the former BBC Radio Director Helen Boaden, Sky News journalist Kit Bradshaw, and BBC News presenter Clive Myrie.

&quot;The Badger&quot; is the Union&#x27;s fortnightly newspaper and is written and designed entirely by Sussex students. The paper is available to students and staff during term-time, covering news and sport on campus, as well as comment pieces, features, lifestyle and arts coverage. It also publishes content online. &quot;The Badger&quot; began in October 1995, having formerly been known as &quot;Unionews&quot; since the 1970s. The paper has since covered a variety of stories, including several on-campus occupations and the expulsion of five Sussex students for involvement in protests.

University of Sussex Student Television (abbreviated to &quot;UniTV)&quot; is a student television channel, launched in September 2010. UniTV is a member of NaSTA (National Student Television Association) and has won 7 NaSTA awards in the past three years.

<doc id="32047" wikidata="Q5699" url="?curid=32047" title="Ur">
<text>Ur ( or ) was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar () in Dhi Qar Governorate, southern Iraq. Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland, on the south bank of the Euphrates, from Nasiriyah in modern-day Iraq. The city dates from the Ubaid period , and is recorded in written history as a city-state from the 26th century BC, its first recorded king being King Tuttues.

The city&#x27;s patron deity was Nanna (in Akkadian, Sin), the Sumerian and Akkadian moon god, and the name of the city is in origin derived from the god&#x27;s name, UNUGKI, literally &quot;the abode (UNUG) of Nanna&quot;. The site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur, which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the 1930s. The temple was built in the 21st century BC (short chronology), during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon.

== Layout ==


== Society and culture ==
Archaeological discoveries have shown unequivocally that Ur was a major Sumerian urban center on the Mesopotamian plain. Especially the discovery of the Royal Tombs has confirmed its splendour. These tombs, which date to the Early Dynastic IIIa period (approximately in the 25th or 24th century BC), contained an immense treasure of luxury items made of precious metals and semi-precious stones imported from long distances (Ancient Iran, Afghanistan, India, Asia Minor, the Levant and the Persian Gulf). This wealth, unparalleled up to then, is a testimony of Ur&#x27;s economic importance during the Early Bronze Age.
Excavation in the old city of Ur in 1929 revealed the Lyres of Ur, instruments similar to the modern harp but in the shape of a bull and with eleven strings.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
When Ur was founded, the Persian Gulf&#x27;s water level was two-and-a-half metres higher than today. Ur is thought, therefore, to have had marshy surroundings; irrigation would have been unnecessary, and the city&#x27;s evident canals likely were used for transportation. Fish, birds, tubers, and reeds might have supported Ur economically without the need for an agricultural revolution sometimes hypothesized as a prerequisite to urbanization.

==== Prehistoric Ubaid period ====
Archaeologists have discovered evidence of early occupation at Ur during the Ubaid period (c. 5500–3700 BC), a prehistoric period of Mesopotamia. The name derives from Tell al-&#x27;Ubaid where the earliest large excavation of Ubaid period material was conducted initially in 1919 by Henry Hall and later by Leonard Woolley.

Later, a layer of soil covered the occupation levels from the Ubaid period. Excavators of the 1920s interpreted the layer of soil as evidence for the Great Flood of the Epic of Gilgamesh and Book of Genesis. It is now understood that the South Mesopotamian plain was exposed to regular floods from the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, with heavy erosion from water and wind, which may have given rise to the Mesopotamian and derivative Biblical Great Flood stories.

=== Bronze Age ===
There are various main sources informing scholars about the importance of Ur during the Early Bronze Age. Proto-cuneiform tablets from the Early Dynastic period, c. 2900 BC, have been recovered. The First Dynasty of Ur seems to have had great wealth and power, as shown by the lavish remains of the Royal Cemetery at Ur. The Sumerian King List provides a tentative political history of ancient Sumer and mentions, among others, several rulers of Ur. Mesannepada is the first king mentioned in the Sumerian King List, and appears to have lived in the 26th century BC. That Ur was an important urban centre already then seems to be indicated by a type of cylinder seal called the City Seals. These seals contain a set of Proto-Cuneiform signs which appear to be writings or symbols of the name of city-states in ancient Mesopotamia. Many of these seals have been found in Ur, and the name of Ur is prominent on them. Ur came under the control of the Semitic-speaking Akkadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC. This was a period when the Semitic-speaking Akkadians, who had entered Mesopotamia in approximately 3000 BC, gained ascendancy over the Sumerians, and indeed much of the ancient Near East.
==== Ur III ====
After a short period of chaos following the fall of the Akkadian Empire the third Ur dynasty was established when the king Ur-Nammu came to power, ruling between c. 2047 BC and 2030 BC. During his rule, temples, including the Ziggurat of Ur, were built, and agriculture was improved through irrigation. His code of laws, the &quot;Code of Ur-Nammu&quot; (a fragment was identified in Istanbul in 1952) is one of the oldest such documents known, preceding the Code of Hammurabi by 300 years. He and his successor Shulgi were both deified during their reigns, and after his death he continued as a hero-figure: one of the surviving works of Sumerian literature describes the death of Ur-Nammu and his journey to the underworld.

Ur-Nammu was succeeded by Shulgi, the greatest king of the Third Dynasty of Ur, who solidified the hegemony of Ur and reformed the empire into a highly centralized bureaucratic state. Shulgi ruled for a long time (at least 42 years) and deified himself halfway through his rule.
The Ur empire continued through the reigns of three more kings with Akkadian names, Amar-Sin, Shu-Sin, and Ibbi-Sin. It fell around 1940 BC to the Elamites in the 24th regnal year of Ibbi-Sin, an event commemorated by the Lament for Ur.

According to one estimate, Ur was the largest city in the world from c. 2030 to 1980 BC. Its population was approximately 65,000 (or 0.1 per cent share of global population then).

The city of Ur lost its political power after the demise of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Nevertheless, its important position which kept on providing access to the Persian Gulf ensured the ongoing economic importance of the city during the second millennium BC. The city came to be ruled by the Amorite first dynasty of Babylon which rose to prominence in southern Mesopotamia in the 19th century BC. During the Old Babylonian Empire, in the reign of Samsu-iluna, Ur was abandoned. It later became a part of the native Sealand Dynasty for several centuries. It then came under the control of the Kassites in the 16th century BC, and sporadically under the control of the Middle Assyrian Empire between the 14th and 11th centuries BC.

===Iron Age===
The city, along with the rest of southern Mesopotamia and much of the Near East, Asia Minor, North Africa and southern Caucasus, fell to the north Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian Empire from the 10th to late 7th centuries BC. From the end of the 7th century BC Ur was ruled by the so-called Chaldean Dynasty of Babylon. In the 6th century BC there was new construction in Ur under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. The last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, improved the ziggurat. However, the city started to decline from around 530 BC after Babylonia fell to the Persian Achaemenid Empire, and was no longer inhabited by the early 5th century BC. The demise of Ur was perhaps owing to drought, changing river patterns, and the silting of the outlet to the Persian Gulf.

== Identification with the Biblical Ur ==

Ur is possibly the city of Ur Kasdim mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the birthplace of the Jewish and Muslim patriarch Abraham (Avraham in Hebrew, Ibrahim in Arabic), traditionally believed to have lived some time in the 2nd millennium BC. There are, however, conflicting traditions and scholarly opinions identifying Ur Kasdim with the sites of Şanlıurfa, Urkesh, Urartu, or Kutha.

The biblical Ur is mentioned four times in the Torah or Hebrew Bible (Tanakh in Hebrew), with the distinction &quot;of the Kasdim&quot;—traditionally rendered in English as &quot;Ur of the Chaldees&quot;. The Chaldeans had settled in the vicinity by around 850 BC, but were not extant anywhere in Mesopotamia during the 2nd millennium BC period when Abraham is traditionally held to have lived. The Chaldean dynasty did not rule Babylonia (and thus become the rulers of Ur) until the late 7th century BC, and held power only until the mid 6th century BC. The name is found in , , and . In , a single passage mentioning Ur is a paraphrase of &quot;Genesis.&quot;

Pope John Paul II wanted to visit the city according to the biblical tradition as part of his trip to Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories but the visit was cancelled due to a dispute between the Government of Saddam Hussein and representatives of the Holy See.

In March 2021, Pope Francis visited Ur during his journey through Iraq.

== Archaeology ==


The site consists of a mound, roughly 1200 by 800 meters with a height of about 20 meters above the plain. The mound is split by the remnants of an ancient canal into north and south portions. 
The remains of a city wall are visible surrounding the site. The occupation size ranged from about 15 hectares in the Jemdet Nasr period to 90 hectares in the Early Dynastic period and then peaking in the Ur III period at 108 hectares and the Isin-Larsa period at 140 hectares, extending beyond the city walls. Subsequent period had varying lesser degrees of occupation.
In 1625, the site was visited by Pietro Della Valle, who recorded the presence of ancient bricks stamped with strange symbols, cemented together with bitumen, as well as inscribed pieces of black marble that appeared to be seals. He retrieved several inscribed bricks. European archaeologists did not identify Tell el-Muqayyar as the site of Ur until Henry Rawlinson successfully deciphered some bricks from that location, brought to England by William Loftus in 1849.

The site was first excavated in 1853 and 1854, on behalf of the British Museum and with instructions from the Foreign Office, by John George Taylor, British vice consul at Basra from 1851 to 1859. Taylor uncovered the Ziggurat of Ur and a structure with an arch later identified as part of the &quot;Gate of Judgment&quot;. Among the finds were copies of a standard cylinder of Nabonidus, Neo-Babylonian ruler, mentioning the prince regent Belshar-uzur, usually thought to be the Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible. Between 1854 and 1918 locals excavated over two hundred tablets from the site, mostly from the temple Ê-nun-maḫ, of the moon god Sin. Built by the Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu, the ziggurat was later repaired by Isin ruler Ishme-Dagan early in the 2nd millennium BC. Stamped bricks on the ziggurat detail the rebuilding of the temple of Ningal by 14th century BC Kassite ruler Kurigalzu I.

Some cuneiform tablets were found. Thirty four of these tablets were inadvertently mixed in with those excavated at Kutalla. Only in recent years has this error been recognized. Typical of the era, his excavations destroyed information and exposed the tell. Natives used the now loosened, 4,000-year-old bricks and tile for construction for the next 75 years, while the site lay unexplored, the British Museum having decided to prioritize archaeology in Assyria.

The site was considered rich in remains, and relatively easy to explore. After some soundings were made during a week in 1918 by Reginald Campbell Thompson, H. R. Hall worked the site for one season (using 70 Turkish prisoners of war) for the British Museum in 1919, laying the groundwork for more extensive efforts to follow. Some cuneiform tablets from the Isin-Larsa period were found, including omen and medical texts. They are now in the British Museum.
Excavations from 1922 to 1934 were funded by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania and led by the archaeologist Sir Charles Leonard Woolley. The last two seasons focused on closing the site properly. A total of about 1,850 burials were uncovered, including 16 that were described as &quot;royal tombs&quot; containing many valuable artifacts, including the Standard of Ur. Most of the royal tombs were dated to about 2600 BC. The finds included the unlooted tomb of a queen thought to be Queen Puabi (formerly transcribed as Shub-ab), known from a cylinder seal found in the tomb, although there were two other different and unnamed seals found in the tomb. Many other people had been buried with her, in a form of human sacrifice. Near the ziggurat were uncovered the temple E-nun-mah and buildings E-dub-lal-mah (built for a king), E-gi-par (residence of the high priestess) and E-hur-sag (a temple building).

Outside the temple area, many houses used in everyday life were found. Excavations were also made below the royal tombs layer: a layer of alluvial clay covered the remains of earlier habitation, including pottery from the Ubaid period, the first stage of settlement in southern Mesopotamia. Woolley later wrote many articles and books about the discoveries. One of Woolley&#x27;s assistants on the site was the British archaeologist Max Mallowan.

A number of royal inscriptions were found during the Woolley excavations. Numerous cuneiform tablets were also recovered. These included archives, temple and domestic, from the Early Dynastic and Sargonic periods, the Ur III period, Old and Middle Babylonian period, and the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods. Many literary and religious texts were also recovered.

The discoveries at the site reached the headlines in mainstream media in the world with the discoveries of the Royal Tombs. As a result, the ruins of the ancient city attracted many visitors. One of these visitors was the already famous Agatha Christie, who as a result of this visit ended up marrying Max Mallowan. During this time the site was accessible from the Baghdad–Basra railway, from a stop called &quot;Ur Junction&quot;.

In 2009, an agreement was reached for a joint University of Pennsylvania and Iraqi team to resume archaeological work at the site of Ur. Excavations began in 2015 under the direction of Elizabeth C Stone and Paul Zimansky of the State University of New York. The first excavation season was primarily to re-excavate Woolley&#x27;s work in an Old Babylonian housing area with two new trenches for confirmation. Among the finds were a cylinder seal and balance pan weights. A number of cuneiform tablets were unearthed, a few Ur III period, a few Old Babylonian period, and a number of Old Akkadian period. A similar though smaller dig was made in a Neo-Babylonian housing area.
 In the 2017 season an urban area adjacent to Wooleys very large AH area was excavated. The burial vault of a Babylonian general Abisum was found. Abisum is known from year 36 of Hammurabi into the reign of Samsu-iluna. Thirty cuneiform tablets were found around the vault and another 12 inside the tomb itself. Some distance south of Area AH a German team of Munich University directed by Adelheid Otto excavated an Old Babylonian home. In levels below the final occupation were found tablets dating to Sin-Eribam and Silli-Adad, rulers of Larsa. They included a new copy of the Lament for Sumer and Ur.

===The Royal Tomb Excavation===
When the Royal Tombs at Ur were discovered, their size was unknown. Excavators started digging two trenches in the middle of the desert to see if they could find anything that would allow them to keep digging. They split into two teams – A and team B. Both teams spent the first few months digging a trench and found evidence of burial grounds by collecting small pieces of golden jewelry and pottery. This was called the &quot;gold trench&quot;. After the first season of digging finished, Woolley returned to England. In Autumn, Woolley returned and started the second season. By the end of the second season, he had uncovered a courtyard surrounded by many rooms. In their third season of digging archaeologists had uncovered their biggest find yet, a building that was believed to have been constructed by order of the king, and a second building thought to be where the high priestess lived. As the fourth and fifth season came to a close, they had discovered so many items that most of their time was now spent recording the objects they found instead of actually digging objects. Items included gold jewelry, clay pots and stones. One of the most significant objects was the Standard of Ur. By the end of their sixth season they had excavated 1850 burial sites and deemed 17 of them to be &quot;Royal Tombs&quot;. Some clay sealings and cuneiform tablet fragment were found in an underlying layer.

Woolley finished his work excavating the Royal Tombs in 1934, uncovering a series of burials. Many servants were killed and buried with the royals, who he believed went to their deaths willingly. Computerized tomography scans on some of the surviving skulls have shown signs that they were killed by blows to the head that could be from the spiked end of a copper axe, which showed Woolley&#x27;s initial theory of mass suicide via poison to be incorrect.
Inside Puabi&#x27;s tomb there was a chest in the middle of the room. Underneath that chest was a hole in the ground that led to what was called the &quot;King&#x27;s Grave&quot;: PG-789. It was believed to be the king&#x27;s grave because it was buried next to the queen. In this grave, there were 63 attendants who were all equipped with copper helmets and swords. It is thought to be his army buried with him. Another large room was uncovered, PG-1237, called the &quot;Great death pit&quot;. This large room had 74 bodies, 68 of which were women. This was based on artifacts found with the bodies, weapons and whetstones in the case of males and simple, non-gold, jewelry in the case of females. There is some debate about the gender of one body. Two large ram statues were found in PG-1237 which are believed to be the remains of lyres. Several lyres were found just outside the entrance. The bodies were found to have perimortem blunt force injuries which caused their death. They also had skeleton markers for long term manual labor.

Most of the treasures excavated at Ur are in the British Museum, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the Baghdad Museum. At the Penn Museum the exhibition &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Ancient Past&quot;, which includes many of the most famous pieces from the Royal Tombs, opened to visitors in late Spring 2011. Previously, the Penn Museum had sent many of its best pieces from Ur on tour in an exhibition called &quot;Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur.&quot; It traveled to eight American museums, including those in Cleveland, Washington and Dallas, ending the tour at the Detroit Institute of Art in May 2011.

Samples from two stratigraphic layers in the royal cemetery area, from before the royal burials, have been radiocarbon dated. The ED Ia layer dated to c. 2900 BC and the ED Ic layer to c. 2679 BC.

==Current status and perservation==
Though some of the areas that were cleared during modern excavations have sanded over again, the Great Ziggurat is fully cleared and stands as the best-preserved and most visible landmark at the site. The famous Royal tombs, also called the Neo-Sumerian Mausolea, located about south-east of the Great Ziggurat in the corner of the wall that surrounds the city, are nearly totally cleared. Parts of the tomb area appear to be in need of structural consolidation or stabilization.

There are cuneiform (Sumerian writing) on many walls, some entirely covered in script stamped into the mud-bricks. The text is sometimes difficult to read, but it covers most surfaces. Modern graffiti has also found its way to the graves, usually in the form of names made with coloured pens (sometimes they are carved).

The Great Ziggurat itself has far more graffiti, mostly lightly carved into the bricks. The graves are completely empty. A small number of the tombs are accessible. Most of them have been cordoned off. The whole site is covered with pottery debris, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to set foot anywhere without stepping on some. Some have colours and paintings on them. Some of the &quot;mountains&quot; of broken pottery are debris that has been removed from excavations.

Pottery debris and human remains form many of the walls of the royal tombs area. In May 2009, the United States Army returned the Ur site to the Iraqi authorities, who hope to develop it as a tourist destination.

Since 2009, the non-profit organization Global Heritage Fund (GHF) has been working to protect and preserve Ur against the problems of erosion, neglect, inappropriate restoration, war and conflict. GHF&#x27;s stated goal for the project is to create an informed and scientifically grounded Master Plan to guide the long-term conservation and management of the site, and to serve as a model for the stewardship of other sites.

Since 2013, the institution for Development Cooperation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs DGCS and the SBAH, the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage of the Iraqi Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, have started a cooperation project for &quot;The Conservation and Maintenance of Archaeological site of UR&quot;. In the framework of this cooperation agreement, the executive plan, with detailed drawings, is in progress for the maintenance of the Dublamah Temple (design concluded, works starting), the Royal Tombs—Mausolea 3rd Dynasty (in progress)—and the Ziqqurat (in progress). The first updated survey in 2013 has produced a new aerial map derived by the flight of a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operated in March 2014. This is the first high-resolution map, derived from more than 100 aerial photograms, with an accuracy of 20 cm or less. A preview of the ortho-photomap of Archaeological Site of Ur is available online.

==List of rulers==

The &quot;Sumerian King List (SKL)&quot; gives a list of only thirteen rulers from three dynasties of Ur. The once supposed second dynasty of Ur may have never existed. The first dynasty of Ur may have been preceded by one other dynasty of Ur (the &quot;Kalam dynasty&quot;) unnamed on the &quot;SKL&quot;—which had extensive influence over the area of Sumer and apparently led a union of south Mesopotamian polities. This predynastic period of Ur may include at least two rulers out of the first eight on this list (Meskalamdug and Akalamdug). The following list should not be considered complete:
