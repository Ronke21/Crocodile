<text>Theravāda (; &#x27;School of the Elders&#x27;; ) is the most commonly accepted name of Buddhism&#x27;s oldest existing school. The school&#x27;s adherents, termed Theravādins (anglicized from Pali &quot;theravādī&quot;), have preserved their version of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s teaching or &quot;Dhamma&quot; in the Pāli Canon for over two millennia.

The Pāli Canon is the most complete Buddhist canon surviving in a classical Indian language, Pāli, which serves as the school&#x27;s sacred language and &quot;lingua franca&quot;. In contrast to Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, Theravāda tends to be conservative in matters of doctrine (&quot;pariyatti&quot;) and monastic discipline (&quot;vinaya&quot;). One element of this conservatism is the fact that Theravāda rejects the authenticity of the Mahayana sutras (which appeared onwards). Consequently, Theravāda generally does not recognize the existence of many Buddhas and bodhisattvas believed by the Mahāyāna school, such as Amitābha and Vairocana, because they are not found in their scriptures.

Theravāda derives from Indian Sthavira nikāya (an early Buddhist school). This tradition later began to develop significantly in India and Sri Lanka from the 3rd century BCE onwards, particularly with the establishment of the Pāli Canon in its written form and the development of its commentarial literature. From both India, as its historical origin, and Sri Lanka, as its principal center of development, the Theravāda tradition subsequently spread to Southeast Asia, where it became the dominant form of Buddhism. Theravāda is the official religion of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Cambodia, and the main dominant Buddhist variant found in Laos and Thailand. It is practiced by minorities in India, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, North Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan. The diaspora of all of these groups, as well as converts around the world, also embrace and practice Theravāda Buddhism.

During the modern era, new developments have included Buddhist modernism, the Vipassana movement which reinvigorated Theravāda meditation practice, the growth of the Thai Forest Tradition which reemphasized forest monasticism and the spread of Theravāda westward to places such as India and Nepal, along with Buddhist immigrants and converts in the European Union and in the United States.

==History==
===Pre-modern===
The Theravāda school descends from the Vibhajjavāda, a division within the Sthāvira nikāya, one of the two major orders that arose after the first schism in the Indian Buddhist community. Theravāda sources trace their tradition to the Third Buddhist council when elder Moggaliputta-Tissa is said to have compiled the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot;, an important work which lays out the Vibhajjavāda doctrinal position.

Aided by the patronage of Mauryan kings like Ashoka, this school spread throughout India and reached Sri Lanka through the efforts of missionary monks like Mahinda. In Sri Lanka, it became known as the Tambapaṇṇiya (and later as Mahāvihāravāsins) which was based at the Great Vihara (Mahavihara) in Anuradhapura (the ancient Sri Lankan capital). According to Theravāda sources, another one of the Ashokan missions was also sent to &quot;Suvaṇṇabhūmi&quot; (&quot;The Golden Land&quot;), which may refer to Southeast Asia.

By the first century BCE, Theravāda Buddhism was well established in the main settlements of the Kingdom of Anuradhapura. The Pali Canon, which contains the main scriptures of the Theravāda, was committed to writing in the first century BCE. Throughout the history of ancient and medieval Sri Lanka, Theravāda was the main religion of the Sinhalese people and its temples and monasteries were patronized by the Sri Lankan kings, who saw themselves as the protectors of the religion.

Over time, two other sects split off from the Mahāvihāra tradition, the Abhayagiri and Jetavana. While the Abhayagiri sect became known for the syncretic study of Mahayana and Vajrayana texts, as well as the Theravāda canon, the Mahāvihāra tradition did not accept these new scriptures. Instead, Mahāvihāra scholars like Buddhaghosa focused on the exegesis of the Pali scriptures and on the Abhidhamma. These Theravāda sub-sects often came into conflict with each other over royal patronage. The reign of Parākramabāhu I (1153–1186) saw an extensive reform of the Sri Lankan sangha after years of warfare on the island. Parākramabāhu created a single unified sangha which came to be dominated by the Mahāvihāra sect.

Epigraphical evidence has established that Theravāda Buddhism became a dominant religion in the Southeast Asian kingdoms of Sri Ksetra and Dvaravati from about the 5th century CE onwards. The oldest surviving Buddhist texts in the Pāli language are gold plates found at Sri Ksetra dated circa the 5th to 6th century. Before the Theravāda tradition became the dominant religion in Southeast Asia, Mahāyāna, Vajrayana and Hinduism were also prominent.

Starting at around the 11th century, Sinhalese Theravāda monks and Southeast Asian elites led a widespread conversion of most of mainland Southeast Asia to the Theravādin Mahavihara school. The patronage of monarchs such as the Burmese king Anawrahta (Pali: Aniruddha, 1044–1077) and the Thai king Ram Khamhaeng (floruit. late 13th century) was instrumental in the rise of Theravāda Buddhism as the predominant religion of Burma and Thailand.

Burmese and Thai kings saw themselves as Dhamma Kings and as protectors of the Theravāda faith. They promoted the building of new temples, patronized scholarship, monastic ordinations and missionary works as well as attempted to eliminate certain non-Buddhist practices like animal sacrifices. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Theravāda also became established as the state religion in Cambodia and Laos. In Cambodia, numerous Hindu and Mahāyāna temples, most famously Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, were transformed into Theravādin monasteries.

===Modern history===

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Theravāda Buddhists came into direct contact with western ideologies, religions and modern science. The various responses to this encounter have been called &quot;Buddhist modernism&quot;. In the British colonies of Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) and Burma (Myanmar), Buddhist institutions lost their traditional role as the prime providers of education (a role that was often filled by Christian schools). In response to this, Buddhist organizations were founded which sought to preserve Buddhist scholarship and provide a Buddhist education. Anagarika Dhammapala, Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera and Henry Steel Olcott (one of the first American western converts to Buddhism) were some of the main figures of the Sri Lankan Buddhist revival. Two new monastic orders were formed in the 19th century, the Amarapura Nikāya and the Rāmañña Nikāya.

In Burma, an influential modernist figure was king Mindon Min (1808–1878), known for his patronage of the Fifth Buddhist council (1871) and the Tripiṭaka tablets at Kuthodaw Pagoda (still the world&#x27;s largest book) with the intention of preserving the Buddha Dhamma. Burma also saw the growth of the &quot;Vipassana movement&quot;, which focused on reviving Buddhist meditation and doctrinal learning. Ledi Sayadaw (1846–1923) was one of the key figures in this movement. After independence, Myanmar held the Sixth Buddhist council (Vesak 1954 to Vesak 1956) to create a new redaction of the Pāli Canon, which was then published by the government in 40 volumes. The Vipassana movement continued to grow after independence, becoming an international movement with centers around the world. Influential meditation teachers of the post-independence era include U Narada, Mahasi Sayadaw, Sayadaw U Pandita, Nyanaponika Thera, Webu Sayadaw, U Ba Khin and his student S.N. Goenka.

Meanwhile, in Thailand (the only Theravāda nation to retain its independence throughout the colonial era), the religion became much more centralized, bureaucratized and controlled by the state after a series of reforms promoted by Thai kings of the Chakri dynasty. King Mongkut (r. 1851–1868) and his successor Chulalongkorn (1868–1910) were especially involved in centralizing sangha reforms. Under these kings, the sangha was organized into a hierarchical bureaucracy led by the Sangha Council of Elders (Pali: &quot;Mahāthera Samāgama&quot;), the highest body of the Thai sangha. Mongkut also led the creation of a new monastic order, the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, which kept a stricter monastic discipline than the rest of the Thai sangha (this included not using money, not storing up food and not taking milk in the evening). The Dhammayuttika movement was characterized by an emphasis on the original Pali Canon and a rejection of Thai folk beliefs which were seen as irrational. Under the leadership of Prince Wachirayan Warorot, a new education and examination system was introduced for Thai monks.

The 20th century also saw the growth of &quot;forest traditions&quot; which focused on forest living and strict monastic discipline. The main forest movements of this era are the Sri Lankan Forest Tradition and the Thai Forest Tradition, founded by Ajahn Mun (1870–1949) and his students.

Theravāda Buddhism in Cambodia and Laos went through similar experiences in the modern era. Both had to endure French colonialism, destructive civil wars and oppressive communist governments. Under French Rule, French indologists of the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient became involved in the reform of Buddhism, setting up institutions for the training of Cambodian and Lao monks, such as the Ecole de Pali which was founded in Phnom Penh in 1914&quot;.&quot; While the Khmer Rouge effectively destroyed Cambodia&#x27;s Buddhist institutions, after the end of the communist regime the Cambodian Sangha was re-established by monks who had returned from exile. In contrast, communist rule in Laos was less destructive since the Pathet Lao sought to make use of the sangha for political ends by imposing direct state control. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the official attitudes toward Buddhism began to liberalise in Laos and there was a resurgence of traditional Buddhist activities such as merit-making and doctrinal study.

The modern era also saw the spread of Theravāda Buddhism around the world and the revival of the religion in places where it remains a minority faith. Some of the major events of the spread of modern Theravāda include:

*The 20th-century Nepalese Theravāda movement which introduced Theravāda Buddhism to Nepal and was led by prominent figures such as Dharmaditya Dharmacharya, Mahapragya, Pragyananda and Dhammalok Mahasthavir.
*The establishment of some of the first Theravāda Viharas in the Western world, such as the London Buddhist Vihara (1926), Das Buddhistische Haus in Berlin (1957) and the Washington Buddhist Vihara in Washington, DC (1965).
*The founding of the Bengal Buddhist Association (1892) and the Dharmankur Vihar (1900) in Calcutta by the Bengali monk Kripasaran Mahasthavir, which were key events in the Bengali Theravāda revival.
*The founding of the Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 by Anagarika Dharmapala which focused on the conservation and restoration of important Indian Buddhist sites, such as Bodh Gaya and Sarnath. 
*The introduction of Theravāda to other Southeast Asian nations like Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. Especially with Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda missionary efforts among English-speaking Chinese communities. In addition, the establishment of the Indonesian Theravāda Saṅgha in 1976 and the Malaysian Theravāda Buddhist Council in 2012 also signaled the revival of Theravāda in both countries.
*The return of Western Theravādin monks trained in the Thai Forest Tradition to western countries and the subsequent founding of monasteries led by western monastics, such as Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery, Chithurst Buddhist Monastery, Metta Forest Monastery, Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, Birken Forest Buddhist Monastery, Bodhinyana Monastery and Santacittarama.
*The spread of the Vipassana movement around the world by the efforts of people like Mother Sayamagyi, S.N. Goenka, Anagarika Munindra, Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzberg, Dipa Ma, and Ruth Denison.
*The Vietnamese Theravāda movement, led by figures such as Ven. Hộ-Tông (Vansarakkhita).

==Texts==

=== Pāli Tipiṭaka ===


According to Kate Crosby, for Theravāda, the Pāli Tipiṭaka, also known as the Pāli Canon is &quot;the highest authority on what constitutes the Dhamma (the truth or teaching of the Buddha) and the organization of the Sangha (the community of monks and nuns).&quot;

The language of the Tipiṭaka, Pāli, is a middle-Indic language which is the main religious and scholarly language in Theravāda. This language may have evolved out of various Indian dialects, and is related to, but not the same as, the ancient language of Magadha.

An early form of the Tipiṭaka may have been transmitted to Sri Lanka during the reign of Ashoka, which saw a period of Buddhist missionary activity. After being orally transmitted (as was the custom for religious texts in those days) for some centuries, the texts were finally committed to writing in the 1st century BCE. Theravāda is one of the first Buddhist schools to commit its Tipiṭaka to writing. The recension of the Tipiṭaka which survives today is that of the Sri Lankan Mahavihara sect.

The oldest manuscripts of the Tipiṭaka from Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia date to the 15th Century, and they are incomplete. Complete manuscripts of the four Nikayas are only available from the 17th Century onwards. However, fragments of the Tipiṭaka have been found in inscriptions from Southeast Asia, the earliest of which have been dated to the 3rd or 4th century. According to Alexander Wynne, &quot;they agree almost exactly with extant Pāli manuscripts. This means that the Pāli Tipiṭaka has been transmitted with a high degree of accuracy for well over 1,500 years.&quot;

There are numerous editions of the Tipiṭaka, some of the major modern editions include the Pali Text Society edition (published in Roman script), the Burmese Sixth Council edition (in Burmese script, 1954–56) and the Thai Tipiṭaka edited and published in Thai script after the council held during the reign of Rama VII (1925–35). There is also a Khmer edition, published in Phnom Penh (1931–69).

The Pāli Tipitaka consists of three parts: the Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Of these, the Abhidhamma Pitaka is believed to be a later addition to the collection, its composition dating from around the 3rd century BCE onwards. The Pāli Abhidhamma was not recognized outside the Theravāda school. There are also some texts which were late additions that are included in the fifth Nikaya, the &quot;Khuddaka Nikāya&quot; (&#x27;Minor Collection&#x27;), such as the &quot;Paṭisambhidāmagga&quot; (possibly c. 3rd to 1st century BCE) and the &quot;Buddhavaṃsa&quot; (c. 1st and 2nd century BCE).

The main parts of the Sutta Pitaka and some portions of the Vinaya show considerable overlap in content with the Agamas, the parallel collections used by non-Theravāda schools in India which are preserved in Chinese and partially in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Tibetan, as well as the various non-Theravāda Vinayas. On this basis, these Early Buddhist texts (i.e. the Nikayas and parts of the Vinaya) are generally believed to be some of the oldest and most authoritative sources on the doctrines of pre-sectarian Buddhism by modern scholars.

Much of the material in the earlier portions is not specifically &quot;Theravādan&quot;, but the collection of teachings that this school&#x27;s adherents preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, while the Theravādans may have added texts to their Tipiṭaka (such as the Abhidhamma texts and so on), they generally did not tamper with the earlier material.

The historically later parts of the canon, mainly the Abhidhamma and some parts of the Vinaya, contain some distinctive elements and teachings which are unique to the Theravāda school and often differ from the Abhidharmas or Vinayas of other early Buddhist schools. For example, while the Theravāda Vinaya contains a total of 227 monastic rules for bhikkhus, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya (used in East Asian Buddhism) has a total of 253 rules for bhikkhus (though the overall structure is the same). These differences arose from the systematization and historical development of doctrines and monasticism in the centuries after the death of the Buddha.

The Abhidhamma-pitaka contains &quot;a restatement of the doctrine of the Buddha in strictly formalized language.&quot; Its texts present a new method, the Abhidhamma method, which attempts to build a single consistent philosophical system (in contrast with the suttas, which present numerous teachings given by the Buddha to particular individuals according to their needs). Because the Abhidhamma focuses on analyzing the internal lived experience of beings and the intentional structure of consciousness, it has often been compared to a kind of phenomenological psychology by numerous modern scholars such as Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi and Alexander Piatigorsky.

The Theravāda school has traditionally held the doctrinal position that the canonical Abhidhamma Pitaka was actually taught by the Buddha himself. Modern scholarship in contrast, has generally held that the Abhidhamma texts date from the 3rd century BCE onwards. However some scholars, such as Frauwallner, also hold that the early Abhidhamma texts developed out of exegetical and catechetical work which made use of doctrinal lists which can be seen in the suttas, called &quot;matikas.&quot;

===Non-canonical literature===
There are numerous Theravāda works which are important for the tradition even though they are not part of the Tipiṭaka. Perhaps the most important texts apart from the Tipiṭaka are the works of the influential scholar Buddhaghosa (4th–5th century CE), known for his Pāli commentaries (which were based on older Sri Lankan commentaries of the Mahavihara tradition). He is also the author of a very important compendium of Theravāda doctrine, the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;. Other figures like Dhammapala and Buddhadatta also wrote Theravāda commentaries and other works in Pali during the time of Buddhaghosa. While these texts do not have the same scriptural authority in Theravāda as the Tipiṭaka, they remain influential works for the exegesis of the Tipiṭaka.

An important genre of Theravādin literature is shorter handbooks and summaries, which serve as introductions and study guides for the larger commentaries. Two of the more influential summaries are Sariputta Thera&#x27;s &quot;Pālimuttakavinayavinicchayasaṅgaha,&quot; a summary of Buddhaghosa&#x27;s Vinaya commentary and Anuruddha&#x27;s &quot;Abhidhammaṭṭhasaṅgaha&quot; (a &quot;Manual of Abhidhamma&quot;).

Throughout the history of Theravāda, Theravāda monks also produced other works of Pāli literature such as historical chronicles (like the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; and the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;), hagiographies, poetry, Pāli grammars, and &quot;sub-commentaries&quot; (that is, commentaries on the commentaries).

While Pāli texts are symbolically and ritually important for many Theravādins, most people are likely to access Buddhist teachings through vernacular literature, oral teachings, sermons, art and performance as well as films and Internet media. According to Kate Crosby, &quot;there is a far greater volume of Theravāda literature in vernacular languages than in Pāli.&quot;

An important genre of Theravādin literature, in both Pāli and vernacular languages, are the Jataka tales, stories of the Buddha&#x27;s past lives. They are very popular among all classes and are rendered in a wide variety of media formats, from cartoons to high literature. The Vessantara Jātaka is one of the most popular of these.

=== Other Buddhist texts ===
Most Theravāda Buddhists generally consider Mahāyāna Buddhist scriptures to be apocryphal, meaning that they are not authentic words of the Buddha. Consequently, Theravādin generally does not recognize the existence of many Buddhas and bodhisattvas believed by the &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; school, such as Amitābha and Vairocana, because they are not found in the canonical scriptures.

==Doctrine (&quot;pariyatti&quot;)==
=== Core teachings ===
The core of Theravāda Buddhist doctrine is contained in the Pāli Canon, the only complete collection of Early Buddhist Texts surviving in a classical Indic language. These basic Buddhist ideas are shared by the other Early Buddhist schools as well as by Mahayana traditions. They include central concepts such as: 
*A doctrine of action (karma), which is based on intention (&quot;cetana&quot;) and a related doctrine of rebirth which holds that after death, sentient beings which are not fully awakened will transmigrate to another body, possibly in another realm of existence. The type of realm one will be reborn in is determined by the being&#x27;s past karma. This cyclical universe filled with birth and death is named samsara. 
*A rejection of other doctrines and practices found in Brahmanical Hinduism, including the idea that the Vedas are a divine authority. Any form of sacrifices to the gods (including animal sacrifices) and ritual purification by bathing are considered useless and spiritually corrupted. The Pāli texts also reject the idea that castes are divinely ordained.
*A set of major teachings called the &quot;bodhipakkhiyādhammā&quot; (factors conducive to awakening).
*Descriptions of various meditative practices or states, namely the four &quot;jhanas&quot; (meditative absorptions) and the formless dimensions (&quot;arupāyatana&quot;).
*Ethical training (&quot;sila&quot;) including the ten courses of wholesome action and the five precepts. 
*Nirvana (Pali: &quot;nibbana&quot;), the highest good and final goal in Theravāda Buddhism. It is the complete and final end of suffering, a state of perfection. It is also the end of all rebirth, but it is &quot;not&quot; an annihilation (&quot;uccheda&quot;).
*The corruptions or influxes (&quot;āsavas&quot;), such as the corruption of sensual pleasures (&quot;kāmāsava&quot;), existence-corruption (&quot;bhavāsava&quot;), and ignorance-corruption (&quot;avijjāsava&quot;).
*The doctrine of impermanence (&quot;anicca&quot;), which holds that all physical and mental phenomena are transient, unstable and inconstant.
*The doctrine of not-self (&quot;anatta&quot;), which holds that all the constituents of a person, namely, the five aggregates (physical form, feelings, perceptions, intentions and consciousness), are empty of a self (&quot;atta&quot;), since they are impermanent and not always under our control. Therefore, there is no unchanging substance, permanent self, soul, or essence.
*The Five hindrances (&quot;pañca nīvaraṇāni&quot;), which are obstacles to meditation: (1) sense desire, (2) hostility, (3) sloth and torpor, (4) restlessness and worry and (5) doubt.
*The Four Divine Abodes (&quot;brahmavihārā&quot;), also known as the four immeasurables (&quot;appamaññā&quot;) 
*The Four Noble Truths, which state, in brief: (1) There is &quot;dukkha&quot; (suffering, unease); (2) There is a cause of dukkha, mainly craving (&quot;tanha&quot;); (3) The removal of craving leads to the end (&quot;nirodha&quot;) of suffering, and (4) there is a path (&quot;magga&quot;) to follow to bring this about.
*The framework of Dependent Arising (&quot;paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;), which explains how suffering arises (beginning with ignorance and ending in birth, old age and death) and how suffering can be brought to an end.
*The Middle Way, which is seen as having two major facets. First, it is a middle path between extreme asceticism and sensual indulgence. It is also seen as a middle view between the idea that at death beings are annihilated and the idea that there is an eternal self (Pali: &quot;atta&quot;). 
*The Noble Eightfold Path, one of the main outlines of the Buddhist path to awakening. The eight factors are: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Samadhi. 
*The practice of taking refuge in the &quot;Triple Gems&quot;: the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha.
*The Seven Aids to Awakening (&quot;satta bojjhaṅgā&quot;): mindfulness (&quot;sati&quot;), investigation (&quot;dhamma vicaya&quot;), energy (&quot;viriya&quot;), bliss (&quot;pīti&quot;)&quot;,&quot; relaxation (&quot;passaddhi&quot;), samādhi, and equanimity (&quot;upekkha&quot;). 
*The six sense bases (&quot;saḷāyatana&quot;) and a corresponding theory of Sense impression (&quot;phassa&quot;) and consciousness (&quot;viññana&quot;).
*Various frameworks for the practice of mindfulness (&quot;sati&quot;), mainly, the four &quot;satipatthanas&quot; (establishments of mindfulness) and the 16 elements of &quot;anapanasati&quot; (mindfulness of breathing).

=== Main doctrinal differences with other Buddhist traditions ===

The orthodox standpoints of Theravāda in comparison to other Buddhist schools are presented in the &quot;Kathāvatthu&quot; (&quot;Points of Controversy&quot;), as well as in other works by later commentators like Buddhaghosa.

Traditionally, the Theravāda maintains the following key doctrinal positions, though not all Theravādins agree with the traditional point of view:

*On the philosophy of time, the Theravāda tradition follows philosophical presentism, the view that only present moment phenomena (dhamma) exist, against the eternalist view of the Sarvāstivādin tradition, which held that dhammas exist in all three times – past, present, future.
*The arahant is never a layperson, for they have abandoned the fetters of a layperson, including married life, using money, etc.
*The power (&quot;bala&quot;) of a Buddha is unique and not common to the disciples (&quot;savaka&quot;) or arahants.
*Theravāda Abhidhamma holds that a single thought (&quot;citta&quot;) cannot last as long as a day.
*Theravāda Abhidhamma holds that insight into the four noble truths happens in one moment (&quot;khaṇa&quot;), rather than gradually (&quot;anupubba&quot;), as was held by Sarvastivada. The defilements (&quot;kilesa&quot;) are also abandoned in a single moment, not gradually.
*Theravāda Abhidhamma traditionally rejects the view that there is an intermediate or transitional state (&quot;antarabhāva&quot;) between rebirths, they hold that rebirth happens instantaneously (in one mind moment). However, as has been noted by various modern scholars like Bhikkhu Sujato, there are canonical passages which support the idea of an intermediate state (such as the &quot;Kutuhalasāla Sutta&quot;). Some Theravāda scholars (such as Balangoda Ananda Maitreya) have defended the idea of an intermediate state and it is also a very common belief among some monks and laypersons in the Theravāda world (where it is commonly referred to as the &quot;gandhabba&quot; or &quot;antarabhāva&quot;).
*Theravāda also does not accept the Mahayana notion that there are two forms of nibbana, an inferior &quot;localized&quot; or &quot;abiding&quot; (&quot;pratiṣṭhita&quot;) nirvana and a non-abiding (&quot;apratiṣṭhita&quot;) nirvana. Such a dual nirvana theory is absent in the suttas. According to the &quot;Kathāvatthu&quot;, there can be no dividing line separating the unconditioned element and there is no superiority or inferiority in the unity of nibbana.
*Theravāda exegetical works consider nibbana to be a real existent, instead of just a conceptual or nominal existent (&quot;prajñapti&quot;) referring to the mere destruction (&quot;khayamatta&quot;) of the defilements or non-existence of the five aggregates, as was held by some in the Sautrantika school for example. In Theravāda scholasticism, nibbana is defined as the cessation (&quot;nirodha&quot;) consisting in non-arising and exists separately from the mere destruction of passion, hatred and delusion.
*Theravāda exegetical works, mental phenomena last for a very short moment or instant (&quot;khaṇa&quot;), but physical phenomena do not.
*Theravāda holds that the Buddha resided in the human realm (&quot;manussa-loka&quot;). It rejects the docetic view found in Mahayana, which says that the Buddha&#x27;s physical body was a mere manifestation, emanation or magical creation (&quot;nirmāṇa&quot;) of a transcendental being, and thus, that his birth and death a mere show and unreal. Also, the Theravāda school rejects the view that there are currently numerous Buddhas in all directions. 
*Theravāda holds that there is a ground level of consciousness called the bhavaṅga, which conditions the rebirth consciousness.
*Theravāda rejects the Pudgalavada doctrine of the &quot;pudgala&quot; (&quot;person&quot; or &quot;personal entity&quot;) as being more than a conceptual designation imputed on the five aggregates.
*Theravāda rejects the view of the Lokottaravada schools which held that the all acts done by the Buddha (including all speech, defecation and urination, etc.) were supramundane or transcendental (&quot;lokuttara&quot;). Also, for Theravāda, a Buddha does not have the power to stop something that has arisen from ceasing, they cannot stop a being from getting old, sick or dying, and they cannot create a permanent thing (like a flower that does not die).
*Theravāda traditionally defends the idea that the Buddha himself taught the &quot;Abhidhamma Pitaka&quot;. This is now being questioned by some modern Theravādins in light of modern Buddhist studies scholarship.
*In Theravāda, nibbana is the only unconstructed phenomenon (&quot;asankhata-dhamma, asankhatadhatu).&quot; Unlike in the Sarvāstivāda school, space (&quot;akasa&quot;), is seen as a constructed dhamma in Theravāda. Even the four noble truths are not unconstructed phenomena, neither is the domain of cessation (&quot;nirodhasamapatti&quot;). &quot;Thatness&quot; (&quot;tathatā&quot;) is also a constructed phenomenon. According to the &quot;Dhammasangani&quot;, nibbana, the unconstructed element, is &#x27;without condition&#x27; (&quot;appaccaya&quot;) and is different from the five aggregates which are &#x27;with condition&#x27; (&quot;sappaccaya&quot;).
*In Theravāda, the bodhisatta path is suitable only for a few exceptional people (like Sakyamuni and Metteya). Theravāda also defines a bodhisatta as someone who has made a vow in front of a living Buddha.
*In Theravāda, there is a physical sensory organ (&quot;indriya&quot;) that conditions the mental consciousness (&quot;manovinñāna&quot;) and is the material support for consciousness. Some later Theravāda works like the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; locate this physical basis for consciousness at the heart (&quot;hadaya-vatthu&quot;), the Pali Canon itself is silent on this issue. Some modern Theravāda scholars propose alternative notions. For example, Suwanda H. J. Sugunasiri proposes that the basis for consciousness is the entire physical organism, which he ties with the canonical concept of &quot;jīvitindriya&quot; or life faculty. W. F. Jayasuriya meanwhile, argues that &quot;hadaya&quot; is not meant literally (it can also mean &quot;essence&quot;, &quot;core&quot;), but refers to the entire nervous system (including the brain), which is dependent on the heart and blood. 
*Theravādins generally reject the Mahayana sutras as &quot;Buddhavacana&quot; (word of the Buddha), and do not study or see these texts (or Mahayana doctrines) as reliable sources. They reject the view that the &quot;Tipitaka&quot; is incomplete or inferior (i.e. &quot;Hinayana&quot;) and that Mahayana texts are somehow more advanced.
*Theravādins traditionally believe that an awakened arahant has an &quot;incorruptible nature&quot; and are thus morally perfect. They have no ignorance or doubts. According to Theravāda doctrine, arahants (as well as the other three lesser ariyas: stream enterers etc.) cannot fall back or regress from their state.

=== Abhidhamma philosophy ===

Theravāda scholastics developed a systematic exposition of the Buddhist doctrine called the Abhidhamma. In the Pāli Nikayas, the Buddha teaches through an analytical method in which experience is explained using various conceptual groupings of physical and mental processes, which are called &quot;dhammas&quot;. Examples of lists of dhammas taught by the Buddha include the twelve sense &#x27;spheres&#x27; or ayatanas, the five aggregates or khandha and the eighteen elements of cognition or dhatus.

Theravāda traditionally promotes itself as the &quot;Vibhajjavāda&quot; &quot;teaching of analysis&quot; and as the heirs to the Buddha&#x27;s analytical method. Expanding this model, Theravāda Abhidhamma scholasticism concerned itself with analyzing &quot;ultimate truth&quot; (&quot;paramattha-sacca&quot;) which it sees as being composed of &quot;all possible&quot; dhammas and their relationships. The central theory of the Abhidhamma is thus known as the &quot;dhamma theory&quot;. &quot;Dhamma&quot; has been translated as &quot;factors&quot; (Collett Cox), &quot;psychic characteristics&quot; (Bronkhorst), &quot;psycho-physical events&quot; (Noa Ronkin) and &quot;phenomena&quot; (Nyanaponika Thera).

According to the Sri Lankan scholar Y. Karunadasa, a dhammas (&quot;principles&quot; or &quot;elements&quot;) are &quot;those items that result when the process of analysis is taken to its ultimate limits&quot;. However, this does not mean that they have an independent existence, for it is &quot;only for the purposes of description&quot; that they are postulated. Noa Ronkin defines dhammas as &quot;the constituents of sentient experience; the irreducible &#x27;building blocks&#x27; that make up one&#x27;s world, albeit they are not static mental contents and certainly not substances.&quot; Thus, while in Theravāda Abhidhamma, dhammas are the ultimate constituents of experience, they are not seen as substances, essences or independent particulars, since they are empty (&quot;suñña&quot;) of a self (&quot;attā&quot;) and conditioned. This is spelled out in the &quot;Patisambhidhamagga&quot;, which states that dhammas are empty of svabhava (&quot;sabhavena suññam&quot;).

According to Ronkin, the canonical Pāli Abhidhamma remains pragmatic and psychological, and &quot;does not take much interest in ontology&quot; in contrast with the Sarvastivada tradition. Paul Williams also notes that the Abhidhamma remains focused on the practicalities of insight meditation and leaves ontology &quot;relatively unexplored&quot;. Ronkin does note however that later Theravāda sub-commentaries (&quot;ṭīkā&quot;) do show a doctrinal shift towards ontological realism from the earlier epistemic and practical concerns.

On the other hand, Y. Karunadasa contends that the tradition of realism goes back to the earliest discourses, as opposed to developing only in later Theravada sub-commentaries:

If we base ourselves on the Pali Nikayas, then we should be compelled to conclude that Buddhism is realistic. There is no explicit denial anywhere of the external world. Nor is there any positive evidence to show that the world is mind-made or simply a projection of subjective thoughts. That Buddhism recognizes the extra-mental existence of matter and, the external world is clearly suggested by the texts. Throughout the discourses it is the language of realism that one encounters. The whole Buddhist practical doctrine and discipline, which has the attainment of Nibbana as its final goal, is based on the recognition of the material world and the conscious living beings living therein.

The Theravāda Abhidhamma holds that there is a total of 82 possible types of dhammas, 81 of these are conditioned (&quot;sankhata&quot;), while one is unconditioned, which is &quot;nibbana&quot;. The 81 conditioned dhammas are divided into three broad categories: consciousness (&quot;citta&quot;), associated mentality (&quot;cetasika&quot;) and materiality, or physical phenomena (&quot;rupa&quot;). Since no dhamma exists independently, every single dhamma of consciousness, known as a &quot;citta&quot;, arises associated (&quot;sampayutta&quot;) with at least seven mental factors (&quot;cetasikas&quot;). In Abhidhamma, all awareness events are thus seen as being characterized by intentionality and never exist in isolation. Much of Abhidhamma philosophy deals with categorizing the different consciousnesses and their accompanying mental factors as well as their conditioned relationships (&quot;paccaya&quot;).

=== Cosmology ===

The Pāli Tipiṭaka outlines a hierarchical cosmological system with various planes existence (&quot;bhava&quot;) into which sentient beings may be reborn depending on their past actions. Good actions lead one to the higher realms, bad actions lead to the lower realms. However, even for the gods (&quot;devas&quot;) in the higher realms like Indra, there is still death, loss and suffering.

The main categories of the planes of existence are:

*Arūpa-bhava, the formless or incorporeal plane. These are associated with the four formless meditations, that is: infinite space, infinite consciousness, infinite nothingness and neither perception nor non-perception. Beings in these realms live extremely long lives (thousands of kappas).
*Kāma-bhava, the spiritual plane of desires. This includes numerous realms of existence such as: various hells (&quot;niraya&quot;) which are devoid of happiness, the realms of animals, the hungry ghosts (&quot;peta&quot;), the realm of humans, and various heaven realms where the devas live (such as Tavatimsa and Tusita).
*Rūpa-bhava, the plane of form. The realms in this plane are associated with the four meditative absorptions (&quot;jhanas&quot;) and those who attain these meditations are reborn in these divine realms.

These various planes of existence can be found in countless world systems (&quot;loka-dhatu&quot;), which are born, expand, contract and are destroyed in a cyclical nature across vast expanses of time (measures in kappas). This cosmology is similar to other ancient Indian systems, such as the Jain cosmology. This entire cyclical multiverse of constant birth and death is called samsara. Outside of this system of samsara is &quot;nibbana&quot; (lit. &quot;vanishing, quenching, blowing out&quot;), a deathless (&quot;amata&quot;) and transcendent reality, which is a total and final release (&quot;vimutti&quot;) from all suffering (&quot;dukkha&quot;) and rebirth.

=== Soteriology and Buddhology ===
According to Theravāda doctrine, release from suffering (i.e. &quot;nibbana&quot;) is attained in four stages of awakening (&quot;bodhi&quot;):

# &quot;Stream-Enterers&quot;: Those who have destroyed the first three fetters (the false view of self, doubt/indecision, and clinging to ethics and vows);
# &quot;Once-Returners&quot;: Those who have destroyed the first three fetters and have weakened the fetters of desire and ill-will;
# &quot;Non-Returners&quot;: Those who have destroyed the five lower fetters, which bind beings to the world of the senses;
# &quot;Arahants&quot; (lit. &quot;honorable&quot; or &quot;worthies&quot;): Those who have realized &quot;Nibbana&quot; and are free from all defilements. They have abandoned all ignorance, craving for existence, restlessness (&quot;uddhacca&quot;) and subtle pride (&quot;māna&quot;).

In Theravāda Buddhism, a Buddha is a sentient being who has discovered the path out of samsara by themselves, has reached Nibbana and then makes the path available to others by teaching (known as &quot;turning the wheel of the Dhamma&quot;). A Buddha is also believed to have extraordinary powers and abilities (&quot;abhiññā&quot;), such as the ability to read minds and fly through the air.

The Theravāda canon depicts Gautama Buddha as being the most recent Buddha in a line of previous Buddhas stretching back for aeons. They also mention the future Buddha, named Metteyya. Traditionally, the Theravāda school also rejects the idea that there can be numerous Buddhas active in the world at the same time. 

Regarding the question of how a sentient being becomes a Buddha, the Theravāda school also includes a presentation of this path. Indeed, according to Buddhaghosa, there are three main soteriological paths: the path of the Buddhas (&quot;buddhayāna&quot;); the way of the individual Buddhas (&quot;paccekabuddhayāna&quot;); and the way of the disciples (&quot;sāvakayāna&quot;).

However, unlike in Mahayana Buddhism, the Theravāda holds that the Buddha path is not for everyone and that beings on the Buddha path (&quot;bodhisattas&quot;) are quite rare. While in Mahayana, bodhisattas refers to beings who have developed the wish to become Buddhas, Theravāda (like other early Buddhist schools), defines a bodhisatta as someone who has made a resolution (&quot;abhinīhāra&quot;) to become a Buddha in front of a living Buddha, and has also received a confirmation from that Buddha that they will reach Buddhahood. Dhammapala&#x27;s &quot;Cariyāpiṭaka&quot; is a Theravāda text which focuses on the path of the Buddhas, while the &quot;Nidānakathā&quot; and the &quot;Buddhavaṃsa&quot; are also Theravāda texts which discuss the Buddha path.

=== Modern developments ===
The modern era saw new developments in Theravāda scholarship due to the influence of Western thought. As Donald K. Swearer writes: Although monastic education is still grounded in the study of Buddhist texts, doctrine, and the Pali language, the curricula of monastic colleges and universities also reflect subject matter and disciplines associated with Western education.Buddhist modernist trends can be traced to figures like Anagarika Dhammapala, King Mongkut, and the first prime minister of Burma U Nu. They promoted a form of Buddhism that was compatible with rationalism and science, and opposed to superstition and certain folk practices. Walpola Rahula&#x27;s, &quot;What the Buddha Taught&quot; is seen by scholars as an introduction to modernist Buddhist thought and the book continues to be widely used in universities.

Another modern phenomenon is Buddhist philosophers who received an education in the West, such as K. N. Jayatilleke (a student of Wittgenstein at Cambridge) and Hammalawa Saddhatissa (who received his Phd at Edinburgh), going on to write modern works on Buddhist philosophy (&quot;Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge&quot;, 1963 and &quot;Buddhist Ethics&quot;, 1987 respectively). Henepola Gunaratana is another modern Theravāda scholar who studied philosophy in the west (at the American University). The modern encounter with Christian missionaries also led to new debates (such as the Panadura debate) and doctrinal works written in defense of Buddhism or attacking Christian ideas, such as Gunapala Dharmasiri&#x27;s &quot;A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God&quot; (1988).

There have also been several modern Theravāda scholars which have taken a historical critical perspective on Theravāda literature and doctrine, attempting to understand its historical development. Some of these figures, such as David Kalupahana, Buddhadasa, and Bhikkhu Sujato, have criticized traditional Theravāda commentators like Buddhaghosa for their doctrinal innovations which differ in significant ways from the early Buddhist texts.

The modern era also saw new Buddhist works on topics which pre-modern Buddhists avoided, such as socially engaged Buddhism and Buddhist economics. Thinkers such as Buddhadasa, Sulak Sivaraksa, Prayudh Payutto, Neville Karunatilake and Padmasiri de Silva have written on these topics. Modern scholarship in western languages by western Buddhist monks such as Nyanatiloka, Nyanaponika, Nyanamoli, Bhikkhu Bodhi and Analayo is another recent development in the Theravāda world.

==Practice (&quot;paṭipatti&quot;)==
===Textual basis===
In the Pāli Canon, the path (&quot;magga&quot;) or way (&quot;patipada&quot;) of Buddhist practice is described in various ways, one of the most widely used frameworks in Theravāda is the Noble Eightfold Path:

The Noble Eightfold Path can also be summarized as the Three Noble Disciplines of sīla (moral conduct or discipline), Samādhi (meditation or concentration) and Paññā (understanding or wisdom).

Theravāda orthodoxy takes the seven stages of purification as outlined in the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; as the basic outline of the path to be followed. The &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, a Sinhala Theravāda doctrinal &quot;summa&quot; written in the fifth century by Buddhaghosa, became the orthodox account of the Theravāda path to liberation in Sri Lanka after the 12th century and this influence spread to other Theravāda nations. It gives the sequence of seven purifications, in three sections:
*The first section (part 1) explains the rules of discipline, and the method for finding a correct temple to practice, or how to meet a good teacher.
*The second section (part 2) describes Samatha (calming) practice, object by object (see Kammaṭṭhāna for the list of the forty traditional objects). It mentions different stages of Samādhi.
*The third section (parts 3–7) is a description of the five khandhas, ayatanas, the Four Noble Truths, dependent origination, and the practise of Vipassanā (insight) through the development of wisdom. It emphasizes different forms of knowledge emerging because of the practice. This part shows a great analytical effort specific to Buddhist philosophy.

This basic outline is based on the threefold discipline. The emphasis is on understanding the three marks of existence, which removes ignorance. Understanding destroys the ten fetters and leads to Nibbana.

Theravādins believe that every individual is personally responsible for achieving their own self-awakening and liberation, each being responsible for their own karma (actions and consequences). Applying knowledge acquired through direct experience and personal realization is more heavily emphasized than beliefs about the nature of reality as revealed by the Buddha.

===Moral conduct===
Giving (Dana) is an important Buddhist virtue. The community of monastics is seen as the most meritorious field of karmic fruitfulness.

Sīla, meaning moral conduct, is mainly defined as right speech, right action, and right livelihood. It is primarily understood through the doctrine of kamma. In Theravāda, one&#x27;s previous intentional actions strongly influence one&#x27;s present experience. Whatever intended actions are carried out will have future consequences, whether in this life or subsequent lives. Intention is central to the idea of kamma. Actions done with good intentions, even if they have bad results, will not have negative kammic consequences.

Several sets of precepts or moral trainings (&quot;sikkhāpada&quot;) guide right action. After taking Refuge in the Triple Gems, lay Theravādin Buddhists traditionally take the Five precepts (whether for life or for a limited time) in the presence of Sangha. Laypeople also sometimes take an extended set of Eight precepts, which includes chastity during sacred days of observance such as Uposatha.

Performing good deeds is another important feature of Theravādin Buddhist ethics. Doing so is said to make &quot;merit&quot; (puñña), which results in a better rebirth. The &quot;ten wholesome actions&quot; is a common list of good deeds:

# Generosity (Dāna); This typically involves providing monks with &quot;the four requisites&quot;; food, clothing, shelter, and medicine; however, giving to charity and the needy is also considered dāna.
# Moral conduct (Sīla); Keeping the five precepts and generally refraining from doing harm.
# Meditation (Bhāvanā).
# Dedication of merit; doing good deeds in the name of someone who has passed away or in the name of all sentient beings.
# Rejoicing in merit of good deeds done by others, this is common in communal activities.
# Rendering service to others; looking after others or needy.
# Honoring others; showing appropriate deference, particularly to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, and to seniors and parents. Usually done by placing the hands together in Añjali Mudrā, and sometimes bowing.
# Preaching or sharing the Dhamma; the gift of Dhamma is seen as a form of highest gift. (Dhammapada 354)
# Listening to Dhamma
# Having right view or Sammādiṭṭhi; mainly the Four Noble Truths and the three marks of existence.

===Meditation===

Meditation (Pāli: &quot;Bhāvanā,&quot; literally &quot;causing to become&quot; or cultivation) means the positive cultivation of one&#x27;s mind.

====Forms====
Theravāda Buddhist meditation practice varies considerably in technique and objects. Currently, there are also various traditions of Theravāda meditation practice, such as the Burmese Vipassana tradition, the Thai Forest Tradition, the esoteric &quot;Borān kammaṭṭhāna&quot; (&#x27;ancient practices&#x27;), the Burmese Weikza tradition, Dhammakaya meditation and the Western Insight Meditation movement.

Theravāda Buddhist meditation practices or Bhavana (mental cultivation) are categorized into two broad categories: Samatha bhavana (calming), and Vipassanā bhavana (investigation, insight). Originally these referred to effects or qualities of meditation, but after the time of Buddhaghosa, they also referred to two distinct meditation types or paths (&quot;yāna&quot;).

&quot;Samatha&quot; (&quot;calm&quot;) consists of meditation techniques in which the mind is focused on a single object, thought, or gatha, leading to &quot;Samādhi&quot;&#x27;. In traditional Theravāda it is considered to be the base for &quot;vipassanā&quot; (&quot;insight&quot;). In the Theravāda-tradition, as early as the Pāli Nikayas, the four &quot;jhānas&quot; are regarded as a &quot;samatha&quot;-practice. The eighth and final step of the Eightfold Path, Right Samadhi, is often defined as the four jhanas. In the Pāli Nikayas, Jhānas are described as preceding the awakening insight of the Buddha, which turned him into an awakened being. Yet the interpretation of &quot;jhana&quot; as single-pointed concentration and calm may be a later re-interpretation in which the original aim of &quot;jhana&quot; was lost.

&quot;Vipassana&quot; (&quot;insight&quot;, &quot;clear seeing&quot;) refers to practices that aim to develop an inner understanding or knowledge of the nature of phenomena (&quot;dhammas&quot;), especially the characteristics of &quot;dukkha&quot;, &quot;anatta&quot; and &quot;anicca&quot;, which are seen as being universally applicable to all constructed phenomena (&quot;sankhata-dhammas&quot;). &quot;Vipassana&quot; is also described as insight into dependent origination, the five aggregates, the sense spheres and the Four Noble Truths. It is the primary focus of the modernist Burmese Vipassana movement. In western countries it is complemented with the four divine abidings, the development of loving-kindness and compassion.

&quot;Vipassana&quot; practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of &quot;sila&quot;, morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires. The practitioner then engages in &quot;anapanasati&quot;, mindfulness of breathing, which is described in the Satipatthana Sutta as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then simply to watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short. In the &quot;New Burmese Method&quot; the practitioner pays attention to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in vitaka, noting or naming physical and mental phenomena (&quot;breathing, breathing&quot;), without engaging the phenomenon with conceptual thinking. By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena the meditator becomes aware of how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena, as described in the five &quot;skandhas&quot; and &quot;paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;. The practitioner also becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness. This noticing is accompanied by reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into dukkha, anatta, and anicca. When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general without necessarily naming them.

According to Vajiranāṇa Mahathera, writing from a traditional and text-based point of view, in the Pāli Canon whether one begins the practice by way of samatha or by way of vipassanā is generally seen as depending on one&#x27;s temperament. According to Vajiranāṇa Mahathera, it is generally held that there are two kinds of individuals. Those of a passionate disposition (or those who enter the path by faith) attain Arahatship through vipassanā preceded by samatha. Those of a skeptical disposition (or those who enter by way of wisdom or the intellect) achieve it through samatha preceded by vipassanā.

====Aims of meditation====
Traditionally, the ultimate goal of the practice is to achieve mundane and supramundane wisdom. Mundane wisdom is the insight in the three marks of existence. The development of this insight leads to four supramundane paths and fruits, these experiences consist a direct apprehension of Nibbana. Supramundane (&quot;lokuttara)&quot; wisdom refers to that which transcends the world of samsara.

Apart from nibbana, there are various reasons why traditional Theravāda Buddhism advocates meditation, including a good rebirth, supranormal powers, combating fear and preventing danger. Recent modernist Theravādins have tended to focus on the psychological benefits and psychological well-being.

====Historical development and sources====
The practice of Theravāda meditation can be traced back to the 5th century exegete Buddhaghosa, who systematized the classic Theravāda meditation, dividing them into samatha and vipassana types and listing 40 different forms (known as &quot;kammaṭṭhānas&quot;, &quot;workplaces&quot;) in his magnum opus, the Visuddhimagga. This text has remained central for the study and practice of Theravāda meditation. Buddhaghosa&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Satipatthana sutta&quot; (&quot;Bases of mindfulness discourse&quot;), as well as the source text itself, are also another important source for meditation in this tradition. Buddhaghosa&#x27;s work drew heavily on the Pali suttas as well as the Pali Abhidhamma. Kate Crosby notes that Buddhaghosa&#x27;s work also &quot;explicitly refers to the contemporaneous existence of secret meditation manuals but not to their content.&quot;

Regarding post Visuddhimagga Theravāda meditation, according to Kate Crosby, In the period between the Visuddhimagga and the present, there have been numerous meditation texts, both manuals and descriptive treatises. Many of the texts found in manuscript collections relate to meditation, some on a single, simple subject such as the recollection of the qualities of the Buddha, others more complex. Little research has been done to assess their variety. One difficulty is that meditation manuals as such are often in a mixture of a classical language, that is, Pali, and a vernacular that may or may not be a currently used language. Also, actual manuals often contain prompts or reminders rather than an in-depth explanation. In recent years it has emerged that there is still extant a relatively high number of manuals and related texts pertaining to a system of meditation called – among other things – borān kammaṭṭhāna or yogāvacara. Its core text, the Mūla-kammaṭṭhāna &quot;original, fundamental or basic meditation practice,&quot; circulated under a number of different titles, or without a title, throughout the Tai–Lao–Khmer and Sri Lankan Buddhist worlds. Some versions of this text are simple lists of kammaṭṭhāna and from that perspective look entirely in accord with the Visuddhimagga or Theravada Abhidhamma texts. Other versions contain extensive narratives, explanations of symbolism, and of the somatic locations involved in the practice that make it clear that we are dealing with techniques of practice not described in the Canon or Visuddhimagga.According to Crosby, the esoteric borān kammaṭṭhāna or yogāvacara meditation tradition was the dominant form of meditation in the Theravāda world during the 18th century, and may date as far back as the 16th century. Crosby notes that this tradition of meditation involved a rich collection of symbols, somatic methods and visualizations which included &quot;the physical internalisation or manifestation of aspects of the Theravada path by incorporating them at points in the body between the nostril and navel.&quot; In spite of the novel elements in this meditation tradition, close study of borān kammaṭṭhāna texts reveals that they are closely connected to Theravada Abhidhamma and the works of Buddhaghosa. Modernist reforms which emphasized Pali Canon study, a shift in state support to other traditions and modern wars in Indochina led to this tradition&#x27;s decline, and it now only survives in a few Cambodian and Thai temples. 

During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Theravāda world saw a modernist revival and reinvention of meditation practice, as exemplified by the Burmese Vipassana movement. According to Buswell &quot;vipassana,&quot; &quot;appears to have fallen out of practice&quot; by the 10th century, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of &quot;Maitreya&quot;. The practice was revived in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728–1816) and by later figures such as Ledi Sayadaw and Mahāsī Sayadaw during the 19th and 20th centuries. These Burmese figures re-invented &quot;vipassana&quot;-meditation and developed simplified meditation techniques, based on the &quot;Satipatthana sutta&quot;, the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, and other texts, emphasizing &quot;satipatthana&quot; and bare insight. These techniques were globally popularized by the Vipassana movement in the second half of the 20th century.

Similar revival movements developed in Thailand, such as the Thai forest tradition and Dhammakaya meditation. These traditions are influenced by the older borān kammaṭṭhāna forms. Thailand and Cambodia also saw attempts to preserve and revive the ancient &quot;borān kammaṭṭhāna&quot; tradition of meditation. In Sri Lanka, the new Buddhist traditions of the Amarapura and Rāmañña Nikāyas developed their own meditation forms based on the Pali Suttas, the Visuddhimagga, and other manuals, while borān kammaṭṭhāna mostly disappeared by the end of the 19th century.

Though the &quot;Vipassana movement&quot; has popularised meditation both in traditional Theravāda countries among the laity, and in western countries, &quot;meditation plays a minor if not negligible role in the lives of the majority of Theravāda monks.&quot; Meditation is especially popular laypersons, especially during special religious holidays or in their old age, when they have more free time to spend at the temple. Buddhist modernists tend to present Buddhism as rational and scientific, and this has also affected how Vipassana meditation has been taught and presented. This has led in some quarters to a playing down of older non-empirical elements of Theravāda, associated with &#x27;superstition&#x27;. Strains of older, traditional Theravāda meditation known as &quot;borān kammaṭṭhāna&quot; still exist, but this tradition has mostly been eclipsed by the Buddhist modernist meditation movements.

=== Other practices ===

Laypersons and monks also perform various types of religious practices daily or during Buddhist holidays. One of these is keeping a Buddhist shrine with a picture or statue of the Buddha for devotional practice in one&#x27;s home, mirroring the larger shrines at temples. It is common to offer candles, incense, flowers and other objects to these shrine. Gestures of respect are also done in front of Buddha images and shrines, mainly the respectful salutation with the hands (&quot;añjalikamma&quot;), and the five-limb prostration (&quot;pañc&#x27;anga-vandana&quot;).

Buddhist forms of chanting is also widely practiced by both monks and laypersons, who may recite famous phrases such as the taking of refuge, the Metta Sutta and the Mangala Sutta in front of their shrine. Chanting may also be part of the practice of recollection (anussati), which refers to contemplating various topics such as the sublime qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha or the five subjects for daily recollection. This may be done as part of a daily puja ritual.

Another important religious practice for the devout is the keeping of special religious holidays known as Uposatha which are based on a lunar calendar. Laypersons commonly take the eight precepts while visiting a temple or monastery and commit to focusing on Buddhist practice for the day.

Study (&quot;ganthadhura&quot;) of the Buddhist texts and listening to Dhamma talks by monks or teachers are also important practices.

==Lay and monastic life==

===Distinction between lay and monastic life===
Traditionally, Theravāda Buddhism has observed a distinction between the practices suitable for a lay person and the practices undertaken by ordained monks (in ancient times, there was a separate body of practices for nuns). While the possibility of significant attainment by laymen is not entirely disregarded by the Theravāda, it generally occupies a position of less prominence than in the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna traditions, with monastic life being hailed as a superior method of achieving Nibbana. The view that Theravāda, unlike other Buddhist schools, is primarily a monastic tradition has, however, been disputed.
This distinction between ordained monks and laypeople – as well as the distinction between those practices advocated by the Pāli Canon, and the folk religious elements embraced by many monks – have motivated some scholars to consider Theravāda Buddhism to be composed of multiple separate traditions, overlapping though still distinct. Most prominently, the anthropologist Melford Spiro in his work &quot;Buddhism and Society&quot; separated Burmese Theravāda into three groups: Apotropaic Buddhism (concerned with providing protection from evil spirits), Kammatic Buddhism (concerned with making merit for a future birth), and Nibbanic Buddhism (concerned with attaining the liberation of Nibbana, as described in the Tipitaka). He stresses that all three are firmly rooted in the Pāli Canon. These categories are not accepted by all scholars, and are usually considered non-exclusive by those who employ them.

The role of lay people has traditionally been primarily occupied with activities that are commonly termed &quot;merit-making&quot; (falling under Spiro&#x27;s category of kammatic Buddhism). Merit-making activities include offering food and other basic necessities to monks, making donations to temples and monasteries, burning incense or lighting candles before images of the Buddha, chanting protective or scriptural verses from the Pali Canon, building roads and bridges, charity to the needy and providing drinking water to strangers along roadside. Some lay practitioners have always chosen to take a more active role in religious affairs, while still maintaining their lay status. Dedicated lay men and women sometimes act as trustees or custodians for their temples, taking part in the financial planning and management of the temple. Others may volunteer significant time in tending to the mundane needs of local monks (by cooking, cleaning, maintaining temple facilities, etc.). Study of the Pāli scriptures and the practice of meditation are less common among the lay community in the past, though in the 20th century these areas have become more popular to the lay community, especially in Thailand.
A number of senior monastics in the Thai Forest Tradition, including Buddhadasa, Ajahn Maha Bua, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Ajahn Pasanno, and Ajahn Jayasaro, have begun teaching meditation retreats outside of the monastery for lay disciples. Ajahn Sumedho, a disciple of Ajahn Chah, founded the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in Hertfordshire, which has a retreat center specifically for lay retreats. Sumedho extended this to Harnham in Northumberland as Aruna Ratanagiri under the present guidance of Ajahn Munindo, another disciple of Ajahn Chah.

===Lay devotee===

In Pāli the word for a male lay devotee is Upasaka and a female devotee is Upasika. One of the duties of the lay followers, as taught by the Buddha, is to look after the needs of the monk/nuns. They are to see that the monk/nuns do not suffer from lack of the four requisites: food, clothing, shelter and medicine. As neither monks nor nuns are allowed to have an occupation, they depend entirely on the laity for their sustenance. In return for this charity, they are expected to lead exemplary lives.

In Myanmar and Thailand, the monastery was and is still regarded as a seat of learning. Theravādin monasteries have been providing free education to many children since ancient times. In fact, today about half of the primary schools in Thailand are located in monasteries. Religious rituals and ceremonies held in a monastery are always accompanied by social activities. In times of crisis, it is to the monks that people bring their problems for counsel and monks often took up the role of mediators in most disputes. Traditionally, a ranking monk will deliver a sermon four times a month: when the moon waxes and wanes and the day before the new and full moons. The laity also have a chance to learn meditation from the monks during these times.

It is also possible for a lay disciple to become enlightened. As Bhikkhu Bodhi notes, &quot;The Suttas and commentaries do record a few cases of lay disciples attaining the final goal of Nirvana. However, such disciples either attain Arahantship on the brink of death or enter the monastic order soon after their attainment. They do not continue to dwell at home as Arahant householders, for dwelling at home is incompatible with the state of one who has severed all craving.&quot;

In the modern era, it is now common for lay disciples to practice meditation, attend lay meditation centers and even aim for awakening. The impetus for this trend began in Myanmar and was supported by prime minister U Nu who himself established the International Meditation Center (IMC) in Yangon. Modern lay teachers such as U Ba Khin (who was also the Accountant General of the Union of Burma) promoted meditation as part of a laypersons daily routine. According to Donald K Swearer, another development in modern Theravāda is &quot;the formation of lay Buddhist associations that have partially assumed the social service responsibilities formerly associated with the monastery&quot;. These include social service and activist organizations such as the Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist Association of Colombo, the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, the Sarvodaya Shramadana of A. T. Ariyaratne, the NGO&#x27;s founded by Sulak Sivaraksa such as Santi Pracha.

===Monastic vocation===

Theravāda sources dating back to medieval Sri Lanka (2nd century BCE to 10th century CE) such as the Mahavamsa show that monastic roles in the tradition were often seen as being in a polarity between urban monks (Sinhala: , Pāli: &quot;gāmavasī&quot;) on one end and rural forest monks (Sinhala: , Pali: &quot;araññavasi, nagaravasi&quot;, also known as &quot;Tapassin&quot;) on the other. The ascetic focused monks were known by the names &quot;Pamsukulikas&quot; (rag robe wearers) and &quot;Araññikas&quot; (forest dwellers).

The Mahavamsa mentions forest monks associated with the Mahavihara. The Pāli Dhammapada Commentary mentions another split based on the &quot;duty of study&quot; and the &quot;duty of contemplation&quot;. This second division has traditionally been seen as corresponding with the city – forest split, with the city monks focusing on the vocation of books (&quot;ganthadhura&quot;) or learning (&quot;pariyatti&quot;) while the forest monks leaning more towards meditation (&quot;vipassanadhura&quot;) and practice (&quot;patipatti&quot;). However this opposition is not consistent, and urban monasteries have often promoted meditation while forest communities have also produced excellent scholars, such as the Island Hermitage of Nyanatiloka.

Scholar monks generally undertake the path of studying and preserving Theravāda&#x27;s Pāli literature. Forest monks tend to be the minority among Theravāda sanghas and also tend to focus on asceticism (&quot;dhutanga&quot;) and meditative praxis. They view themselves as living closer to the ideal set forth by the Buddha, and are often perceived as such by lay folk, while at the same time often being on the margins of the Buddhist establishment and on the periphery of the social order.

While this divide seems to have been in existence for some time in the Theravāda school, only in the 10th century is a specifically forest monk monastery, mentioned as existing near Anuradhapura, called &quot;Tapavana&quot;. This division was then carried over into the rest of Southeast Asia as Theravāda spread.

Today there are forest based traditions in most Theravāda countries, including the Sri Lankan Forest Tradition, the Thai Forest Tradition as well as lesser known forest based traditions in Burma and Laos, such as the Burmese forest based monasteries (&quot;taw&quot;yar&quot;) of the Pa Auk Sayadaw. In Thailand, forest monks are known as &quot;phra thudong&quot; (ascetic wandering monks) or &quot;phra thudong kammathan&quot; (wandering ascetic meditator).

===Ordination===
The minimum age for ordaining as a Buddhist monk is 20 years, which is calculated from conception. Those under this age can perform traditional ceremonies such as &quot;shinbyu,&quot; in Myanmar, in order to ordain as novices (sāmaṇera). Novices shave their heads, wear the yellow robes, and observe the Ten Precepts. While there is no explicit minimum age for novices prescribed in the scriptures, it is traditionally accepted that boys as young as seven can be accepted for ordination. This tradition echoes the story of the Buddha&#x27;s son, Rahula, who was allowed to become a novice at the age of seven. Both monks and nuns are expected to adhere to a specific code of discipline, of which monks follow 227 rules, and nuns follow 311.

In most Theravāda countries, it is a common practice for young men to ordain as monks for a fixed period of time. In Thailand and Myanmar, young men typically ordain for the retreat during Vassa, the three-month monsoon season, though shorter or longer periods of ordination are not rare. Traditionally, temporary ordination was even more flexible among Laotians. Once they had undergone their initial ordination as young men, Laotian men were permitted to temporarily ordain again at any time, though married men were expected to seek their wife&#x27;s permission. Throughout Southeast Asia, there is little stigma attached to leaving the monastic life. Monks regularly leave the robes after acquiring an education, or when compelled by family obligations or ill health.

Ordaining as a monk, even for a short period, is seen as having many virtues. In many Southeast Asian cultures, it is seen as a means for a young man to &quot;repay his gratitude&quot; to his parents for their work and effort in raising him, because the merit from his ordination is dedicated for their well-being. Thai men who have ordained as a monk may be seen as more mature and suitable husbands by Thai women, who refer to men who have served as monks with a colloquial term meaning &quot;ripe&quot; to indicate that they are more mature and ready for marriage. Particularly in rural areas, temporary ordination of boys and young men traditionally offered peasant boys an opportunity to receive free education in temple schools with sponsorship and accommodation.

In Sri Lanka, temporary ordination is not practised, and a monk leaving the order is frowned upon but not condemned. The continuing influence of the caste system in Sri Lanka plays a role in the taboo against temporary or permanent ordination as a bhikkhu in some orders. Though Sri Lankan orders are often organized along caste lines, men who ordain as monks temporarily pass outside of the conventional caste system, and as such during their time as monks may act (or be treated) in a way that would not be in line with the expected duties and privileges of their caste.

For those born in Western countries who wish to become Buddhist monks or nuns, it is possible to undertake the lifestyle in their home countries, among other Buddhist monastics in Western countries, or to travel and take up residence in a Buddhist monastery in Asian countries such as Sri Lanka or Thailand. In countries where Buddhism is deeply rooted, it can often be easier to adhere to the lifestyle of a monk or nun, as it requires considerable discipline to successfully live by the non-secular rules and regulations for which Buddhist practices are known. For instance, Theravāda monastics are typically required to abstain from activities such as working, handling money, listening to music and cooking. Such obligations can be especially challenging in non-Buddhist societies.

Some of the more well-known Theravādin monks are Ajahn Mun, Ajahn Chah, Ledi Sayadaw, Webu Sayadaw, Narada Maha Thera, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Buddhadasa, Mahasi Sayadaw, Nyanatiloka Mahathera, Nyanaponika Thera, Preah Maha Ghosananda, U Pandita, Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Khemadhammo, Ajahn Brahm, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Sucitto, Ajahn Jayasaro, Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Walpola Rahula Thero, Henepola Gunaratana, Bhaddanta Āciṇṇa, Bhante Yogavacara Rahula, Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro, K. Sri Dhammananda, Sayadaw U Tejaniya and Bhikkhu Analayo.

===Monastic practices===
The practices usually vary in different sub-schools and monasteries within Theravāda. But in the most orthodox forest monastery, the monk usually models his practice and lifestyle on that of the Buddha and his first generation of disciples by living close to nature in forest, mountains and caves. Forest monasteries still keep alive the ancient traditions through following the Buddhist monastic code of discipline in all its detail and developing meditation in secluded forests.

In a typical daily routine at the monastery during the 3-month vassa period, the monk will wake up before dawn and will begin the day with group chanting and meditation. At dawn the monks will go out to surrounding villages bare-footed on alms-round and will have the only meal of the day before noon by eating from the bowl by hand. Most of the time is spent on Dhamma study and meditation. Sometimes the abbot or a senior monk will give a Dhamma talk to the visitors. Laity who stay at the monastery will have to abide by the traditional eight Buddhist precepts.

The life of the monk or nun in a community is much more complex than the life of the forest monk. In the Buddhist society of Sri Lanka, most monks spend hours every day in taking care of the needs of lay people such as preaching &quot;bana,&quot; accepting alms, officiating funerals, teaching &quot;dhamma&quot; to adults and children in addition to providing social services to the community.

After the end of the Vassa period, many of the monks will go out far away from the monastery to find a remote place (usually in the forest) where they can hang their umbrella tents and where it is suitable for the work of self-development. When they go wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those requisites which are necessary will be carried along. These generally consist of the bowl, the three robes, a bathing cloth, an umbrella tent, a mosquito net, a kettle of water, a water filter, razor, sandals, some small candles, and a candle lantern.

The monks do not fix their times for walking and sitting meditation, for as soon as they are free, they just start doing it; nor do they determine for how long they will go on to meditate. Some of them sometimes walk from dusk to dawn whereas at other times they may walk from between two and seven hours. Some may decide to fast for days or stay at dangerous places where ferocious animals live in order to aid their meditation.

Those monks who have been able to achieve a high level of attainment will be able to guide the junior monks and lay Buddhists toward the four degrees of spiritual attainment.

===Bhikkhunis===
A few years after the arrival of Mahinda, the bhikkhu Saṅghamittā, who is also believed to have been the daughter of Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka. She ordained the first nuns in Sri Lanka. In 429, by request of China&#x27;s emperor, nuns from Anuradhapura were sent to China to establish the order there, which subsequently spread across East Asia. The prātimokṣa of the nun&#x27;s order in East Asian Buddhism is the Dharmaguptaka, which is different from the prātimokṣa of the current Theravāda school; the specific ordination of the early Sangha in Sri Lanka not known, although the Dharmaguptaka sect originated with the Sthāvirīya as well.

The nun&#x27;s order subsequently died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century and in Burma in the 13th century. It had already died out around the 10th century in other Theravādin areas. Novice ordination has also disappeared in those countries. Therefore, women who wish to live as renunciates in those countries must do so by taking eight or ten precepts. Neither laywomen nor formally ordained, these women do not receive the recognition, education, financial support or status enjoyed by Buddhist men in their countries. These &quot;precept-holders&quot; live in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and Thailand. In particular, the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. Japan is a special case as, although it has neither the bhikkhuni nor novice ordinations, the precept-holding nuns who live there do enjoy a higher status and better education than their precept-holder sisters elsewhere, and can even become Zen priests. In Tibet there is currently no bhikkhuni ordination, but the Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.

In 1996, 11 selected Sri Lankan women were ordained fully as Theravāda bhikkhunis by a team of Theravāda monks in concert with a team of Korean nuns in India. There is disagreement among Theravāda vinaya authorities as to whether such ordinations are valid. The Dambulla chapter of the Siam Nikaya in Sri Lanka also carried out a nun&#x27;s ordination at this time, specifically stating their ordination process was a valid Theravādin process where the other ordination session was not. This chapter has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns since then. This has been criticized by leading figures in the Siam Nikaya and Amarapura Nikaya, and the governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has declared that there can be no valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree with this.

In 1997 Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun; when she received full ordination in 2000, her dwelling became America&#x27;s first Theravāda Buddhist bhikkhuni vihara.

A 55-year-old Thai Buddhist 8-precept white-robed maechee nun, Varanggana Vanavichayen, became the first woman to receive the going-forth ceremony of a novice (and the gold robe) in Thailand, in 2002. On 28 February 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly known as Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, became the first Thai woman to receive bhikkhuni ordination as a Theravāda nun.
Dhammananda Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka. The Thai Senate has reviewed and revoked the secular law passed in 1928 banning women&#x27;s full ordination in Buddhism as unconstitutional for being counter to laws protecting freedom of religion. However, Thailand&#x27;s two main Theravāda Buddhist orders, the Mahanikaya and Dhammayutika Nikaya, have yet to officially accept fully ordained women into their ranks.

In 2009 in Australia four women received bhikkhuni ordination as Theravāda nuns, the first time such ordination had occurred in Australia. It was performed in Perth, Australia, on 22 October 2009 at Bodhinyana Monastery. Abbess Vayama together with Venerables Nirodha, Seri, and Hasapanna were ordained as Bhikkhunis by a dual Sangha act of Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis in full accordance with the Pāli Vinaya.

In 2010, in the US, four novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai Theravāda tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. Henepola Gunaratana and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere.

The first bhikkhuni ordination in Germany, the ordination of German woman Samaneri Dhira, occurred on 21 June 2015 at Anenja Vihara.

In Indonesia, the first Theravāda ordination of bhikkhunis in Indonesia after more than a thousand years occurred in 2015 at Wisma Kusalayani in Lembang, Bandung in West Java. Those ordained included Vajiradevi Sadhika Bhikkhuni from Indonesia, Medha Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Anula Bhikkhuni from Japan, Santasukha Santamana Bhikkhuni from Vietnam, Sukhi Bhikkhuni and Sumangala Bhikkhuni from Malaysia, and Jenti Bhikkhuni from Australia.

===Monastic orders===
Theravāda monks typically belong to a particular &quot;nikaya&quot;, variously referred to as monastic orders or fraternities. These different orders do not typically develop separate doctrines, but may differ in the manner in which they observe monastic rules. These monastic orders represent lineages of ordination, typically tracing their origin to a particular group of monks that established a new ordination tradition within a particular country or geographic area.

In Sri Lanka caste plays a major role in the division into nikayas. Some Theravāda Buddhist countries appoint or elect a sangharaja, or Supreme Patriarch of the Sangha, as the highest ranking or seniormost monk in a particular area, or from a particular nikaya. The demise of monarchies has resulted in the suspension of these posts in some countries, but patriarchs have continued to be appointed in Thailand. Myanmar and Cambodia ended the practice of appointing a sangharaja for some time, but the position was later restored, though in Cambodia it lapsed again.

== Impact on modern society ==

Theravāda Buddhism&#x27;s emphasis on mindfulness and meditation practices has influenced modern society by promoting mental well-being and stress reduction techniques leading to the integration of mindfulness in various therapeutic and self-improvement programs. Additionally, its teachings on ethical conduct and compassion continue to inspire individuals and organizations to prioritize moral values and social responsibility in their actions and decision-making. The emphasis on ethical conduct in Theravada Buddhism encourages individuals to lead virtuous lives. This includes refraining from actions that harm others, such as lying, stealing, and harming living beings. These principles promote personal integrity and honesty in modern society. Buddhism encourages the cultivation of compassion and loving-kindness (metta) towards all sentient beings. In contemporary society, these teachings inspire individuals and organizations to prioritize social responsibility, charitable activities, and humanitarian efforts aimed at alleviating suffering and promoting the welfare of others. Theravada Buddhism places significant emphasis on self-awareness and self-transformation. Practitioners are encouraged to explore the nature of the self (anatta), impermanence (anicca), and the nature of suffering (dukkha). These teachings have inspired individuals in modern society to embark on journeys of self-discovery, self-improvement, and personal growth. The teachings on mindfulness and the impermanence of life have provided individuals with effective tools for coping with stress and life&#x27;s challenges. In today&#x27;s fast-paced and often stressful world, these teachings offer valuable strategies for maintaining balance and emotional stability. This journey of mindfulness and mental health has been strengthened by top institutions encouraging the idea of mindfulness and the effects it has on people. The mindfulness classes/courses/programs provided by many top universities and institutions such as Yale, Stanford, etc. to their students, staff, and general public have benefited them

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to theatre:

[[Theatre]] – the generic term for the performing arts and a usually collaborative form of fine art involving live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event (such as a story) through acting, singing, and/or dancing before a live audience in a specific place. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of speech, gesture, mime, puppets, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. Elements of design and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.

==Nature of theatre==
Theatre may be described as all of the following:
* One of the arts
** One of the performing arts
* Source of literature, in the form of plays, operas, dances, literary adaptations as presented in front of a live audience. 
* Not necessarily high art: &quot;The theater in any time is not exclusively made up of high art,&quot; wrote Brooks McNamara, &quot;but of a complex of related forms: popular and amateur entertainment, and, in the 20th century, to a great extent, radio, television, motion pictures and the Internet.&quot;

==History of theatre==

History of theatre

===Western tradition===
Chronological movements of the Western tradition include:
* Theatre of ancient Greece – a theatrical culture that flourished in ancient Greece between c. 550 and c. 220 BC. Tragedy (late 6th century BC), comedy (486 BC), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there. Western theatre originated in Athens and its drama has had a significant and sustained impact on Western culture as a whole.
* Theatre of ancient Rome – diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of Plautus&#x27;s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of Seneca. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the Hellenization of Roman culture in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage.
* Medieval theatre – theatre of Europe between the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and the beginning of the Renaissance in approximately the 15th century AD. Medieval theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including liturgical drama, mystery plays, morality plays, farces and masques.
* Commedia dell&#x27;arte – a form of theatre characterized by masked &quot;types&quot; which began in Italy in the 16th century, and was responsible for the advent of the actress and improvised performances based on sketches or scenarios.
* English Renaissance theatre – also known as &quot;early modern English theatre&quot;, refers to the theatre of England, largely based in London, which occurred between the Reformation and the closure of the theatres in 1642. It includes the drama of William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and many other famous playwrights.
* Restoration comedy – English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of English drama. Restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness.
* Restoration spectacular – elaborately staged productions beginning the late 17th-century Restoration period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable scenery, baroque illusionistic painting, gorgeous costumes, and special effects such as trapdoor tricks, &quot;flying&quot; actors, and fireworks.
* Neoclassical theatre – theatrical movement that drew inspiration from the &quot;classical&quot; art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome that was dominant in Europe from the mid-18th to the 19th centuries.
* Nineteenth-century theatre – wide range of movements in the theatrical culture of Europe and the United States in the 19th century. In the West, they include Romanticism, melodrama, the well-made plays of Scribe and Sardou, the farces of Feydeau, the problem plays of Naturalism and Realism, Wagner&#x27;s operatic &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s plays and operas, Wilde&#x27;s drawing-room comedies, Symbolism, and proto-Expressionism in the late works of August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen.
** Nineteenth-century theatrical scenery
* Twentieth-century theatre – wide range of movements in the theatrical culture of the 20th century, including Naturalism, Realism, Expressionism and Experimental theatre.
** Theatre of the United Kingdom – introduced by the Romans and part of the British culture since at least 1585.
*** West End – popular term for mainstream professional theatre staged in the large theatres of London&#x27;s &#x27;Theatreland&#x27;, the West End.
*** London fringe – small scale theatres, many of them located above pubs, and the equivalent to New York&#x27;s Off-Broadway or Off-Off-Broadway theatres.
*** Fringe festival – unjuried festivals, such as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Adelaide Fringe, permit artists to produce a wide variety of works.
** Theater of the United States – based in the Western tradition.
*** Broadway – refers to theatrical performances presented in the Theater District centered along Broadway, and in Lincoln Center, in Manhattan in New York City. Along with London&#x27;s West End theatre, Broadway theatre is widely considered to represent the highest level of commercial theatre in the English-speaking world.
*** Off-Broadway – professional venue in New York City with a seating capacity between 100 and 499, and for a specific production of a play, musical or revue. These theatres are smaller than Broadway theatres.
*** Off-Off-Broadway – theaters in New York City that have fewer than 100 seats, though the term can be used for any show in the New York City area that has neither an Off-Broadway nor a Broadway contract.
**** Downtown Theater – Part of the avant-garde artistic movement that began in the 1970s and is centered below 14th Street in Manhattan.
*** Regional theatre – professional theatre companies outside of New York City that produce their own seasons.
*** Summer stock theatre – any theatre that presents stage productions only in the summer within the United States. Often viewed as a starting point for professional actors, stock casts are typically young, just out of high school or still in college.
** Theatre of the Soviet Union
*** Proletcult Theatre – theatrical branch of the Soviet cultural movement Proletcult concerned with the powerful expression of ideological content as political propaganda in the years following the revolution of 1917. Platon Kerzhentsev was one of its principal practitioners.

===African===
African theatre includes:
* Ancient Egyptian quasi-theatrical events – earliest recorded quasi-theatrical event dates back to 2000 BCE with the &quot;passion plays&quot; of Ancient Egypt. This story of the god Osiris was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization.
* Yoruba theatre – origins are traced back to the masquerade of the Egungun (the &quot;cult of the ancestor&quot;). The traditional ceremony culminates in the essence of the masquerade where it is deemed that ancestors return to the world of the living to visit their descendants. In addition to its origin in ritual, Yoruba theatre can be &quot;traced to the &#x27;theatrogenic&#x27; nature of a number of the deities in the Yoruba pantheon, such as Obatala the arch divinity, Ogun the divinity of creativeness and Sango the divinity of the storm&quot;, whose reverence is imbued &quot;with drama and theatre and the symbolic overall relevance in terms of its relative interpretation.&quot;

===Asian===
Asian theatre
* Theatre of India – began with Sanskrit theatre and flourished between the 1st and 10th centuries CE, which was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written.

Today it is often called Chinese opera, although this normally refers specifically to the more well-known forms such as Peking opera and Cantonese opera; there have been many other forms of theatre in China.
* Thai theatre – a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand&#x27;s national epic &quot;Ramakien&quot;, a version of the Indian &quot;Ramayana&quot;, remains popular in Thailand even today.
* Khmer and Malay theatre – In Cambodia, at the ancient capital Angkor Wat, stories from the Indian epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at Borobudur in Indonesia.
* Theatre of Japan – traditional Japanese theater forms that are famous around the world, including &quot;Noh&quot;, &quot;kyōgen&quot;, &quot;kabuki&quot;, and &quot;bunraku&quot; (puppet theatre).

===Middle Eastern===
* Middle-Eastern theatre – the most popular forms of theatre in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as &quot;ta&#x27;ziya&quot;, in which actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the &quot;shaheed&quot; (martyrdom) of Ali&#x27;s sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Secular plays known as &quot;akhraja&quot; were recorded in medieval &quot;adab&quot; literature, though they were less common than puppetry and &quot;ta&#x27;ziya&quot; theatre.

==Styles of theatre==
There are a variety of theatrical styles used in theatre and drama. These include:

* Expressionism – anti-realistic in seeing appearance as distorted and the truth lying within man. The outward appearance on stage can be distorted and unrealistic to portray an eternal truth.
* Melodrama – sentimental drama with musical underscoring, often with an unlikely plot that concerns the suffering of the good at the hands of evildoers but ends happily with good triumphant. Featuring stock characters such as the noble hero, the long-suffering damsel in distress, and the cold-blooded villain.
* Modernism – a broad concept that sees art, including theatre, as detached from life in a pure way and able to reflect on life critically.
* Naturalism – life on stage is presented with close attention to detail, based on observations of &quot;real life.&quot;
* Postmodern theatre – originated in Europe in the middle of the 20th century out of the postmodern philosophy as a reaction against modernist theatre. Postmodern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers or definitive truth.

* Realism – characters are portrayed as close to real life, with realistic settings and staging.

==Types of stages==

*Proscenium – The proscenium arch was the most common form of theatre building in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The &quot;arch&quot; acts like a picture frame through which the action can be seen.

==General theatre concepts==
* Act – plays are separated into acts with the acts separated into scenes.
* Acting – the art of performing
* Cold reading – reading a script for the first time. Usually the designers have read and analyzed the text for design purposes before a cast has been selected. Sometimes a cold reading involves the entire cast, crew, and designers who are experiencing the script for the first time as an ensemble.
* Curtain call – taking a bow at the end of the performance. Actors will generally acknowledge the orchestra pit (if there were any musicians) and the running crew as well as the audience. 
* Drama therapy – the use of theatre as therapy for a variety of issues.
* Everyman – the concept of the universal person that the audience can relate to.
* Footlights – originally lighting was placed at the front edge of the stage under hoods so as to not bother the audience. It can be a generic term for anyone wanting to be involved with theatre. A play of that name is now a musical and also a Theatrical Comedy Troupe at Cambridge University.
* Theatrical property – Props are the items actors pick up, use, move, etc. on stage. These can include consumables such as drinks, food, etc.
* Stage – The surface upon which the sets are built upon and the actors stand to tell the story. Can be raked (that is, at an angle).
* Stagecraft – usually refers to the design aspect of theatre. Examples: lights, sound, props, costumes, makeup, set. 
* Theatrical constraints – budgets, time, allergies
* Theatrical scenery – also referred to as the set or the scenic elements. The physical representation of the world of the play.
* Theatrical superstitions – some theatre spaces have their own superstitions; there are universal ones that many theatre people adhere to.
* Ticket – this is the domain of the Front of House, as well as the programs, ushers, and seeing patrons (the audience) are seated before the lights are darkened at the beginning of the play, but also at intermission.
* Spectacle – what the audience experiences.
* Rehearsals – where the actors and the director (and sometimes assistant director) start to plan the movements, the tempo, timing, the energy level of all the scenes.
* Dress rehearsals – where all the components (costumes, lighting, set, props, actors) come together to run through the play from start to finish, not only to get issues such as set and costume changes finalized and timed correctly, but to smooth out any minor issues with lighting, sound, tempo, etc.
* Tech rehearsals – rehearsals where the actors are not involved. They give the sound, lighting, and running crew a chance to rehearse and create a rhythm that is proficient and smooth prior to dress rehearsals.
*Run-throughs – The meaning of this term depends on the director. Generally, it can mean just running through an act with the actors (no technical aspects involved). Sometimes it can involve costume changes, as those can become complicated if wig changes are also required. Costume changes can be rehearsed and done in as little as 30 seconds to 2 minutes (if a wig is involved).

<text>A phenotypic trait, simply trait, or character state is a distinct variant of a phenotypic characteristic of an organism; it may be either inherited or determined environmentally, but typically occurs as a combination of the two. For example, having eye color is a &quot;character&quot; of an organism, while blue, brown and hazel versions of eye color are &quot;traits&quot;. The term &quot;trait&quot; is generally used in genetics, often to describe the phenotypic expression of different combinations of alleles in different individual organisms within a single population, such as the famous purple vs. white flower coloration in Gregor Mendel&#x27;s pea plants. By contrast, in systematics, the term &quot;character state&quot; is employed to describe features that represent fixed diagnostic differences among taxa, such as the absence of tails in great apes, relative to other primate groups.

== Definition ==
A phenotypic trait is an obvious, observable, and measurable characteristic of an organism; it is the expression of genes in an observable way. An example of a phenotypic trait is a specific hair color or eye color. Underlying genes, that make up the genotype, determine the hair color, but the hair color observed is the phenotype. 

The phenotype is dependent on the genetic make-up of the organism, but is also influenced by the environmental conditions that the organism was subjected to during its ontogenetic development, including various epigenetic processes. 

Regardless of the degree of influence of genotype versus environment, the phenotype encompasses all of the characteristics of an organism, including traits at multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from behavior and evolutionary history of life traits (e.g., litter size), through morphology (e.g., body height and composition), physiology (e.g., blood pressure), cellular characteristics (e.g., membrane lipid composition, mitochondrial densities), components of biochemical pathways, and even messenger RNA.

==Genetic origin of traits in diploid organisms==
Different phenotypic traits are caused by different forms of genes, or alleles, which arise by mutation in a single individual and are passed on to successive generations.

==Biochemistry of dominance and extensions to expression of traits==
The biochemistry of the intermediate proteins determines how they interact in the cell. Therefore, biochemistry predicts how different combinations of alleles will produce varying traits.

Extended expression patterns seen in diploid organisms include facets of incomplete dominance, codominance, and multiple alleles. Incomplete dominance is the condition in which neither allele dominates the other in one heterozygote. Instead the phenotype is intermediate in heterozygotes. Thus you can tell that each allele is present in the heterozygote. Codominance refers to the allelic relationship that occurs when two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygote, and both phenotypes are seen simultaneously. Multiple alleles refers to the situation when there are more than 2 common alleles of a particular gene. Blood groups in humans is a classic example. The ABO blood group proteins are important in
determining blood type in humans, and this is determined by different alleles of the one locus.

==Continuum versus categorical traits==

Schizotypy is an example of a psychological phenotypic trait found in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Studies have shown that gender and age influences the expression of schizotypal traits. For instance, certain schizotypal traits may develop further during adolescence, whereas others stay the same during this period.

<text>Trabant () is a series of small cars produced from 1957 until 1991 by former East German car manufacturer VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau. Four models were made: the Trabant 500, Trabant 600, Trabant 601, and the Trabant 1.1. The first model, the 500, was a relatively modern car when it was introduced.

It featured detachable duroplast body panels on a galvanised steel unibody chassis, front-wheel drive, a transverse two-stroke engine, and independent suspension. Because this 1950s design remained largely unchanged until the introduction of the last model, the Trabant 1.1 in 1990, the Trabant became symbolic of the former East Germany&#x27;s stagnant economy and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in general. Called &quot;a spark plug with a roof&quot;, 3,096,999 Trabants were produced. Older models have been sought by collectors in the United States due to their low cost and fewer restrictions on the importation of antique cars. The Trabant also gained a following among car tuning and rallying enthusiasts.

== Overview ==

The German word &quot;Trabant&quot;, derived from Middle High German &quot;drabant&quot;, means &#x27;satellite&#x27; or &#x27;companion&#x27;. The car&#x27;s name was inspired by the Soviet Sputnik satellite. The cars are often referred to as &quot;Trabbi&quot; or &quot;Trabi&quot;. Produced without major changes for nearly 30 years, the Trabant became the most common automobile in East Germany. It came to symbolise the country during the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, as images of East Germans crossing the border into West Germany were broadcast around the globe.

Manufactured by a state monopoly, a Trabant took about ten years to acquire. East German buyers were placed on a waiting list of up to thirteen years. The waiting time depended on their proximity to Berlin, the capital. Official state price was 7,450 GDR marks and the demand to production ratio was forty three to one (1989). The free market price for a second-hand one was more than twice the price of a new one, and the average worker had to wait ten to thirteen years on a waiting list, or, if available, pay more than double for a second hand model.

The Trabant had a steel frame, with the roof, boot lid, bonnet, wings and doors made of duroplast, a hard plastic made from recycled cotton waste from the Soviet Union and phenol resins from the East German dye industry. It was the second car with a body made of recycled material; the first was the AWZ P70 Zwickau, produced from 1955 to 1959. The material was durable, and the average lifespan of a Trabant was 28 years.

The Trabant&#x27;s build quality was poor, and it was loud, slow, and poorly designed.

The car had four principal variants:

*The Trabant P 50, also known as the Trabant 500 (produced 1957–1962)
*The Trabant 600 (1962–1965)
*The Trabant 601 (1964–1990)
*The Trabant 1.1, produced in 1990–1991 with a VW engine

The engine for the 500, 600 and the original 601 was a small two-stroke engine with two cylinders, accounting for the vehicle&#x27;s modest performance. Its curb weight was about . When it ceased production in 1989, the Trabant delivered from displacement.
It took 21 seconds to accelerate from zero to its top speed of .

The engine produced a very smoky exhaust and was a significant source of air pollution – nine times the hydrocarbons and five times the carbon-monoxide emissions of the average 2007 European car. Its fuel consumption was . Since the engine was two-stroke, oil had to be added to the fuel tank at a 50:1 (or 33:1) ratio of fuel to oil at each fill-up. Contemporary gas stations in countries where two-stroke engines were common sold a premixed gas-oil mixture at the pump. Because the Trabant had no fuel pump, its fuel tank was above the engine so fuel could reach the carburettor by gravity; this increased the risk of fire in front-end accidents. Earlier models had no fuel gauge, and a dipstick was inserted into the tank to determine how much fuel remained.

Known for its dull colour scheme and cramped, uncomfortable ride, the Trabant is an object of ridicule for many Germans and is regarded as symbolic of the fall of the Eastern Bloc. Known as a &quot;spark plug with a roof&quot; because of its small size, the car did gain public affection.

Its design remained essentially unchanged from its introduction in the late 1950s, and the last model was introduced in 1990. The 1980s model had no tachometer, no indicator for either the headlights or turn signals, no fuel gauge, no rear seat belts, no external fuel door, and drivers had to pour a mix of gasoline and oil into a tank located directly under the bonnet/hood. In contrast, the West German Volkswagen Beetle received a number of updates (including improvements in efficiency) over a similar period.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau had its origins in the former Auto Union/DKW business which had operated out of the site prior to the war, and the company&#x27;s first products were essentially copies of pre-war DKW designs. Following the partition of Germany, Auto Union re-established itself in West Germany (ultimately evolving into Audi), leaving VEB Sachsenring with the two stroke engine inherited from DKW.

The Trabant was the result of a planning process which had been intended to design a three-wheeled motorcycle. In German, &quot;Trabant&quot; is an astronomical term for a moon (or other natural satellite) of a celestial body.

=== Full production ===

The first of the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a relatively advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension. The Trabant&#x27;s greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s, many small West European cars (such as the Renault) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder four-stroke engine. The Trabant had a front, transversely mounted engine and front-wheel drive in an era when many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car&#x27;s two-stroke engine made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.

The Trabant&#x27;s air-cooled, engine—upgraded to in 1962–63—was derived from a pre-war DKW design with minor alterations during its production run. The first Saab car had a larger (764 cc), water-cooled, two-cylinder two-stroke engine. Wartburg, an East German manufacturer of larger sedans, also used a water-cooled, three-cylinder, , two-stroke DKW engine.

The original Trabant, introduced in 1958, was the P 50. Trabant&#x27;s base model, it shared a large number of interchangeable parts with the latest 1.1s. The 500 cc, P50 evolved into a version with a fully synchronised gearbox in 1960, and received a , engine in 1962 as the P 60.

The updated P601 was introduced in 1964. It was essentially a facelift of the P 60, with a different front fascia, bonnet, roof and rear and the original P50 underpinnings. The model remained nearly unchanged until the end of its production except for the addition of 12V electricity, rear coil springs and an updated dashboard for later models.
The Trabant&#x27;s designers expected production to extend until 1967 at the latest, and East German designers and engineers created a series of more-sophisticated prototypes intended to replace the P601; several are displayed at the Dresden Transport Museum. Each proposal for a new model was rejected by the East German government due to shortages of the raw materials required in larger quantities for the more-advanced designs. As a result, the Trabant remained largely unchanged for more than a quarter-century. Also unchanged was its production method, which was extremely labour-intensive.

Production started from 34,000 p.a. in 1964, reached 100,000 p.a. in 1973, to a high of 150,000 in 1989.

The Trabant 1.1 was a 601 with a better-performing 1.05-litre (), VW Polo engine. With a slightly modified look (including a floor-mounted gearshift), it was quieter and cleaner than its predecessor. The 1.1 had front disc brakes, and its wheel assembly was borrowed from Volkswagen. It was produced from 1989 to 1991, in parallel with the two-stroke P601. Except for the engine and transmission, many parts from older P50s, P60s and 601s were compatible with the 1.1.

=== 1989–1991 ===
In mid-1989, thousands of East Germans began loading their Trabants with as much as they could carry and drove to Hungary or Czechoslovakia en route to West Germany–the so-called &quot;Trabi Trail&quot;. Many had to get special permission to drive their Trabants into West Germany. The cars did not meet West German emissions standards and polluted the air at four times the European average.

A licensed version of the Volkswagen Polo engine replaced the Trabant&#x27;s two-stroke engine, the result of a trade agreement between East and West Germany. The first prototypes were built in 1988, with pre-series cars appearing in 1989, but series production only began in May 1990 - By which time the two German states had already agreed to reunification. The locally built EA111-series engine was given the model code BM 820 by the East Germans; the plant also made 1.3-litre versions for the Wartburg 1.3 (BM 860) and the Barkas utility vehicle (BM 880). The model, the Trabant 1.1, also had minor improvements to its brake and signal lights, a renovated grille, and MacPherson struts instead of a leaf-spring-suspended chassis.

By April 1991, after only eleven months, the Trabant 1.1 was discontinued. In total, 3.7 million Trabant vehicles had been produced. However, it soon became apparent that there was no place for the Trabant in a reunified German economy. Its inefficient, labour-intensive production line had only survived thanks to government subsidies.

The Zwickau factory in Mosel (where the Trabant was manufactured) was sold to Volkswagen AG; the rest of the company became HQM Sachsenring GmbH. Volkswagen redeveloped the Zwickau factory into a centre for engine production; it also produces some Volkswagen Golfs and Passats.

=== 1990s and later ===
According to Richard Leiby, the Trabant had become &quot;a symbol of the technological and social backwardness of the East German state.&quot; Trabants became a symbol of the GDR&#x27;s serious flaws in the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when many were abandoned by their Eastern owners who migrated west. Unlike the Lada Niva, Škoda Estelle, Polski Fiat (design licensed from the Italian car manufacturer) and Yugo, the Trabant had negligible sales in Western Europe.

A Trabant could be bought for as little as a few Deutsche Marks during the early 1990s, and many were given away. Although prices recovered as they became collectors&#x27; items, they remain inexpensive cars. In her &quot;Bodywork&quot; project, performance artist Liz Cohen transformed a 1987 Trabant into a 1973 Chevrolet El Camino. The Trabant was planned to return to production in Uzbekistan as the Olimp during the late 1990s, but only one model was produced.

Former Bulgarian Foreign Minister and Atlantic Club of Bulgaria founding president Solomon Passy owned a Trabant which was blessed by Pope John Paul II in 2002 and in which he took NATO Secretaries General Manfred Wörner, George Robertson, and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer for rides. In 2005, Passy donated the vehicle (which had become symbolic of Bulgaria&#x27;s NATO accession) to the National Historical Museum of Bulgaria. In 1997, the Trabant was celebrated for passing the moose test without rolling over, as the Mercedes-Benz W168 had; a Thuringian newspaper&#x27;s headline read, &quot;Come and get us, moose! Trabi passes A-Class killer test&quot;.

The Trabant entered the world of diplomacy in 2007 when Steven Fisher, deputy head of mission at the British Embassy in Budapest, used a 1.1 (painted as close to British racing green as possible) as his diplomatic car. American Trabant owners celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall with the Parade of Trabants, an annual early-November rally held in Washington, D.C. The event, sponsored by the privately owned International Spy Museum, includes street tours in Trabants, rides, live German music and displays about East Germany.

== Planned reintroduction ==
The Herpa company, a Bavarian miniature-vehicle manufacturer, bought the rights to the Trabant name and showed a scale model of a &quot;newTrabi&quot; at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. Plans for production included a limited run, possibly with a BMW engine. A Trabant nT model was unveiled two years later in Frankfurt.

The Trabant nT consortium includes Herpa, the German specialized-auto-parts manufacturer IndiKar and the German automobile-engineering company IAV. The group was looking for investment, design and production in the Trabant&#x27;s original hometown of Zwickau, with sales &quot;in 2012&quot;. The Trabant nT electric car would be equipped with a asynchronous motor powered by a lithium-ion battery.

<doc id="31011" wikidata="Q17086170" url="?curid=31011" title="There Is No Cabal">
<text>There Is No Cabal (abbreviated TINC) is a catchphrase and running joke found on Usenet. The journalist Wendy M. Grossman writes that its appearance on the &quot;alt.usenet.cabal&quot; FAQ reflects conspiracy accusations as old as the Internet itself. The anthropologist Gabriella Coleman writes that the joke reveals &quot;discomfort over the potential for corruption by meritocratic leaders&quot;.

==History==
The phrase &quot;There Is No Cabal&quot; was developed to deny the existence of the backbone cabal, which members of the cabal denied. The cabal consisted of operators of major news server newsgroups, allowing them to wield greater control over Usenet.

<doc id="31015" wikidata="Q41403" url="?curid=31015" title="Teletubbies">
<text>Teletubbies is a British children&#x27;s television series created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport for the BBC. The programme focuses on four differently coloured characters known as the Teletubbies, named after the television screens on their bellies. Recognised throughout popular culture for the uniquely shaped antenna protruding from the head of each character, the Teletubbies communicate through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to toddlers.

The series rapidly became a commercial success in Britain and abroad. It won multiple BAFTA awards and was nominated for two Daytime Emmys throughout its run. A single based on the show&#x27;s theme song reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1997 and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks, selling over a million copies. By October 2000, the franchise generated over £1billion () in merchandise sales.

Though the original run ended in 2001, a rebooted series was green-lit in 2014. The reboot premiered on CBeebies in the United Kingdom and on the Nick Jr. Channel in the United States. The reboot ran for 120 episodes, with the last episode airing on the Nick Jr. Channel on 17 August 2018.

The original series returned to the United States on 25 May 2016, when every episode was added to the Noggin streaming service, including episodes that had never aired in America before.

==Plot==
The programme takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls audible in the background. The main shelter of the four Teletubbies is an earth house known as the &quot;Tubbytronic Superdome&quot; implanted in the ground and accessed through a hole at the top or an especially large semicircular door at the dome&#x27;s foot. The Teletubbies co-exist with a number of strange contraptions such as the Voice Trumpets and the group&#x27;s anthropomorphic blue vacuum cleaner (&quot;Noo-Noo&quot;). The show&#x27;s colourful psychedelic setting was designed specifically to appeal to the attention spans of infants and unlock different sections of the mind while also educating young children of transitions that can be expected in life.

An assortment of rituals is performed throughout the course of every episode, such as the playful interactions between the Teletubbies and the Voice Trumpets, mishaps caused by the Noo-Noo, the footage of children displayed on the screens on the Teletubbies&#x27; stomachs, and the magical event that occurs once per episode. The event differs each time; it is often caused inexplicably and is frequently strange yet whimsical. Each episode is closed by the Voice Trumpets and the narrator. The disappointed, reluctant, but eventually obedient Teletubbies bid farewell to the viewer as they go back to the Tubbytronic Superdome while the Sun Baby sets.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Tinky Winky (played by Dave Thompson and Simon Shelton in the original series and by Jeremiah Krage in the revival series) is the first Teletubby, as well as the largest and oldest of the group. He is covered in purple terrycloth and has a triangular antenna on his head. He often carries a red bag.
* Dipsy (played by John Simmit in the original series and by Nick Kellington in the revival series) is the second Teletubby. He is green and named after his antenna, which resembles a dipstick. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will occasionally refuse to go along with the others&#x27; group opinion. His face is notably darker than the rest of the Teletubbies, and the creators have stated that he is Black. He often wears a large hat with a black and white pattern.
* Laa-Laa (played by Nikky Smedley in the original series and by Rebecca Hyland in the revival series) is the third Teletubby. She is yellow and has a curly antenna. Laa-Laa is very sweet, likes to sing and dance, and is often shown looking out for the other Teletubbies. Her favourite toy is an orange rubber ball.
* Po (played by Pui Fan Lee in the original series and by Rachelle Beinart in the revival series) is the fourth Teletubby, as well as the shortest and youngest. She is red and has an antenna shaped like a stick used for blowing soap bubbles. Po normally speaks in a soft voice and has been stated by the show&#x27;s creators to be Cantonese; she sometimes speaks the language. Her favourite toy is a blue and pink scooter.

===Supporting characters===
* Noo-Noo (operated by Mark Dean in the original series and Victoria Jane and Olly Taylor in the revival series) is a sentient vacuum cleaner who acts as both the Teletubbies&#x27; guardian and housekeeper. He hardly ever ventures outside the Tubbytronic Superdome, instead remaining indoors and constantly cleaning with his sucker-like nose. He communicates through a series of slurping and sucking noises. He occasionally misbehaves and sucks up anything from tubby toast to blankets, which prompts the Teletubbies to call him &quot;Naughty Noo-Noo&quot; and give chase. He was blue in the original series and had orange, pink and yellow stripes in the revival series.
* The Voice Trumpets (voiced by Eric Sykes, Toyah Willcox, John Simmit, Gary Stevenson, Alex Hogg, Alex Pascall, Tim Whitnall and Rudolph Walker in the original series, Sandra Dickinson, Toni Barry, Rachael Lillis and John Schwab used in the US series from PBS, and Fearne Cotton, Jim Broadbent, Antonia Thomas, Teresa Gallagher, David Walliams and Rochelle Humes in the revival series) are several devices resembling periscopes that rise from the ground and interact with the Teletubbies, often engaging in games with them and serving as supervisors. They are the only residents of Teletubbyland who speak in complete sentences.
* The Sun Baby (played by Jess Smith in the original series and Berry (surname unknown) in the revival series) appears at the beginning and end of each episode. She acts as a wake-up call for the Teletubbies.
* Numerous rabbits are found throughout Teletubbyland, and are depicted by several Flemish Giant rabbits. The Teletubbies enjoy watching them hop and play. The rabbits are the only type of Earth animal found in the land, and take residence in rabbit holes and bushes. They are hardly ever seen in the Magical Events, apart from the Lion and Bear (edited sketch).
* The Tubby Phone (voiced by Jane Horrocks) is a character in the revival series. Tubby Phone has the ability to make &quot;Tubby Phone dance&quot; and Teletubbies dance after they push the button on the phone. At one point, it has the ability to make Tubby photos.
* The Tiddlytubbies (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) are baby Teletubbies appearing in the revival series. Their names are Mi-Mi, Daa Daa, Baa, Ping, RuRu, Nin, Duggle Dee and Umby Pumby. The Tiddlytubbies would get their own spin-off animated web series in 2018.

==Release==
On 31 March 1997, the first episode of &quot;Teletubbies&quot; aired on BBC2 on the CBBC programming block. It filled a time slot previously held by &quot;Playdays&quot;. This schedule change initially received backlash from parents, but the show was not moved. The programme&#x27;s unconventional format quickly received attention from the media, and it was attracting two million viewers per episode by August. In February 1998, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; noted that it had &quot;reached cult status&quot; in less than a year on the air.

&quot;Teletubbies&quot; has been aired in over 120 countries in 45 different languages. In the United States, the series airs on Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister channel, the Nick Jr. Channel. Episodes were also released through the Nick Jr. mobile application and on-demand services. The original series is available as part of the Noggin subscription service in North America. It aired on PBS Kids in the United States from 6 April 1998 to 29 August 2008. BBC Studios channels carry the series in most of Africa, Asia and Poland. A Spanish dub airs on Clan in Spain. In Greece, the series airs on Nickelodeon Greece. NPO Zappelin carries the show in the Netherlands and MTVA airs it in Hungary. In Australia and New Zealand, the series airs on CBeebies Australia and ABC Kids. JimJam&#x27;s Benelux feed airs the series and Ultra airs it in Serbia. &quot;Teletubbies&quot; also airs on SIC in Portugal and e-Junior in the Middle East. In Singapore, the series aired over-the-air on Premiere 12 six days a week, attracting by mid-1998 an audience of 78,000 viewers, and twice a week on cable, on the Eureka Learning Channel. The series also gave a notable subscription drive for Singapore Television Twelve&#x27;s magazine, owing to Teletubby plush toys sweepstakes.

A redubbed version of the 2015 reboot premiered on Netflix on 14 November 2022 featuring Tituss Burgess.

==Production==

The show was created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport after the BBC requested their pitch for a show aimed at preschoolers. Inspired by Davenport&#x27;s interest in astronauts, specifically Apollo 11 and the first Moon landing, as well as their concern about &quot;how children were reacting to the increasingly technological environment of the late 1990s&quot;, the two put together a pitch which the BBC picked up.

Finding a shooting location was a challenge, as they wanted to film the production outside but was unable to locate a place &quot;with a suitable bowl-like dip&quot;. They ended up filming on a farm in Wimpstone, Warwickshire, where they had previously shot &quot;Tots TV&quot;. Due to problems with a previous television show shooting at the location, the shooting was protested by the locals, although they calmed down after being assured that &quot;it was a low-key children&#x27;s programme and no one would be aware of the filming&quot;. After the show took off, though, its popularity caused the land to be overrun by the press. In 2013, due to the continued trespassing, its owner, Rosemary Harding, had the location filled with water and turned into a small pond: &quot;People were jumping fences and crossing cattle fields. We’re glad to see the back of it.&quot;

According to Davenport, the press was particularly interested in getting photos of the actors in their Teletubby costumes without their heads on. Eventually, the team took measures to secure their privacy, including blindfolding visitors coming to the set and creating a tent for the actors to change in secret.

The artist who originally drew the characters that would become the Teletubbies was the illustrator and caricaturist Jonathan Hills, who also designed digital images for television programmes including &quot;Poirot&quot;. In 2022 a sample from a collection of original drawings were presented by Hills&#x27; widow Lucy on the BBC show &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. The collection was valued, by expert Mark Hill, at up to £80,000.

==Promotion==
===Merchandising===

Golden Bear Toys distributed the first line of &quot;Teletubbies&quot; dolls shortly after the programme&#x27;s debut. They were sold internationally, with talking toys available in multiple languages. Hasbro signed on to develop a new range of products in 1998. In 1999, Microsoft UK released a set of interactive &quot;ActiMates&quot; toys based on the characters. The Rasta Imposta company introduced &quot;Teletubbies&quot; costumes for children and adults in the same year. Two educational video games featuring the characters were also released throughout the series&#x27; run.

&quot;Teletubbies&quot; dolls were the top-selling Christmas toy in 1997. Demand outstripped supply at most retailers, reportedly prompting many shops to ration them to one per customer. In some cases, shoppers camped outside stores overnight in hopes of purchasing &quot;Teletubbies&quot; merchandise. Fights over the toys broke out among parents and collectors on occasion. Over one million dolls were sold in Britain by 25 December of that year, with Golden Bear representatives estimating that sales could have reached three million if supplies had been available. The plush toys were named &quot;Toy of the Year&quot; by the British Association of Toy Retailers in 1998.

Kids&#x27; meal tie-ins have been released at fast-food restaurants throughout North America. In May 1999, Burger King distributed a set of six &quot;Teletubbies&quot; plush toys. They also included chicken nuggets shaped like the characters on their menu for a brief period of time. Keychains modelled after the characters were available at McDonald&#x27;s in April 2000. These promotions became controversial among adults who believed they were intended to attract toddlers to high-fat food. Psychiatrist Alvin Francis Poussaint considered the deals &quot;troubling&quot;. He voiced his opinion on the matter publicly, but did not take action against the companies.

Two kiddie rides featuring the characters were manufactured by Jolly Roger. They were available at some amusement parks and arcades, such as Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s and Fantasy Island.

Overseas &quot;Teletubbies&quot; merchandise sales throughout the 1990s delivered €136 million in profits for the BBC. By the time of the programme&#x27;s cancellation, &quot;Teletubbies&quot; toys had generated over £200 million in revenue for co-creator Anne Wood alone. In 2005, Chris Hastings and Ben Jones of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called &quot;Teletubbies&quot; &quot;the most lucrative show in BBC television history.&quot;

In 2021, WildBrain, who owns the Teletubbies brand, launched a Teletubbies Pride Collection, with merchandise proceeds going towards efforts to expand LGBTQ images and inclusion in children’s and family programming.

===Live events===

To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the premiere of &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, a series of events took place from March to April 2007. The characters headlined an invitation-only event in London on 21 March 2007. They appeared in New York City&#x27;s Times Square, Grand Central Terminal, and Apollo Theater. They were also interviewed on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; in an episode that included the first televised appearance of the actors without their costumes. A partnership was formed with Isaac Mizrahi in which Mizrahi designed Teletubbies-inspired bags to be auctioned off to benefit charities. A new line of clothing was launched at the Pop-Up Shop and other speciality stores. New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg announced 28 March 2007 &quot;Teletubbies Day&quot; and gave the key to the city to the Teletubbies. Following their show in New York, the Teletubbies went on their first live European tour, performing in London, Paris, Bremen, Darmstadt, Halle, Hamburg, Köln, and Hannover.

In January 2016, costumed &quot;Teletubbies&quot; characters appeared at the American International Toy Fair. In April 2016, the series&#x27; premiere on the Greek Nickelodeon channel was advertised with a series of appearances by the Teletubbies at malls throughout Athens. This began with a live show at Avenue Mall on 16 April, which featured both the Teletubbies and a host from the network. Throughout May 2016, the characters appeared on various breakfast television programmes to promote the upcoming series debut on the Nick Jr. Channel in the United States.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Common Sense Media&#x27;s Emily Ashby found that &quot;while the show&#x27;s examples of cooperative play, wonder, and simple joys are gentle and pleasing, the creatures can still be a little grating to parents watching along.&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated in her review that the episodes &quot;offer a genuinely appealing combination: cute and slightly surreal.&quot;

Upon the show&#x27;s release, some critics feared that the characters&#x27; use of babbling in place of complete sentences would negatively affect young viewers&#x27; ability to communicate. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported in 1997 that many parents objected to its &quot;goo-goo style&quot; and &quot;said the show was a bad influence on their children.&quot; Marina Krcmar, a professor of communication at the Wake Forest University, told interviewers in 2007 that &quot;toddlers learn more from an adult speaker than they do from a program such as &quot;Teletubbies&quot;.&quot; However, Paul McCann of &quot;The Independent&quot; defended this aspect of the show, stating that &quot;&quot;Teletubbies&quot; upsets those who automatically assume that progressive and creative learning is trendy nonsense. Those who believe that education should be strictly disciplined and functional, even when you&#x27;re 18 months old. Thankfully &quot;Teletubbies&quot; isn&#x27;t for them. It&#x27;s for kids.&quot;

===Tinky Winky controversy===

Controversy arose in 1999 concerning Tinky Winky and him carrying a bag that looks much like a woman&#x27;s handbag (although he was first &quot;outed&quot; by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter from July 1997 to &quot;The Face&quot;). He aroused the interest of Jerry Falwell in 1999 when Falwell alleged that the character was a &quot;gay role model&quot;. Falwell issued an attack in his &quot;National Liberty Journal&quot;, citing a &quot;Washington Post&quot; &quot;In/out&quot; column which stated that lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres was &quot;out&quot; as the chief national gay representative, while trendy Tinky Winky was &quot;in&quot;. He warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a covert homosexual symbol, because &quot;he is purple, the gay pride colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle: the gay pride symbol.&quot; The BBC made an official response, explaining that &quot;Tinky Winky is simply a sweet, technological baby with a magic bag.&quot; Kenn Viselman of Itsy-Bitsy Entertainment commented, &quot;He&#x27;s not gay. He&#x27;s not straight. He&#x27;s just a character in a children&#x27;s series.&quot;

In May 2007, Polish Ombudsman for Children Ewa Sowińska revisited the matter, and planned to order an investigation. &quot;I noticed that he has a woman&#x27;s handbag, but I didn&#x27;t realise he&#x27;s a boy&quot;, Sowińska said in a public statement. She asked her office&#x27;s psychologists to look into the allegations. After the research in late 2007, she stated: &quot;The opinion of a leading sexologist, who maintains that this series has no negative effects on a child&#x27;s psychology, is perfectly credible. As a result, I have decided that it is no longer necessary to seek the opinion of other psychologists.&quot;

Despite the objections, the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;″s editors included Tinky Winky as the only fictional character in the 2008 inaugural &quot;Happy List&quot;, alongside 99 real-life adults recognised for making Britain a better and happier place.

In response to this controversy, the gay community embraced the Teletubbies, with Tinky Winky leading pride parades and being featured on restaurant menus with themed items. In 2021, WildBrain, owner of the Teletubbies brand, declared their support for the LGBTQ+ community with the statement &quot;Teletubbies Love Pride.&quot; The company released a limited collection of merchandise with proceeds supporting GLAAD. In a statement, WildBrain said, &quot;The Teletubbies have always embraced their own offbeat quirkiness and sense of style. This Pride Month, we&#x27;re celebrating that &#x27;love who you are&#x27; spirit through our Collection of ready-to-rave fashion that makes Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po very proud.&quot; This was followed up by a 30-piece gender-fluid adult fashion collection commemorating Pride 2022.

===&quot;The Lion and the Bear&quot; controversy===

The &quot;magical event&quot; that features a cut-out lion chasing a cut-out bear was criticised for its unsettling cinematography, music, and character design and was deemed inappropriate for children. It was subsequently banned in several countries. In 2000, a revised version of the sketch was aired with adjusted editing, sound design, and voice acting to improve the tone; both versions have been posted online several times.

===Cult following===
Although the programme is aimed at children between the ages of one and four, it had a substantial cult following with older generations, mainly university and college students. The mixture of bright colours, unusual designs, repetitive non-verbal dialogue, ritualistic format, and occasional forays into physical comedy appealed to many who perceived the programme as having psychedelic qualities. Shortly after the premiere of the show, at Imperial College London, the campus activities calendar included airtimes and episode highlights.

===Awards and nominations===
==Other media==
===In popular culture===
* In 2012, during both the second and third series of TVN&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live Korea&quot;, the programme was referenced as &quot;Yeouido Teletubbies&quot; (여의도 텔레토비) to portray the 2012 presidential election campaign. This experimental skit caused the popularity of SNL Korea&#x27;s &quot;Crew&quot;, Kim Seul-gi and Kim Min-kyo, who acted major candidates respectably, to skyrocket.
* A parody of the series was featured in the 2013 &quot;Regular Show&quot; episode &quot;Sleep Fighter&quot;.

The song was written by Andrew McCrorie-Shand and Andrew Davenport, and produced by McCrorie-Shand and Steve James. The single reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1997, and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks after its release.

<text>Terrestrial Time (TT) is a modern astronomical time standard defined by the International Astronomical Union, primarily for time-measurements of astronomical observations made from the surface of Earth.
For example, the Astronomical Almanac uses TT for its tables of positions (ephemerides) of the Sun, Moon and planets as seen from Earth. In this role, TT continues Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT or TD), which succeeded ephemeris time (ET). TT shares the original purpose for which ET was designed, to be free of the irregularities in the rotation of Earth.

The unit of TT is the SI second, the definition of which is based currently on the caesium atomic clock, but TT is not itself defined by atomic clocks. It is a theoretical ideal, and real clocks can only approximate it.

TT is distinct from the time scale often used as a basis for civil purposes, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). TT is indirectly the basis of UTC, via International Atomic Time (TAI). Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, TT is 32.184 s ahead of TAI.

==History==

A definition of a terrestrial time standard was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1976 at its XVI General Assembly and later named &quot;Terrestrial Dynamical Time&quot; (TDT). It was the counterpart to Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), which was a time standard for Solar system ephemerides, to be based on a dynamical time scale. Both of these time standards turned out to be imperfectly defined. Doubts were also expressed about the meaning of &#x27;dynamical&#x27; in the name TDT.

In 1991, in Recommendation IV of the XXI General Assembly, the IAU redefined TDT, also renaming it &quot;Terrestrial Time&quot;. TT was formally defined in terms of Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), defined by the IAU on the same occasion. TT was defined to be a linear scaling of TCG, such that the unit of TT is the &quot;SI second on the geoid&quot;, i.e. the rate approximately matched the rate of proper time on the Earth&#x27;s surface at mean sea level. Thus the exact ratio between TT time and TCG time was formula_1, where formula_2 was a constant and formula_3 was the gravitational potential at the geoid surface, a value measured by physical geodesy. In 1991 the best available estimate of formula_4 was .

In 2000, the IAU very slightly altered the definition of TT by adopting an exact value, .

==Current definition==

TT differs from Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) by a constant rate. Formally it is defined by the equation

formula_5

where TT and TCG are linear counts of SI seconds in Terrestrial Time and Geocentric Coordinate Time respectively, formula_4 is the constant difference in the rates of the two time scales, and formula_7 is a constant to resolve the epochs (see below). formula_4 is defined as exactly . Due to the term formula_1 the rate of TT is very slightly slower than that of TCG.

The equation linking TT and TCG more commonly has the form given by the IAU,

formula_10

where formula_11 is the TCG time expressed as a Julian date (JD). The Julian Date is a linear transformation of the raw count of seconds represented by the variable TCG, so this form of the equation is not simplified. The use of a Julian Date specifies the epoch fully. The above equation is often given with the Julian Date for the epoch, but that is inexact (though inappreciably so, because of the small size of the multiplier formula_4). The value is exactly in accord with the definition.

Time coordinates on the TT and TCG scales are specified conventionally using traditional means of specifying days, inherited from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of Earth. Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used. For continuity with their predecessor Ephemeris Time (ET), TT and TCG were set to match ET at around Julian Date More precisely, it was defined that TT instant and TCG instant exactly correspond to the International Atomic Time (TAI) instant This is also the instant at which TAI introduced corrections for gravitational time dilation.

TT and TCG expressed as Julian Dates can be related precisely and most simply by the equation

formula_13

where formula_14 is exactly.

==Realizations==

TT is a theoretical ideal, not dependent on a particular realization. For practical use, physical clocks must be measured and their readings processed to estimate TT. A simple offset calculation is sufficient for most applications, but in demanding applications, detailed modeling of relativistic physics and measurement uncertainties may be needed.

=== TAI ===
The main realization of TT is supplied by TAI. The BIPM TAI service, performed since 1958, estimates TT using measurements from an ensemble of atomic clocks spread over the surface and low orbital space of Earth. TAI is canonically defined retrospectively, in monthly bulletins, in relation to the readings shown by that particular group of atomic clocks at the time. Estimates of TAI are also provided in real time by the institutions that operate the participating clocks. Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, the TAI realization of TT is defined thus:

formula_15

The offset 32.184 s arises from history. The atomic time scale A1 (a predecessor of TAI) was set equal to UT2 at its conventional starting date of 1 January 1958, when Δ&quot;T&quot; was about 32 seconds. The offset 32.184 seconds was the 1976 estimate of the difference between Ephemeris Time (ET) and TAI, &quot;to provide continuity with the current values and practice in the use of Ephemeris Time&quot;.

TAI is never revised once published and TT(TAI) has small errors relative to TT(BIPM), on the order of 10-50 microseconds.

The GPS time scale has a nominal difference from atomic time , so that . This realization introduces up to a microsecond of additional error, as the GPS signal is not precisely synchronized with TAI, but GPS receiving devices are widely available.

=== TT(BIPM) ===

Approximately annually since 1992, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) has produced better realizations of TT based on reanalysis of historical TAI data. BIPM&#x27;s realizations of TT are named in the form &quot;TT(BIPM08)&quot;, with the digits indicating the year of publication. They are published in the form of a table of differences from TT(TAI), along with an extrapolation equation that may be used for dates later than the table. The latest is TT(BIPM23).

=== Pulsars ===

Researchers from the International Pulsar Timing Array collaboration have created a realization TT(IPTA16) of TT based on observations of an ensemble of pulsars up to 2012. This new pulsar time scale is an independent means of computing TT. The researchers observed that their scale was within 0.5 microseconds of TT(BIPM17), with significantly lower errors since 2003. The data used was insufficient to analyze long-term stability, and contained several anomalies, but as more data is collected and analyzed, this realization may eventually be useful to identify defects in TAI and TT(BIPM).

=== Other standards ===

TT is in effect a continuation of (but is more precisely uniform than) the former Ephemeris Time (ET). It was designed for continuity with ET, and it runs at the rate of the SI second, which was itself derived from a calibration using the second of ET (see, under Ephemeris time, Redefinition of the second and Implementations). The JPL ephemeris time argument Teph is within a few milliseconds of TT.

TT is slightly ahead of UT1 (a refined measure of mean solar time at Greenwich) by an amount known as Δ&quot;T&quot; was measured at +67.6439 seconds (TT ahead of UT1) at 0 h UTC on 1 January 2015; and by retrospective calculation, Δ&quot;T&quot; was close to zero about the year 1900. Δ&quot;T&quot; is expected to continue to increase, with UT1 becoming steadily (but irregularly) further behind TT in the future. In fine detail, Δ&quot;T&quot; is somewhat unpredictable, with 10-year extrapolations diverging by 2-3 seconds from the actual value.

==Relativistic relationships==

Observers in different locations, that are in relative motion or at different altitudes, can disagree about the rates of each other&#x27;s clocks, owing to effects described by the theory of relativity. As a result, TT (even as a theoretical ideal) does not match the proper time of all observers.

In relativistic terms, TT is described as the proper time of a clock located on the geoid (essentially mean sea level).
However,
TT is now actually defined as a coordinate time scale.
The redefinition did not quantitatively change TT, but rather made the existing definition more precise. In effect it defined the geoid (mean sea level) in terms of a particular level of gravitational time dilation relative to a notional observer located at infinitely high altitude.

The present definition of TT is a linear scaling of Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), which is the proper time of a notional observer who is infinitely far away (so not affected by gravitational time dilation) and at rest relative to Earth. TCG is used to date mainly for theoretical purposes in astronomy. From the point of view of an observer on Earth&#x27;s surface the second of TCG passes in slightly less than the observer&#x27;s SI second. The comparison of the observer&#x27;s clock against TT depends on the observer&#x27;s altitude: they will match on the geoid, and clocks at higher altitude tick slightly faster.

<text>The Tatra 600, named the Tatraplan, was a rear-engined large family car (D-segment in Europe) produced from 1948 to 1952 by the Czech manufacturer Tatra. The first prototype was finished in 1946.

==History==

After World War II, Tatra continued its pre-war business of building passenger cars in addition to commercial vehicles and military vehicles. The factory was nationalised in 1946 two years before the Communist takeover. Although production of pre-war models continued, a new model, the Tatra 600 Tatraplan was designed in 1946-47 by Josef Chalupa, Vladimír Popelář, František Kardaus and Hans Ledwinka. The name of the car celebrated the new Communist planned economy but also referred to aeroplane inspiration (&#x27;éroplan&#x27; means aeroplane in colloquial Czech).

Originally the 600 was known as the Tatra 107, continuing from Tatra&#x27;s previous aerodynamic cars- the 77, 87, and 97- as it was intended as a newer, smaller, and cheaper version to replace the outdated Tatra 57. Tatra switched to a new numbering system after WWII, with all car model codes began with 600; as a result, the Tatra 107 became the Tatra 600.

After two prototypes &quot;Ambrož&quot; (December 1946) and &quot;Josef&quot; (March 1947), the 600 went into mass production in 1948. In 1951, the state planning department decided that the Tatraplan should henceforth be built at the Skoda Auto plant in Mladá Boleslav, leaving Tatra to concentrate on truck assembly. This was quite unpopular with the workforce at both plants: as a result Skoda built Tatraplans for one year only before the model was discontinued in 1952.

The Tatraplan had a monocoque streamlined ponton-styled 6-seat fastback saloon body with front suicide doors and a drag coefficient (Cd) of just 0.32. It was powered by an air-cooled flat-four cylinder, 1,952 cc rear-mounted engine. 6,342 were made, 2,100 of them in Mladá Boleslav. In 2010, in the UK, the Tatraplan won the &#x27;Classic Car of the Year&#x27; competition in the 1940s category.

==Models==

* Tatra 107 - original designation of 600.
* Tatra 201 - commercial version of 600, four built (a pickup truck, a panel van, and two ambulances) in 1947. Unlike the 600, the 201 was front-engined.
* Tatra 600 Diesel - similar to 600 but with 2.0L diesel engine, three prototypes built in 1949.
* Tatra 601 Monte Carlo - a 2-door sports car based on the 600, one (possibly two) built in 1949.
* Tatra 602 Tatraplan Sports - a racing car based on the 600, 2 built in 1949.

<text>Taking Children Seriously (TCS) is an exploration of parenting and educational philosophy whose central idea is that children are full people.

==Overview==
TCS was conceived between 1988 and 1989 by Sarah Fitz-Claridge, and later grew into an online mailing-list around 1992.

TCS begins with the observation that most traditional interactions between adults and youth are based on coercion. Instead of viewing some sources of ideas – such as parents’ ideas – as having authority, Taking Children Seriously takes the growth of knowledge seriously, which means free competition of the ideas irrespective of source. 

The TCS model of parenting and education views coercion as infringing on the will of the child, and also rejects parental or educator &quot;self-sacrifice&quot; as infringing on the will of the adult. TCS defines coercion as: &quot;double-binding – putting others in no-win situations – using your ingenuity to actively prevent problems being solved. Authority. Interacting hierarchically. Looking down on.&quot; TCS advocates that parents and children act creatively to find solutions without force or compromise.

The TCS philosophy is informed by the epistemology of Karl Popper and David Deutsch, a theoretical physicist at Oxford University.

<doc id="31030" wikidata="Q92560" url="?curid=31030" title="The Vision of Escaflowne">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series created by Shōji Kawamori with Sunrise Studios and directed by Kazuki Akane. It premiered from April to September 1996, on TV Tokyo. Sony&#x27;s anime satellite channel, Animax also aired the series, both in Japan and on its various worldwide networks, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. It was licensed for Region 1 release by Bandai Entertainment.

The series follows a high school girl named Hitomi, who finds herself pulled from Earth to the planet Gaea when a boy named Van appears on the high school track while battling a dragon. In Gaea, she is caught in the middle of a war as the Zaibach Empire attempts to take over Gaea. Van (King of Fanelia), with aid from Allen (an Asturian Knight), commands his mystical mech Escaflowne in the struggle to stop the Zaibach Empire. Hitomi&#x27;s fortune telling powers blossom in Gaea as she becomes the key to awakening Escaflowne and to stopping Zaibach&#x27;s plans.

While the anime series was in production, two very different manga series retellings were also developed and released: a version of the story entitled &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; and a retelling titled &quot;Hitomi — The Vision of Escaflowne&quot;. In addition, a second manga adaptation called &quot;Escaflowne — Energist&#x27;s Memories&quot; was released as a single volume in 1997. The story was novelized in a series of six light novels by Yumiko Tsukamoto. An anime film, entitled simply &quot;Escaflowne&quot;, was released in June 2000. Four CD soundtracks and a drama CD have also been released in relation to the series.

==Plot==

Gaea is an alternate world that was created from the combined wishes of the inhabitants of Atlantis when it started to sink into the ocean. On Gaea, Earth is known as the Mystic Moon. Gaea&#x27;s size, mass, atmospheric composition, temperature belts, and even seasons are the same as Earth’s. The series focuses on Hitomi Kanzaki and her adventures after she is transported to the world of Gaea, a mysterious planet where she can see Earth and its moon in the sky. Hitomi&#x27;s latent psychic powers are enhanced on Gaea and she quickly becomes embroiled in the conflicts between the Zaibach Empire led by Emperor Isaac Dornkirk and the several peaceful countries that surround it. The conflicts are brought about by the Zaibach Empire&#x27;s quest to revive the legendary power from the ancient city of Atlantis. As the series progresses, many of the characters&#x27; pasts and motivations, as well as the history of Atlantis and the true nature of the planet Gaea, are revealed.

==Production==
Shoji Kawamori first proposed the series after a trip to Nepal, during which he visited the foggy mountain region and pictured a hidden world where an epic focusing on both fate and destiny should be set. When he returned, he proposed the series to Bandai Visual and Sunrise. According to Kawamori, his pitch for the series was simple: &quot;if &quot;Macross&quot; was robotic mecha and love songs, why not a story about robotic mecha and divining powers?&quot;. He worked with Bandai producer Minoru Takanashi to finish fleshing out the original idea. They researched various mysteries for inspiration, particularly stories centered on the mythical land of Atlantis and the Bermuda Triangle. As the series began taking shape, they changed the lead character from a male, to a high school girl as the lead character. Nobuteru Yuki was hired as the character designer, and tasked with crafting a design for Hitomi and the rest of the cast. He would later state that Hitomi was his favorite character because it was the first one he would ever designed completely from scratch rather than simply being adapted from an existing medium. Initially, Folken and Dilandau were a single enemy commander, but as the story was fleshed out, the creators felt the series would be more interesting if there were two with very different personalities.

Initially, Yasuhiro Imagawa was brought on board to direct. He is credited with coining the word &quot;escaflowne&quot;, a Latin-based derivative of the word &quot;escalation&quot;, that would be used in the title. Imagawa imagined a series that was heavily male-oriented and would feature a shapely heroine and dramatic battles. However, he left the project before production started to direct &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot;. Without a director, the series was put on hold and Kawamori left to work on other projects. After two years, Sunrise revisited the project and brought in relative newcomer Kazuki Akane as the new director. To broaden the potential audience, Akane decided to add more girl-oriented elements to the series. The suggestive elements were removed, several of the male characters were given more &quot;beautiful boy&quot; appearances, and the plot element around the tarot cards were added. Akane also redesigned Hitomi, taking her from a curvy, air-headed, long-haired girl with glasses to a slim, athletic, short-haired and more intelligent and confident girl. With the series character designs finalized and the story set, Yoko Kanno was selected to write the songs for the series, including the background songs which she co-wrote with her then-husband Hajime Mizoguchi, with whom she had previously collaborated on the soundtrack for &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot;. Initially they found it difficult to score the series as the plot itself was still being reworked around the new concept, but the plot changes were finished in time for them to prepare the score and give the film the desired final &quot;epic touch.&quot; 16-year-old Maaya Sakamoto, fresh from a small role in the anime adaptation of &quot;Mizuiro Jidai&quot;, was selected not only as the voice of Hitomi, but also to sing the &quot;Escaflowne&quot; theme song. Kanno is noted as saying that Sakamoto is an ideal interpreter of her work. After this project, they continued to collaborate on many other works and some consider her work on &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; to be the launching point of Sakamoto&#x27;s career.

It is said as the series entered into production, the budget required it be cut down to twenty-six episodes before work began on the final scripts and the animation. However the director disputes this in a Panel Q&amp;A for Funimation&#x27;s Kickstarter, where he states the series was always supposed to be 26 episodes. This is clarified by Shoji Kawamori in the Special Edition Booklet for &quot;Escaflowne&quot;, in which he states the original pitch was 39 episodes in 1990, but this version never went into production, it was also radically different in concept and tone. The production really began in 1994 where the show solidified its fantasy aspects and the final format., In an interview during this time Kawamori had said he was unsure what form Escaflowne would take, but eventually it was set on a 26 episode TV anime. In the retail Japanese video release, some of the extended scenes were restored to the first seven episodes.

==Media==
===Anime===

&quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo on April 2, 1996, where it aired weekly until it completed its twenty-six-episode run on September 24, 1996. Bandai Entertainment North American division, which licensed the series for home video distribution under its AnimeVillage label, first released the series with English subtitles, across eight VHS volumes, including a box set, from September 15 to December 15, 1998. In August 2000, Fox Kids Network began broadcasting the series in the United States. Produced by Saban Entertainment under license by Bandai Entertainment, these dubbed episodes were heavily edited to remove footage, add new &quot;flashback&quot; sequences to remind the audience of the events that just occurred, and to heavily downplay the role of Hitomi in the series. The first episode was skipped altogether, and the series soundtrack produced by Yoko Kanno was partially replaced with more techno rearrangements by Inon Zur. This modified version of the series was canceled after ten episodes due to &quot;low ratings&quot;. Fox explained that they edited to meet their own target audience, to comply with broadcast standards, and to fit the allowed timeslot. The Canadian television channel YTV acquired Fox&#x27;s dubbed version of the series for broadcast. Following Fox&#x27;s planned broadcast schedule, they premiered the series on September 11, 2000, with the second episode. YTV aired all of the episodes Fox Kids dubbed, concluding with the series true first episode in February 2001. Bandai began releasing the dubbed version to VHS in 2000, discontinuing the releases in February 2001 after only four volumes had been released.

Bandai later released the entire series, unedited and in the original episode order, to Region 1 DVD. Spanning eight volumes, the releases include the original Japanese audio tracks with optional English subtitles, and the uncut English dubbed track. Bandai also later released the series in several different box sets, including a Limited Edition set released on July 23, 2002, a &quot;Perfect Collection&quot;—which included the &quot;Escaflowne&quot; feature-length movie—released October 26, 2004, and an &quot;Anime Legends&quot; box set on April 11, 2006. At Otakon 2013, Funimation had announced that they have acquired both licenses to &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; and the movie. On February 27, 2016, Funimation launched a Kickstarter campaign to re-dub the Escaflowne TV series using the HD materials from Sunrise, with the goal of $150,000, with it raising over the goal at $318,784. Three pieces of theme music are used for the series. , performed by Maaya Sakamoto, is used for the series opening theme for the entire series, except the first episode in which no opening sequence is used. Performed by Hiroki Wada, &quot;Mystic Eyes&quot; is used for the ending theme for the first twenty-five episodes, while the final episode uses Yoko Kanno&#x27;s instrumental piece . In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the series was made available in its Funimation dub on Channel 4 via All 4. From November 2022 to January 2024, the series streamed on ITV Hub, along with its successor platform, ITVX.

===Soundtracks===
Maaya Sakamoto voiced the main character of Hitomi Kanzaki and performed the opening theme song &quot;Yakusoku wa Iranai&quot; and other songs from the series. Yoko Kanno and Hajime Mizoguchi composed and produced the series&#x27; musical themes and background, incorporating a variety of styles including contemporary, classical, and Gregorian chant. Four CD soundtracks have been released in Japan by Victor Entertainment. &quot;Escaflowne: Over the Sky&quot; was released on June 5, 1996, with sixteen tracks, including the series&#x27; full opening and ending themes. The second CD, &quot;Escaflowne Original Soundtrack 2&quot;, was released on July 24, 1996, and contained an additional seventeen tracks.

Released on September 28, 1996, &quot;Escaflowne Original Soundtrack 3&quot; contained an additional fifteen tracks. The fourth CD soundtrack, &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne: Lovers Only&quot;, was released in on January 22, 1997, and contained twenty tracks, including the original TV length opening and ending themes and the ending theme used for the final episode of the series. Despite the relative popularity of the soundtracks, they were not licensed for release outside Japan for some time and were only available by importing them. However, all 4 soundtracks can now be currently purchased digitally via iTunes.

===Manga===
Three alternate retellings of &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; have been released in manga form, with first two manga series developed at the same time as the anime. Due to the radical changes in the anime series during production, these two manga series are very different from the original anime series and each other. The first series, also titled &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; was one of the first manga series to appear in the then new &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot; magazine from Kadokawa Shoten. Despite the anime series itself being on hold, Sunrise gave artist Katsu Aki the existing production and character designs, resulting in the first series having the heavy manga feel and curvaceous Hitomi that was originally planned for the anime series. Given free rein to change the story however he wanted, Aki&#x27;s version is a violent saga focused primarily on fighting and has Hitomi transforming into a &quot;curvaceous nymph&quot; that is the power source of the mecha Escaflowne. The series premiered in &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot;&#x27;s first issue on October 24, 1994, and ran until November 26, 1997. The thirty-four chapters were collected and published by Kadokawa across eight &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It was licensed for released in North America by Tokyopop with the first volume released on July 8, 2003. The Tokyopop English editions were also imported for distribution in Australia by Madman Entertainment.




In 1996, with the premiere of the anime series, &quot;Messiah Knight — The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; was created. This &quot;shōjo&quot; oriented adaptation was written by Yuzuru Yashiro and serialized in &quot;Asuka Fantasy DX&quot; from April 8, 1996, through January 18, 1997. Unlike the first manga, it focused more on the interaction of the characters and severely toned down the violence to the point that the mecha are not used for battle at all and Escaflowne only appears near the end of the series. It was abruptly canceled after only 10 chapters and the end of the anime, due to the slowing popularity of the series. The individual chapters were released in two &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, at which time the series was retitled &quot;Hitomi — The Vision of Escaflowne.&quot;

A final manga retelling, &quot;Escaflowne — Energist&#x27;s Memories,&quot; was a collaborative effort of various manga artists around Japan to create 15 &quot;mini-stories&quot; related to the anime series. The single volume manga was published in January 1997 under Kadokawa&#x27;s &quot;Asuka comics DX&quot; imprint. Artists who contributed to the volume include: Tammy Ohta, Yayoi Takeda, Kahiro Okuya, Daimoon Tennyo, Kazumi Takahashi, Masaki Sano, and Kyo Watanabe.

===Novels===
Yumiko Tsukamoto and Shoji Kawamori collaborated in the writing on a novelization of the &quot;Vision of Escaflowne&quot; anime series. The light novel chapters were originally serialized in &quot;Newtype&quot;, and the illustrations were provided by Nobuteru Yuuki and Hirotoshi Sano. The individual chapters were collected and released in six individual volumes by Kadokawa under their &quot;New Type Novels&quot; label between June 1996 and August 1997.




===Anime film===

 is an anime film released in Japan on June 24, 2000, that retells the story of the anime series. The film was produced by Sunrise, animated by Studio BONES, and directed by Kazuki Akane. Featuring character re-designs by Nobuteru Yūki, the film focuses on the relationship between Van and Hitomi and their personal issues. The characters themselves are also given different personalities; in the film Hitomi changes from a cheerful girl in love to a depressed, suicidal schoolgirl who suffers from self-induced feelings of loneliness and alienation and Van is now a violent, hot-headed man. In the film the world of Gaea has a more Asian design than the heavily European-influenced television series.

===Other media===
Victor Entertainment released one drama CD for the series, &quot;Escaflowne Original Drama Album&quot;, which was released on December 18, 1996. A video game based on the series, also titled &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; was released to the PlayStation system by Bandai Games in 1997. A limited edition version came packaged with a small collector&#x27;s book and 26 tarot cards. The action-adventure game had an altered plot line and featured additional characters.

==Reception==
Though well received, &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; was not as popular in Japan as producers hoped. Outside Japan, however, it was a worldwide hit. In the United States, it outsold &quot;Gundam&quot; on video tape; and the first volume of the English DVD release of &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; was the fourth best-selling anime DVD for the month of September 2000. The series aired in South Korea where it enjoyed consistently high ratings. Producers noted that it was the worldwide success that led to the eventual creation of the anime film, &quot;Escaflowne&quot;.

Egan Loo, writing for &quot;Animerica&quot;, considered it an &quot;epic fantasy&quot; with some of the &quot;most dramatic music in any soundtrack, anime, or live-action&quot;, and a &quot;breathless pacing&quot; that result in its being an &quot;acclaimed masterpiece.&quot; The Anime Encyclopaedia calls it the &quot;genuine family entertainment, both in and out of the anime world, and arguably the best TV anime of the 1990s&quot;. It is called a &quot;fantastically beautiful series, with striking production design&quot; and an &quot;incredibly well executed fusion of familiar anime genres and devices&quot; by Anime Classics Zettai!.

<doc id="31032" wikidata="Q898483" url="?curid=31032" title="Protein tertiary structure">
<text>Protein tertiary structure is the three-dimensional shape of a protein. The tertiary structure will have a single polypeptide chain &quot;backbone&quot; with one or more protein secondary structures, the protein domains. Amino acid side chains and the backbone may interact and bond in a number of ways. The interactions and bonds of side chains within a particular protein determine its tertiary structure. The protein tertiary structure is defined by its atomic coordinates. These coordinates may refer either to a protein domain or to the entire tertiary structure. A number of these structures may bind to each other, forming a quaternary structure.

== History ==
The science of the tertiary structure of proteins has progressed from one of hypothesis to one of detailed definition. Although Emil Fischer had suggested proteins were made of polypeptide chains and amino acid side chains, it was Dorothy Maud Wrinch who incorporated geometry into the prediction of protein structures. Wrinch demonstrated this with the &quot;Cyclol&quot; model, the first prediction of the structure of a globular protein. Contemporary methods are able to determine, without prediction, tertiary structures to within 5 Å (0.5 nm) for small proteins (&lt;120 residues) and, under favorable conditions, confident secondary structure predictions.
== Determinants ==
=== Stability of native states ===

==== Thermostability ====

A protein folded into its native state or native conformation typically has a lower Gibbs free energy (a combination of enthalpy and entropy) than the unfolded conformation. A protein will tend towards low-energy conformations, which will determine the protein&#x27;s fold in the cellular environment. Because many similar conformations will have similar energies, protein structures are dynamic, fluctuating between these similar structures.

Globular proteins have a core of hydrophobic amino acid residues and a surface region of water-exposed, charged, hydrophilic residues. This arrangement may stabilize interactions within the tertiary structure. For example, in secreted proteins, which are not bathed in cytoplasm, disulfide bonds between cysteine residues help to maintain the tertiary structure. There is a commonality of stable tertiary structures seen in proteins of diverse function and diverse evolution. For example, the TIM barrel, named for the enzyme triosephosphateisomerase, is a common tertiary structure as is the highly stable, dimeric, coiled coil structure. Hence, proteins may be classified by the structures they hold. Databases of proteins which use such a classification include &quot;SCOP&quot; and &quot;CATH&quot;.

==== Kinetic traps ====
Folding kinetics may trap a protein in a high-energy conformation, i.e. a high-energy intermediate conformation blocks access to the lowest-energy conformation. The high-energy conformation may contribute to the function of the protein. For example, the influenza hemagglutinin protein is a single polypeptide chain which when activated, is proteolytically cleaved to form two polypeptide chains. The two chains are held in a high-energy conformation. When the local pH drops, the protein undergoes an energetically favorable conformational rearrangement that enables it to penetrate the host cell membrane.

==== Metastability ====
Some tertiary protein structures may exist in long-lived states that are not the expected most stable state. For example, many serpins (serine protease inhibitors) show this metastability. They undergo a conformational change when a loop of the protein is cut by a protease.

=== Chaperone proteins ===
It is commonly assumed that the native state of a protein is also the most thermodynamically stable and that a protein will reach its native state, given its chemical kinetics, before it is translated. Protein chaperones within the cytoplasm of a cell assist a newly synthesised polypeptide to attain its native state. Some chaperone proteins are highly specific in their function, for example, protein disulfide isomerase; others are general in their function and may assist most globular proteins, for example, the prokaryotic GroEL/GroES system of proteins and the homologous eukaryotic heat shock proteins (the Hsp60/Hsp10 system).

=== Cytoplasmic environment ===
Prediction of protein tertiary structure relies on knowing the protein&#x27;s primary structure and comparing the possible predicted tertiary structure with known tertiary structures in protein data banks. This only takes into account the cytoplasmic environment present at the time of protein synthesis to the extent that a similar cytoplasmic environment may also have influenced the structure of the proteins recorded in the protein data bank.

=== Ligand binding ===
The structure of a protein, such as an enzyme, may change upon binding of its natural ligands, for example a cofactor. In this case, the structure of the protein bound to the ligand is known as holo structure, while the unbound protein has an apo structure.

Structure stabilized by the formation of weak bonds between amino acid side chains
- Determined by the folding of the polypeptide chain on itself (nonpolar residues are located
inside the protein, while polar residues are mainly located outside)
- Envelopment of the protein brings the protein closer and relates a-to located in distant regions of the sequence
- Acquisition of the tertiary structure leads to the formation of pockets and sites suitable for the recognition and
the binding of specific molecules (biospecificity).

== Determination ==
The knowledge of the tertiary structure of soluble globular proteins is more advanced than that of membrane proteins because the former are easier to study with available technology.

=== X-ray crystallography ===
X-ray crystallography is the most common tool used to determine protein structure. It provides high resolution of the structure but it does not give information about protein&#x27;s conformational flexibility.

=== NMR ===
Protein NMR gives comparatively lower resolution of protein structure. It is limited to smaller proteins. However, it can provide information about conformational changes of a protein in solution.

=== Cryogenic electron microscopy ===
Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can give information about both a protein&#x27;s tertiary and quaternary structure. It is particularly well-suited to large proteins and symmetrical complexes of protein subunits.

=== Dual polarisation interferometry ===
Dual polarisation interferometry provides complementary information about surface captured proteins. It assists in determining structure and conformation changes over time.

== Projects ==

=== Prediction algorithm ===
The Folding@home project at the University of Pennsylvania is a distributed computing research effort which uses approximately 5 petaFLOPS (≈10 x86 petaFLOPS) of available computing. It aims to find an algorithm which will consistently predict protein tertiary and quaternary structures given the protein&#x27;s amino acid sequence and its cellular conditions.

A list of software for protein tertiary structure prediction can be found at
List of protein structure prediction software.

=== Protein aggregation diseases ===
Protein aggregation diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Huntington&#x27;s disease and prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy can be better understood by constructing (and reconstructing) disease models. This is done by causing the disease in laboratory animals, for example, by administering a toxin, such as MPTP to cause Parkinson&#x27;s disease, or through genetic manipulation.
Protein structure prediction is a new way to create disease models, which may avoid the use of animals.

===Protein Tertiary Structure Retrieval Project (CoMOGrad)===

Matching patterns in tertiary structure of a given protein to huge number of known protein tertiary structures and retrieve most similar ones in ranked order is in the heart of many research areas like function prediction of novel proteins, study of evolution, disease diagnosis, drug discovery, antibody design etc. The CoMOGrad project at BUET is a research effort to device an extremely fast and much precise method for protein tertiary structure retrieval and develop online tool based on research outcome.

<text>The Great Molasses Flood, also known as the Boston Molasses Disaster, was a disaster that occurred on Wednesday, January 15, 1919, in the North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.

A large storage tank filled with of molasses, weighing approximately burst, and the resultant wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated , killing 21 people and injuring 150. The event entered local folklore and residents reported for decades afterwards that the area still smelled of molasses on hot summer days.

== Flood ==

Molasses can be fermented to produce ethanol, the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages and a key component in munitions. The disaster occurred at the Purity Distilling Company facility at 529Commercial Street near Keany Square. A considerable amount of molasses had been stored there by the company, which used the harborside Commercial Street tank to offload molasses from ships and store it for later transfer by pipeline to the Purity ethanol plant situated between Willow Street and Evereteze Way in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The molasses tank stood tall and in diameter, and contained as much as .

On January 15, 1919, temperatures in Boston had risen above , climbing rapidly from the frigid temperatures of the preceding days, and the previous day, a ship had delivered a fresh load of molasses, which had been warmed to decrease its viscosity for transfer. Possibly due to the thermal expansion of the older, colder molasses already inside the tank, the tank burst open and collapsed at approximately 12:30p.m. Witnesses reported that they felt the ground shake and heard a roar as it collapsed, a long rumble similar to the passing of an elevated train; others reported a tremendous crashing, a deep growling, &quot;a thunderclap-like &quot;, and a sound like a machine gun as the rivets shot out of the tank.

The density of molasses is about , 40 percent more dense than water, resulting in the molasses having a great deal of potential energy. The collapse translated this energy into a wave of molasses high at its peak, moving at . The wave was of sufficient force to drive steel panels of the burst tank against the girders of the adjacent Boston Elevated Railway&#x27;s Atlantic Avenue structure and tip a streetcar momentarily off the El&#x27;s tracks. Stephen Puleo describes how nearby buildings were swept off their foundations and crushed. Several blocks were flooded to a depth of . Puleo quotes a &quot;Boston Post&quot; report:

The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that people &quot;were picked up by a rush of air and hurled many feet&quot;. Others had debris hurled at them from the rush of sweet-smelling air. A truck was picked up and hurled into Boston Harbor. After the initial wave, the molasses became viscous, exacerbated by the cold temperatures, trapping those caught in the wave and making it even more difficult to rescue them. About 150 people were injured, and 21 people and several horses were killed. Some were crushed and drowned by the molasses or by the debris that it carried within. The wounded included people, horses, and dogs; coughing fits became one of the most common ailments after the initial blast. Edwards Park wrote of one child&#x27;s experience in a 1983 article for &quot;Smithsonian&quot;:

== Aftermath ==

First to the scene were 116 cadets under the direction of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from , a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy) that was docked nearby at the playground pier. The cadets ran several blocks toward the accident and entered into the knee-deep flood of molasses to pull out the survivors, while others worked to keep curious onlookers from getting in the way of the rescuers. The Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and Navy personnel soon arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and feeding the exhausted workers. Many of these people worked through the night, and the injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims, and four days elapsed before they stopped searching; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses that they were hard to recognize. Other victims were swept into Boston Harbor and were found three to four months after the disaster.

In the wake of the accident, 119 residents brought a class-action lawsuit against the United States Industrial Alcohol Company (USIA), which had bought Purity Distilling in 1917. It was one of the first class-action suits in Massachusetts and is considered a milestone in paving the way for modern corporate regulation. The company claimed that the tank had been blown up by anarchists because some of the alcohol produced was to be used in making munitions, but a court-appointed auditor found USIA responsible after three years of hearings, and the company ultimately paid out $628,000 in damages ($ in , adjusted for inflation). Relatives of those killed reportedly received around $7,000 per victim (equivalent to $ in ).

=== Cleanup ===
Cleanup crews used salt water from a fireboat to wash away the molasses and sand to absorb it, and the harbor was brown with molasses until summer. The cleanup in the immediate area took weeks, with several hundred people contributing to the effort, and it took longer to clean the rest of Greater Boston and its suburbs. Rescue workers, cleanup crews, and sight-seers had tracked molasses through the streets and spread it to subway platforms, to the seats inside trains and streetcars, to pay telephone handsets, into homes, and to countless other places. It was reported that &quot;Everything that a Bostonian touched was sticky.&quot;

=== Fatalities ===


== Causes ==
Several factors might have contributed to the disaster. The first factor is that the tank may have leaked from the very first day that it was filled in 1915. The tank was also constructed poorly and tested insufficiently, and carbon dioxide production might have raised the internal pressure due to fermentation in the tank. Warmer weather the previous day would have assisted in building this pressure, as the air temperature rose from over that period. The failure occurred from a manhole cover near the base of the tank, and a fatigue crack there possibly grew to the point of criticality.

The tank had been filled to capacity only eight times since it was built a few years previously, putting the walls under an intermittent, cyclical load. Several authors say that the Purity Distilling Company was trying to out-race prohibition, as the 18th amendment was ratified the next day (January 16, 1919) and took effect one year later. An inquiry after the disaster revealed that Arthur Jell, USIA&#x27;s treasurer, neglected basic safety tests while overseeing construction of the tank, such as filling it with water insufficient to check for leaks, and ignored warning signs such as groaning noises each time the tank was filled. He had no architectural or engineering experience. When filled with molasses, the tank leaked so badly that it was painted brown to hide the leakage. Local residents collected leaked molasses for their homes. A 2014 investigation applied modern engineering analysis and found that the steel was half as thick as it should have been for a tank of its size even with the lower standards they had at the time. Another issue was that the steel lacked manganese and was made more brittle as a result. The tank&#x27;s rivets were also apparently flawed, and cracks first formed at the rivet holes.

In 2016, a team of scientists and students at Harvard University conducted extensive studies of the disaster, gathering data from many sources, including 1919 newspaper articles, old maps, and weather reports. The student researchers also studied the behavior of cold corn syrup flooding a scale model of the affected neighborhood. The researchers concluded that the reports of the high speed of the flood were credible.

Two days before the disaster, warmer molasses had been added to the tank, reducing the viscosity of the fluid. When the tank collapsed, the fluid cooled quickly as it spread, until it reached Boston&#x27;s winter evening temperatures and the viscosity increased dramatically. The Harvard study concluded that the molasses cooled and thickened quickly as it rushed through the streets, hampering efforts to free victims before they suffocated.

== Area today ==

United States Industrial Alcohol did not rebuild the tank. The property formerly occupied by the molasses tank and the North End Paving Company became a yard for the Boston Elevated Railway (predecessor to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority). It is now the site of a city-owned recreational complex, officially named Langone Park, featuring a Little League Baseball field, a playground, and bocce courts. Immediately to the east is the larger Puopolo Park, with additional recreational facilities.

A small plaque at the entrance to Puopolo Park, placed by the Bostonian Society, commemorates the disaster. The plaque, titled &quot;Boston Molasses Flood&quot;, reads:

The accident has since become a staple of local culture, not only for the damage the flood brought, but also for the sweet smell that filled the North End for decades after the disaster. According to journalist Edwards Park, &quot;The smell of molasses remained for decades a distinctive, unmistakable atmosphere of Boston.&quot;

On January 15, 2019, for the 100th anniversary of the event, a ceremony was held in remembrance. Ground-penetrating radar was used to identify the exact location of the tank from 1919. The concrete slab base for the tank remains in place approximately below the surface of the baseball diamond at Langone Park. Attendees of the ceremony stood in a circle marking the edge of the tank. The 21 names of those who died in, or as a result of, the flood were read aloud.

Many laws and regulations governing construction were changed as a direct result of the disaster, including requirements for oversight by a licensed architect and civil engineer.

== In popular culture ==
* The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets&#x27; song &quot;Great Molasses Disaster&quot; is about the flood, and their official music video includes many pictures of the aftermath.
* Canadian metal band Protest The Hero&#x27;s song &quot;All Hands&quot; from the album &quot;Palimpsest&quot; is written from the perspective of a victim of the flood. The piano interlude to the song is titled &quot;Harborside&quot;, a reference to the harborside tanks in which the molasses was stored. The last lines of the song references the first hand accounts of the aftermath.
* Comedian and actress Ayo Edebiri, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, passionately spoke about the Great Molasses Flood where she mentions that she was &quot;reduced to tears&quot; talking about the tragedy, where people outside of Boston are far less aware of the event.
* In 2024, Boston-based theatre company Fork &amp; Shoe Theatre Co-op performed &quot;A Pain in the Molasses&quot; by Jael Whitney, a puppet show about the political underpinnings of the disaster, at the Mosesian Center for the Arts.

<text>Edward James Hughes (17 August 1930 – 28 October 1998) was an English poet, translator, and children&#x27;s writer. Critics frequently rank him as one of the best poets of his generation and one of the twentieth century&#x27;s greatest writers. He was appointed Poet Laureate in 1984 and held the office until his death. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Hughes fourth on its list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

He married fellow poet Sylvia Plath, an American, in 1956. They lived together in the United States and then in England, in what was known to be a tumultuous relationship. They had two children before separating in 1962. Plath ended her own life in 1963.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Hughes was born at 1 Aspinall Street, in Mytholmroyd in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to William Henry (1894–1981) and Edith (née Farrar) Hughes (1898–1969). He was raised among the local farms of the Calder Valley and on the Pennine moorland. The third child, Hughes had a brother Gerald (1920–2016), who was ten years older. Next came their sister Olwyn Marguerite Hughes (1928–2016), who was two years older than Ted. 

One of their mother&#x27;s ancestors, Nicholas Ferrar, had founded the Little Gidding community. Most of the more recent generations of the family had worked in the clothing and milling industries in the area. 

Hughes&#x27;s father, William, a joiner, was of Irish descent. He had enlisted with the Lancashire Fusiliers in the First World War and fought at Ypres. He narrowly escaped being killed; he was saved when a bullet hit him but lodged in a pay book in his breast pocket. He was one of just 17 men of his regiment to return from the Dardanelles Campaign (1915–16). 

The stories of Flanders fields filled Hughes&#x27;s childhood imagination (later described in the poem &quot;Out&quot;). Hughes noted, &quot;my first six years shaped everything&quot;.

Hughes loved hunting and fishing, swimming, and picnicking with his family. He attended the Burnley Road School until he was seven. After his family moved to Mexborough, he attended Schofield Street Junior School. His parents ran a newsagent&#x27;s and tobacconist&#x27;s shop in the town. 

In &quot;Poetry in Making&quot;, Hughes recalled that he was fascinated by animals, collecting, and drawing toy lead creatures. He acted as retriever when his elder brother gamekeeper shot magpies, owls, rats, and curlews. He grew up amid the harsh realities of working farms in the valleys and on the moors. 

During his time in Mexborough, he explored Manor Farm at Old Denaby. He later said that he came to know it &quot;better than any place on earth&quot;. His earliest poem &quot;The Thought Fox&quot;, and earliest story &quot;The Rain Horse&quot;, were recollections of the area. At the age of about 13 a friend, John Wholey, took Hughes to his home at Crookhill Lodge, on the Crookhill estate above Conisbrough. There the boys could fish and shoot. Hughes became close to the Wholey family and learnt a lot about wildlife from Wholey&#x27;s father, the head gardener and gamekeeper on the estate. Hughes came to view fishing as an almost religious experience.

Hughes attended Mexborough Secondary School (later Grammar School), where a succession of teachers encouraged him to write, and develop his interest in poetry. Teachers Miss McLeod and Pauline Mayne introduced him to the poets Gerard Manley Hopkins and T.S. Eliot. Hughes was also mentored by teacher John Fisher, and his own sister Olwyn, who was well versed in poetry. Future poet Harold Massingham also attended this school and was mentored by Fisher. In 1946, one of Hughes&#x27;s early poems, &quot;Wild West&quot;, and a short story were published in the grammar school magazine &quot;The Don and Dearne&quot;. He published further poems in 1948. By 16, he had no other thought than being a poet.

During the same year, Hughes won an open exhibition in English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, but chose to do his national service first. His two years of national service (1949–1951) passed comparatively easily. Hughes was stationed as a ground wireless mechanic in the RAF on an isolated three-man station in east Yorkshire. During this time, he had little to do but &quot;read and reread Shakespeare and watch the grass grow&quot;. He learnt many of the plays by heart and memorised great quantities of W. B. Yeats&#x27;s poetry.

===Career===
In 1951 Hughes initially studied English at Pembroke College under M. J. C. Hodgart, an authority on balladic forms. Hughes felt encouraged and supported by Hodgart&#x27;s supervision, but attended few lectures and wrote no more poetry at this time, feeling stifled by literary academia and the &quot;terrible, suffocating, maternal octopus&quot; of literary tradition. He wrote, &quot;I might say, that I had as much talent for Leavis-style dismantling of texts as anyone else, I even had a special bent for it, nearly a sadistic streak there, but it seemed to me not only a foolish game, but deeply destructive of myself.&quot; In his third year, he transferred to Anthropology and Archaeology, both of which would later inform his poetry. He did not excel as a scholar, receiving only a third-class grade in Part I of the Anthropology and Archaeology Tripos in 1954. 

His first published poetry appeared in &quot;Chequer&quot;. A poem, &quot;The little boys and the seasons&quot;, written during this time, was published in &quot;Granta&quot;, under the pseudonym Daniel Hearing.

After university, living in London and Cambridge, Hughes had many varied jobs including working as a rose gardener, a nightwatchman, and a reader for the British film company J. Arthur Rank. He worked at London Zoo as a washer-upper, a post that offered plentiful opportunities to observe animals at close quarters. 

On 25 February 1956, Hughes and his friends held a party to launch &quot;St. Botolph&#x27;s Review&quot;, which had a single issue. In it, Hughes had four poems. At the party, he met American poet Sylvia Plath, who was studying at Cambridge on a Fulbright Scholarship. She had already published extensively, having won various awards, and had come to the party especially to meet Hughes and his fellow poet Lucas Myers. Hughes and Plath felt a great mutual attraction, but they did not meet again for another month, when Plath passed through London on her way to Paris. She visited him again on her return three weeks later.
Hughes and Plath were married on 16 June 1956, at St George the Martyr, Holborn, four months after they had first met. They chose the date, Bloomsday, in honour of Irish writer James Joyce. Plath&#x27;s mother was the only wedding guest. The couple spent most of their honeymoon at Benidorm, in Alicante on Spain&#x27;s Costa Blanca.

Hughes&#x27;s biographers note that Plath did not tell him about her history of depression and suicide attempts until much later. Reflecting later in &quot;Birthday Letters&quot;, Hughes commented that early on he could see chasms of difference between himself and Plath, but that in the first years of their marriage they both felt happy and supported, avidly pursuing their writing careers.

On returning to Cambridge, they lived at 55 Eltisley Avenue. That year they each had poems published in &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Poetry&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. Plath typed up Hughes&#x27;s manuscript for his collection &quot;Hawk in the Rain&quot;, which won a competition run by the Poetry centre of the Young Men&#x27;s and Young Women&#x27;s Hebrew Association of New York. The first prize was publication by Harper. Hughes gained widespread critical acclaim after the book&#x27;s release in September 1957, including a Somerset Maugham Award. The work favoured hard-hitting trochees and spondees reminiscent of Middle English — a style he used throughout his career — over the more genteel latinate sounds.

The couple moved to the United States in 1957 so that Plath could take a teaching position at her alma mater, Smith College. During this time, Hughes taught at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In 1958, they met artist Leonard Baskin, who would later illustrate many of Hughes&#x27;s books, including &quot;Crow&quot;. 

The couple returned to England in 1959, staying for a short while back in Heptonstall and then finding a small flat in Primrose Hill, London. They were both writing: Hughes was working on programmes for the BBC as well as producing essays, articles, reviews, and talks. During this time, he wrote the poems that would later be published in &quot;Recklings&quot; (1966) and &quot;Wodwo&quot; (1967). 

In March 1960, his book &quot;Lupercal&quot; was published, and it won the Hawthornden Prize. He found he was being labelled as the poet of the wild, writing only about animals. Hughes began to seriously explore myth and esoteric practices including shamanism, alchemy and Buddhism, with The Tibetan Book of the Dead being a particular focus in the early 1960s. He believed that imagination could heal dualistic splits in the human psyche, and poetry was the language of that work.

Hughes and Plath had two children, Frieda Hughes (b. 1960) and Nicholas Hughes (1962–2009). In 1961, they bought the house Court Green, in North Tawton, Devon. 

In the summer of 1962, Hughes began an affair with Assia Wevill, who had been subletting the Primrose Hill flat with her husband. Under the cloud of his affair, Hughes and Plath separated in the autumn of 1962. Plath moved back to London and set up life in a new flat with the children.

Letters written by Plath between 18 February 1960 and 4 February 1963, unseen until 2017, accuse Hughes of physically abusing her, including an incident two days before she miscarried their second child in 1961.

===Death of Sylvia Plath===

Beset by depression made worse by her husband&#x27;s affair and with a history of suicide attempts, Plath took her own life on 11 February 1963. 

Hughes dramatically wrote in a letter to an old friend of Plath&#x27;s from Smith College, &quot;That&#x27;s the end of my life. The rest is posthumous.&quot; Some people argued that Hughes had driven Plath to suicide. Plath&#x27;s gravestone in Heptonstall was repeatedly vandalized. Some people were aggrieved that &quot;Hughes&quot; is written on her stone and attempted to chisel it off, leaving only the name &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot;.

Plath&#x27;s poem &quot;The Jailer&quot;, in which the speaker condemns her husband&#x27;s brutality, was included in the 1970 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement&quot;. Poet Robin Morgan published a poem &quot;Arraignment&quot;, in which she openly accused Hughes of the battery and murder of Plath. 

There were lawsuits resulting from the controversy. Morgan&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Monster&quot;, which contained that poem was banned. Underground, pirated editions of it were published. Other radical feminists threatened to kill Hughes in Plath&#x27;s name. In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, a battle raged in the letters pages of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 20 April 1989, Hughes wrote the article &quot;The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace&quot;:

In the years soon after [Plath&#x27;s] death, when scholars approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. But I learned my lesson early... If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, in the hope of correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal to have anything to do with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech... The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know.
As Plath&#x27;s widower, Hughes became the executor of Plath&#x27;s personal and literary estates. He oversaw the posthumous publication of her manuscripts, including &quot;Ariel&quot; (1965). Some critics were dissatisfied by his choice of poem order and omissions in the book. Others who were critical of Hughes personally argued that he had essentially driven Plath to suicide and should not be responsible for her literary legacy. He claimed to have destroyed the final volume of Plath&#x27;s journal, detailing their last few months together. In his foreword to &quot;The Journals of Sylvia Plath&quot;, he defends his actions as a consideration for the couple&#x27;s young children.
Following Plath&#x27;s suicide, Hughes wrote two poems, &quot;The Howling of Wolves&quot; and &quot;Song of a Rat&quot;. He did not write poetry again for three years. He broadcast extensively, wrote critical essays, and became involved in running Poetry International with Patrick Garland and Charles Osborne, in the hopes of connecting English poetry with the rest of the world. 

In 1966, he wrote poems to accompany Leonard Baskin&#x27;s illustrations of crows, which became the epic narrative &quot;The Life and Songs of the Crow&quot;, one of the works for which Hughes is best known. In 1967, while living with Wevill, Hughes produced two sculptures of a jaguar, one of which he gave to his brother and one to his sister. Gerald Hughes&#x27; sculpture, branded with the letter &#x27;A&#x27; on its forehead, was offered for sale in 2012.

On 23 March 1969, six years after Plath&#x27;s suicide, Assia Wevill took her own life by the same method: asphyxiation from a gas stove. Wevill also killed her child, Alexandra Tatiana Elise (nicknamed Shura), the four-year-old daughter of Hughes, born on 3 March 1965. These deaths resulted in reports that Hughes had been abusive to both Plath and Wevill. Hughes did not finish the &quot;Crow&quot; sequence until after his work &quot;Cave Birds&quot; was published in 1975.

===1970–1998===

In August 1970, Hughes married a second time, to Carol Orchard, a nurse. They were together until his death. Heather Clark in her biography of Plath, &quot;Red Comet&quot; (2021), observed that Hughes &quot;would never be faithful to a woman after he left Plath&quot;. 

Hughes bought a house known as Lumb Bank near Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, while still maintaining the property at Court Green. He also began cultivating a small farm near Winkleigh, Devon, called &quot;Moortown&quot;; he used this name as the title of one of his poetry collections. Later he served as the president of the charity Farms for City Children, established by his friend Michael Morpurgo in Iddesleigh.

In 1970 Hughes and his sister Olwyn set up the Rainbow Press. Between 1971 and 1981, it published sixteen titles, comprising poems by Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, Ruth Fainlight, Thom Gunn, and Seamus Heaney. The works were printed by Daedalus Press in Norfolk,&lt;ref name=&quot;ann.skea/Hughes-Press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rampant Lions Press, and the John Roberts Press.

Hughes was appointed Poet Laureate in December 1984, following Sir John Betjeman. A collection of his animal poems for children had been published by Faber earlier that year, &quot;What is the Truth?&quot;, illustrated by R. J. Lloyd. For that work he won the annual Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award. 

Hughes wrote many works for children. He also collaborated closely with Peter Brook and the National Theatre Company. He dedicated himself to the Arvon Foundation, which promotes writing education and has run residential writing courses at Lumb Bank. 

In 1993, Hughes made a rare television appearance for Channel 4, reading passages from his 1968 novel &quot;The Iron Man&quot;. He was featured in the 1994 documentary &quot;Seven Crows A Secret&quot;.

In early 1994, increasingly alarmed by the decline of fish in rivers local to his Devonshire home, Hughes became involved in conservation activism. He was one of the founding trustees of the Westcountry Rivers Trust, a charity established to restore rivers through catchment-scale management and a close relationship with local landowners and riparian owners.
Hughes was appointed a member of the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II just before he died. He had continued to live at the house in Devon, until suffering a fatal heart attack on 28 October 1998 while undergoing hospital treatment for colon cancer in Southwark, London. 

On 3 November 1998, his funeral was held at North Tawton church, and he was cremated in Exeter. Speaking at the funeral, fellow poet Seamus Heaney, said: 
&quot;No death outside my immediate family has left me feeling more bereft. No death in my lifetime has hurt poets more. He was a tower of tenderness and strength, a great arch under which the least of poetry&#x27;s children could enter and feel secure. His creative powers were, as Shakespeare said, still crescent. By his death, the veil of poetry is rent and the walls of learning broken.&quot;

On 16 March 2009, Nicholas Hughes, the son of Hughes and Plath, died by suicide in his home in Alaska He had suffered from depression.

In January 2013, Carol Hughes announced that she would write a memoir of their marriage. &quot;The Times&quot; headlined its story &quot;Hughes&#x27;s widow breaks silence to defend his name&quot; and observed that &quot;for more than 40 years she has kept her silence, never once joining in the furious debate that has raged around the late Poet Laureate since the suicide of his first wife, the poet Sylvia Plath.&quot;

Hughes&#x27;s brother Gerald published a memoir late in 2014, &quot;Ted and I: A Brother&#x27;s Memoir&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as &quot;a warm recollection of a lauded poet&quot;.

==Work==
Hughes&#x27;s first collection, &quot;The Hawk in the Rain&quot; (1957), attracted considerable critical acclaim. In 1959 he won the Galbraith prize, which brought $5,000. His most significant work is perhaps &quot;Crow&quot; (1970), which whilst it has been widely praised also divided critics, combining an apocalyptic, bitter, cynical and surreal view of the universe with what sometimes appeared simple, childlike verse. Crow was edited several times across Hughes&#x27; career. Within its opus he created a cosmology of the totemic Crow who was simultaneously God, Nature and Hughes&#x27; alter ego. The publication of &quot;Crow&quot; shaped Hughes&#x27; poetic career as distinct from other forms of English Nature Poetry.

In a 1971 interview with &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, Hughes cited his main influences as including Blake, Donne, Hopkins, and Eliot. He mentioned also Schopenhauer, Robert Graves&#x27;s book &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, and &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;.

Hughes worked for 10 years on a prose poem, &quot;Gaudete&quot;, which he hoped to have made into a film. It tells the story of the vicar of an English village who is carried off by elemental spirits, and replaced in the village by his enantiodromic double, a changeling, fashioned from a log, who nevertheless has the same memories as the original vicar. The double is a force of nature who organises the women of the village into a &quot;love coven&quot; in order that he may father a new messiah. When the male members of the community discover what is going on, they murder him. The epilogue consists of a series of lyrics spoken by the restored priest in praise of a nature goddess, inspired by Robert Graves&#x27;s &quot;White Goddess&quot;. It was printed in 1977. Hughes was very interested in the relationship between his poetry and the book arts, and many of his books were produced by notable presses and in collaborative editions with artists, for instance with Leonard Baskin.

In addition to his own poetry, Hughes wrote a number of translations of European plays, mainly classical ones. His &quot;Tales from Ovid&quot; (1997) contains a selection of free verse translations from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. He also wrote both poetry and prose for children, one of his most successful books being &quot;The Iron Man&quot;, written to comfort his children after their mother Sylvia Plath&#x27;s suicide. It later became the basis of Pete Townshend&#x27;s 1989 rock opera of the same name, and of the 1999 animated film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, the latter of which is dedicated to his memory. 

Hughes was appointed Poet Laureate in 1984 following the death of John Betjeman. It was later known that Hughes was second choice for the appointment. Philip Larkin, the preferred nominee, had declined, because of ill health and a loss of creative momentum, dying a year later. Hughes served in this position until his death in 1998. In 1992 Hughes published &quot;Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being&quot;, a monumental work inspired by Graves&#x27;s &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. The book, considered Hughes&#x27;s key work of prose, had a mixed reception &quot;divided between those who considered it an important and original appreciation of Shakespeare&#x27;s complete works, whilst others dismissed it as a lengthy and idiosyncratic appreciation of Shakespeare refracted by Hughes&#x27;s personal belief system&quot;. Hughes himself later suggested that the time spent writing prose was directly responsible for a decline in his health. Also in 1992, Hughes published &quot;Rain Charm for the Duchy&quot;, collecting together for the first time his Laureate works, including poems celebrating important royal occasions. The book also contained a section of notes throwing light on the context and genesis of each poem.

In 1998, his &quot;Tales from Ovid&quot; won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award. In &quot;Birthday Letters&quot;, his last collection, Hughes broke his silence on Plath, detailing aspects of their life together and his own behaviour at the time. The book, the cover artwork for which was by their daughter Frieda, won the 1999 Whitbread Prize for poetry.

Hughes&#x27;s definitive 1,333-page &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (Faber &amp; Faber) appeared (posthumously) in 2003. A poem discovered in October 2010, &quot;Last letter&quot;, describes what happened during the three days leading up to Plath&#x27;s suicide. It was published in &quot;New Statesman&quot; on National Poetry Day, October 2010. Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy told Channel 4 News that the poem was &quot;the darkest poem he has ever written&quot; and said that for her it was &quot;almost unbearable to read&quot;.

In 2011, several previously unpublished letters from Hughes to Craig Raine were published in the literary review Areté. They relate mainly to the process of editing &quot;Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being&quot;, and also contain a sequence of drafts of letters in which Raine attempts to explain to Hughes his disinclination to publish Hughes&#x27;s poem &quot;The Cast&quot; in an anthology he was editing, on the grounds that it might open Hughes to further attack on the subject of Sylvia Plath. &quot;Dear Ted, Thanks for the poem. It is very interesting and would cause a minor sensation&quot; (4 April 1997). The poem was eventually published in &quot;Birthday Letters&quot; and Hughes makes a passing reference to this then unpublished collection: &quot;I have a whole pile of pieces that are all – one way or another – little bombs for the studious and earnest to throw at me&quot; (5 April 1997).

===Themes===
Hughes&#x27;s earlier poetic work is rooted in nature and, in particular, the innocent savagery of animals, an interest from an early age. He wrote frequently of the mixture of beauty and violence in the natural world. Animals serve as a metaphor for his view on life: animals live out a struggle for the survival of the fittest in the same way that humans strive for ascendancy and success. Examples can be seen in the poems &quot;Hawk Roosting&quot; and &quot;Jaguar&quot;.

The West Riding dialect of Hughes&#x27;s childhood remained a staple of his poetry, his lexicon lending a texture that is concrete, terse, emphatic, economical yet powerful. The manner of speech renders the hard facts of things and wards off self-indulgence.

Hughes&#x27;s later work is deeply reliant upon myth and the British bardic tradition, heavily inflected with a modernist, Jungian, and ecological viewpoint. He re-worked classical and archetypal myth working with a conception of the dark sub-conscious.

=== Translation ===
In 1965, he founded with Daniel Weissbort the journal &quot;Modern Poetry in Translation&quot;, which involved bringing to the attention of the West the work of Czesław Miłosz, who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Weissbort and Hughes were instrumental in bringing to the English-speaking world the work of many poets who were hardly known, from such countries as Poland and Hungary, then controlled by the Soviet Union. Hughes wrote an introduction to a translation of &quot;Vasko Popa: Collected Poems&quot;, in the &quot;Persea Series of Poetry in Translation&quot;, edited by Weissbort. which was reviewed with favour by premiere literary critic John Bayley of Oxford University in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

==Commemoration and legacy==
A memorial walk was inaugurated in 2005, leading from the Devon village of Belstone to Hughes&#x27;s memorial stone above the River Taw, on Dartmoor, and in 2006 a Ted Hughes poetry trail was built at Stover Country Park, also in Devon. In 2008 &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Hughes fourth on its list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

On 28 April 2011, a memorial plaque for Hughes was unveiled at North Tawton by his widow Carol Hughes. At Lumb Bridge near Pecket Well, Calderdale is a plaque, installed by The Elmet Trust, commemorating Hughes&#x27;s poem &quot;Six Young Men&quot;, which was inspired by an old photograph of six young men taken at that spot. The photograph, taken just before the First World War, was of six young men who were all soon to lose their lives in the war. A Ted Hughes Festival is held each year in Mytholmroyd, led by the Elmet Trust, an educational body founded to support the work and legacy of Hughes.

In 2010, it was announced that Hughes would be commemorated with a memorial in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. On 6 December 2011, a slab of Kirkstone green slate was ceremonially placed at the foot of the memorial commemorating T. S. Eliot. Poet Seamus Heaney and actress Juliet Stevenson gave readings at the ceremony, which was also attended by Hughes&#x27;s widow Carol and daughter Frieda, and by the poets Simon Armitage, Blake Morrison, Andrew Motion and Michael Morpurgo. Motion paid tribute to Hughes as &quot;one of the two great poets of the last half of the last century&quot; (the other being Philip Larkin). Hughes&#x27;s memorial stone bears lines from &quot;That Morning&quot;, a poem recollecting the epiphany of a huge shoal of salmon flashing by as he and his son Nicholas waded a stream in Alaska: &quot;So we found the end of our journey / So we stood alive in the river of light / Among the creatures of light, creatures of light.&quot;

In October 2015, the BBC Two major documentary &quot;Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death&quot; examined Hughes&#x27;s life and work. The programme included contributions from poets Simon Armitage and Ruth Fainlight, broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, biographers Elaine Feinstein and Jonathan Bate, activist Robin Morgan, critic Al Alvarez, publicist Jill Barber, friend Ehor Boyanowsky, patron Elizabeth Sigmund, friend Daniel Huws, Hughes&#x27;s US editor Frances McCullough, and younger cousin Vicky Watling. His daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her father and mother.

===Archive===
Hughes archival material is held by institutions such as Emory University and Exeter University. In 2008, the British Library acquired a large collection comprising over 220 files containing manuscripts, letters, journals, personal diaries, and correspondence. The library archive is accessible through the British Library website.
There is also a Collection Guide available grouping together all of the Hughes material at the British Library with links to material held by other institutions. Inspired by Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Crow&quot; the German painter Johannes Heisig created a large painting series in black and white which was presented to the public for the first time on the occasion of Berlin Museum Long Night in August 2011 at the SEZ Berlin.

===Ted Hughes Award===
In 2009, the Ted Hughes Award for new work in poetry was established with the permission of Carol Hughes. The Poetry Society notes &quot;the award is named in honour of Ted Hughes, Poet Laureate, and one of the greatest twentieth century poets for both children and adults&quot;. Members of the Poetry Society and Poetry Book Society recommend a living UK poet who has completed the newest and most innovative work that year, &quot;highlighting outstanding contributions made by poets to our cultural life&quot;. The £5,000 prize was previously funded from the annual honorarium that former Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy received as Laureate from The Queen.

===Ted Hughes Society===
The Ted Hughes Society, founded in 2010, publishes a peer-reviewed on-line journal, which can be downloaded by members. Its website also publishes news, and has articles on all Hughes&#x27;s major works for free access. The Society staged Hughes conferences in 2010 and 2012 at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and will continue to stage conferences elsewhere.

===Ted Hughes Paper Trail===
On 16 November 2013, Hughes&#x27;s former hometown of Mexborough held a special performance trail, as part of its &quot;Right Up Our Street&quot; project, celebrating the writer&#x27;s connection with the town. The free event included a two-hour ramble through Mexborough following the route of young Hughes&#x27;s paper round. Participants visited some of the important locations which influenced the poet, with the trail beginning at Hughes&#x27;s former home, which is now a furniture shop.

===Elmet Trust===
The Elmet Trust, founded in 2006, celebrates the life and work of Ted Hughes. The Trust looks after Hughes&#x27;s birthplace in Mytholmroyd, which is available as a holiday let and writer&#x27;s retreat. The Trust also runs Hughes-related events, including an annual Ted Hughes Festival.

<text>Thomas Wolsey ( ; – 29 November 1530) was an English statesman and Catholic cardinal. When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the king&#x27;s almoner. Wolsey&#x27;s affairs prospered and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state. He also held important ecclesiastical appointments. These included the Archbishop of York—the second most important role in the English church—and that of papal legate. His appointment as a cardinal by Pope Leo X in 1515 gave him precedence over all other English clergy.

The highest political position Wolsey attained was Lord Chancellor, the king&#x27;s chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple Thomas Cromwell was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as the &quot;alter rex&quot; (&quot;other king&quot;). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfil his ecclesiastical duties as archbishop, a position he nominally held but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason—charges Henry commonly used against ministers who fell out of his favour—but died from natural causes on the way.

==Early life==
Thomas Wolsey was born in about 1473, the son of Robert Wolsey of Ipswich and his wife, Joan Daundy. Widespread traditions identify his father as a butcher; his modest origin became a topic of criticism later, when he amassed wealth and power that critics thought more befitting a member of the high nobility. Wolsey attended Ipswich School and Magdalen College School before studying theology at Magdalen College, Oxford.

On 10 March 1498, he was ordained as a priest in Marlborough, Wiltshire, and remained in Oxford, first as the Master of Magdalen College School, and soon the dean of divinity. From 1500 to 1509, Wolsey held a living as rector of St Mary&#x27;s church, Limington, in Somerset.

In 1502, he became a chaplain to Henry Deane, archbishop of Canterbury, who died the following year. He was then taken into the household of Sir Richard Nanfan, who made Wolsey executor of his estate. After Nanfan&#x27;s death in 1507, Wolsey entered the service of King Henry VII.

Wolsey benefited from Henry VII&#x27;s introduction of measures to curb the power of the nobility; the king was willing to favour those from more humble backgrounds. Henry VII appointed Wolsey royal chaplain. In this position Wolsey served as secretary to Richard Foxe, who recognised Wolsey&#x27;s ability, dedication, industry and willingness to take on tedious tasks. Wolsey&#x27;s remarkable rise to power from humble origins attests to his intelligence, administrative ability, industriousness, ambition, and rapport with the king. In April 1508, Wolsey was sent to Scotland to discuss with King James IV rumours of the renewal of the Auld Alliance.

Wolsey&#x27;s rise coincided with the accession in April 1509 of Henry VIII, whose character, policies and attitude to diplomacy differed significantly from his father&#x27;s. In 1509 Henry appointed Wolsey to the post of almoner, a position that gave him a seat on the Privy Council and an opportunity to attain greater prominence and establish personal rapport with the king. A factor in Wolsey&#x27;s rise was the young Henry VIII&#x27;s relative lack of interest in the details of government during his early years.

== Political career ==
===Rise to prominence===
The primary counsellors Henry VIII inherited from his father were Richard Foxe ( 1448–1528, Bishop of Winchester 1501–1528) and William Warham ( 1450–1532, Archbishop of Canterbury 1503–1532). They were cautious and conservative, advising the king to act as a careful administrator like his father. Henry soon appointed to his Privy Council men more sympathetic to his own views and inclinations. Until 1511, Wolsey was adamantly antiwar, but when the king expressed his enthusiasm for an invasion of France, Wolsey adapted his views to the king&#x27;s and gave persuasive speeches to the Privy Council in favour of war. Warham and Foxe, who did not share the king&#x27;s enthusiasm for the French war, fell from power (1515/1516), and Wolsey took over as the king&#x27;s most trusted advisor and administrator. When Warham resigned as Lord Chancellor in 1515, probably under pressure from Wolsey, Henry appointed Wolsey in his place.

Wolsey made careful moves to destroy or neutralise other courtiers&#x27; influence. He helped cause the fall of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham in 1521, and in 1527 he prosecuted, unsuccessfully, Henry&#x27;s close friend William Compton and Henry&#x27;s ex-mistress Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon, for adultery. In the case of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Wolsey adopted a different strategy, attempting to win Suffolk&#x27;s favour by his actions after the duke secretly married Henry&#x27;s sister Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France, much to the king&#x27;s displeasure. Wolsey advised the king not to execute the newlyweds but to embrace them; whether this was out of care for the couple or because of the threat they posed to his own safety remains unclear. The bride, both as sister to Henry and as Dowager Queen of France, had high royal status that could have threatened Wolsey had she so chosen.

Wolsey&#x27;s rise to a position of great secular power paralleled his increasing status in the church. He became a canon of Windsor in 1511. In 1514 he was made Bishop of Lincoln and then Archbishop of York in the same year. Pope Leo X made him a cardinal in 1515, with the titular church of St Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1518 he was appointed as abbot of St. Albans and bishop of Bath. Following the success of the English campaign in France and the peace negotiations that followed, Wolsey&#x27;s ecclesiastical career advanced further: in 1523 he became Bishop of Durham, a post with wide political powers, and thus became known as Prince-Bishop of Durham. In 1529 he moved on from the bishop position in Durham to become the Bishop of Winchester. With his roles in the church came great wealth and estates, and with the accumulation of his different roles in the church he made upwards of £35,000 a year.

The Anglo-French War (1512–14) gave Wolsey a significant opportunity to demonstrate his talents in foreign policy. A convenient justification for going to war came in 1511 in the form of a plea for help from Pope Julius II, who was beginning to feel threatened by France. England formed an alliance with Julius, King Ferdinand II of Aragon, and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor against King Louis XII of France.

The first English campaign against France proved unsuccessful, partly due to the unreliability of the alliance with Ferdinand. Henry learned from the mistakes of the campaign and in 1513, still with papal support, launched a joint attack on France with Maximilian, successfully capturing two French cities and causing the French to retreat. Wolsey&#x27;s ability to keep a large number of troops supplied and equipped for the duration of the war proved a major factor in the English success. He also had a key role in negotiating the Anglo-French treaty of 7 August 1514, which secured a temporary peace between the two nations. Under this treaty, Louis XII would marry Henry&#x27;s young sister, Mary. In addition England was able to keep the captured city of Tournai and secure an increase in the annual pension France paid.

Meanwhile, a turnover of rulers in Europe threatened to diminish England&#x27;s influence. With Henry&#x27;s sister, Mary, married to Louis XII on 9 October 1514, an alliance was formed, but Louis was not in good health. Less than three months later, he died and was succeeded by the young and ambitious Francis I.

Queen Mary had allegedly secured a promise from Henry that if Louis died, she could marry whomever she pleased. Following Louis&#x27;s death, she secretly married Suffolk, with Francis I&#x27;s assistance, which prevented another marriage alliance. As Mary was the only princess Henry could use to secure marriage alliances, this was a bitter blow. Wolsey then proposed an alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire against France.

===Papal legate===
The death of Ferdinand II of Aragon, Henry VIII&#x27;s father-in-law and England&#x27;s closest ally, in 1516 was a further blow. Ferdinand was succeeded by Charles V, who immediately proposed peace with France. After Maximilian I&#x27;s death in 1519, Charles was elected in his stead; thus Charles ruled a substantial portion of Europe and English influence became limited on the continent.

But Wolsey managed to assert English influence by other means. In 1517, Pope Leo X sought peace in Europe to form a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. In 1518 Wolsey was made Papal Legate in England, enabling him to realise Leo&#x27;s desire for peace by organising the Treaty of London. The treaty showed Wolsey as the arbiter of Europe, organising a massive peace summit involving 20 nations. This put England at the forefront of European diplomacy and drew her out of isolation, making her a desirable ally. This is well illustrated by the Anglo-French treaty signed two days afterwards. It was partly this peace treaty that caused conflict between France and Spain. In 1519, when Charles V ascended to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor, King Francis I of France was infuriated. He had invested enormous sums in bribing the electorate to elect him emperor, and thus used the Treaty of London as a justification for the Habsburg-Valois conflict. Wolsey appeared to act as mediator between the two powers, both of which were vying for England&#x27;s support.

===Field of the Cloth of Gold===
Another of Wolsey&#x27;s diplomatic triumphs was the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. Wolsey organised much of this grandiose meeting between Francis I and Henry VIII, accompanied by 5,000 followers and involving court activities more than military discussion. Though it seemed to open the door to peaceful negotiations with France if the king wished, it was also a chance for a lavish display of English wealth and power before the rest of Europe, through flamboyant celebrations and events such as jousting, with the two kings competing, though not against each other. With France and Spain vying for England&#x27;s allegiance, Wolsey could choose the ally that better suited his policies. Wolsey chose Charles mainly because England&#x27;s economy would suffer from the loss of the lucrative cloth trade industry between England and the Netherlands had France been chosen instead.

Under Wolsey&#x27;s guidance, Europe&#x27;s chief nations sought to outlaw war among Christian nations. Garrett Mattingly, who has studied the causes of wars in that era, found that treaties of non-aggression such as this one could never be stronger than their sponsors&#x27; armies. When those forces were about equal, the treaties typically widened the conflict. That is, diplomacy could sometimes postpone war, but could not prevent wars based on irreconcilable interests and ambitions. What was lacking, Mattingly concludes, was a neutral power whose judgements were generally accepted either by impartial justice or by overwhelming force.

===Alliance with Spain===
The Treaty of London is often regarded as Wolsey&#x27;s finest moment, but it was abandoned within a year. Wolsey developed links with Charles in 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. At the Calais Conference Wolsey signed the Secret Treaty of Bruges (1521) with Charles V, stating that England would join Spain in a war against France if France refused to sign the peace treaty and ignored the Anglo-French treaty of 1518. Wolsey&#x27;s relationship with Rome was also ambivalent. Despite his links to the papacy, Wolsey was strictly Henry&#x27;s servant. Though the Treaty of London was an elaboration on Pope Leo&#x27;s ambitions for European peace, it was seen in Rome as a vain attempt by England to assert her influence over Europe and steal some papal thunder. Furthermore, Wolsey&#x27;s peace initiatives prevented a crusade to the Holy Land, which was the catalyst for the Pope&#x27;s desire for European peace.

Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio, who represented the Pope at the Treaty of London, was kept waiting for many months in Calais before being allowed to cross the Channel and join the festivities in London in what may have been a display by Wolsey of his independence of Rome. An alternative hypothesis is that Campeggio was kept waiting until Wolsey received his legacy, thus asserting Wolsey&#x27;s attachment to Rome.

Though the English gain from the wars of 1522–23 was minimal, their contribution certainly aided Charles V in his defeat of the French, particularly in 1525 at the Battle of Pavia, where Charles&#x27;s army captured Francis I. Henry then felt there was a realistic opportunity for him to seize the French crown, to which the kings of England had long laid claim. Parliament, however, refused to raise taxes. This led Wolsey to devise the Amicable Grant, which was met with even more hostility, and contributed to his downfall. In 1525, after Charles V had abandoned England as an ally, Wolsey began to negotiate with France, and the Treaty of the More was signed, during Francis I&#x27;s captivity, with the Regent of France—his mother, Louise of Savoy.

The closeness between England and Rome can be seen in the formulation of the League of Cognac in 1526. Though England was not part of it, the League was organised in part by Wolsey with papal support. Wolsey&#x27;s plan was that the League of Cognac, an alliance between France and some Italian states, would challenge Charles&#x27;s League of Cambrai. This was both a gesture of allegiance to Rome and an answer to growing concerns about Charles&#x27;s dominance over Europe.

The final blow to this policy came in 1529, when the French made peace with Charles. Meanwhile, the French also continued to honour the &quot;Auld Alliance&quot; with Scotland, stirring up hostility on England&#x27;s border. With peace between France and the Emperor, there was no-one to free the Pope from Charles, who had effectively held Pope Clement VII captive since the Sack of Rome (1527). There was thus little hope of securing Henry VIII an annulment from his marriage to Charles&#x27;s aunt Catherine of Aragon. Since 1527, Wolsey&#x27;s desire to secure an annulment for his master had dictated his foreign policy, and by 1529 none of his endeavours had succeeded.

===Annulment===

Henry&#x27;s marriage to Queen Catherine of Aragon had produced no sons who survived infancy; the Wars of the Roses were still within living memory, leading to the fear of a power struggle after Henry&#x27;s death. Henry felt the people would accept only a male sovereign, not his daughter Mary. He believed God had cursed him for the sin of marrying the widow of his elder brother, and that the papal dispensation for that marriage was invalid because it was based upon the claim that Catherine was still a virgin after her first husband&#x27;s death. Henry argued that Catherine&#x27;s claim was not credible, and thus the dispensation must be withdrawn and the marriage annulled. His motivation has been attributed to his determination to have a son and heir, and to his desire for Anne Boleyn, one of his wife&#x27;s maids-of-honour. Queen Catherine had no further pregnancies after 1519; Henry began annulment proceedings in 1527.

Catherine, however, maintained that she had been a virgin when she married Henry. Because she opposed annulment and a return to her previous status as Dowager Princess of Wales, the annulment request became a matter of international diplomacy, with Catherine&#x27;s nephew Charles V pressuring Clement not to annul the marriage. Clement faced a dilemma: he would anger either Charles or Henry. He delayed his decision as long as possible, infuriating Henry and Anne Boleyn, who began to doubt Wolsey&#x27;s loyalty to the Crown over the Church.

Wolsey appealed to Clement for an annulment on three fronts. First, he tried to convince the Pope that the dispensation was void as the marriage clearly disobeyed instructions in the book of Leviticus. Second, Wolsey objected to the dispensation on technical grounds, claiming it was incorrectly worded. (Shortly afterwards, a correctly worded version was found in Spain.) Third, Wolsey wanted Clement to let the final decision be made in England, which, as papal legate, he would supervise.

In 1528 Clement decided to allow two papal legates to decide the outcome in England: Wolsey and Campeggio. Wolsey was confident of the decision, but Campeggio took a long time to arrive, and when he finally did, he delayed proceedings so much that the case had to be suspended in July 1529, effectively sealing Wolsey&#x27;s fate.

==Domestic achievements==

During his 14 years as chancellor, Wolsey had more power than any other Crown servant in English history. This led to his being hated by much of the nobility, who believed that power should be theirs. The king protected him from being attacked. As long as he was in the king&#x27;s favour, Wolsey had great freedom in domestic matters, and had his hand in nearly every aspect of them. For much of the time, Henry VIII had complete confidence in him, and as Henry&#x27;s interests inclined more towards foreign policy, he was willing to give Wolsey free rein in reforming the management of domestic affairs, for which Wolsey had grand plans. Historian John Guy explains Wolsey&#x27;s methods:

Operating with the king&#x27;s firm support, and with special powers over the church given by the Pope as legate, Wolsey dominated civic affairs, administration, the law, the church, and foreign policy. He was amazingly energetic and far-reaching. He built a great fortune for himself and was a major benefactor of arts, humanities and education. He projected numerous reforms, with some success in areas such as finance, taxation, educational provision and justice. From the king&#x27;s perspective, his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when Henry wanted a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne. Historians agree that Wolsey was a man dogged by other men&#x27;s failures and his own ambition. In the end, abandoned by the king, Wolsey was charged with treason, but died of natural causes before he could be beheaded.

===Taxation===
Wolsey made changes to the taxation system, devising, with treasurer of the Chamber John Heron, the &quot;Subsidy&quot;. This form of tax was based upon accurate valuations of the taxpayer&#x27;s wealth, where one shilling was taken per pound from the income. The old fixed tax of 15ths and 10ths meant that those who earned very little had to pay almost as much as the wealthy. With the new income tax the poorer members of society paid much less. This more progressive form of taxation enabled Wolsey to raise enough money for the king&#x27;s foreign expeditions, bringing in over £300,000. He also raised considerable capital through other means, such as &quot;benevolences&quot;, and enforced loans from the nobility, which yielded £200,000 in 1522. Ultimately, Wolsey&#x27;s fiscal policy became increasingly disliked- his forced loans and benevolences culminated in the Amicable Grant (1525). This was met with hostility as the Amicable Grant provoked &#x27;full-scale revolt in Suffolk... the most serious rebellion since 1497&#x27; (Cornish rebellion).

===Justice===
As a legal administrator, Wolsey reinvented the equity court, where the verdict was decided by the judge on the principle of &quot;fairness&quot;. As an alternative to the Common Law courts, Wolsey re-established the position of the prerogative courts of the Star Chamber and the Court of Chancery. The system in both courts concentrated on simple, inexpensive cases, and promised impartial justice. He also established the Court of Requests (although this court was only given this name later on) for the poor, where no fees were required. Wolsey&#x27;s legal reforms were popular, and overflow courts were required to attend to all the cases. Many powerful men who had felt invincible under the law found themselves convicted; for example, in 1515, the Earl of Northumberland was sent to Fleet Prison and in 1516 Lord Abergavenny was accused of illegal retaining.

Wolsey also used his courts to tackle national controversies, such as the pressing issue of enclosures. The countryside had been thrown into discord by the entrepreneurial actions of landlords enclosing areas of land and converting from arable farming to pastoral farming, requiring fewer workers. The Tudors valued stability, and the resulting mass urban migration represented a serious crisis. Wolsey conducted national enquiries into enclosures in 1517, 1518 and 1527. In the course of his administration, he used the Court of Chancery to prosecute 264 landowners, including peers, bishops, knights, religious heads, and Oxford colleges. Enclosures were seen as directly linked to rural unemployment and depopulation, vagrancy, food shortages and, accordingly, inflation. This pattern repeated in many of Wolsey&#x27;s other initiatives, particularly his quest to abolish enclosure. Despite spending significant time and effort investigating the state of the countryside and prosecuting numerous offenders, Wolsey freely surrendered his policy during the parliament of 1523 to ensure that Parliament passed his proposed taxes for Henry&#x27;s war in France. Enclosures remained a problem for many years.

Wolsey used the Star Chamber to enforce his 1518 policy of &quot;Just Price&quot;, which attempted to regulate the price of meat in London and other major cities. Those found to be charging too much were prosecuted by the Chamber. After the bad harvest of 1527, Wolsey bought up surplus grain and sold it off cheaply to the needy. This greatly eased disorder and became common practice after a disappointing harvest.

===Church reforms===
In 1524 and 1527 Wolsey used his powers as papal legate to dissolve 30 decayed monasteries where monastic life had virtually ceased in practice, some in Ipswich and Oxford. He used the income to found a grammar school in Ipswich (The King&#x27;s School, Ipswich) and Cardinal College in Oxford (in 1532, after Wolsey&#x27;s fall, the king renamed it King Henry VIII&#x27;s College; it is now known as Christ Church). In 1528 he began to limit the benefit of clergy. He also attempted, as legate, to force reform on monastic orders like the Augustinian canons.

Wolsey died five years before Henry&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries began.

===Relationships===
Wolsey&#x27;s power depended on maintaining good relations with Henry. He grew increasingly suspicious of the &quot;minions&quot;—young, influential members of the Privy chamber—particularly after infiltrating one of his own men into the group. He attempted many times to disperse them from court, giving them jobs that took them to the Continent and far from Henry. After the Amicable Grant failed, the minions began to undermine him again. Consequently, Wolsey devised a grand plan of administrative reforms, incorporating the notorious Eltham ordinances of 1526. This reduced the members of the Privy Council from 12 to 6, removing Henry&#x27;s friends such as Sir William Compton and Nicholas Carew.

One of Wolsey&#x27;s greatest impediments was his lack of popularity amongst the nobles at court and in Parliament. Their dislikes and mistrusts partly stemmed from what they saw as Wolsey&#x27;s excessive demands for money in the form of the Subsidy or benevolences. They also resented the Act of Resumption of 1486, by which Henry VII had resumed possession of all lands granted by the crown since 1455. These lands had passed onto his heir, Henry VIII. Many nobles resented the rise to power of a low-born man, whilst others simply disliked that he monopolised the court and concealed information from the Privy Council.

When mass riots broke out in East Anglia, which should have been under the control of the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, Henry was quick to denounce the Amicable Grant, and began to lose faith in Wolsey. During the relatively peaceful period in England after the War of the Roses, its population increased. With more demand for food and no additional supply, prices increased. Landowners were forced to enclose land and convert to pastoral farming, which brought in more profit. Wolsey&#x27;s quest against enclosure was fruitless in terms of restoring economic stability.

The same can be said for Wolsey&#x27;s legal reforms. After he made justice accessible to all and encouraged more people to bring cases to court, the system was abused. The courts became overloaded with incoherent, tenuous cases, which would have been far too expensive to have rambled on in the Common Law courts. Wolsey eventually ordered all minor cases out of the Star Chamber in 1528. The result of this venture was further resentment by the nobility and the gentry.

===Art patronage ===
From 1515, when he became cardinal, until his death, Wolsey used art and architecture to underpin his positions. He initiated a building campaign on a scale not only unprecedented for an English churchman and Lord Chancellor, but also exceeded by few English kings. In so doing, he brought Italian Renaissance ideas, classical embellishments, and architectural models into English architecture. Scholars generally cite Somerset House in London (1547–1552) as the first classical building in England, built for Edward Seymour, the first Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector to King Edward VI. But Wolsey embraced Italian-inspired classicism nearly half a century before Seymour, though more theoretically than visually. Wolsey&#x27;s subsequent disgrace over his failure to garner papal approval of an annulment of Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon has clouded the fact that he was not only the first high-profile patron in England to seek out and promote Italian classicism in art, architecture, and magnificence, but also that his contributions endured.

Among Wolsey&#x27;s projects were lavish, classically inspired additions to York Palace in London, the Archbishop of York&#x27;s residence. He supervised the grandiose temporary buildings at the Field of Cloth of Gold and renovated Hampton Court, which he later relinquished to the king. Wolsey&#x27;s use of architecture as a symbol of power, along with his introduction of Italian classical ornamentation, set a trend continued by Henry VIII and others. Wolsey oversaw tombs for Henry&#x27;s VIII&#x27;s parents at Westminster Abbey and negotiated contracts for Henry VIII&#x27;s tomb as well as one for himself. If these works had been completed as planned, they would be among Europe&#x27;s largest, most elaborate, and grandest tombs. The college originally founded and planned by Wolsey and refounded by Henry VIII (Christ Church) remains the largest and grandest of all Oxford colleges.

===Failures with the Church===
As well as his State duties, Wolsey simultaneously attempted to exert his influence over the Church in England. As cardinal and, from 1524, lifetime papal legate, Wolsey continually vied for control over others in the Church. His principal rival was William Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who made it more difficult for Wolsey to follow through with his plans for reform. Despite making promises to reform the bishoprics of England and Ireland, and, in 1519, encouraging monasteries to embark on a programme of reform, he did nothing to bring about these changes.

==Downfall and death==
In spite of having many enemies, Wolsey retained Henry VIII&#x27;s confidence until Henry decided to seek an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon so that he could marry Anne Boleyn. Wolsey&#x27;s failure to secure the annulment directly caused his downfall and arrest. It was rumoured that Anne Boleyn and her faction convinced Henry that Wolsey was deliberately slowing proceedings; as a result, he was arrested in 1529, and the Pope decided that the official decision should be made in Rome, not England.

In 1529, Wolsey was stripped of his government office and property, including his magnificently expanded residence of Palace of Whitehall, which Henry took to replace the Palace of Westminster as his own main London residence. Wolsey was permitted to remain Archbishop of York. He travelled to Yorkshire for the first time in his career, but when he was staying at one of the Archbishop&#x27;s residences, Cawood in north Yorkshire, he was accused of treason and ordered to London by Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland.

In great distress, Wolsey left Cawood Castle on the evening of 7 November. He lodged at Pomfret Abbey in Pontefract that night and the following day made it to Sheffield Castle, where he spent the next 14 days hosted by George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury.

At Sheffield, Wolsey fell seriously ill with dysentery. Taken into custody by Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower, Wolsey left for Hardwick Hall on 25 November. He was so ill that Kingston&#x27;s guards believed Wolsey to be dying, and wept openly. Spending the night in the city of Nottingham, Wolsey proceeded to Leicester Abbey in the city of Leicester. He was so weak, he could barely sit on his mule. He reached the abbey on the evening of 27 November, and had to be carried upstairs.

Wolsey remained in bed the next day, his health rapidly failing. He began to lose his sight, and repeatedly lost consciousness the night of 28 to 29 November. He made confession at 7 a.m. on 29 November, and died an hour later.

Wolsey was buried in a simple pine coffin, dressed in his episcopal robes and with his cross, mitre, and ring. He lay in state at the abbey until 5 p.m. on 29 November, after which is body was moved to abbey church. Funeral mass was sung at 4 a.m. on 1 December, and he was buried two hours later.

Leicester Abbey was turned over to William Cavendish after the dissolution of the monasteries. His son tore down the abbey, and the site of Wolsey&#x27;s burial was lost. (The site of the former abbey is now Abbey Park.)

In keeping with his practice of erecting magnificent buildings at Hampton Court, Westminster and Oxford, Wolsey had planned a magnificent tomb at Windsor by Benedetto da Rovezzano and Giovanni da Maiano. Henry VIII contemplated using the impressive black sarcophagus for himself, but Lord Nelson now lies in it, in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Henry often receives credit for artistic patronage that properly belongs to Wolsey.

==Mistress and issue==
Wolsey lived in a &quot;non-canonical&quot; marriage for around a decade with a woman called Joan Larke of Yarmouth, Norfolk. The edict that priests, regardless of their functions or the character of their work, should remain celibate had not been wholeheartedly accepted in England.

Wolsey had two children, both before he was made bishop: a son, Thomas Wynter (born circa 1510), and a daughter, Dorothy (born circa 1512), both of whom lived to adulthood. The son was sent to live with a family in Willesden and tutored in his early years by Maurice Birchinshaw. He later married and had children of his own. Dorothy was adopted by John Clansey, and was in due course placed in the convent at Shaftesbury Abbey.

Following the dissolution of the monasteries under Thomas Cromwell she was awarded a pension.

Following his rapid promotion, Larke became a source of embarrassment to Wolsey, who arranged for her marriage to George Legh of Adlington, in Cheshire, circa 1519. He provided the dowry. Henry VIII had a mansion built for Legh at Cheshunt Great House.

==Fictional portrayals==
* Wolsey plays a major role in the early stages of &quot;the Autobiography of Henry VIII&quot; by Margaret George.
* Wolsey is the primary antagonist of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, which depicts him as an arrogant power-grabber. Henry Irving, Walter Hampden and John Gielgud were well known for their stage performances of the role, and Timothy West played him in the 1979 BBC Television Shakespeare production of that play. Henry Irving&#x27;s reading of Wolsey&#x27;s Farewell survives on a rare wax cylinder recording.
* Wolsey is a minor but important character in Robert Bolt&#x27;s play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;; he was played in the two film versions of the play by Orson Welles (1966) and John Gielgud (1988), respectively.
* Wolsey was portrayed somewhat more sympathetically in the film &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969), a performance that earned Anthony Quayle an Academy Award nomination.
* Wolsey was played by John Baskcomb in &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970) and by John Bryans when the series was made into the film &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot; (1972).
* David Suchet plays Wolsey in the 2003 two-part television serial &quot;Henry VIII&quot; with Ray Winstone.
* Terry Scott portrayed a comical Wolsey in &quot;Carry On Henry&quot; (1970).
* William Griffis played Wolsey in the Broadway musical &quot;Rex&quot; (1976), which starred Nicol Williamson as Henry.
* In the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot; (2007), Sam Neill plays Wolsey. This production interprets his death as suicide by cutthroat, covered up by the king and Cromwell out of residual affection for him.
* Roger Ashton-Griffiths portrays Wolsey in David Starkey&#x27;s 2009 documentary series &quot;Henry VIII: The Mind of a Tyrant&quot;.
* Wolsey is one of the main characters in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novel &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2009), played by Paul Jesson in the RSC production and by Jonathan Pryce in the first and second television series. He is portrayed through Cromwell&#x27;s eyes as a mentor and a ruthlessly loyal statesman. A desire to avenge Wolsey&#x27;s downfall and ignominious death fuels many of Cromwell&#x27;s actions through the latter half of &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; and its sequel &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot;, which was incorporated into the stage and television adaptations.
* In the TVE series &quot;Carlos, rey emperador&quot; (2015), he is portrayed by Blai Llopis.
* Wolsey appears in &quot;The White Princess&quot;, STARZ, Season 1, Episode 8 (2017), played by Mark Edel-Hunt.
* Philip Cumbus portrays Wolsey in &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The White Princess&quot;.

==Memorials==

Before Wolsey was removed from power, he planned to make his home town of Ipswich a seat of learning. He built a substantial college, which for two years, 1528–1530, was parent of the Queen Elizabeth School or Ipswich School, which today flourishes on another site. All that remains of Wolsey&#x27;s structure is the former waterside gate, figured by Francis Grose in his &quot;Antiquities&quot;, which can still be seen on College Street.

In 1930 Wolsey was commemorated in Ipswich with a pageant play.
An appeal was launched in 2009 to erect a permanent memorial to Wolsey in Ipswich. This led to the commissioning of a more-than-life-sized bronze statue from sculptor David Annand. Wolsey is shown seated and facing south towards St Peter&#x27;s Church (the former medieval Augustinian priory church, which he annexed as the chapel of his college), teaching from a book, and with a cat at his side. The statue was unveiled in June 2011, when it was dedicated by the Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, and launched in a civic capacity by the Mayor of Ipswich.

Another statue of Wolsey stands in Leicester&#x27;s Abbey Park close to the site of his burial. It was donated by the Wolsey hosiery company, a major employer in the city and also named after the cardinal.

The Wolsey Place shopping centre and Woking F.C.&#x27;s nickname The Cardinals commemorate the fact Wolsey was visiting Henry VIII at Woking Palace when the news arrived that he had been made a cardinal.

==Other==
Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s bust was used in the 1980s above the London Transport roundel on London&#x27;s buses in west and south-west London as the symbol of the Cardinal bus district, which was named after him and his residence at Hampton Court.

Carlos Logario, a Spanish doctor practising in England, was the doctor to Thomas Wolsey.

<text>A triode is an electronic amplifying vacuum tube (or &quot;thermionic valve&quot; in British English) consisting of three electrodes inside an evacuated glass envelope: a heated filament or cathode, a grid, and a plate (anode). Developed from Lee De Forest&#x27;s 1906 Audion, a partial vacuum tube that added a grid electrode to the thermionic diode (Fleming valve), the triode was the first practical electronic amplifier and the ancestor of other types of vacuum tubes such as the tetrode and pentode. Its invention helped make amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony possible. Triodes were widely used in consumer electronics devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s, when transistors replaced them. Today, their main remaining use is in high-power RF amplifiers in radio transmitters and industrial RF heating devices. In recent years there has been a resurgence in demand for low power triodes due to renewed interest in tube-type audio systems by audiophiles who prefer the sound of tube-based electronics.

The name &quot;triode&quot; was coined by British physicist William Eccles some time around 1920, derived from the Greek τρίοδος, &quot;tríodos&quot;, from &quot;tri-&quot; (three) and &quot;hodós&quot; (road, way), originally meaning the place where three roads meet.

== History ==
===Precursor devices===

Before thermionic valves were invented, Philipp Lenard used the principle of grid control while conducting photoelectric experiments in 1902.

The first vacuum tube used in radio was the thermionic diode or Fleming valve, invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 as a detector for radio receivers. It was an evacuated glass bulb containing two electrodes, a heated filament (cathode) and a plate (anode).

===Invention===
Triodes came about in 1906 when American engineer Lee de Forest and Austrian physicist Robert von Lieben independently patented tubes that added a third electrode, a control grid, between the filament and plate to control current. Von Lieben&#x27;s partially-evacuated three-element tube, patented in March 1906, contained a trace of mercury vapor and was intended to amplify weak telephone signals. Starting in October 1906 De Forest patented a number of three-element tube designs by adding an electrode to the diode, which he called Audions, intended to be used as radio detectors. The one which became the design of the triode, in which the grid was located between the filament and plate, was patented January 29, 1907. Like the von Lieben vacuum tube, De Forest&#x27;s Audions were incompletely evacuated and contained some gas at low pressure. von Lieben&#x27;s vacuum tube did not see much development due to his death seven years after its invention, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War.

De Forest&#x27;s Audion did not see much use until its ability to amplify was recognized around 1912 by several researchers, who used it to build the first successful amplifying radio receivers and electronic oscillators. The many uses for amplification motivated its rapid development. By 1913 improved versions with higher vacuum were developed by Harold Arnold at American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which had purchased the rights to the Audion from De Forest, and Irving Langmuir at General Electric, who named his tube the &quot;Pliotron&quot;, These were the first vacuum tube triodes. The name &quot;triode&quot; appeared later, when it became necessary to distinguish it from other kinds of vacuum tubes with more or fewer elements (diodes, tetrodes, pentodes, etc.). There were lengthy lawsuits between De Forest and von Lieben, and De Forest and the Marconi Company, who represented John Ambrose Fleming, the inventor of the diode.

===Wider adoption===
The discovery of the triode&#x27;s amplifying ability in 1912 revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of &quot;electronics&quot;, the technology of active (amplifying) electrical devices. The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication. During World War I, AM voice two way radio sets were made possible in 1917 (see TM (triode)) which were simple enough that the pilot in a single seat aircraft could use it while flying. Triode &quot;continuous wave&quot; radio transmitters replaced the cumbersome inefficient &quot;damped wave&quot; spark-gap transmitters, allowing the transmission of sound by amplitude modulation (AM). Amplifying triode radio receivers, which had the power to drive loudspeakers, replaced weak crystal radios, which had to be listened to with earphones, allowing families to listen together. This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first mass communication medium, with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920. Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible. Vacuum tube triode repeaters, invented at Bell Telephone after its purchase of the Audion rights, allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles. The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later, on January 25, 1915. Other inventions made possible by the triode were television, public address systems, electric phonographs, and talking motion pictures.

The triode served as the technological base from which later vacuum tubes developed, such as the tetrode (Walter Schottky, 1916) and pentode (Gilles Holst and Bernardus Dominicus Hubertus Tellegen, 1926), which remedied some of the shortcomings of the triode detailed below.

The triode was very widely used in consumer electronics such as radios, televisions, and audio systems until it was replaced in the 1960s by the transistor, invented in 1947, which brought the &quot;vacuum tube era&quot; introduced by the triode to a close. Today triodes are used mostly in high-power applications for which solid state semiconductor devices are unsuitable, such as radio transmitters and industrial heating equipment. However, more recently the triode and other vacuum tube devices have been experiencing a resurgence and comeback in high fidelity audio and musical equipment. They also remain in use as vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs), which come in a variety of implementations but all are essentially triode devices.

== Construction ==

All triodes have a hot cathode electrode heated by a filament, which releases electrons, and a flat metal plate electrode (anode) to which the electrons are attracted, with a grid consisting of a screen of wires between them to control the current. These are sealed inside a glass container from which the air has been removed to a high vacuum, about 10−9 atm. Since the filament eventually burns out, the tube has a limited lifetime and is made as a replaceable unit; the electrodes are attached to terminal pins which plug into a socket. The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10,000 hours for power tubes.

=== Low power triodes ===
Low power triodes have a concentric construction &quot;(see drawing right)&quot;, with the grid and anode as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode. The cathode is a narrow metal tube down the center. Inside the cathode is a filament called the &quot;heater&quot; consisting of a narrow strip of high resistance tungsten wire, which heats the cathode red-hot (800 - 1000 °C). This type is called an &quot;indirectly heated cathode&quot;. The cathode is coated with a mixture of alkaline earth oxides such as calcium and thorium oxide which reduces its work function so it produces more electrons. The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode. The anode is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid. It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with heat-radiating fins. The electrons travel in a radial direction, from cathode through the grid to the anode. The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic insulators and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base, where the electrodes are brought out to connecting pins. A &quot;getter&quot;, a small amount of shiny barium metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass, helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time.

=== High-power triodes ===
High-power triodes generally use a filament which serves as the cathode (a directly heated cathode) because the emission coating on indirectly heated cathodes is destroyed by the higher ion bombardment in power tubes. A thoriated tungsten filament is most often used, in which thorium added to the tungsten diffuses to the surface and forms a monolayer which increases electron emission. As the monolayer is removed by ion bombardment it is continually renewed by more thorium diffusing to the surface. These generally run at higher temperatures than indirectly heated cathodes. The envelope of the tube is often made of more durable ceramic rather than glass, and all the materials have higher melting points to withstand higher heat levels produced. Tubes with anode power dissipation over several hundred watts are usually actively cooled; the anode, made of heavy copper, projects through the wall of the tube and is attached to a large external finned metal heat sink which is cooled by forced air or water.

=== Lighthouse tubes ===

A type of low power triode for use at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF), the &quot;lighthouse&quot; tube, has a planar construction to reduce interelectrode capacitance and lead inductance, which gives it the appearance of a &quot;lighthouse&quot;. The disk-shaped cathode, grid and plate form planes up the center of the tube - a little like a sandwich with spaces between the layers. The cathode at the bottom is attached to the tube&#x27;s pins, but the grid and plate are brought out to low inductance terminals on the upper level of the tube: the grid to a metal ring halfway up, and the plate to a metal button at the top. These are one example of &quot;disk seal&quot; design. Smaller examples dispense with the octal pin base shown in the illustration and rely on contact rings for all connections, including heater and D.C. cathode.

As well, high-frequency performance is limited by transit time: the time required for electrons to travel from cathode to anode. Transit time effects are complicated, but one simple effect is input conductance, also known as grid loading. At extreme high frequencies, electrons arriving at the grid may become out of phase with those departing towards the anode. This imbalance of charge causes the grid to exhibit a reactance that is much less than its low-frequency &quot;open circuit&quot; characteristic.

Transit time effects are reduced by reduced spacings in the tube. Tubes such as the 416B (a Lighthouse design) and the 7768 (an all-ceramic miniaturised design) are specified for operation to 4 GHz. They feature greatly reduced grid-cathode spacings of the order of 0.1 mm.

These greatly reduced grid spacings also give a much higher amplification factor than conventional axial designs. The 7768 has an amplification factor of 225, compared with 100 for the 6AV6 used in domestic radios and about the maximum possible for an axial design.

Anode-grid capacitance is not especially low in these designs. The 6AV6 anode-grid capacitance is 2 picofarads (pF), the 7768 has a value of 1.7 pF. The close electrode spacing used in microwave tubes &quot;increases&quot; capacitances, but this increase is offset by their overall reduced dimensions compared to lower-frequency tubes.

== Operation ==
In the triode, electrons are released into the tube from the metal cathode by heating it, a process called thermionic emission. The cathode is heated red hot by a separate current flowing through a thin metal filament. In some tubes the filament itself is the cathode, while in most tubes there is a separate filament which heats the cathode but is electrically isolated from it. The interior of the tube is well evacuated so that electrons can travel between the cathode and the anode without losing energy in collisions with gas molecules. A positive DC voltage, which can be as low as 20V or up to thousands of volts in some transmitting tubes, is present on the anode. The negative electrons are attracted to the positively charged anode (or &quot;plate&quot;), and flow through the spaces between the grid wires to it, creating a flow of electrons through the tube from cathode to anode.

The magnitude of this current can be controlled by a voltage applied on the grid (relative to the cathode). The grid acts like a gate for the electrons. A more negative voltage on the grid will repel more of the electrons, so fewer get through to the anode, reducing the anode current. A less negative voltage on the grid will allow more electrons from the cathode to reach the anode, increasing the anode current. Therefore, an input AC signal on the grid of a few volts (or less), even at a very high impedance (since essentially no current flows through the grid) can control a much more powerful anode current, resulting in amplification. When used in its linear region, variation in the grid voltage will cause an approximately proportional variation in the anode current; this ratio is called the transconductance. If a suitable load resistance is inserted in the anode circuit, although the transconductance is somewhat lowered, the varying anode current will cause a varying voltage across that resistance which can be much larger than the input voltage variations, resulting in voltage gain.

The triode is a normally &quot;on&quot; device; and current flows to the anode with zero voltage on the grid. The anode current is progressively reduced as the grid is made more negative relative to the cathode. Usually a constant DC voltage (&quot;bias&quot;) is applied to the grid along with the varying signal voltage superimposed on it. That bias is required so that the positive peaks of the signal never drive the grid positive with respect to the cathode which would result in grid current and non-linear behaviour. A sufficiently negative voltage on the grid (usually around 3-5 volts in small tubes such as the 6AV6, but as much as –130 volts in early audio power devices such as the &#x27;45), will prevent any electrons from getting through to the anode, turning off the anode current. This is called the &quot;cutoff voltage&quot;. Since beyond cutoff the anode current ceases to respond to the grid voltage, the voltage on the grid must remain above the cutoff voltage for faithful (linear) amplification as well as not exceeding the cathode voltage.

The triode is somewhat similar in operation to the n-channel JFET; it is normally on, and exhibits progressively lower and lower plate/drain current as the grid/gate is pulled increasingly negative relative to the source/cathode. Cutoff voltage corresponds to the JFET&#x27;s pinch-off voltage (Vp) or VGS(off); i.e., the voltage point at which output current essentially reaches zero. This similarity is limited, however. The triode&#x27;s anode current is highly dependent on anode voltage as well as grid voltage, thus limiting the voltage gain. Because, in contrast, the JFET&#x27;s drain current is virtually unaffected by drain voltage, it appears as a constant-current device, similar in action to a tetrode or pentode tube (high dynamic output impedance). Both the JFET and tetrode/pentode valves are thereby capable of much higher voltage gains than the triode which seldom exceeds 100. However the power gain, or the output power obtained from a certain AC input voltage is often of greater interest. When these devices are used as cathode followers (or source followers), they all have a voltage &quot;gain&quot; of just under 1, but with a large current gain.

== Applications ==

Although S.G. Brown&#x27;s Type G Telephone Relay (using a magnetic &quot;earphone&quot; mechanism driving a carbon microphone element) was able to give power amplification and had been in use as early as 1914, it was a purely mechanical device with limited frequency range and fidelity. It was suited only to a limited range of audio frequencies - essentially voice frequencies.

The triode was the first non-mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies, and made radio practical. Triodes are used for amplifiers and oscillators. Many types are used only at low to moderate frequency and power levels. Large water-cooled triodes may be used as the final amplifier in radio transmitters, with ratings of thousands of watts. Specialized types of triode (&quot;lighthouse&quot; tubes, with low capacitance between elements) provide useful gain at microwave frequencies.

Vacuum tubes are obsolete in mass-marketed consumer electronics, having been overtaken by less expensive transistor-based solid-state devices. However, more recently, vacuum tubes have been making somewhat of a comeback. Triodes continue to be used in certain high-power RF amplifiers and transmitters. While proponents of vacuum tubes claim their superiority in areas such as high-end and professional audio applications, the solid-state MOSFET has similar performance characteristics.

== Characteristics ==

In triode datasheets, characteristics linking the anode current (Ia) to anode voltage (Va) and grid voltage (Vg) are usually given. From here, a circuit designer can choose the operating point of the particular triode. Then the output voltage and amplification of the triode can be evaluated graphically by drawing a load line on the graph.

In the example characteristic shown on the image, suppose we wish to operate it at a quiescent anode voltage Va of 200 V and a grid voltage bias of −1 V. This implies a quiescent plate (anode) current of 2.2 mA (using the yellow curve on the graph). In a class-A triode amplifier, one might place an anode resistor (connected between the anode and the positive power supply). If we choose Ra = 10000 Ω, the voltage drop on it would be V+ − Va = Ia × Ra = 22 V for the chosen anode current of Ia = 2.2 mA. Thus we require a power supply voltage V+ = 222 V in order to obtain Va = 200 V on the anode.

Now suppose we impress on the −1 V bias voltage a signal of 1 V peak-peak, so that the grid voltage varies between −0.5 V and −1.5 V. When Vg = −0.5 V, the anode current will increase to 3.1 mA, lowering the anode voltage to Va = V+ − 10 kΩ × 3.1 mA = 191 V (orange curve). When Vg = −1.5 V, the anode current will decrease to 1.4 mA, raising the anode voltage to Va = V+ − 10 kΩ × 1.4 mA = 208 V (green curve). Therefore a 1 V peak-peak signal on the input (grid) causes an output voltage change of about 17 V. 

Thus voltage amplification of the signal is obtained. The ratio of these two changes, the voltage amplification factor (or &quot;mu&quot;) is 17 in this case. It is also possible to use triodes as cathode followers in which there is no voltage amplification but a huge reduction in dynamic impedance; in other words, the &quot;current&quot; is greatly amplified (as it also is in the common-cathode configuration described above). Amplifying either the voltage or current results in power amplification, the general purpose of an amplifying tube (after all, either the current or voltage alone could be increased by decreasing the other just using a transformer, a passive device).

<text>Flower Pot Men is a British programme for young children produced by BBC Television. It was first transmitted in 1952, and repeated regularly for more than twenty years. A remake of the programme called &quot;Bill and Ben&quot; was aired in 2001.

The original programme was part of a BBC children&#x27;s television series titled &quot;Watch with Mother&quot;, featuring a different programme each weekday, most of them involving string puppets.

==Premise==
&quot;Flower Pot Men&quot; features the story of Bill and Ben, two men made of terracotta flower pots who live at the bottom of an English garden. A third character, Little Weed, of indeterminate species resembling either a sunflower or a dandelion with a smiling face, is shown growing between two large flowerpots. The three are also sometimes visited by a tortoise called Slowcoach and, in one particular episode, the trio meet a faintly mysterious character made out of potatoes, Dan the Potato Man.

Typically, while the &quot;man who worked in the garden&quot; would be away having his dinner, the two flower pot men, Bill and Ben, would emerge from their pots. After a minor adventure, a slight mishap would occur, for which someone would then take the blame: &quot;Which of these two flowerpot men, was it Bill or was it Ben?&quot; the narrator would trill in a quavering soprano; the culprit would then confess, before the gardener&#x27;s footsteps would be heard coming up the garden path; the flower pot men then would vanish into their pots and the &quot;Goodbye&quot; screen would appear. The final punch-line was, &quot;..and I think the little house knew something about it; don&#x27;t you?&quot;.

==Production==
According to her adopted daughter Alison Gassier, Freda Lingstrom got the idea for the show after spending time in her woodshed with a flowerpot. She assembled the production crew, which consisted mainly of those who had worked on her previous show &quot;Andy Pandy&quot;: her associate Maria Bird, puppeteers Audrey Atterbury and Molly Gibson, and opera singer Gladys Whitred. The only new member was Peter Hawkins, who voiced both Bill and Ben, inventing their gibberish language, named Oddle-Poddle. He based the language on select words such as &quot;Slogalog&quot; (Slowcoach the Tortoise) and &quot;Haddap&quot; (Hello).

The puppets were made to look as if they were made from flowerpots. Cupcake holders were used for their hats, which sometimes caught onto their strings. Peter particularly praised Audrey&#x27;s puppetry for being very precise. The scripts were written in English, with Peter translating them into Oddle-Poddle.

== Confusion with other characters ==
Retired headteacher Hilda Brabban created an unrelated set of characters also named Bill and Ben. These have been confused with the &quot;Flower Pot Men&quot;, including in the initial versions of two obituaries of Brabban, published in &quot;The Independent&quot; and BBC&#x27;s in-house magazine &quot;Ariel&quot; respectively. The confusion also affected the BBC panel show &quot;QI&quot;, where host Stephen Fry in the 2004 episode &quot;Bills&quot; mistakenly claimed Brabban had named the &quot;Flower Pot Men&quot; characters after her younger brothers. All three sources later corrected their statements. Brabban sold three stories about a Bill and Ben to the BBC in the 1950s; but other than their names, they bore no resemblance to the &quot;Flower Pot Men&quot;. Brabban&#x27;s stories were broadcast on the radio programme &quot;Listen with Mother&quot; in 1951; the Bill and Ben of the &quot;Flower Pot Men&quot; were first seen on the television programme &quot;Watch with Mother&quot; in 1952. Both programmes were produced by Freda Lingstrom. During her later life Brabban suffered a stroke and later maintained she did invent the characters used in the BBC series; this prompted lawyers, acting on behalf of the estate of the show&#x27;s creator, Freda Lingstrom, to threaten Brabban with litigation if she appeared on television to propagate this claim.

==Comics==
The show was the basis for a comic strip of the same name in the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Robin&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The short lived one-hit wonder group, The Flower Pot Men, known for their 1967 song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to San Francisco&quot;, named the group after the show, although it caused controversies with people suggesting it may have had something to do with marijuana. Bill and Ben themselves may have inspired the names of the twin tank engines, Bill and Ben, from &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&quot;, considering they, like the flowerpot men Bill and Ben, were somewhat mischievous and prone to playing pranks at times.

<doc id="31039" wikidata="Q309027" url="?curid=31039" title="Turboprop">
<text>A turboprop is a gas turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller.

A turboprop consists of an intake, reduction gearbox, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a propelling nozzle. Air enters the intake and is compressed by the compressor. Fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor, where the fuel-air mixture then combusts. The hot combustion gases expand through the turbine stages, generating power at the point of exhaust. Some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor and electric generator. The gases are then exhausted from the turbine. In contrast to a turbojet or turbofan, the engine&#x27;s exhaust gases do not provide enough power to create significant thrust, since almost all of the engine&#x27;s power is used to drive the propeller.

==Technological aspects==

Exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power, which is obtained by extracting additional power (beyond that necessary to drive the compressor) from turbine expansion. Owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system, the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low. Consequently, the exhaust jet produces about 10% of the total thrust. A higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher speeds.

Turboprops have bypass ratios of 50–100, although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans.

The propeller is coupled to the turbine through a reduction gear that converts the high RPM/low torque output to low RPM/high torque. This can be of two primary designs, free-turbine and fixed. A free-turbine turboshaft found on the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6, where the gas generator is not connected to the propeller. This allows for propeller strike or similar damage to occur without damaging the gas generator and allowing for only the power section (turbine and gearbox) to be removed and replaced in such an event, and also allows for less stress on the start during engine ground starts. Whereas a fixed shaft has the gearbox and gas generator connected, such as on the Honeywell TPE331.

The propeller itself is normally a constant-speed (variable pitch) propeller type similar to that used with larger aircraft reciprocating engines, except that the propeller-control requirements are very different. Due to the turbine engine&#x27;s slow response to power inputs, particularly at low speeds, the propeller has a greater range of selected travel in order to make rapid thrust changes, notably for taxi, reverse, and other ground operations. The propeller has 2 modes, Alpha and Beta. Alpha is the mode for all flight operations including takeoff. Beta, a mode typically consisting of zero to negative thrust, is used for all ground operations aside from takeoff. The Beta mode is further broken down into 2 additional modes, Beta for taxi and Beta plus power. Beta for taxi as the name implies is used for taxi operations and consists of all pitch ranges from the lowest alpha range pitch, all the way down to zero pitch, producing very little to zero-thrust and is typically accessed by moving the power lever to a beta for taxi range. Beta plus power is a reverse range and produces negative thrust, often used for landing on short runways where the aircraft would need to rapidly slow down, as well as backing operations and is accessed by moving the power lever below the beta for taxi range. Due to the pilot not being able to see out of the rear of the aircraft for backing and the amount of debris reverse stirs up, manufacturers will often limit the speeds beta plus power may be used and restrict its use on unimproved runways. Feathering of these propellers is performed by the propeller control lever.

The constant-speed propeller is distinguished from the reciprocating engine constant-speed propeller by the control system. The turboprop system consists of 3 propeller governors, a governor, and overspeed governor, and a fuel-topping governor. The governor works in much the same way a reciprocating engine propeller governor works, though a turboprop governor may incorporate beta control valve or beta lift rod for beta operation and is typically located in the 12 o&#x27;clock position. There are also other governors that are included in addition depending on the model, such as an overspeed and fuel topping governor on a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6, and an under-speed governor on a Honeywell TPE331. The turboprop is also distinguished from other kinds of turbine engine in that the fuel control unit is connected to the governor to help dictate power.

To make the engine more compact, reverse airflow can be used. On a reverse-flow turboprop engine, the compressor intake is at the aft of the engine, and the exhaust is situated forward, reducing the distance between the turbine and the propeller.

Unlike the small-diameter fans used in turbofan engines, the propeller has a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air. This permits a lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust. Since it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree, a low disc loading (thrust per unit disc area) increases the aircraft&#x27;s energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.

Propellers work well until the flight speed of the aircraft is high enough that the airflow past the blade tips reaches the speed of sound. Beyond that speed, the proportion of the power that drives the propeller that is converted to propeller thrust falls dramatically. For this reason turboprop engines are not commonly used on aircraft that fly faster than 0.6–0.7 Mach, with some exceptions such as the Tupolev Tu-95. However, propfan engines, which are very similar to turboprop engines, can cruise at flight speeds approaching 0.75 Mach. To maintain propeller efficiency across a wide range of airspeeds, turboprops use constant-speed (variable-pitch) propellers. The blades of a constant-speed propeller increase their pitch as aircraft speed increases. Another benefit of this type of propeller is that it can also be used to generate reverse thrust to reduce stopping distance on the runway. Additionally, in the event of an engine failure, the propeller can be feathered, thus minimizing the drag of the non-functioning propeller.

While the power turbine may be integral with the gas generator section, many turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate coaxial shaft. This enables the propeller to rotate freely, independent of compressor speed.

==History==

Alan Arnold Griffith had published a paper on compressor design in 1926. Subsequent work at the Royal Aircraft Establishment investigated axial compressor-based designs that would drive a propeller. From 1929, Frank Whittle began work on centrifugal compressor-based designs that would use all the gas power produced by the engine for jet thrust.

The world&#x27;s first turboprop was designed by the Hungarian mechanical engineer György Jendrassik. Jendrassik published a turboprop idea in 1928, and on 12 March 1929 he patented his invention. In 1938, he built a small-scale (100 Hp; 74.6 kW) experimental gas turbine. The larger Jendrassik Cs-1, with a predicted output of 1,000 bhp, was produced and tested at the Ganz Works in Budapest between 1937 and 1941. It was of axial-flow design with 15 compressor and 7 turbine stages, annular combustion chamber. First run in 1940, combustion problems limited its output to 400 bhp. Two Jendrassik Cs-1s were the engines for the world&#x27;s first turboprop aircraft – the Varga RMI-1 X/H. This was a Hungarian fighter-bomber of WWII which had one model completed, but before its first flight it was destroyed in a bombing raid. In 1941, the engine was abandoned due to war, and the factory converted to conventional engine production.

The first mention of turboprop engines in the general public press was in the February 1944 issue of the British aviation publication &quot;Flight&quot;, which included a detailed cutaway drawing of what a possible future turboprop engine could look like. The drawing was very close to what the future Rolls-Royce Trent would look like. The first British turboprop engine was the Rolls-Royce RB.50 Trent, a converted Derwent II fitted with reduction gear and a Rotol five-bladed propeller. Two Trents were fitted to Gloster Meteor &quot;EE227&quot; — the sole &quot;Trent-Meteor&quot; — which thus became the world&#x27;s first turboprop-powered aircraft to fly, albeit as a test-bed not intended for production. It first flew on 20 September 1945. From their experience with the Trent, Rolls-Royce developed the Rolls-Royce Clyde, the first turboprop engine to receive a type certificate for military and civil use, and the Dart, which became one of the most reliable turboprop engines ever built. Dart production continued for more than fifty years. The Dart-powered Vickers Viscount was the first turboprop aircraft of any kind to go into production and sold in large numbers. It was also the first four-engined turboprop. Its first flight was on 16 July 1948. The world&#x27;s first single engined turboprop aircraft was the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba-powered Boulton Paul Balliol, which first flew on 24 March 1948.

The Soviet Union built on German World War II turboprop preliminary design work by Junkers Motorenwerke, while BMW, Heinkel-Hirth and Daimler-Benz also worked on projected designs. While the Soviet Union had the technology to create the airframe for a jet-powered strategic bomber comparable to Boeing&#x27;s B-52 Stratofortress, they instead produced the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear, powered with four Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprops, mated to eight contra-rotating propellers (two per nacelle) with supersonic tip speeds to achieve maximum cruise speeds in excess of 575 mph, faster than many of the first jet aircraft and comparable to jet cruising speeds for most missions. The Bear would serve as their most successful long-range combat and surveillance aircraft and symbol of Soviet power projection through to the end of the 20th century. The USA used turboprop engines with contra-rotating propellers, such as the Allison T40, on some experimental aircraft during the 1950s. The T40-powered Convair R3Y Tradewind flying-boat was operated by the U.S. Navy for a short time.

The first American turboprop engine was the General Electric XT31, first used in the experimental Consolidated Vultee XP-81. The XP-81 first flew in December 1945, the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power. The technology of Allison&#x27;s earlier T38 design evolved into the Allison T56, used to power the Lockheed Electra airliner, its military maritime patrol derivative the P-3 Orion, and the C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft.

The first turbine-powered, shaft-driven helicopter was the Kaman K-225, a development of Charles Kaman&#x27;s K-125 synchropter, which used a Boeing T50 turboshaft engine to power it on 11 December 1951.

December 1963 saw the first delivery of Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada&#x27;s PT6 turboprop engine for the then Beechcraft 87, soon to become Beechcraft King Air.

1964 saw the first deliveries of the Garrett AiResearch TPE331, (now owned by Honeywell Aerospace) on the Mitsubishi MU-2, making it the fastest turboprop aircraft for that year.

==Usage==
In contrast to turbofans, turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below 725 km/h (450 mph; 390 knots) because the jet velocity of the propeller (and exhaust) is relatively low. Modern turboprop airliners operate at nearly the same speed as small regional jet airliners but burn two-thirds of the fuel per passenger.

Compared to piston engines, their greater power-to-weight ratio (which allows for shorter takeoffs) and reliability can offset their higher initial cost, maintenance and fuel consumption. As jet fuel can be easier to obtain than avgas in remote areas, turboprop-powered aircraft like the Cessna Caravan and Quest Kodiak are used as bush airplanes.

Turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft, but the Tupolev Tu-114 can reach . Large military aircraft, like the Tupolev Tu-95, and civil aircraft, such as the Lockheed L-188 Electra, were also turboprop powered. The Airbus A400M is powered by four Europrop TP400 engines, which are the second most powerful turboprop engines ever produced, after the Kuznetsov NK-12.

In 2017, the most widespread turboprop airliners in service were the ATR 42/72 (950 aircraft), Bombardier Q400 (506), De Havilland Canada Dash 8-100/200/300 (374), Beechcraft 1900 (328), de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (270), Saab 340 (225). Less widespread and older airliners include the BAe Jetstream 31, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner, Dornier 328, Saab 2000, Xian MA60, MA600 and MA700, Fokker 27 and 50.

Turboprop business aircraft include the Piper Meridian, Socata TBM, Pilatus PC-12, Piaggio P.180 Avanti, Beechcraft King Air and Super King Air. In April 2017, there were 14,311 business turboprops in the worldwide fleet.

===Reliability===

Between 2012 and 2016, the ATSB observed 417 events with turboprop aircraft, 83 per year, over 1.4 million flight hours: 2.2 per 10,000 hours.
Three were &quot;high risk&quot; involving engine malfunction and unplanned landing in single‑engine Cessna 208 Caravans, four &quot;medium risk&quot; and 96% &quot;low risk&quot;.
Two occurrences resulted in minor injuries due to engine malfunction and terrain collision in agricultural aircraft and five accidents involved aerial work: four in agriculture and one in an air ambulance.

<doc id="31040" wikidata="Q174606" url="?curid=31040" title="Tomaso Albinoni">
<text>Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was an Italian composer of the Baroque era. His output includes operas, concertos, sonatas for one to six instruments, sinfonias, and solo cantatas. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is known today for his instrumental music, especially his concertos. He is best remembered today for a work called &quot;Adagio in G minor&quot;, attributed to him but largely written by Remo Giazotto, a 20th century musicologist and composer, who was a cataloger of the works of Albinoni.

==Biography==
Born in Venice, to Antonio Albinoni, a wealthy paper merchant, he studied violin and singing. Relatively little is known about his life, which is surprising, considering his contemporary stature as a composer and the comparatively well-documented period in which he lived. In 1694 he dedicated his Opus 1 to the fellow-Venetian, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (grand-nephew of Pope Alexander VIII). His first opera, &quot;Zenobia, regina de Palmireni&quot;, was produced in Venice in 1694. Albinoni was possibly employed in 1700 as a violinist to Charles IV, Duke of Mantua, to whom he dedicated his Opus 2 collection of instrumental pieces. In 1701 he wrote his hugely popular suites Opus 3, and dedicated that collection to Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany.

In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi; Antonino Biffi, the &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of San Marco was a witness, and evidently was a friend of Albinoni. 
Albinoni seems to have no other connection with that primary musical establishment in Venice, however, and achieved his early fame as an opera composer in many cities in Italy, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. During this time, he was also composing instrumental music in abundance: prior to 1705, he mostly wrote trio sonatas and violin concertos, but between then and 1719 he wrote solo sonatas and concertos for oboe.

Unlike most contemporary composers, he appears never to have sought a post at either a church or noble court, but then he had independent means and could afford to compose music independently. In 1722, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, to whom Albinoni had dedicated a set of twelve concertos, invited him to direct two of his operas in Munich.
Part of Albinoni&#x27;s work was lost in World War II with the destruction of the Dresden State Library. As a result, little is known of his life and music after the mid-1720s.

Around 1740, a collection of Albinoni&#x27;s violin sonatas was published in France as a posthumous work, and scholars long presumed that meant that Albinoni had died by that time. However, it appears he lived on in Venice in obscurity; a record from the parish of San Barnaba indicates Tomaso Albinoni died in Venice in 1751, of diabetes mellitus. He was 79 years old.

==Music and influence==

Most of his operatic works have been lost - either because they never got published or because they were destroyed. However, nine collections of instrumental works were published. These met with considerable success and consequent reprints. He is therefore known more as a composer of instrumental music (99 sonatas, 59 concerti and 9 sinfonie) today. In his lifetime these works were compared favourably with those of Arcangelo Corelli and Antonio Vivaldi. His nine collections published in Italy, Amsterdam, and London were either dedicated to or sponsored by an impressive list of southern European nobility. Albinoni wrote at least fifty operas, of which twenty-eight were produced in Venice between 1723 and 1740. Albinoni himself claimed 81 operas (naming his second-to-last opera, in the libretto, as his 80th). In spite of his enormous operatic output, today he is most noted for his instrumental music, especially his oboe concerti (from &quot;12 Concerti a cinque&quot; op. 7 and, most famously, &quot;12 Concerti a cinque&quot; op. 9). He is the first Italian known to employ the oboe as a solo instrument in concerti (c. 1715, in his op. 7) and publish such works, although earlier concerti featuring solo oboe were probably written by German composers such as Telemann or Händel. In Italy, Alessandro Marcello published his well-known oboe concerto in D minor a little later, in 1717. Albinoni also employed the instrument often in his chamber works and operas.

His instrumental music attracted great attention from Johann Sebastian Bach, who never visited Italy but had access to Italian music, particularly when working in Weimar for the ducal court. Bach wrote at least two fugues on Albinoni&#x27;s themes (&quot;Fugue in A major on a theme by Tomaso Albinoni,&quot; BWV 950, and &quot;Fugue in B minor on a theme by Tomaso Albinoni&quot;, BWV 951) and frequently used his basses for harmonic exercises for his pupils. 

The famous &quot;Adagio in G minor&quot;, the subject of many modern recordings, is thought by some to be a musical hoax composed by Remo Giazotto. However, a discovery by musicologist Muska Mangano, Giazotto&#x27;s last assistant before his death, has cast some doubt on that belief. Among Giazotto&#x27;s papers, Mangano discovered a modern but independent manuscript transcription of the figured bass portion, and six fragmentary bars of the first violin, &quot;bearing in the top right-hand corner a stamp stating unequivocally the Dresden provenance of the original from which it was taken&quot;. This provides support for Giazotto&#x27;s account that he did base his composition on an earlier source.

<text>A trust is a legal relationship in which the owner of property, or any transferable right, gives it to another to manage and use solely for the benefit of a designated person. In the English common law, the party who entrusts the property is known as the &quot;settlor&quot;, the party to whom it is entrusted is known as the &quot;trustee&quot;, the party for whose benefit the property is entrusted is known as the &quot;beneficiary&quot;, and the entrusted property is known as the &quot;corpus&quot; or &quot;trust property&quot;. A &quot;testamentary trust&quot; is an irrevocable trust established and funded pursuant to the terms of a deceased person&#x27;s will. An inter vivos trust is a trust created during the settlor&#x27;s life.

The trustee is the legal owner of the assets held in trust on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are equitable owners of the trust property. Trustees have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust for the benefit of the equitable owners. Trustees must provide regular accountings of trust income and expenditures. A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches their duty. Some breaches can be charged and tried as criminal offenses. A trustee can be a natural person, business entity or public body. A trust in the US may be subject to federal and state taxation. The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed. It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role. For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.

Trusts have existed since Roman times and become one of the most important innovations in property law. Specific aspects of trust law vary in different jurisdictions. Some U.S. states are adapting the Uniform Trust Code to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain.
An owner placing property into trust turns over part of their bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property&#x27;s legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or deceased. Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries. While the trustee is given legal title to the trust property, in accepting title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. The primary duties owed are those of loyalty, prudence and impartiality. Trustees may be held to a high standard of care in their dealings to enforce their behavior. To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject to ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including openness, transparency, recordkeeping, accounting, and disclosure. A trustee has a duty to know, understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise turn over all profits from the trust and neither endebt nor riskily speculate on the assets without the written, clear permission of all adult beneficiaries.

There are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with a conflict of interest. Courts can reverse a trustee&#x27;s actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions if they find a trustee has failed in their duties. Such a failure is a civil breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities. It is advisable for settlors and trustees to seek legal advice before entering into, or creating, a trust agreement and trustees must take care in acting or omitting to act to avoid unlawful mistakes.

==History==
===English common law===

Roman law had a well-developed concept of the trust (&quot;fideicommissum&quot;) in terms of &quot;testamentary trusts&quot; created by wills but never developed the concept of the &quot;inter vivos&quot; (living) trusts which apply while the creator lives. This was created by later common law jurisdictions. Personal trust law developed in England at the time of the Crusades, during the 12th and 13th centuries. In medieval English trust law, the settlor was known as the &quot;feoffor&quot; to uses, while the trustee was known as the &quot;feoffee&quot; to uses, and the beneficiary was known as the &quot;cestui que&quot; use, or &quot;cestui que&quot; trust.

At the time, land ownership in England was based on the feudal system. When a landowner left England to fight in the Crusades, he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues, on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return. However, Crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return. English common law did not recognize his claim. As far as the King&#x27;s courts were concerned, the land belonged to the trustee, who was under no obligation to return it. The Crusader had no legal claim. The disgruntled Crusader would then petition the king, who would refer the matter to his Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience. At this time, the principle of equity was born in English law. However, the original notion of equity goes all the way back to Aristotle and is found in book V, chapter 10 of his Ethics. Indeed, the universities of the 13th century often wrote commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s works, and it was these universities that gave rise to the lawyers of the time.

The Lord Chancellor would consider it &quot;unconscionable&quot; that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the Crusader (the &quot;true&quot; owner). Therefore, he would find in favour of the returning Crusader. Over time, it became known that the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s court (the Court of Chancery) would continually recognize the claim of a returning Crusader. The legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested. The Crusader was the &quot;beneficiary&quot; and the acquaintance the &quot;trustee&quot;. The term &quot;use of land&quot; was coined, and in time developed into what we now know as a &quot;trust&quot;.

==Significance==
The trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the English legal system. Today, trusts play a significant role in most common law systems, and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes. In Curaçao, for example, the trust was enacted into law on 1 January 2012; however, the Curaçao Civil Code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument. France has recently added a similar, Roman-law-based device to its own law with the &quot;fiducie&quot;, amended in 2009; the &quot;fiducie&quot;, unlike a trust, is a contractual relationship. Trusts are widely used internationally, especially in countries within the English law sphere of influence, and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems, they do recognise the concept under the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition (partly only the extent that they are parties thereto). The Hague Convention also regulates conflict of trusts.

Although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers, they have become very important in American capital markets, particularly through pension funds (in certain countries essentially always trusts) and mutual funds (often trusts).

==Basic principles==
Property of any sort may be held in a trust. The uses of trusts are many and varied, for both personal and commercial reasons, and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning, asset protection, and taxes. Living trusts may be created during a person&#x27;s life (through the drafting of a trust instrument) or after death in a will.

In a relevant sense, a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors (investors) are also the beneficiaries. This is particularly evident in the Delaware business trust, which could theoretically, with the language in the &quot;governing instrument&quot;, be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation, although traditionally the Massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the US. One of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee, multiple beneficiaries, and their respective creditors (particularly the trustee&#x27;s creditors), making it &quot;bankruptcy remote&quot;, and leading to its use in pensions, mutual funds, and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust.

===Terminology===

* Appointer: This is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one. This person is usually mentioned in the trust deed.
* Appointment: In trust law, &quot;appointment&quot; often has its everyday meaning. It is common to talk of &quot;the appointment of a trustee&quot;, for example. However, &quot;appointment&quot; also has a technical trust law meaning, either:
** the act of &quot;appointing&quot; (i.e. giving) an asset from the trust to a beneficiary (usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust); or
** the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment.
:The trustee&#x27;s right to do this, where it exists, is called a power of appointment. Sometimes, a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee, such as the settlor, the protector, or a beneficiary.
* &#x27;As Trustee For&#x27; (ATF): This is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee.
* Beneficiary: A beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns.
* &#x27;In Its Own Capacity&#x27; (IIOC): This term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf.
* Protector: A protector may be appointed in an express, &quot;inter vivos&quot; trust, as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another. The legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate. No-one doubts that a &quot;trustee&quot; has fiduciary responsibilities. If a &quot;protector&quot; also has fiduciary responsibilities, then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees. However, a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one. Also, protectors are comparatively new, while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years. It is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties, and by others that they do not. The case law has not yet established this point.
* Settlor(s): This is the person (or persons) who creates the trust. Grantor(s) is a common synonym.
* Terms of the Trust means the settlor&#x27;s wishes expressed in the Trust Instrument.
* Trust deed: A trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee, beneficiaries, settlor and appointer, and the terms and conditions of the agreement.
* Trust distributions: A trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust.
* Trustee: A person (either an individual, a corporation or more than one of either) who administers a trust. A trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trust&#x27;s beneficiaries.

===Creation===
Trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor also known as the founder (express trusts) or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.

Common ways in which a trust is created include:
# a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees (often referred to as an &quot;inter vivos&quot; or living trust);
# an oral declaration or promise;
# the will of a decedent, usually called a testamentary trust; or
# a court order (for example in family proceedings).

In some jurisdictions, certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document.

===Formalities===

The formalities required of a trust depend on the type of trust in question.

Generally, a private express trust requires three elements to be certain, which together are known as the &quot;three certainties&quot;. These elements were determined in &quot;Knight v Knight&quot; to be intention, subject matter and objects. The certainty of intention allows the court to ascertain a settlor&#x27;s true reason for creating the trust. The certainties of subject matter and objects allow the court to administer trust when the trustees fail to do so. The court determines whether there is sufficient certainty by construing the words used in the trust instrument. These words are construed objectively in their &quot;reasonable meaning&quot;, within the context of the entire instrument. Despite intention being integral to express trusts, the court will try not to let trusts fail for the lack of certainty.

# Intention. A mere expression of hope that a trust be created does not constitute the intent to create a trust. Conversely, the use of terms of art such as the word &quot;trust&quot; does not of itself establish whether an instrument is an express trust. Disputes in this area mainly concern differentiating gifts from trusts. 
# Subject Matter. The property subject to the trust must be clearly identified (&quot;Palmer v Simmonds&quot;). One may not, for example state, settle &quot;the majority of my estate&quot;, as the precise extent cannot be ascertained. Trust property may be any form of specific property, be it real or personal, tangible or intangible. It is often, for example, real estate, shares or cash.
# Objects. The beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified, or at least be ascertainable (&quot;Re Hain&#x27;s Settlement&quot;). In the case of discretionary trusts, where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be, the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries (&quot;McPhail v Doulton&quot;). Beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust (for example, &quot;my future grandchildren&quot;). Alternatively, the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries.

===Trustees===
A trust may have multiple trustees, and these trustees are the legal owners of the trust&#x27;s property, but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties, such as a duty of care and a duty to inform. If trustees do not adhere to these duties, they may be removed through a legal action. The trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company, but typically the trust itself is not a legal entity and any litigation involving the trust must include the trustee as a party. A trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument. If a trust lacks a trustee, a court may appoint one.

The trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust. The trust&#x27;s affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust, accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries, filing required tax returns and other duties. In some cases dependent upon the trust instrument, the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit. A trustee may be held personally liable for problems, although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased. For example, a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested. In addition, a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given. However, in the United States, similar to directors and officers, an exculpatory clause may minimize liability; although this was previously held to be against public policy, this position has changed.

In the United States, the Uniform Trust Code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts, although trustees may be unpaid. Commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about 1% of assets under management.

===Beneficiaries===
The beneficiaries are beneficial (or &#x27;equitable&#x27;) owners of the trust property. Either immediately or eventually, the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property, or they will receive the property itself. The extent of a beneficiary&#x27;s interest depends on the wording of the trust document. One beneficiary may be entitled to income (for example, interest from a bank account), whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when they attain a specified age. The settlor has much discretion when creating the trust, subject to some limitations imposed by law.

The use of trusts as a means to inherit substantial wealth may be associated with some negative connotations; some beneficiaries who are able to live comfortably from trust proceeds without having to work a job may be jokingly referred to as &quot;trust fund babies&quot; (regardless of age) or &quot;trustafarians&quot;.

==Purposes==
Common purposes for trusts include:
* Employee ownership: Shares in a company may be held by the trustee of an employee trust, often indefinitely, as part of an employee share or share option plan of that company.
*Privacy: Trusts may be created purely for privacy. The terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions, while the terms of a trust are not.
* Spendthrift clauses: Trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries (for example, one&#x27;s children) against their own inability to handle money. Courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a settlor.
* Wills and estate planning: Trusts frequently appear in wills (indeed, technically, the administration of every deceased&#x27;s estate is a form of trust). Conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceased&#x27;s spouse (if any), and then to the children equally. If the children are under 18, or under some other age mentioned in the will (21 and 25 are common), a trust must come into existence until the &#x27;contingency age&#x27; is reached. The executor of the will is (usually) the trustee and the children are the beneficiaries. The trustee will have authority to assist the beneficiaries during their minority.
* Charities: In some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts. In others, corporations may be charities also. In most jurisdictions, charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit (in England, for example, by the Charity Commission).
* Unit trusts: The trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle.
* Pension plans: typically set up as a trust, with the employer as settlor, and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries.
* Remuneration trusts: for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents. This form of trust was developed by Paul Baxendale-Walker and has since gained widespread use.
* Corporate structures: Complex business arrangements, most often in the finance and insurance sectors, sometimes use trusts among various other entities (e.g., corporations) in their structure.
* Asset protection: Trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote. For example, a discretionary trust, of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary, but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary. In such an arrangement, the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets without owning them, and therefore, in theory, protected from creditors. In addition, the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name (e.g., &quot;The Teddy Bear Trust&quot;). These strategies are ethically and legally controversial.
* Tax planning: The tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route (if, indeed, it would be possible to do so). In many cases, the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative, and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance. For an example see the &quot;nil-band discretionary trust&quot;, explained at Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom).
* Co-ownership: Ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust. In particular, ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one or both owning the legal title as trustee.
* Construction law: In Canada and Minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust. In the event of contractor insolvency, this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed.
* Legal retainer – Lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client, this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolvent. However, strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts.

==Types==
Trusts go by many different names, depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, a single trust might accurately be described in several ways. For example, a living trust is often an express trust, which is also a revocable trust, and might include an incentive trust, and so forth.

===Alphabetic list of trust types===
* Asset-protection trust: The concept of an asset-protection trust encompasses any form of trust that provides for funds to be held on a discretionary basis. Such trusts are set up in an attempt to avoid or mitigate the effects of taxation, divorce and bankruptcy on the beneficiary. Such trusts may be proscribed or limited in their effect by governments and the courts.
* Charitable trust: This is an irrevocable trust established for charitable purposes and, in some jurisdictions, a more specific term than &quot;charitable organization&quot;. A charitable trust enjoys a varying degree of tax, economic, and creditor protection benefits.
* Constructive trust: Unlike an express trust, a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee. A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an &quot;equitable remedy&quot;. This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing, where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it. A constructive trust is, essentially, a legal fiction. For example, a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff&#x27;s request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them. The constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing, and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization. The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust, the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust. The latter is an &quot;equitable remedy&quot; imposed by law being truly remedial; the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property.
* Discretionary trust: In a discretionary trust, certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy to be a beneficiary (i.e., whether there is a &#x27;class&#x27; of beneficiaries, which a person can be said to belong to). In that way, persons who satisfy that criterion (who are members of that class) can enforce the trust. &quot;Re Baden’s Deed Trusts&quot;; &quot;McPhail v Doulton&quot;
* Directed trust: In these types, a &quot;directed trustee&quot; is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trust&#x27;s execution; these participants may include a distribution committee, trust protector, or investment advisor. The directed trustee&#x27;s role is administrative which involves following investment instructions, holding legal title to the trust assets, providing fiduciary and tax accounting, coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants
* Dynasty trust (also known as a &#x27;generation-skipping trust&#x27;): A type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantor&#x27;s grandchildren, not the grantor&#x27;s children. The children of the grantor never take title to the assets. This allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to their children first. Generation-skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor&#x27;s children, however, because any income generated by the trust&#x27;s assets can be made accessible to the grantor&#x27;s children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren.
*Employee trust: A trust for the benefit of employees. A United States example is a trust established to operate an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
* Express trust: An express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust, over their assets, either now, or upon their later death. In these cases, this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a trust deed. Almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value, or is real estate.

* Fixed trust: The entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor. The trustee has little or no discretion. Common examples are:
** a trust for a minor (&quot;to x if she attains 21&quot;);
** a &#x27;life interest&#x27; (&quot;to pay the income to x for her lifetime&quot;); and
** a &#x27;remainder&#x27; (&quot;to pay the capital to y after the death of x&quot;)
* Grantor retained annuity trust (&#x27;GRAT&#x27;): an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers asset(s), as a gift, into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument. At the end of the term, the financial property is transferred (tax-free) to the named beneficiaries. This trust is commonly used in the U.S. to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a &#x27;gift tax&#x27;.
* Hybrid trust: Combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts. In a hybrid trust, the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor. But the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property, once these fixed amounts have been paid out, is to be paid to the beneficiaries.
* Implied trust: as distinct from an express trust, is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met, but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist. A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for. In such a case, the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor (the creator of the trust). In other words, the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document.
* Improvement trust: can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area. The trust is often run by a committee, and can act similarly to a development agency, depending on the provisions of its charter.
* Incentive trust: A trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary. The term &quot;incentive trust&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee.
* &quot;Inter vivos&quot; trust (or &#x27;living trust&#x27;): A settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an &quot;inter vivos&quot; trust.

* Irrevocable trust: In contrast to a revocable trust, an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed. Although in rare cases, a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer, under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust.
* Land trust: A private, nonprofit organization that, as all or part of its mission, actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition, or by its stewardship of such land or easements; or an agreement whereby one party (the trustee) agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party (the beneficiary).
* Offshore trust: Strictly speaking, an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident. However, the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or, colloquially, as tax havens. Offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries, but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions. By extension, &quot;onshore trust&quot; has come to mean any trust resident in a high-tax jurisdiction.
* Personal injury trust: A personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury.

* Private and public trusts: A private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary. By contrast, a &quot;public trust&quot; (also called a &quot;charitable trust&quot;) has some charitable end as its beneficiary. To qualify as a charitable trust, the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty, providing education, carrying out some religious purpose, etc. The permissible objects are generally set out in legislation, but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust, by analogy. Charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation.
* Protective trust: Here the terminology is different between the UK and the USA:
** In the UK, a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event; such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary, or any attempt by an individual to dispose of their interest. They have become comparatively rare.
** In the US, a &#x27;protective trust&#x27; is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning. (In another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust.) Often a person, &quot;A&quot;, wishes to leave property to another person &quot;B&quot;. &quot;A&quot;, however, fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before &quot;A&quot; dies, and that therefore &quot;B&quot; would receive none of it. &quot;A&quot; could establish a trust with &quot;B&quot; as the beneficiary, but then &quot;A&quot; would not be entitled to use of the property before they died. Protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation. &quot;A&quot; would establish a trust with both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; as beneficiaries, with the trustee instructed to allow &quot;A&quot; use of the property until they died, and thereafter to allow its use to &quot;B&quot;. The property is then safe from being claimed by &quot;A&quot;&#x27;s creditors, at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trust&#x27;s establishment. This use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders, and is frequently used as an alternative to them.
* Purpose trust: Or, more accurately, non-charitable purpose trust (all charitable trusts are purpose trusts). Generally, the law does not permit non-charitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth-century common law (and, arguable, &quot;Quistclose&quot; trusts). Certain jurisdictions (principally, offshore jurisdictions) have enacted legislation validating non-charitable purpose trusts generally.
*QTIP Trust: Short for &quot;qualified terminal interest property&quot;. A trust recognized under the tax laws of the United States which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the estate tax.
* Resulting trust: A resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where (1) a trust fails, wholly or in part, as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets; or (2) a voluntary payment is made by A to B in circumstances which do not suggest gifting. B becomes the resulting trustee of A&#x27;s payment.
* Revocable trust: A trust of this kind may be amended, altered or revoked by its settlor at any time, provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated. Revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the US as a substitute for a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a person&#x27;s final affairs after death.
* Secret trust: A &quot;post mortem&quot; trust constituted externally from a will but imposing obligations as a trustee on one, or more, legatees of a will.
* Semi-secret trust: A trust in which a will demonstrates the intention to create a trust, names a trustee, but does not identify the intended beneficiary.
* Simple trust:
** In the US jurisdiction this has two distinct meanings:
*** In a simple trust the trustee has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust. This is also called a &#x27;bare trust&#x27;. All other trusts are &quot;special trusts&quot; where the trustee has active duties beyond this.
*** A simple trust in Federal income tax law is one in which, under the terms of the trust document, all net income must be distributed on an annual basis.
** In the UK a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust. Bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors. Trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland.
* Special trust: In the US, a special trust, also called complex trust, contrasts with a simple trust (see above). It does not require the income be paid out within the subject tax year. The funds from a complex trust can also be used to donate to a charity or for charitable purposes.
* Special Power of Appointment trust (SPA Trust): A trust implementing a special power of appointment to provide asset protection features.
* Spendthrift trust: It is a trust put into place for the benefit of a person who is unable to control their spending. It gives the trustee the power to decide how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary.
* Standby Trust (or &#x27;Pourover Trust)&#x27;: The trust is empty at creation during life and the will transfers the property into the trust at death. This is a statutory trust.
* Statutory Business Trust: A trust created pursuant to a state&#x27;s business trust statute used primarily for commercial purposes. Two prominent variants of Statutory Business Trusts are Delaware statutory trusts and Massachusetts business trusts. The Uniform Law Commission promulgated a final amended draft of the Uniform Statutory Entity Act (2009) in 2013. As of 24 January 2017, no states have adopted the Uniform Statutory Entity Act of 2009.
* Testamentary trust (or &#x27;Will Trust&#x27;): A trust created in an individual&#x27;s will is called a testamentary trust. Because a will can become effective only upon death, a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of the settlor&#x27;s death.
* Unit trust: A trust where the beneficiaries (called &quot;unitholders&quot;) each possess a certain share (called &quot;units&quot;) and can direct the trustee to pay money to them out of the trust property according to the number of units they possess. A unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment, rather than disposition, as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary.

== Country specific variations ==
While trusts originated in England, and therefore English trusts law has had a significant influence, particularly among common law legal systems such as those of the Commonwealth or the United States, the impact of trust law has been wide and varied. Even under common law systems, the basic notion of a trust has been implemented in strikingly different ways.

Trust law in civil law jurisdictions, generally including Continental Europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions (e.g. Curaçao, Liechtenstein and Sint Maarten). The trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases, for example within the Brussels regime (Europe) and the parties to the Hague Trust Convention. Tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that European countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts.

=== Cyprus ===
Cyprus legislators enacted the Cyprus International Trusts Law of 2012 with an aim to facilitate the establishment of trusts by non-Cypriot residents. The Cyprus International Trust is based on common law principles however the Cyprus International Trusts Law of 2012 introduces certain conditions and requirements to for the trust to qualify under the same law. These conditions are:

* The settlor must be of sound mind and of the right age.
* The settlor must not be a resident of Cyprus for at least 1 year prior to the establishment of the Cyprus International Trust.
* The beneficiaries must not be residents of Cyprus for at least 1 year prior to the establishment of the Cyprus International Trust.
* At least one trustee must be residing in Cyprus during the whole duration of the trust.

In addition to above the common law principles of certainty must be present.

==== Settlor Powers provided by law ====
The Cyprus International Trust Law of 2012 also introduces certain settlor powers which if exercised will not invalidate the trust and or do not need to be inserted in the trust deed for the settlor to exercise them. The powers introduced are:

* to revoke or amend the terms of a trust or any trusts or powers arising wholly or partly under it
* to advance, distribute, pay or otherwise apply income or capital of the trust property or to give directions for the making of such advancement, distribution, payment or application
* to exercise the powers of a director or officer or issue binding directions as to the appointment or removal of a director or officer of any company, wholly or partly owned by the trust;
* to give binding directions to the trustee in connection with the purchase, retention, sale, management, lending, pledging or charging of the trust property or the exercise of any powers or rights arising from such property;
* to appoint or remove any trustee, enforcer, protector or beneficiary;
* to appoint or remove any investment manager or investment adviser;
* to change the applicable law governing the trust or the forum for the administration of the trust;
* to restrict the exercise of any power or discretion of a trustee by requiring that they are only exercisable with the consent of the settlor or any other person expressly specified in the terms governing the trust.

==== Duration of Cyprus International Trust ====
Cyprus does not limit the duration of an international trust and it may be formed for an unspecified duration.

==== Charitable Trust and Purpose Trust ====
In accordance with Section 7, a Cyprus International Trust may be formed for one or more of the following purposes:

* the prevention or relief of poverty
* the advancement of education
* the advancement of religion
* the advancement of health or the saving of lives
* the advancement of citizenship or community development
* the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science
* the advancement of amateur sport
* the advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity
* the advancement of environmental protection or improvement
* the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantages
* the advancement of animal welfare and protection of animals;
* any other purpose beneficial to the public in general or which may reasonably be considered to be relevant to any of above

==== Confidentiality of Cyprus International Trust ====
The law includes specific confidentiality obligations over the trustee, the protector, enforcer or any other person to keep information and details of the trust confidential. This right is waived in the instances that law requires the disclosure of such information or if a judge before which a case is tried in issues a judgment to such effect. Nevertheless, with the changing times, public disclosure of trusts is required in Cyprus. Such public disclosures are required:

===== Stamp Duty Commissioner for validating the creation of the Cyprus International Trust =====
For a trust to be validly constituted it must be presented to the commissioner of stamp duty and a one-time payment of Euro 430 is made. The commissioner does not keep a copy of the document.

===== Regulatory Disclosure of ASPs managing a Cyprus International Trust =====
The regulation of the industry providing company and trust management functions (ASP) has also brought about the requirement to disclose to the regulator the existence of a Cyprus International Trust. Such obligation burdens the trust company and the information disclosed is the following:

* The date the trust was created
* The name of the trust
* The name and particulars of the trustee
* The governing law of the trust

For the avoidance of any doubt, the regulator does not require particulars of the Settlor, the Beneficiaries and details of the trusts. Neither does the regulator store in any way the trust deed. On the contrary, they rely on the regulated entity to collect, store and update this information

===== Cyprus Beneficial Owner Register and Cyprus International Trust =====
The Prevention and Suppression of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Law of 2007-2018 introduced mandatory disclosure requirements in respects to trusts. Generally known as the Cyprus Beneficial Ownership Register. Subject to this the following information will be required to be mandatory disclosed:

* The settlor
* The trustee
* The protector
* The beneficiary or the class of beneficiaries if they have not been identified yet
* Any other person exercising control over the trust

The actual implementation of this law still remains to be seen however the requirements above are expressly extracted from The Prevention and Suppression of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Law of 2007–2018.

===== FATCA =====
Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) a Trustee and or a Trust may be classified as a Foreign Financial Institution (FFI) requiring registration with the IRS and disclosure of results on a yearly basis.

===== CRS =====
Under the Common Reporting Standard decree, a trust would in most cases classify as either a Reporting Financial Institution (FI) or a Passive Non-Financial Entity (Passive NFE). If the trust is an FI the trust or the trustee will have an obligation to report to its local tax authority in Cyprus in respects to the reportable accounts.

==== Taxation of Cyprus International Trust ====
The income and profits derived within and outside of Cyprus are liable to every possible taxation imposed in Cyprus if the beneficiary is a resident of Cyprus in accordance with the Income Tax Laws of Cyprus.

If the beneficiaries are not Cyprus residents then any income and profit derived from Cypriot sources will be subject to tax.

Relevant to consider is what income is subject to taxation in Cyprus and the none domicile regime applicable in Cyprus.

=== England and Wales ===
==== History ====
As noted above, the English trust arose from the court of the Lord Chancellor, known as the Court of Chancery.

There are several features which distinguish the modern English trust both from other common law trusts and from civil law approaches.

==== Purpose trusts and the requirement for a beneficiary ====

In some ways, the modern English trust is, when compared to other jurisdictions, more conservative in its requirements. For example, it retains the requirement that there be a beneficiary. There are two main exceptions to this rule: charitable purpose trusts and &quot;Re Denley&quot; trusts. This contrasts with other jurisdictions like Cyprus, the BVI, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Gibraltar which allow for non-charitable purpose trusts to be valid. This will normally be done by appointing a somebody to act as the trust&#x27;s Protector. These purpose trusts allow for a trust to be created with a purpose (e.g. &#x27;to provide for &quot;N&quot;&#x27;s education&#x27;, where &quot;N&quot; is a family member) instead of a named beneficiary. The role of the Protector (also sometimes called an enforcer) is to hold the trustees to account, which the beneficiaries would usually have the right to do.

==== Unincorporated Associations ====

A major use of trusts is to allow for the existence of unincorporated associations. These often are associations or groups of people that come together for a particular (usually non-commercial purpose). Common examples might be local social and sports clubs, some gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, and some professional associations.

The main way that English law supports the existence of these is by understanding them as a form of trust. The association has no legal personality (i.e. the capacity to enter into legal relations in their own name). This contrasts with the approach taken in many civil law jurisdictions, like Spain or France, where civil or social associations are often accorded legal personhood. Thus, in England, the officers of an association (e.g. its chairman, secretary and treasurer) will be recognised as trustees and will hold the assets of the association on trust for the members of the association with the constitution of the association forming the basis of the rules governing the trust.

===South Africa===
In many ways trusts in South Africa operate similarly to other common law countries, although the law of South Africa is actually a hybrid of the British common law system and Roman-Dutch law.

In South Africa, in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a &quot;bewind trust&quot; (inherited from the Roman-Dutch &quot;bewind&quot; administered by a &quot;bewindhebber&quot;) in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust, although this is regarded by modern Dutch law as not actually a trust. &quot;Bewind&quot; trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantages.

In South Africa, minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution, the Guardian&#x27;s Fund, and released to the children in adulthood. Therefore, testamentary (will) trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children.

There are two types of living trusts in South Africa, namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts. In vested trusts, the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed, whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit.

====Asset protection====
Until recently, there were tax advantages to living trusts in South Africa, although most of these advantages have been removed. Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency Act (Act 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).

====Tax considerations====
Under South African law living trusts are considered tax payers. Two types of tax apply to living trusts, namely income tax and capital gains tax (CGT). A trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 40% (individuals pay according to income scales, usually less than 20%). The trust&#x27;s income can, however, be taxed in the hands of either the trust or the beneficiary. A trust pays CGT at the rate of 20% (individuals pay 10%). Trusts do not pay deceased estate tax (although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate, in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax).

The taxpayer whose residence has been &#x27;locked&#x27; into a trust has now been given another opportunity to take advantage of these CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is not likely that it will ever become available thereafter.

=== United States ===
In the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in Pennsylvania, California, Oklahoma and Texas (and any other state that has adopted section 602 of the Uniform Trust Code), in which trusts are presumed to be revocable unless the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable.

In the United States, state law, variable from state to state, governs trusts. Many states have adopted the Uniform Trust Code, and there are also broad similarities among states&#x27; common law of trust. These similarities are summarized in the Restatements of the Law, such as the Restatement of Trusts, Third (2003−08). Additionally, as a practical matter, federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the Internal Revenue Service may affect the structure and creation of trusts.

In the United States the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations, partnerships, or not at all depending on the circumstances, although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations. For example, the trust-preferred security is a hybrid (debt and equity) security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks&#x27; balance sheets. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of (large) banks&#x27; regulatory capital.

==== Estate planning ====

Living trusts, as opposed to testamentary (will) trusts, may help a trustor avoid probate. Avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular. Probate is potentially costly, and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private. Both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability, by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will.

Negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the one-time probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies whether or not there is a drafted will. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent&#x27;s assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of bonding, insurance, and itemized accountings of probate assets.

==== Estate tax effect ====
Living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the U.S. federal estate tax. Married couples may, however, effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause.

For a living trust, the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust, such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, in practical terms, tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations. If a living trust fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on resulting trusts, which in some notable cases, has had high tax consequences.

<text>In music, a tone row or note row ( or &#x27;), alsoseriesorset, is a non-repetitive ordering of a set of pitch-classes, typically of the twelve notes in musical set theory of the chromatic scale, though both larger and smaller sets are sometimes found.

==History and usage==
Tone rows are the basis of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique and most types of serial music. Tone rows were widely used in 20th-century contemporary music, like Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s use of twelve-tone rows, &quot;without dodecaphonic transformations.&quot;

A tone row has been identified in the A minor prelude, BWV 889, from book II of J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; (1742) and by the late eighteenth century it is found in works such as Mozart&#x27;s C major String Quartet, K. 157 (1772), String Quartet in E-flat major, K. 428, String Quintet in G minor, K. 516 (1790), and the Symphony in G minor, K. 550 (1788). Beethoven also used the technique but, on the whole, &quot;Mozart seems to have employed serial technique far more often than Beethoven&quot;. Franz Liszt used a twelve-tone row in the opening of his &quot;Faust Symphony&quot;. Hans Keller claims that Schoenberg was aware of this serial practice in the classical period and that &quot;Schoenberg repressed his knowledge of classical serialism because it would have injured his narcissism.&quot;

==Theory and compositional techniques==

Tone rows are designated by letters and subscript numbers (e.g.: RI11, which may also appear as RI11 or RI–11). The numbers indicate the initial (P or I) or final (R or RI) pitch-class number of the given row form, most often with &quot;c&quot; = 0.

* &quot;P&quot; indicates prime, a forward-directed right-side up form.
* &quot;I&quot; indicates inversion, a forward-directed upside-down form.
* &quot;R&quot; indicates retrograde, a backwards right-side up form.
* &quot;RI&quot; indicates retrograde-inversion, a backwards upside-down form.
* Transposition is indicated by a &quot;T number&quot;, for example P8 is a T(4) transposition of P4.

A twelve-tone composition will take one or more tone rows, called the &quot;prime form&quot;, as its basis plus their transformations (inversion, retrograde, retrograde inversion, as well as transposition; see twelve-tone technique for details). These forms may be used to construct a melody in a straightforward manner as in Schoenberg&#x27;s Piano Suite Op. 25 Minuet Trio, where P-0 is used to construct the opening melody and later varied through transposition, as P-6, and also in articulation and dynamics. It is then varied again through inversion, untransposed, taking form I-0. However, rows may be combined to produce melodies or harmonies in more complicated ways, such as taking successive or multiple pitches of a melody from two different row forms, as described at twelve-tone technique.

Initially, Schoenberg required the avoidance of suggestions of tonality—such as the use of consecutive imperfect consonances (thirds or sixths)—when constructing tone rows, reserving such use for the time when the dissonance is completely emancipated. Alban Berg, however, sometimes incorporated tonal elements into his twelve-tone works. The main tone row of his Violin Concerto hints at this tonality:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
 \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)
 \relative c&#x27; {
 \time 12/1
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 1 = 60
 g1 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f
}
&lt;/score&gt;

This tone row consists of alternating minor and major triads starting on the open strings of the violin, followed by a portion of an ascending whole tone scale. This whole tone scale reappears in the second movement when the chorale &quot;Es ist genug&quot; (It is enough) from J.S. Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort&quot;, BWV 60 is quoted literally in the woodwinds (mostly clarinet).

Some tone rows have a high degree of internal organization. An example is the tone row from Anton Webern&#x27;s Concerto for Nine Instruments Op. 24, shown below.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
 \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 3/1
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 1 = 60
 b1 bes d
 es, g fis
 aes e f
 c&#x27; cis a
}
&lt;/score&gt;

In this tone row, if the first three notes are regarded as the &quot;original&quot; cell, then the next three are its retrograde inversion, the next three are retrograde, and the last three are its inversion. A row created in this manner, through variants of a trichord or tetrachord called the generator, is called a &quot;derived row&quot;.

The tone rows of many of Webern&#x27;s other late works are similarly intricate. The tone row for Webern&#x27;s String Quartet Op. 28 is based on the BACH motif (B, A, C, B) and is composed of three tetrachords:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
 \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 4/1
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 1 = 60
 bes1 a c b!
 dis e cis d
 ges, f aes g
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The &quot;set-complex&quot; is the forty-eight forms of the set generated by stating each &quot;aspect&quot; or transformation on each pitch class.

The all-interval twelve-tone row is a tone row arranged so that it contains one instance of each interval within the octave, 0 through 11.

The &quot;total chromatic&quot; (or &quot;aggregate&quot;) is the set of all twelve pitch classes. An &quot;array&quot; is a succession of aggregates. The term is also used to refer to lattices.

An aggregate may be achieved through complementation or combinatoriality, such as with hexachords.

A &quot;secondary set&quot; is a tone row which is derived from or, &quot;results from the reversed coupling of hexachords&quot;, when a given row form is immediately repeated. For example, the row form consisting of two hexachords:
 &quot;0 1 2 3 4 5&quot; / &quot;6 7 8 9 t e&quot;
when repeated immediately results in the following succession of two aggregates, in the middle of which is a new and complete aggregate beginning with the second hexachord:
 &quot;0 1 2 3 4 5&quot; / &quot;6 7 8 9 t e&quot; / &quot;0 1 2 3 4 5&quot; / &quot;6 7 8 9 t e&quot;
 secondary set: [&quot;6 7 8 9 t e&quot; / &quot;0 1 2 3 4 5&quot;]

A &quot;weighted aggregate&quot; is an aggregate in which the twelfth pitch does not appear until at least one pitch has appeared at least twice, supplied by segments of different set forms. It seems to have been first used in Milton Babbitt&#x27;s String Quartet No. 4. An aggregate may be vertically or horizontally weighted. An &quot;all-partition array&quot; is created by combining a collection of hexachordally combinatorial arrays.

==Nonstandard tone rows==

Schoenberg specified many strict rules and desirable guidelines for the construction of tone rows such as number of notes and intervals to avoid. Tone rows that depart from these guidelines include the above tone row from Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto which contains triads and tonal emphasis, and the tone row below from Luciano Berio&#x27;s &quot;Nones&quot; which contains a repeated note making it a &#x27;thirteen-tone row&#x27;:

Igor Stravinsky used a five-tone row, chromatically filling out the space of a major third centered tonally on C (C–E), in one of his early serial compositions, &quot;In memoriam Dylan Thomas&quot;.

In his twelve-tone practice, Stravinsky preferred the inverse-retrograde (IR) to the retrograde-inverse (RI), as for example in his &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot;:


Ben Johnston uses a &quot;just tone row&quot; (see just intonation) in works including String Quartets Nos. 6 and 7. Each permutation contains a just chromatic scale, however, transformations (transposition and inversion) produce pitches outside of the primary row form, as already occurs in the inversion of P0. The pitches of each hexachord are drawn from different otonality or utonality on A+ utonality, C otonality and utonality, and E- otonality, outlining a diminished triad.

<text>Triatoma protracta is a species of any mid sized insect in the family Reduviidae. It is known commonly as the western bloodsucking conenose. It is distributed in the western United States and Mexico.

This species and other &quot;kissing bugs&quot; are vectors of &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;, the protozoan that causes Chagas disease.

This species is between 0.5 and 0.75 inches long. It is dark brown to black in color with a lighter margin along the abdomen. The wings lie flat across the back. The &quot;beak&quot; has three segments and curls beneath the head. The nymph is similar in appearance but it is smaller and lacks wings.

This insect and others of its genus live in the nests of animals such as pack rats (genus &quot;Neotoma&quot;). They become pests when they invade houses. They bite humans, producing irritation to the skin and sometimes severe allergic reactions. The insects are also known to have three subspecies including:

* &quot;T. protracta woodi&quot;
* &quot;T. protracta protracta&quot;
* &quot;T. protracta navajoensis&quot;

<text>A three-chord song is a song whose music is built around three chords that are played in a certain sequence. A common type of three-chord song is the simple twelve-bar blues used in blues and rock and roll.

Typically, the three chords used are the chords on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant (scale degrees I, IV and V): in the key of C, these would be the C, F and G chords. Sometimes the V7 chord is used instead of V, for greater tension.

The I (tonic), IV (subdominant) and V (dominant) chords (primary triads) together encompass all seven tones of the tonic&#x27;s major scale. These three chords are a simple means of covering many melodies without the use of passing notes.

The order of the chord progression may be varied; popular chord progression variations using the I, IV and V chords of a scale are: 
* I – IV – V 
* IV – I – V
* I – IV – I – V 
* I – IV – V – IV
Beside the I, IV and V chord progression, other widely used 3-chord progressions are:
* I – vi – V
* I – ii – V

==Quotes==
Songwriter Harlan Howard once said &quot;country music is three chords and the truth.&quot;

Lou Reed said &quot;One chord is fine. Two chords is pushing it. Three chords and you&#x27;re into jazz.&quot; Reed nevertheless wrote many songs with unique or complex chord progressions himself, such as the material on &quot;Berlin&quot;.

<doc id="31052" wikidata="Q843585" url="?curid=31052" title="Trakehner">
<text>Trakehner () is a light warmblood breed of horse, originally developed at the East Prussian state stud farm in the town of Trakehnen from which the breed takes its name. The was established in 1731 and operated until 1944, when the fighting of World War II led to the annexing of East Prussia by Russia, and the town containing the stud renamed as Yasnaya Polyana.

The Trakehner typically stands between . They can be any color, with bay, gray, chestnut and black being the most common, though the breed also includes few roan and tobiano pinto horses. It is considered to be the lightest and most refined of the warmbloods, due to its closed stud book which allows entry of only Trakehner, as well as few selected Thoroughbred, Anglo-Arabian, Shagya and Arabian bloodlines.

==Characteristics==
Owing to its Thoroughbred ancestry, the Trakehner is of rectangular build, with a long sloping shoulder, good hindquarters, short cannons, and a medium-long, crested and well-set neck. The head is often finely chiseled, narrow at the muzzle, with a broad forehead. It is known for its &quot;floating trot&quot; – full of impulsion and suspension. The Trakehner possesses a strong, medium-length back and powerful hindquarters.

Trakehners are athletic and trainable, with good endurance, while some are more spirited than horses of other warmblood breeds. Trakehners breed true to type, due to the purity of the bloodlines, making it valuable for upgrading other warmbloods.

==History==


Old Prussians and other Baltic people such as the Lithuanians were noted for their hardy horses and cavalry during the early Middle Ages. During their conquest of Old Prussians in the 13th century Prussian crusade, the conquering Teutonic Knights named the Old Prussian horse a &quot;Schwaikenpferd&quot;, a small primitive horse. Beginning in the 14th century, knights used it to breed their military horses, and descendants of the Schwaikenpferd were later used by Masovian and Ostsiedlung farmers for light utility work. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the people of Ducal Prussia, Brandenburg, and Royal Prussia used a wide variety of horses from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Crimean Tatars, Ottoman Turkey, Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, Holy Roman Empire for their cavalry and stud horses, crossed on local animals.

In 1732 King Frederick William I of Prussia used these horses and other imports to establish the Trakehnen Stud at the East Prussian town Trakehnen (now Yasnaya Polyana, Russia). Soldiers cleared the forest at the River Pissa between Stallupönen and Gumbinnen. In 1739 the king gave it to crown prince Frederick II of Prussia, who often sold stallions to make money. After his death in 1786 it became state property, named &quot;Königlich Preußisches Hauptgestüt Trakehnen&quot;.

Between 1817 and 1837 the stud added Arabian, Thoroughbred, and Hanoverian horse blood to their stock. One especially influential Thoroughbred was Perfectionist, by Persimmon, who won The Derby and the St Leger in 1896. He was to be the sire of the great Trakehner stallion Tempelhüter, and most modern Trakehners can be traced to these two stallions. The Arabian blood was added to offset possible flaws of the Thoroughbred.

East Prussian farmers were encouraged to bring their mares, by then known for their hardiness and quality, to Trakehnen&#x27;s stallions. This enabled the rapid transformation of the breed into much sought-after army remounts: sure-footed, intelligent and athletic. By 1918 60,000 mares per year were bred to East Prussian stallions.

In 1919 the Treaty of Versailles limited Germany&#x27;s army to 100,000 troops and so the breed&#x27;s focus was again turned to producing horses suitable to farm duties. For this purpose, sires of heavier conformation (build) were used, the most successful being Ararad, Dampfross, Hyperion, Pythagoras and Tempelhüter. These stallions, while refined, possessed much substance and bone. Their influence is still seen on the modern Trakehner.

It was during the 1920s and 1930s that the breed was recognized for its performance abilities in competitive disciplines. Trakehners won gold and silver medals in two Olympics, including six gold medals in Berlin in 1936, and won Czechoslovakia&#x27;s notoriously challenging Velká pardubická steeplechase nine times. In the 1930s there were more than 10,000 breeders and 18,000 registered mares.

In the 1930s and early 1940s Hauptvorwerk Trakehnen and its 15 Vorwerke covered , of which were fields, meadows, forest, garden and other. Horses such as the Trakehner were used in World War II which, at the end, nearly destroyed the breed as Soviet troops advanced from the East, causing flight and expulsion of Germans during and after WWII. The main Stud and local residents were forced to evacuate between 20 January 1945 and March 1945. Their journey West, known as &quot;Der Treck&quot; (&quot;The Flight&quot;), sent the horses on a dangerous journey in frigid conditions across the frozen Vistula lagoon without proper rations or shelter. It is considered one of the toughest tests to which an entire breed of horses has been submitted.

Refugee convoys were bombed while on the ice by the Soviet airforce, so only a small number of horses made it to safety. 700 surviving horses were accounted for. The horses left behind in East Prussia became important in the breeding of Russian breeds such as the Kirov as well as the Polish Mazury (also known as the Masuren) and Pozan (or Poznan), which developed into the Wielkopolski. After the war, the breed, which once numbered tens of thousands was reduced to approximately 600 broodmares and 50 stallions in West Germany. The last original Trakehner was Keith, born there in 1941, who died in November 1976 in Gilten shortly before his 35th birthday. On 23 October 1947 the East Prussian Studbook Society was dissolved and the Association of Breeders and Friends of the Warmblood Horse of Trakehner Origin, known today as the &quot;Trakehner Verband&quot;, was created. Among the greatest obstacles the organization faced was that unlike other German breeds, the Trakehner had no mother state and could not depend on government funding. The re-establishment of the breed originally depended on the determination of its members and the largesse of others.

True pure-bred Trakehner show the &quot;Ostpreußische Elchschaufel&quot; (East Prussian moose horn) branding (see Image above).

==The modern Trakehner==

Today in Germany the breed is considered a federal responsibility, with its governance falling under both the Trakehner Verband and the Trakehner Gesellschaft mbH; the latter handling all business operations.

Stallion inspections are held in Neumünster, Germany, each October and approved stallions are required to complete extended performance tests, which rate the horses&#x27; gaits, temperament, jumping ability, and suitability over a cross country course, before being given full breeding licenses.

The Trakehner is used as a &quot;refiner&quot; of other breeds, allowing an infusion of Thoroughbred and Arabian blood without the risks often involved in first generation outcrosses. Influential stallions include Abglanz for the Hanoverian, Herbststurm who influenced the Oldenburg, Marco Polo for the Dutch Warmblood, the stallions Ibikus and Donauwind for the Danish Warmblood, and Polarstern for the Swedish Warmblood.

While Trakehners compete in nearly all equestrian disciplines, they are particularly prized as dressage mounts, due to their sensitivity, intelligence and way of going. Peron anchored the United States team to an Olympic Bronze in 1996 at Atlanta. Abdullah, by Donauwind, is particularly famous for his show jumping team gold and individual silver medals at the 1984 Olympics and 1985 World Cup win. Heuriger was the 1994 show jumping team silver medallist at the 1994 World Equestrian Games. Trakehner mare TSF Dalera BB, ridden by Jessica von Bredow Werndl, is the no.1 ranked dressage horse in the world as of September 2023, and has won gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics for both team and individual. Dalera has also won individual gold medals at the 2022 and 2023 Dressage World Cup.

<text>Tempera (), also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium, usually glutinous material such as egg yolk. &quot;Tempera&quot; also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long-lasting, and examples from the first century AD still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by oil painting. A paint consisting of pigment and binder commonly used in the United States as poster paint is also often referred to as &quot;tempera paint&quot;, although the binders in this paint are different from traditional tempera paint.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;tempera&quot; is derived from the Italian &quot;dipingere a tempera&quot; (&quot;paint in distemper&quot;), from the Late Latin &quot;distemperare&quot; (&quot;mix thoroughly&quot;).

==History==

Tempera painting has been found on early Egyptian sarcophagus decorations. Many of the Fayum mummy portraits use tempera, sometimes in combination with encaustic painting with melted wax, the alternative painting technique in the ancient world. It was also used for the murals of the 3rd century Dura-Europos synagogue. 

A related technique has been used also in ancient and early medieval paintings found in several caves and rock-cut temples of India. High-quality art with the help of tempera was created in Bagh Caves between the late 4th and 10th centuries and in the 7th century in Ravan Chhaya rock shelter, Odisha.

The art technique was known from the classical world, where it appears to have taken over from encaustic painting and was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the Byzantine world and Medieval and Early Renaissance Europe. Tempera painting was the primary panel painting medium for nearly every painter in the European Medieval and Early renaissance period up to 1500. For example, most surviving panel paintings attributed to Michelangelo are executed in egg tempera, an exception being his &quot;Doni Tondo&quot; which uses both tempera and oil paint.

Oil paint, which may have originated in Afghanistan between the 5th and 9th centuries and migrated westward in the Middle Ages eventually superseded tempera. Oil replaced tempera as the principal medium used for creating artwork during the 15th century in Early Netherlandish painting in northern Europe. Around 1500, oil paint replaced tempera in Italy. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were intermittent revivals of tempera technique in Western art, among the Pre-Raphaelites, Social Realists, and others. Tempera painting continues to be used in Greece and Russia where it is the traditional medium for Orthodox icons.

==Technique==
Tempera is traditionally created by hand-grinding dry powdered pigments into a binding agent or &quot;medium&quot;, such as egg yolk, milk (in the form of casein) and a variety of plant gums.

===Egg tempera===
The most common form of classical tempera painting is &quot;egg tempera&quot;. For this form most often only the contents of the egg yolk is used. The white of the egg and the membrane of the yolk are discarded (the membrane of the yolk is dangled over a receptacle and punctured to drain off the liquid inside). The egg yolk is diluted with water and used with pigment. Some kind of remedy is always added in different proportions. One recipe uses vinegar as a preservative, but only in small quantities. A few drops of vinegar will keep the solution for a week. Some egg tempera schools use different mixtures of egg yolk and water, usually the ratio of yolk to water is 1:3; other recipes offer white wine (1 part yolk, 2 parts wine).

Powdered pigment, or pigment that has been ground in distilled water, is placed onto a palette or bowl and mixed with a roughly equal volume of the binder. Some pigments require slightly more binder, some require less.

When used to paint icons on church walls, liquid myrrh is sometimes added to the mixture to give the paint a pleasing odor, particularly as worshippers may find the egg tempera somewhat pungent for quite some time after completion. The paint mixture has to be constantly adjusted to maintain a balance between a &quot;greasy&quot; and &quot;watery&quot; consistency by adjusting the amount of water and yolk. As tempera dries, the artist will add more water to preserve the consistency and to balance the thickening of the yolk on contact with air. Once prepared, the paint cannot be stored. Egg tempera is water-resistant, but not waterproof. Different preparations use the egg white or the whole egg for a different effect. Other additives such as oil and wax emulsions can modify the medium. Egg tempera is not a flexible paint and requires stiff boards; painting on canvas will cause cracks to form and chips of paint to fall off.

Egg tempera paint should be cured for at least 3 months, up to 6 months. The surface is susceptible to scratches during the curing process, but will become much more durable after curing. Egg tempera paintings are not normally framed behind glass, as the glass can trap moisture and lead to the growth of mold.

===Tempera grassa===
Adding oil in no more than a 1:1 ratio with the egg yolk by volume produces a water-soluble medium with many of the color effects of oil paint, although it cannot be painted thickly.

===Pigments===
Some of the pigments used by medieval painters, such as cinnabar (contains mercury), orpiment (contains arsenic), or lead white (contains lead) are highly toxic. Most artists today use modern synthetic pigments, which are less toxic but have similar color properties to the older pigments. Even so, many (if not most) modern pigments are still dangerous unless certain precautions are taken; these include keeping pigments wet in storage to avoid breathing their dust.

===Application===
Tempera paint dries rapidly. It is normally applied in thin, semi-opaque or transparent layers. Tempera painting allows for great precision when used with traditional techniques that require the application of numerous small brush strokes applied in a cross-hatching technique. When dry, it produces a smooth matte finish. Because it cannot be applied in thick layers as oil paints can, tempera paintings rarely have the deep color saturation that oil paintings can achieve because it can hold less pigment (lower pigment load). In this respect, the colors of an unvarnished tempera painting resemble a pastel, although the color deepens if a varnish is applied. On the other hand, tempera colors do not change over time, whereas oil paints darken, yellow, and become transparent with age.

===Ground===

Tempera adheres best to an absorbent ground that has a lower oil content than the tempera binder used (the traditional rule of thumb is &quot;fat over lean&quot;, and never the other way around). The ground traditionally used is inflexible Italian gesso, and the substrate is usually rigid as well. Historically wood panels were used as the substrate, and more recently un-tempered masonite or medium density fiberboard (MDF) have been employed; heavy paper is also used.

===Pre-made paints===
Apart from the traditional process of mixing pigment with egg yolk, new methods include egg tempera sold in tubes by manufacturers such as Sennelier and Daler-Rowney. These paints do contain a slight amount of oil to enhance durability within the container. Notable egg tempera artist and author Koo Schadler points out that because of this addition of oil &quot;tubed &#x27;egg tempera&#x27; paints are actually &#x27;tempera grassa&#x27;, an emulsion of egg yolk and a drying oil (generally with other additives, such as preservatives and stabilizers). Tempera grassa has some of the working properties of both egg tempera and oil painting and is a perfectly viable medium – however it is not the same as pure, homemade egg tempera and behaves differently.&quot;Marc Chagall used Sennelier egg tempera tube paints extensively.

==Artists==
Although tempera has been out of favor since the Late Renaissance and Baroque eras, it has been periodically rediscovered by later artists such as William Blake, the Nazarenes, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Joseph Southall. The 20th century saw a significant revival of tempera. European painters who worked with tempera include Giorgio de Chirico, Otto Dix, Eliot Hodgkin, Pyke Koch, and Pietro Annigoni, who used an emulsion of egg yolks, stand oil and varnish.

Spanish surrealist painter Remedios Varo worked extensively in egg tempera.

===Revival in 20th-century American art===

The tempera medium was used by American artists such as the Regionalists Andrew Wyeth, Thomas Hart Benton and his students James Duard Marshall and Roger Medearis; expressionists Ben Shahn, Mitchell Siporin and John Langley Howard, magic realists George Tooker, Paul Cadmus, Jared French, Julia Thecla and Louise E. Marianetti, realist painter David Hanna; Art Students League of New York instructors Kenneth Hayes Miller and William C. Palmer, Social Realists Kyra Markham, Isabel Bishop, Reginald Marsh, and Noel Rockmore, Edward Laning, Anton Refregier, Jacob Lawrence, Rudolph F. Zallinger, Robert Vickrey, Peter Hurd, and science fiction artist John Schoenherr, notable as the cover artist of &quot;Dune&quot;.

===20th-century Indian art===
In the early part of the 20th century, a large number of Indian artists, notably of the Bengal school took up tempera as one of their primary media of expression. Artists such as Gaganendranath Tagore, Asit Kumar Haldar, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Kalipada Ghoshal and Sughra Rababi were foremost. After the 1950s, artists such as Jamini Roy and Ganesh Pyne established tempera as a medium for the new age artists of India.

===In contemporary art===
Other practicing tempera artists include Philip Aziz, Ernst Fuchs, Antonio Roybal, George Huszar, Donald Jackson, Tim Lowly, Altoon Sultan, Shaul Shats, Sandro Chia, Alex Colville, Robert Vickrey, Andrew Wyeth, Andrew Grassie, Soheila Sokhanvari, and Ganesh Pyne.

Ken Danby (1940-2007) a Canadian realist artist, whose most well known works (such as: At the Crease, Lacing up, and Pancho) were completed using egg tempera.

Robert Clinch (1957-) is an Australian realist painter who, thanks to the 1993 Marten Bequest Travelling Scholarship, was able to conduct extensive research into egg tempera and has since completed multiple works in the medium.

<text>Theological virtues are virtues associated in Christian theology and philosophy with salvation resulting from the grace of God. Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally the theological virtues have been named faith, hope, and charity (love). They are coupled with the four natural or cardinal virtues, and opposed to the seven deadly sins.

The medieval Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas explained that these virtues are called theological virtues &quot;first, because their object is God, inasmuch as they direct us aright to God: secondly, because they are infused in us by God alone: thirdly, because these virtues are not made known to us, save by Divine revelation, contained in Holy Writ&quot;.

==Background==

===1 Corinthians 13===
The first mention in Christian literature of the three theological virtues is in St. Paul&#x27;s first letter to the Thessalonians 1:3, &quot;...calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope...&quot; In 1 Thessalonians 5:8, he refers to this triad of virtues again, &quot;But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation.&quot;

In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). &quot;So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.&quot; First, because it informs the other two: &quot;It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.&quot; According to Augustine of Hippo, from a temporal perspective, love lasts, while &quot;Hope isn&#x27;t hope if its object is seen,&quot; and faith gives way to possession. This view is shared by Gregory of Nyssa.

===Aquinas===
Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom () and moral virtue (e.g. courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness). This is frequently termed &quot;the Unity of the Virtues.&quot;

Aquinas stated that theological virtues are so called &quot;because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures&quot;.

In his treatment of the virtues, Aquinas viewed the theological virtues as being the product of habitual grace. According to Aquinas, this grace, through the theological virtues, allows humanity to become agents in meritorious action that is beyond their own natural ability. In this way it is supernatural.

Aquinas says &quot;Faith has the character of a virtue, not because of the things it believes, for faith is of things that appear not, but because it adheres to the testimony of one in whom truth is infallibly found&quot;.

Aquinas further connected the theological virtues with the cardinal virtues. He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological virtues, caused by habitual grace, to find their fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal virtues.

==Teaching by denomination==
===Catholic Church===
The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that faith, hope, and love (charity) &quot;dispose Christians to live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity. They have God for their origin, their motive, and their object – God known by faith, hoped in, and loved for His own sake.&quot;

===Moravian Church===
Among essential beliefs, the Moravian Church teaches that &quot;God creates; God redeems; God blesses. And we respond in faith, in love, and in hope.&quot; As such, Moravian Christians teach to judge themselves &quot;by how deep our faith is, how expansive our love is, and how life affirming our hope is.&quot;

===Anglican Communion===
Churches of the Anglican Communion also follow Augustine and Aquinas. &quot;Faith is a matter of knowledge of God which perfects the intellect... Hope is a matter of the perfection of the will... Love is a matter of perfection itself as love is the perfection of all powers.&quot; Richard Hooker said regarding faith, that its &quot;principal object is that eternal verity which hath discovered the treasures of hidden wisdom in Christ&quot;; of hope that its &quot;highest object is that everlasting goodness which in Christ doth quicken the dead&quot;; of charity, that its &quot;final object is that incomprehensible beauty which shineth in the countenance of Christ the Son of the Living God&quot;.

==Moral theology ==
A person receives the theological virtues by their being &quot;infused&quot;—through Divine grace—into the person. The theological virtues are so named because their object is the divine being ().
* &quot;Faith&quot; is the infused virtue, by which the intellect, by a movement of the will, assents to the supernatural truths of Revelation, not on the motive of intrinsic evidence, but on the sole ground of the infallible authority of God revealing. According to Hugh Pope &quot;[W]hat God says is supremely credible, though not necessarily supremely intelligible for us.&quot; The First Vatican Council (III, iii;) stated that &quot;faith is a supernatural virtue by which we with the inspiration and assistance of God&#x27;s grace, believe those things to be true which He has revealed... although the assent of faith is in no sense blind, yet no one can assent to the Gospel teaching in the way necessary for salvation without the illumination of the Holy Spirit...&quot; It is a gratuitous gift of God.
* &quot;Hope&quot; is defined as a Divinely infused virtue, which acts upon the will, by which one trusts, with confidence grounded on the Divine assistance, to attain life everlasting. Its opposite is the sin of despair.
* &quot;Charity&quot; is a Divinely infused virtue, inclining the human will to cherish God for his own sake above all things, and man for the sake of God. To love God is to wish Him all honour and glory and every good, and to endeavour, as far as one can, to obtain it for Him. notes a unique feature of reciprocity that makes charity a veritable friendship of man with God. &quot;Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.&quot; Lack of love may give place to hatred, wrath, or indifference.

==Comparison of cardinal and theological virtues==
The moral virtues are acquired by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology holds that the theological virtues differ from the cardinal virtues in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. The Episcopal Church shares this view. &quot;As distinct from the cardinal virtues which we can develop, the theological virtues are the perfection of human powers given by the grace of God.&quot; Like the cardinal virtues, an individual who exercises these virtues strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.

Following Augustine, Aquinas also recognized a separate but related type of moral virtue which is also infused by God. The distinction lies both in their source and end. The moral virtue of temperance recognizes food as a good that sustains life, but guards against the sin of gluttony. The &quot;infused&quot; virtue of temperance disposes the individual to practice fasting and abstinence. The infused moral virtues are connected to the theological virtue of Charity.

Pope Benedict XVI wrote three encyclicals about the theological virtues: &quot;Deus caritas est&quot; (about love), &quot;Spe salvi&quot; (about hope), and &quot;Lumen fidei&quot; (about faith: this encyclical was written both by Pope Benedict XVI and by Pope Francis).

<text>The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for over six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the band pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, guitarist Keith Richards, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their early years, Jones was the primary leader. Andrew Loog Oldham became their manager in 1963 and encouraged them to write their own songs. The Jagger–Richards partnership soon became the band&#x27;s primary songwriting and creative force.

Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;Get Off of My Cloud&quot; (both 1965), and &quot;Paint It Black&quot; (1966) became international number-one hits. &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966), their first entirely original album, is often considered to be the most important of their early albums. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;/&quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; and experimented with psychedelic rock on &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. By the end of the 1960s, they had returned to their rhythm and blues-based rock sound, with hit singles &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; (1968) and &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; (1969), and albums &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; (1968), featuring &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; and &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (1969), featuring &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; and &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;.

Jones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as &quot;the greatest rock and roll band in the world&quot;. &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971), which yielded &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. It was followed by &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972), featuring &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot;, and &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; (1973), featuring &quot;Angie&quot;. Taylor left the band at the end of 1974 and was replaced by Ronnie Wood. The band released &quot;Some Girls&quot; in 1978, featuring &quot;Miss You&quot; and &quot;Beast of Burden&quot;, and &quot;Tattoo You&quot; in 1981, featuring &quot;Start Me Up&quot;. &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; (1994). Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007, they had broken the record for the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and they were the highest-earning live act of 2021. Following Wyman&#x27;s departure in 1993, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones becoming their regular bassist, and then as a three-piece core following Watts&#x27; death in 2021, with Steve Jordan becoming their regular drummer. &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot;, the band&#x27;s first new album of original material in 18 years, was released in October 2023, becoming their fourteenth UK number-one album.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; estimated record sales of more than 250 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; have ranked them as one of the greatest artists of all time.

==History==
===Early history===

Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became classmates and childhood friends in 1950 in Dartford, Kent. The Jagger family moved to Wilmington, Kent, away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor. The group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Bo Diddley. Jagger again met Richards on 17 October 1961 on platform two at Dartford railway station. Jagger was carrying records by Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters; these revealed to Richards a shared interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards and Taylor often met Jagger at his house. The meetings moved to Taylor&#x27;s house in late 1961, where Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith joined the trio; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.

In March 1962, the Blues Boys read about the Ealing Jazz Club in the newspaper &quot;Jazz News&quot;, which mentioned Alexis Korner&#x27;s rhythm and blues band, Alexis Korner&#x27;s Blues Incorporated. The Blues Boys sent a tape of their best recordings to Korner, who was impressed. On 7 April, they visited the Ealing Jazz Club, where they met the members of Blues Incorporated, who included slide guitarist Brian Jones, keyboardist Ian Stewart, and drummer Charlie Watts. After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group.

Having left Blues Incorporated, Jones advertised for bandmates in &quot;Jazz Weekly&quot; in the week of 2 May 1962. Ian Stewart was among the first to respond to the ad. In June, Jagger, Taylor, and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart. The first rehearsal included guitarist Geoff Bradford and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom decided not to join the band. They objected to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards. That same month, the addition of the drummer Tony Chapman completed the line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, and Taylor. According to Richards, Jones named the band during a phone call to &quot;Jazz News&quot;. When asked by a journalist for the band&#x27;s name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor; one of the tracks was &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;. Jones was the band&#x27;s &quot;uncontested leader&quot; during its early years and a key to the band&#x27;s early success.

===1962–1964: Building a following===
The band played their first show billed as &quot;the Rollin&#x27; Stones&quot; on 12 July 1962, at the Marquee Club in London. At the time, the band consisted of Jones, Jagger, Richards, Stewart, and Taylor. Bill Wyman auditioned for the role of bass guitarist at a pub in Chelsea on 7 December 1962 and was hired as a successor to Dick Taylor. The band were impressed by his instrument and amplifiers (including the Vox AC30). The classic line-up of the Rolling Stones, with Charlie Watts on drums, played for the first time in public on Saturday, 12 January 1963 at the Ealing Jazz Club. However, it was not until a gig there on 2 February 1963 that Watts became the Stones&#x27; permanent drummer.

Shortly afterwards, the band began their first tour of the UK, performing Chicago blues, including songs by Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. By 1963, they were finding their musical stride as well as popularity. In 1964, they beat the Beatles as the number one United Kingdom band in two surveys. The band&#x27;s name was changed shortly after their first gig to the Rolling Stones. Their acting manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, secured a Sunday afternoon residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London, in February 1963.

In May 1963, the Rolling Stones signed Andrew Loog Oldham as their manager. He had been directed to them by his previous clients, the Beatles. Oldham, then 19, had not reached the age of majority—he was also younger than anyone in the band— and so could not obtain an agent&#x27;s licence or sign any contracts without his mother co-signing. By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton to secure record financing and assistance booking venues. Gomelsky, who had no written agreement with the band, was not consulted.

Oldham initially tried applying the strategy used by Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles, and have the Rolling Stones wear suits. He later changed his mind and imagined a band that contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, and an unclean appearance. He wanted to make the Stones &quot;a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables&quot; and to &quot;establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic&quot;. Stewart left the official line-up, but remained road manager and touring keyboardist. Of Stewart&#x27;s decision, Oldham later said, &quot;Well, he just doesn&#x27;t look the part, and six is too many for [fans] to remember the faces in the picture.&quot; Later, Oldham reduced the band members&#x27; ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers.

Decca Records, which had declined to sign a deal with the Beatles, gave the Rolling Stones a recording contract with favourable terms. The band were to receive a royalty rate three times as high as that typically given to a new act, full artistic control of recordings, and ownership of the recording master tapes. The deal also let the band use non-Decca recording studios. Regent Sound Studios, a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on the ceiling for sound treatment, became their preferred location. Oldham, who had no recording experience but made himself the band&#x27;s producer, said Regent had a sound that &quot;leaked, instrument-to-instrument, the right way&quot; creating a &quot;wall of noise&quot; that worked well for the band. Because of Regent&#x27;s low booking rates, the band could record for extended periods rather than the usual three-hour blocks common at other studios. All tracks on the first Rolling Stones album, &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;, were recorded there.

Oldham contrasted the Rolling Stones&#x27; independence with the Beatles&#x27; obligation to record in EMI&#x27;s studios, saying it made the Beatles appear as &quot;mere mortals ... sweating in the studio for the man&quot;. He promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty counterpoint to the Beatles, by having the band pose unsmiling on the cover of their first album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as: &quot;Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?&quot; In contrast, Wyman says: &quot;Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally. ... [Oldham] never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively.&quot; In a 1971 interview, Wyman stated, &quot;We were the first pop group to break away from the whole Cliff Richard thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter.&quot;

A cover version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Come On&quot; was the Rolling Stones&#x27; first single, released on 7 June 1963. The band refused to play it at live gigs, and Decca bought only one ad to promote the record. At Oldham&#x27;s direction, fan-club members bought copies at record shops polled by the charts, helping &quot;Come On&quot; rise to number 21 on the UK Singles Chart. Having a charting single gave the band entrée to play outside London, starting with a booking at the Outlook Club in Middlesbrough on 13 July, sharing the billing with the Hollies. Later in 1963, Oldham and Easton arranged the band&#x27;s first big UK concert tour as a supporting act for American stars, including Bo Diddley, Little Richard, and the Everly Brothers. The tour gave the band the opportunity to hone their stagecraft.

During the tour, the band recorded their second single, a Lennon–McCartney song, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;. It reached number 13 on the UK charts. The Beatles&#x27; own recording of the song is included on the 1963 album &quot;With the Beatles&quot;. On 1 January 1964, the Stones&#x27; were the first band to play on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;. In January 1964 the band released a self-titled EP, which became their first number 1 record in the UK. The third single by the Stones, Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, reflecting Bo Diddley&#x27;s style, was released in February 1964 and reached number 3.

Oldham saw little future for an act that gave up the chance to get significant songwriting royalties by only playing the songs of what he described as &quot;middle-aged blacks&quot;, thus limiting their appeal to teenage audiences. Jagger and Richards decided to write songs together. Oldham described the first batch as &quot;soppy and imitative&quot;. Because the band&#x27;s songwriting developed slowly, songs on their first album &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; (1964; issued in the US as &quot;England&#x27;s Newest Hit Makers&quot;), were primarily covers, with only one Jagger/Richards original—&quot;Tell Me (You&#x27;re Coming Back)&quot;—and two numbers credited to Nanker Phelge, the pen name used for songs written by the entire group.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; first US tour in June 1964 was &quot;a disaster&quot;, according to Wyman. &quot;When we arrived, we didn&#x27;t have a hit record [there] or anything going for us.&quot; When the band appeared on the variety show &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, that week&#x27;s guest host, Dean Martin, mocked both their hair and their performance. During the tour they recorded for two days at Chess Studios in Chicago, meeting many of their most important influences, including Muddy Waters. These sessions included what would become the Rolling Stones&#x27; first number 1 hit in the UK, their cover version of Bobby and Shirley Womack&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot;.

The Stones followed the Famous Flames, featuring James Brown, in the theatrical release of the 1964 film &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot;, which showcased American acts with British Invasion artists. According to Jagger, &quot;We weren&#x27;t actually following James Brown because there was considerable time between the filming of each section. Nevertheless, he was still very annoyed about it ...&quot; On 25 October the band appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Because of the pandemonium surrounding the Stones, Sullivan initially declined to rebook them. However, he booked them for appearances in 1966 and 1967.

A second EP, &quot;Five by Five&quot;, was issued in the UK in August 1964. In the US the EP was expanded into their second LP, &quot;12 X 5&quot;, which was released in October during the tour. The Rolling Stones&#x27; fifth UK single, a cover of Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;—with &quot;Off the Hook&quot;, credited to Nanker Phelge, as the B-side—was released in November 1964 and became their second number 1 hit in the UK. The band&#x27;s US distributors, London Records, declined to release &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; as a single. In December 1964, the distributor released the band&#x27;s first single with Jagger/Richards originals on both sides: &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;, with &quot;What a Shame&quot; as the B-side; the single went to number 19 in the US.

===1965–1967: Height of fame===

The band&#x27;s second UK LP, &quot;The Rolling Stones No. 2&quot;, was released in January 1965 and reached number 1 on the charts. The US version, released in February as &quot;The Rolling Stones, Now!&quot;, reached number 5. The album was recorded at Chess Studios in Chicago and RCA Studios in Los Angeles. In January and February of that year, the band played 34 shows for around 100,000 people in Australia and New Zealand. The single &quot;The Last Time&quot;, released in February, was the first Jagger/Richards composition to reach number 1 on the UK charts; it reached number 9 in the US. It was later identified by Richards as &quot;the bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.&quot;

Their first international number 1 hit was &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, recorded in May 1965 during the band&#x27;s third North American tour. Richards recorded the guitar riff that drives the song with a fuzzbox as a scratch track to guide a horn section. Nevertheless, the final cut did not include the planned horn overdubs. Issued in the summer of 1965, it was their fourth UK number 1 and their first in the US, where it spent four weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was a worldwide commercial success for the band. The US version of the LP &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;, released in July 1965, also went to number 1; it included seven original songs, three Jagger/Richards numbers and four credited to Nanker Phelge. The UK version of &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot; was released in September 1965. Their second international number 1 single &quot;Get Off of My Cloud&quot; was released in the autumn of 1965, followed by another US-only LP, &quot;December&#x27;s Children (And Everybody&#x27;s)&quot;.

The album &quot;Aftermath&quot;, released in the late spring of 1966, was the first LP to be composed entirely of Jagger/Richards songs; it reached number 1 in the UK and number 2 in the US. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Aftermath&quot; is often regarded as the most important of the band&#x27;s formative records. On this album, Jones&#x27; contributions expanded beyond guitar and harmonica. To the Middle Eastern-influenced &quot;Paint It Black&quot; he added sitar; to the ballad &quot;Lady Jane&quot; he added dulcimer, and to &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; he added marimbas. &quot;Aftermath&quot; also contained &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;, a nearly 12-minute song that included elements of jamming and improvisation.

The Stones&#x27; success on the British and American singles charts peaked during the 1960s. &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot; was released in February 1966, and reached number 2 in the UK and US charts; &quot;Paint It Black&quot; reached number 1 in the UK and US in May 1966. &quot;Mother&#x27;s Little Helper&quot;, released in June 1966, reached number 8 in the US; it was one of the first pop songs to discuss the issue of prescription drug abuse. &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?&quot; was released in September 1966 and reached number 5 in the UK and number 9 in the US. It had a number of firsts for the group: it was the first Stones recording to feature brass horns, and the back-cover photo on the original US picture sleeve depicted the group satirically dressed in drag. The song was accompanied by one of the first official music videos, directed by Peter Whitehead.
During their North American tour in June and July 1966, the Stones&#x27; high-energy concerts proved highly successful with young people, while alienating local police who had the physically exhausting task of controlling the often rebellious crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band&#x27;s notoriety &quot;among the authorities and the establishment seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people&quot;. In an effort to capitalise on this, London released the live album &quot;Got Live If You Want It!&quot; in December. The band&#x27;s first greatest hits album &quot;Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)&quot; was released in the UK in November 1966, a different version of which had been released in the US in March that year.

In January 1967, &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; was released, and reached number 3 in the UK and number 2 in the US. It was Andrew Oldham&#x27;s last venture as the Rolling Stones&#x27; producer. Allen Klein took over his role as the band&#x27;s manager in 1965. Richards recalled, &quot;There was a new deal with Decca to be made ... and he said he could do it.&quot; The US version included the double A-side single &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; and &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, which went to number 1 in the US and number 3 in the UK. When the band went to New York to perform the numbers on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in January, they were ordered to change the lyrics of the refrain of &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; to &quot;let&#x27;s spend some time together&quot;.

In early 1967, Jagger, Richards, and Jones began to be hounded by authorities over their recreational drug use, after &quot;News of the World&quot; ran a three-part feature entitled &quot;Pop Stars and Drugs: Facts That Will Shock You&quot;. The series described alleged LSD parties hosted by the Moody Blues and attended by top stars including the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend and Cream&#x27;s Ginger Baker, and described alleged admissions of drug use by leading pop musicians. The first article targeted Donovan (who was raided and charged soon after); the second instalment (published on 5 February) targeted the Rolling Stones. A reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the exclusive London club Blaise&#x27;s, where a member of the Rolling Stones allegedly took several Benzedrine tablets, displayed a piece of hashish, and invited his companions back to his flat for a &quot;smoke&quot;. The article claimed this was Mick Jagger, but it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity; the reporter had in fact been eavesdropping on Brian Jones. Two days after the article was published, Jagger filed a writ for libel against the &quot;News of the World&quot;.

A week later, on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped off by the paper, raided a party at Keith Richards&#x27; home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time, but Jagger, Richards, and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were subsequently charged with drug offences. Andrew Oldham was afraid of being arrested and fled to America. Richards said in 2003, &quot;When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realize that this was a whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped. Up until then it had been as though London existed in a beautiful space where you could do anything you wanted.&quot;

In March 1967, while awaiting the consequences of the police raid, Jagger, Richards, and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones&#x27; girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that she left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: &quot;That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He&#x27;d never forgive me for that and I don&#x27;t blame him, but hell, shit happens.&quot; Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band&#x27;s first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy. June 1967 saw the release of the US-only compilation album &quot;Flowers&quot;.

On 10 May 1967, the day Jagger, Richards and Fraser were arraigned in connection with the Redlands charges, Jones&#x27; house was raided by police. He was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. Three of the five Stones now faced drug charges. Jagger and Richards were tried at the end of June. Jagger received a three-month prison sentence for the possession of four amphetamine tablets; Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to a year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point but were released on bail the next day, pending appeal.

&quot;The Times&quot; ran an editorial, &quot;Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?&quot;, in which conservative editor William Rees-Mogg surprised his readers by his unusually critical discourse on the sentencing, pointing out that Jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offence than &quot;any purely anonymous young man&quot;. While awaiting the appeal hearings, the band recorded a new single, &quot;We Love You&quot;, as a thank you for their fans&#x27; loyalty. It began with the sound of prison doors closing, and the accompanying music video included allusions to the trial of Oscar Wilde. On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards&#x27; conviction, and reduced Jagger&#x27;s sentence to a conditional discharge. Jones&#x27; trial took place in November 1967. In December, after appealing the original prison sentence, Jones received a £1,000 fine and was put on three years&#x27; probation, with an order to seek professional help.

In December 1967, the band released &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, which reached number 3 in the UK and number 2 in the US. It drew unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; was recorded while Jagger, Richards, and Jones were awaiting their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was publicly amicable, but in 2003 Jagger said: &quot;The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren&#x27;t concentrating and that we were being childish. It was not a great moment really—and I would have thought it wasn&#x27;t a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew&#x27;s job.&quot; &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; became the first album the Rolling Stones produced on their own. Its psychedelic sound was complemented by the cover art, which featured a 3D photo by Michael Cooper, who had also photographed the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Bill Wyman wrote and sang a track on the album: &quot;In Another Land&quot;, also released as a single, the first on which Jagger did not sing lead.

===1968–1972: Jones&#x27; departure and death, Mick Taylor joins, &quot;Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World&quot;===
The band spent the first few months of 1968 working on material for their next album. Those sessions resulted in the song &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;, released as a single in May. The subsequent album, &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, an eclectic mix of country and blues–inspired tunes, marked the band&#x27;s return to their rhythm and blues roots. It was also the beginning of their collaboration with producer Jimmy Miller. It featured the lead single &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; (which addressed the political upheavals of May 1968) and &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;. Controversy over the design of the album cover, which featured a public toilet with graffiti covering the wall behind it, delayed the album&#x27;s release for six months. While the band had &quot;absolute artistic control over their albums&quot;, Decca was not enthused about the cover&#x27;s depiction of graffiti reading &quot;John Loves Yoko&quot; being included; the album was released that December, with a different cover design.

&quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot;, which originally began as an idea about &quot;the new shape of the rock-and-roll concert tour&quot;, was filmed at the end of 1968. It featured John Lennon, Yoko Ono, the Dirty Mac, the Who, Jethro Tull, Marianne Faithfull, and Taj Mahal. The footage was shelved for 28 years but was finally released officially in 1996, with a DVD version released in October 2004.

By the time &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; was released, Brian Jones was only sporadically contributing to the band. Jagger said that Jones was &quot;not psychologically suited to this way of life&quot;. His drug use had become a hindrance, and he was unable to obtain a US visa. Richards reported that in a June meeting with Jagger, Watts, and himself at Jones&#x27; house, Jones admitted that he was unable to &quot;go on the road again&quot;, and left the band saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve left, and if I want to I can come back.&quot; On 3 July 1969, less than a month later, Jones drowned under mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool at his home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex. The band auditioned several guitarists, including Paul Kossoff, as a replacement for Jones, before settling on Mick Taylor, who was recommended to Jagger by John Mayall.
The Rolling Stones were scheduled to play at a free concert for Blackhill Enterprises in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, two days after Jones&#x27; death; they decided to go ahead with the show as a tribute to him. Jagger began by reading an excerpt from Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;Adonais&quot;, an elegy written on the death of his friend John Keats. They released thousands of butterflies in memory of Jones before opening their set with &quot;I&#x27;m Yours and I&#x27;m Hers&quot;, a Johnny Winter number. The concert, their first with new guitarist Mick Taylor, was performed in front of an estimated 250,000 fans. A Granada Television production team filmed the performance, which was broadcast on British television as &quot;The Stones in the Park&quot;. Blackhill Enterprises stage manager Sam Cutler introduced the Rolling Stones onto the stage by announcing: &quot;Let&#x27;s welcome the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.&quot;
Cutler repeated the introduction throughout their 1969 US tour. The show also included the concert debut of their fifth US number 1 single, &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, which had been released the previous day. In September 1969 the band&#x27;s second greatest hits album &quot;Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)&quot; was released, featuring a poem in dedication to Jones on the inside cover.

The Stones&#x27; last album of the 1960s was &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, which reached number 1 in the UK and number 3 in the US. It featured &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; with guest lead female vocals by Merry Clayton (sister of Sam Clayton, of the American rock band Little Feat). Other tracks include &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; (with accompaniment by the London Bach Choir, who initially asked that their name be removed from the album&#x27;s credits after apparently being &quot;horrified&quot; by the content of some of its other material, but later withdrew this request), &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;, as well as a cover of Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Love in Vain&quot;. Jones and Taylor are both featured on the album.

Just after the US tour ended, the band performed at the Altamont Free Concert at the Altamont Speedway, about east of San Francisco. A Hells Angels biker gang provided security, and a fan, Meredith Hunter, was stabbed and beaten to death by the Angels after they realised he was armed. Part of the tour, and the Altamont concert, was documented in Albert and David Maysles&#x27; film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. In response to the growing popularity of bootleg recordings (in particular &quot;Live&#x27;r Than You&#x27;ll Ever Be&quot;, recorded during the 1969 tour), the album &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot; was released in 1970. Critic Lester Bangs declared it the best-ever live album. It reached number 1 in the UK and number 6 in the US.

At the end of the decade, the band appeared on BBC&#x27;s review of the 1960s music scene, &quot;Pop Go the Sixties&quot;, performing &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, which was broadcast live on 31 December 1969. The following year, the band wanted out of contracts with both Klein and Decca, but still owed them one more Jagger/Richards–credited single. To get back at the label and fulfil their final contractual obligation, the band came up with the track &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot;—deliberately making it as crude as they could in hopes of making it un-releasable. Decca instead released &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; from &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Banquet&quot; as a UK single in July 1971, the track&#x27;s 1968 single release having been only in the US.

Amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, Rolling Stones Records. &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, released in March 1971, the band&#x27;s first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover designed by Andy Warhol. It was an Andy Warhol photograph of a man from the waist down in tight jeans featuring a functioning zipper. When unzipped, it revealed the subject&#x27;s underwear. In some markets an alternate cover was released because of the perceived offensive nature of the original at the time.

&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;″ cover was the first to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which effectively became the band&#x27;s logo. It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Designer John Pasche created the logo, following a suggestion by Jagger to copy the stuck-out tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, The tongue and lips design was part of a package that in 2003 VH1 named the best album cover ever. The logo has remained on all the Stones&#x27; post-1970 albums and singles, in addition to their merchandise and stage sets. The album contains one of their best-known hits, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, and the country-influenced &quot;Dead Flowers&quot;. &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; were recorded at Alabama&#x27;s Muscle Shoals Sound Studio after the 1969 American tour. The album continued the band&#x27;s immersion into heavily blues-influenced compositions; is noted for its &quot;loose, ramshackle ambience&quot;; and marked Mick Taylor&#x27;s first full album with the band. &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; reached number 1 in both the UK and the US.

In 1968, the Stones, acting on a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control room in a van and created the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio so they would not be limited to the standard 9–5 operating hours of most recording studios. The band lent the mobile studio to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, who used it to record &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970) and &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; (1971). Deep Purple immortalised the mobile studio itself in the song &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; with the line &quot;the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside, making our music there&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, the Rolling Stones left England after receiving advice from their financial manager Prince Rupert Loewenstein. He recommended they go into tax exile before the start of the next financial year. The band had learned that they had not paid taxes for seven years, despite being assured that their taxes were taken care of; and the UK government was owed a relative fortune. The Stones moved to the South of France, where Richards rented the Villa Nellcôte and sublet rooms to band members and their entourage.

Using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they held recording sessions in the basement. They completed the new tracks, along with material dating as far back as 1969, at Sunset Studios in Los Angeles. The resulting double album, &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, was released in May 1972, and reached number one in both the UK and the US. Given an A+ grade by critic Robert Christgau and disparaged by Lester Bangs—who reversed his opinion within months—&quot;Exile&quot; is now accepted as one of the Stones&#x27; best albums. The films &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot; (never officially released) and &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones&quot; (released in 1974) document the subsequent highly publicised 1972 North American Tour.

The band&#x27;s double compilation album, &quot;Hot Rocks 1964–1971&quot;, was released in 1971; it reached number 3 in the UK and number 4 in the US. It is certified Diamond in the US, having sold over 6 million copies, being certified 12× Platinum for being a double album, and spent over 347 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. A follow-up double compilation album &quot;More Hot Rocks (Big Hits &amp; Fazed Cookies)&quot; was released in 1972. In 1974, Bill Wyman was the first band member to release solo material, his album &quot;Monkey Grip&quot;.

===1972–1977: Critical fluctuations and Ronnie Wood replaces Taylor===

In 1972, members of the band set up a complex financial structure to reduce the amount of their taxes. Their holding company, Promogroup, has offices in both the Netherlands and the Caribbean. The Netherlands was chosen because it does not directly tax royalty payments. The band have been tax exiles ever since, meaning they can no longer use Britain as their main residence. Due to the arrangements with the holding company, the band has reportedly paid a tax of just 1.6% on their total earnings of £242 million over the past 20 years.

In November 1972, the band began recording sessions in Kingston, Jamaica, for the album &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;; it was released in 1973 and reached number 1 in both the UK and US. The album, which contained the worldwide hit &quot;Angie&quot;, was the first in a string of commercially successful, but critically tepidly received, studio albums. The sessions for &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; also produced unused material, most notably an early version of the popular ballad &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;, which was not released until the &quot;Tattoo You&quot; LP nine years later.

Another legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France, interrupted the making of &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;. Authorities had issued a warrant for Richards&#x27; arrest, and the other band members had to return briefly to France for questioning. This, along with Jagger&#x27;s 1967 and 1970 convictions on drug charges, complicated the band&#x27;s plans for their Pacific tour in early 1973: they were denied permission to play in Japan and almost banned from Australia. A European tour followed in September and October 1973, which bypassed France, coming, as it did, after Richards&#x27; recent arrest in England on drug charges.

The 1974 album &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; was recorded in the Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany; it reached number 2 in the UK and number 1 in the US. Miller was not invited to return as the album&#x27;s producer because his &quot;contribution level had dropped&quot;. Jagger and Richards, credited as &quot;the Glimmer Twins&quot;, produced the album. Both the album and the single of the same name were hits.

Near the end of 1974, Taylor began to lose patience after years of feeling like a &quot;junior citizen in the band of jaded veterans&quot;. The band&#x27;s situation made normal functioning complicated, with members living in different countries, and legal barriers restricting where they could tour. In addition, drug use was starting to affect Taylor&#x27;s and Richards&#x27; productivity, and Taylor felt some of his own creative contributions were going unrecognised. At the end of 1974, Taylor quit the Rolling Stones. Taylor said in 1980, &quot;I wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do something else ... I wasn&#x27;t really composing songs or writing at that time. I was just beginning to write, and that influenced my decision ... There are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest; they can ride along somebody else&#x27;s success. And there are some people for whom that&#x27;s not enough. It really wasn&#x27;t enough for me.&quot;
The Stones needed a new guitarist, and the recording sessions in Munich for the next album, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (1976) (number 2 in the UK, number 1 in the US), provided an opportunity for some guitarists hoping to join the band to work while trying out. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck were auditioned, as well as Robert A. Johnson and Shuggie Otis. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed they had played without realising they were being auditioned. American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also tried out, but Richards and Jagger preferred for the band to remain purely British. When Ronnie Wood auditioned, everyone agreed he was the right choice. He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;. He had declined Jagger&#x27;s earlier offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to Faces, saying &quot;that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really important to me&quot;. Faces&#x27; lead singer Rod Stewart went so far as to say he would take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.

In 1975, Wood joined the band as second guitarist for their upcoming Tour of the Americas, which was a contributing factor in the disbandment of Faces. His installment as a Rolling Stone was announced in 1976; unlike the other band members, however, Wood was a salaried employee, which remained the case until the early 1990s, when he finally joined the Stones&#x27; business partnership.

The 1975 Tour of the Americas kicked off in New York City with the band performing on a flatbed trailer being pulled down Broadway. The tour featured stage props including a giant phallus and a rope on which Jagger swung out over the audience. In June of that year, the Stones&#x27; Decca catalogue was purchased by Klein&#x27;s ABKCO label. In August 1976, the Stones played Knebworth in England in front of 200,000—their largest audience to date—and finished their set at 7 a.m. Jagger had booked live recording sessions at the El Mocambo, a club in Toronto, to produce a long-overdue live album, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Love You Live&quot;, the first Stones live album since &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot; It reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 5 in the US.

Richards&#x27; addiction to heroin delayed his arrival in Toronto; the other members had already arrived. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canadian customs after Richards was found in possession of a burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Anita Pallenberg, discovered of heroin in Richards&#x27; room. He was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence. The Crown prosecutor later conceded that Richards had procured the drugs after his arrival.
Despite the incident, the band played two shows in Toronto, but caused more controversy when Margaret Trudeau, then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was seen partying with the band after one show. The band&#x27;s shows were not advertised to the public. Instead, the El Mocambo had been booked for the entire week by April Wine for a recording session. 1050 CHUM, a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine. Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing.

On 4 March, Richards&#x27; partner Anita Pallenberg pleaded guilty to drug possession and incurred a fine in connection with the original airport incident. The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, he received a suspended sentence and was ordered to play two charity concerts to benefit the Canadian institute for the blind in Oshawa; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians, a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards&#x27; resolve to stop using heroin. It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara. Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction as Richards struggled to get clean. While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle. He was a regular at New York&#x27;s Studio 54 disco club, often in the company of model Jerry Hall. His marriage to Bianca Jagger ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged.

Although the Rolling Stones remained popular through the early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band&#x27;s output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun to view the Rolling Stones as an outdated band.

===1978–1982: Commercial peak===
The group&#x27;s fortunes changed in 1978, after the band released &quot;Some Girls&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Miss You&quot;, the country ballad &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot;, &quot;Beast of Burden&quot;, and &quot;Shattered&quot;. In part as a response to punk, many songs, particularly &quot;Respectable&quot;, were fast, basic, guitar-driven rock and roll, and the album&#x27;s success re-established the Rolling Stones&#x27; immense popularity among young people. It reached number 2 in the UK and number 1 in the US. Following the 1978 US Tour, the band appeared on the first show of the fourth season of the TV series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Some Girls&quot;, the band released their next album, &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot;, in mid-1980. During recording sessions for the album, a rift between Jagger and Richards slowly developed. Richards wanted to tour in the summer or autumn of 1980 to promote the new album. Much to his disappointment, Jagger declined. &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the title track reached number 3 in the US.
In early 1981, the group reconvened and decided to tour the US that year, leaving little time to write and record a new album, as well as to rehearse for the tour. That year&#x27;s resulting album, &quot;Tattoo You&quot;, featured a number of outtakes from other recording sessions, including lead single &quot;Start Me Up&quot;, which reached number 2 in the US and ranked number 22 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 year-end chart. Two songs (&quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; (US number 13) and &quot;Tops&quot;) featured Mick Taylor&#x27;s unused rhythm guitar tracks, while jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins played on &quot;Slave&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, and &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;. The album reached number 2 in the UK and number 1 in the US.

The Rolling Stones reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1982 with &quot;Hang Fire&quot;. Their 1981 American Tour was their biggest, longest, and most colourful production to date. It was the highest-grossing tour of that year. It included a concert at Chicago&#x27;s Checkerboard Lounge with Muddy Waters, in one of his last performances before his death in 1983. Some of the shows were recorded. This resulted in the 1982 live album &quot;Still Life (American Concert 1981)&quot; which reached number 4 in the UK and number 5 in the US, and the 1983 Hal Ashby concert film &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot;, filmed at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona and the Brendan Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands, New Jersey.

In mid-1982, to commemorate their 20th anniversary, the Rolling Stones took their American stage show to Europe. The European tour was their first in six years and used a similar format to the American tour. The band were joined by former Allman Brothers Band keyboardist Chuck Leavell, who continues to perform and record with them. By the end of the year, the Stones had signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, CBS Records, for a reported $50 million, then the biggest record deal in history.

=== 1983–1988: Band turmoil and solo projects ===
Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released &quot;Undercover&quot; in late 1983. It reached number 3 in the UK and number 4 in the US. Despite good reviews and the peak Top Ten position of the title track, the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it. Subsequently, the Stones&#x27; new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing their Atlantic catalogue.

By this time, the Jagger/Richards rift had grown significantly. To Richards&#x27; annoyance, Jagger signed a solo deal with CBS Records and spent much of 1984 writing songs for his first album. He also declared his growing lack of interest in the Rolling Stones. By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings. Much of the material on 1986&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Work&quot; was generated by Richards, with more contributions from Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums. It was recorded in Paris, and Jagger was often absent from the studio, leaving Richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward.

In June 1985, Jagger teamed up with David Bowie for &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, which was recorded for the Live Aid charity movement. This was one of Jagger&#x27;s first solo performances, and the song reached number 1 in the UK, and number 7 in the US. In December 1985, Ian Stewart died of a heart attack. The Rolling Stones played a private tribute concert for him at London&#x27;s 100 Club in February 1986. Two days later they were presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

&quot;Dirty Work&quot; was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews, reaching number 4 in both the US and UK. It was the Stones&#x27; first album for CBS with an outside producer, Steve Lillywhite. With relations between Richards and Jagger at an all-time low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album and instead undertook a solo tour, where he performed some Rolling Stones songs. As a result of their animosity, the Stones almost broke up. Jagger&#x27;s solo records, &quot;She&#x27;s the Boss&quot; (1985), which reached number 6 in the UK and number 13 in the US, and &quot;Primitive Cool&quot; (1987), which reached number 26 in the UK and number 41 in the US, met with moderate commercial success. In 1988, with the Rolling Stones mostly inactive, Richards released his first solo album, &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot;, which reached number 37 in the UK and No. 24 in the US. It was well received by fans and critics, and was certified Gold in the US. Richards has subsequently referred to this late-80s period, when the two were recording solo albums with no obvious reunion of the Stones in sight, as &quot;World War III&quot;.

===1989–1999: Comeback, record-breaking tours and Wyman&#x27;s departure===
In early 1989, the Stones – Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, Ronnie Wood, Brian Jones, Mick Taylor, and Ian Stewart – were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Jagger, Richards, Wood and Taylor in attendance. Jagger and Richards set aside their animosity and went to work on a new Rolling Stones album, &quot;Steel Wheels&quot;. Heralded as a return to form, it included the singles &quot;Mixed Emotions&quot; (US number 5), &quot;Rock and a Hard Place&quot; (US number 23) and &quot;Almost Hear You Sigh&quot;. The album also included &quot;Continental Drift&quot;, which the Rolling Stones recorded in Tangier, Morocco, in 1989, with the Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar, coordinated by Tony King and Cherie Nutting. Nigel Finch produced the BBC documentary film &quot;The Rolling Stones in Morocco&quot;. Finch also directed &quot;25x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones&quot;, a documentary spanning the band&#x27;s 25-year history, featuring new interviews with the five current members and archival interview material of Brian Jones and Mick Taylor. &quot;25x5&quot; aired on the BBC in late 1989 and was released on home video early the following year. &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; reached number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US.

The Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour was the band&#x27;s first world tour in seven years and their biggest stage production to date. Opening acts included Living Colour and Guns N&#x27; Roses. Recordings from the tour include the 1991 concert album &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, which reached number 6 in the UK and number 16 in the US, and the concert film &quot;Live at the Max&quot; released in 1991. The tour was Bill Wyman&#x27;s last. After years of deliberation he decided to leave the band, although his departure was not made official until January 1993. He then published &quot;Stone Alone&quot;, an autobiography based on scrapbooks and diaries he had kept since the band&#x27;s early days. A few years later he formed Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings and began recording and touring again.

After the successes of the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours, the band took a break. Watts released two jazz albums; Wood recorded his fifth solo album, the first in 11 years, called &quot;Slide On This&quot;; Wyman released his fourth solo album; Richards released his second solo album in late 1992, &quot;Main Offender&quot;, and did a small tour, including big concerts in Spain and Argentina. Jagger got good reviews and sales with his third solo album, &quot;Wandering Spirit&quot;, which reached number 12 in the UK and number 11 in the US. The album sold more than two million copies worldwide, being certified Gold in the US.

After Wyman&#x27;s departure, the Rolling Stones&#x27; new distributor/record label, Virgin Records, remastered and repackaged the band&#x27;s back catalogue from &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; to &quot;Steel Wheels&quot;, except for the three live albums. They issued another hits compilation in 1993 entitled &quot;Jump Back&quot;, which reached number 16 in the UK and number 30 in the US. By 1993, the Stones were ready to start recording another studio album. Charlie Watts recruited bassist Darryl Jones, a former sideman of Miles Davis, and Sting, as Wyman&#x27;s replacement for 1994&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot;. Jones continues to perform with the band as their touring and session bassist. The album met with positive reviews and strong sales, going double platinum in the US. Reviewers took note and credited the album&#x27;s &quot;traditionalist&quot; sounds to the Rolling Stones&#x27; new producer Don Was. &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 1995 Grammy Awards. It reached number 1 in the UK and number 2 in the US.
The accompanying Voodoo Lounge Tour lasted into the following year and grossed $320 million, becoming the world&#x27;s highest-grossing tour at the time. Mostly acoustic numbers from various concerts and rehearsals made up &quot;Stripped&quot; which reached number 9 in the UK and the US. It featured a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, as well as infrequently played songs such as &quot;Shine a Light&quot;, &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, and &quot;The Spider and the Fly&quot;. On 8 September 1994, the Stones performed their new song &quot;Love Is Strong&quot; and &quot;Start Me Up&quot; at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The band received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the ceremony.

The Rolling Stones were the first major recording artists to broadcast a concert over the Internet; a 20-minute video was broadcast on 18 November 1994 using the Mbone at 10 frames per second. The broadcast, engineered by Thinking Pictures and financed by Sun Microsystems, was one of the first demonstrations of streaming video; while it was not a true webcast, it introduced many to the technology.

The Rolling Stones ended the 1990s with the album &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;, released in 1997 to mixed reviews. It reached number 6 in the UK and number 3 in the US. The video of the single &quot;Anybody Seen My Baby?&quot; featured Angelina Jolie as guest and was given steady rotation on both MTV and VH1. Sales were roughly equal to those of previous records (about 1.2 million copies sold in the US). The subsequent Bridges to Babylon Tour, which crossed Europe, North America, and other destinations, proved that the band remained a strong live attraction. Once again, a live album was recorded during the tour, &quot;No Security&quot;; only this time all but two songs (&quot;Live With Me&quot; and &quot;The Last Time&quot;) were previously unreleased on live albums. The album reached number 67 in the UK and number 34 in the US. In 1999, the Rolling Stones staged the No Security Tour in the US and continued the Bridges to Babylon tour in Europe.

===2000–2011: 40th anniversary, &quot;A Bigger Bang&quot; and continued success===
In late 2001, Mick Jagger released his fourth solo album, &quot;Goddess in the Doorway&quot;. It met with mixed reviews; it reached number 44 in the UK and number 39 in the US. A month after the September 11 attacks, Jagger, Richards, and a backing band took part in The Concert for New York City, performing &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; and &quot;Miss You&quot;. In 2002, the Stones released &quot;Forty Licks&quot;, a greatest hits double album, to mark forty years as a band. The collection contained four new songs recorded with the core band of Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood, Leavell, and Jones. The album has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide. It reached number 2 in both the US and UK. The same year, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named the Rolling Stones one of the 50 Bands To See Before You Die. The Stones headlined the Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto concert in Toronto, Canada, to help the city—which they had used for rehearsals since the Voodoo Lounge tour—recover from the 2003 SARS epidemic; an estimated 490,000 people attended the concert.

On 9 November 2003, the band played their first concert in Hong Kong, as part of the Harbour Fest celebration, in support of its SARS-affected economy. The same month, the band licensed the exclusive rights to sell the new four-DVD boxed set &quot;Four Flicks&quot;, recorded on their recent world tour, to the US Best Buy chain of stores. In response, some Canadian and US music retail chains (including HMV Canada and Circuit City) pulled Rolling Stones CDs and related merchandise from their shelves and replaced it with signs explaining why. In 2004, a double live album of the Licks Tour, &quot;Live Licks&quot;, was released and certified gold in the US. It reached number 2 in both the UK and US. In November 2004, the Rolling Stones were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame.

The band&#x27;s first new album in almost eight years, &quot;A Bigger Bang&quot;, was released on 6 September 2005 to positive reviews, including a glowing write-up in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. The album reached number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US. The single &quot;Streets of Love&quot; reached the top 15 in the UK. The album included the political &quot;Sweet Neo Con&quot;, Jagger&#x27;s criticism of American Neoconservatism. Richards was initially worried about a political backlash in the US, but did not object to the lyrics, saying &quot;I just didn&#x27;t want it to become some peripheral distractions/political storm in a tea-cup sort of thing.&quot; The subsequent A Bigger Bang Tour began in August 2005, and included North America, South America, and East Asia. In February 2006, the group played the half-time show of Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan. By the end of 2005, the Bigger Bang tour had set a record of $162 million in gross receipts, breaking the North American mark set by the band in 1994. On 18 February 2006, the band played a free concert to over one million people at the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro—one of the largest rock concerts of all time.

After performances in Japan, China, Australia, and New Zealand in March and April 2006, the Stones&#x27; tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe. During the break, Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall from a tree on Fiji, where he had been on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006, it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his alcohol abuse rehabilitation programme, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Mick Jagger&#x27;s throat problems forced the cancellation of three shows and the rescheduling of several others that fall. The Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest-grossing tour of all time.
Martin Scorsese filmed the Stones performances at New York City&#x27;s Beacon Theatre on 29 October and 1 November 2006 for the documentary film, &quot;Shine a Light&quot;, released in 2008. The film features guest appearances by Buddy Guy, Jack White, and Christina Aguilera. An accompanying soundtrack, also titled &quot;Shine a Light&quot;, was released in April 2008 and reached number 2 in the UK and number 11 in the US. The album&#x27;s debut at number 2 on the UK charts was the highest position for a Rolling Stones concert album since &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert&quot; in 1970. At the Beacon Theatre show, music executive Ahmet Ertegun fell and later died from his injuries.

The band toured Europe throughout June and August 2007. 12 June 2007 saw the release of the band&#x27;s second four-disc DVD set: &quot;The Biggest Bang&quot;, a seven-hour film featuring their shows in Austin, Rio de Janeiro, Saitama, Shanghai, and Buenos Aires, along with extras. On 10 June 2007, the band performed their first gig at a festival in 30 years, at the Isle of Wight Festival, to a crowd of 65,000, and were joined onstage by Amy Winehouse. On 26 August 2007, they played their last concert of the Bigger Bang tour at the O2 Arena in London. At the conclusion of the tour, the band had grossed a record-setting $558 million and were listed in the 2007 edition of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. On 12 November 2007, ABKCO released &quot;Rolled Gold: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones&quot;, a double-CD remake of the 1975 compilation &quot;Rolled Gold&quot;. In July 2008, the Rolling Stones left EMI to sign with Vivendi&#x27;s Universal Music, taking with them their catalogue stretching back to &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. New music released by the band while under this contract was to be issued through Universal&#x27;s Polydor label.

During the autumn, Jagger and Richards worked with producer Don Was to add new vocals and guitar parts to ten unfinished songs from the &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; sessions. Jagger and Mick Taylor also recorded a session together in London, where Taylor added a new guitar track to what would be the expanded album&#x27;s single, &quot;Plundered My Soul&quot;. On 17 April 2010, the band released a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single of the previously unreleased track &quot;Plundered My Soul&quot;, as part of Record Store Day. The track, part of the group&#x27;s 2010 re-issue of &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, was combined with &quot;All Down the Line&quot; as its B-side. The band appeared at the Cannes Festival for the premiere of the documentary &quot;Stones in Exile&quot; (directed by Stephen Kijak) about the recording of the album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; On 23 May, the re-issue of &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; reached number 1 on the UK charts, almost 38 years to the week after it first occupied that position. The band became the first act to see a classic work return to number 1 decades after it was first released. In the US, the album re-entered the charts at number 2.

Loewenstein proposed to the band that they wind down their recording and touring activity and sell off their assets. The band disagreed, and that year Loewenstein parted from the band after four decades as their manager, later writing the memoir &quot;A Prince Among Stones&quot;. Joyce Smyth, a lawyer who had long been working for the Stones, took over as their full-time manager in 2010. Smyth would go on to win Top Manager in the 2019 &quot;Billboard&quot; Live Music Awards.

In October 2010, the Stones released &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones&quot; to cinemas and later to DVD. A digitally remastered version of the film was shown in select cinemas across the United States. Although originally released to cinemas in 1974, it had never been available for home release, apart from bootleg recordings. In October 2011, the Stones released &quot;The Rolling Stones: Some Girls Live In Texas &#x27;78&quot; to cinemas. A digitally remastered version of the film was shown in select cinemas across the US. This live performance was recorded during one show in Ft. Worth, Texas, in support of their 1978 US Tour and their album &quot;Some Girls&quot;. The film was released (on DVD/Blu-ray Disc) on 15 November 2011. On 21 November, the band reissued &quot;Some Girls&quot; as a 2-CD deluxe edition. The second CD included twelve previously unreleased tracks (except &quot;So Young&quot;, which was a B-side to &quot;Out of Tears&quot;) from the sessions, with mostly newly recorded vocals by Jagger.

=== 2012–2016: 50th anniversary, documentary and &quot;Blue &amp; Lonesome&quot; ===
The Rolling Stones celebrated their 50th anniversary in the summer of 2012 by releasing the book &quot;The Rolling Stones: 50&quot;. A new take on the band&#x27;s lip-and-tongue logo, designed by Shepard Fairey, was also revealed and used during the celebrations. Jagger&#x27;s brother Chris performed a gig at The Rolling Stones Museum in Slovenia, in conjunction with the celebrations.

The documentary &quot;Crossfire Hurricane&quot;, directed by Brett Morgen, was released in October 2012. He conducted approximately fifty hours of interviews for the film, including extensive interviews with Wyman and Taylor. This was the first official career-spanning documentary since &quot;25x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones&quot;, filmed for their 25th anniversary in 1989. A new compilation album, &quot;GRRR!&quot;, was released on 12 November. Available in four different formats, it included two new tracks, &quot;Doom and Gloom&quot; and &quot;One More Shot&quot;, recorded at Studio Guillaume Tell in Paris, France, in the last few weeks of August 2012. The album went on to sell over two million copies worldwide. The music video for &quot;Doom and Gloom&quot;, featuring Noomi Rapace, was released on 20 November.

In November 2012, the Stones began their 50 &amp; Counting... tour at London&#x27;s O2 Arena, where they were joined by Jeff Beck. At their second show, in London, Eric Clapton and Florence Welch joined the group onstage. The third anniversary concert took place on 8 December at the Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York. The last two dates were at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on 13 and 15 December. Bruce Springsteen and blues–rock band the Black Keys joined the band on the final night. The stage on this tour was designed so that the lips could &quot;inflate and deflate during different parts of the show.&quot; The band also played two songs at &quot;12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief&quot;.

The Stones played nineteen shows in the US in spring 2013 with various guest stars, including Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, before returning to the UK. In June, the band performed at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival. They returned to Hyde Park in July and performed the same set list as their 1969 concert at the venue. &quot;Hyde Park Live&quot;, a live album recorded at the two Hyde Park gigs on 6 and 13 July, was released exclusively as a digital download through iTunes later that month. An award-winning live DVD, &quot;Sweet Summer Sun: Live in Hyde Park&quot;, was released on 11 November.

In February 2014, the band embarked on their 14 On Fire tour, scheduled for the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and Europe and to go until the summer. On 17 March, Jagger&#x27;s long-time partner L&#x27;Wren Scott died suddenly, resulting in the cancellation and rescheduling of the opening tour dates to October. On 4 June, the Rolling Stones performed for the first time in Israel. &quot;Haaretz&quot; described the concert as being &quot;Historic with a capital H&quot;. In a 2015 interview with Jagger, when asked if retirement crosses his mind he stated, &quot;Nah, not in the moment. I&#x27;m thinking about what the next tour is. I&#x27;m not thinking about retirement. I&#x27;m planning the next set of tours, so the answer is really, &#x27;No, not really.

The Stones embarked on their Latin American tour in February 2016. On 25 March, the band played a bonus show, a free open-air concert in Havana, Cuba, which was attended by an estimated 500,000 concert-goers. In June of that year, the Rolling Stones released &quot;Totally Stripped&quot;, an expanded and reconceived edition of &quot;Stripped&quot;, in multiple formats. Their concert on 25 March 2016 in Cuba was commemorated in the film &quot;Havana Moon&quot;. It premiered on 23 September for one night only in more than a thousand theatres worldwide. The film &quot;Olé Olé Olé!: A Trip Across Latin America&quot;, a documentary of their 2016 Latin America tour, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 16 September 2016; it came out on DVD and Blu-ray on 26 May 2017. The Stones performed at the Desert Trip festival held in Indio, California, playing two nights, 7 and 14 October, the same nights as Bob Dylan.

The band released &quot;Blue &amp; Lonesome&quot; on 2 December 2016. The album consisted of 12 blues covers of artists such as Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Jimmy Reed, and Little Walter. Recording took place in British Grove Studios, London, in December 2015, and featured Eric Clapton on two tracks. The album reached number 1 in the UK, the second-highest opening sales week for an album that year. It also debuted at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

=== 2017–present: No Filter Tour, Watts&#x27; death, and &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot; ===

In July 2017, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; reported that the Stones were getting ready to record their first album of original material in more than a decade, but recording was later ultimately delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;On Air&quot;, a collection of 18 recordings the band performed on the BBC between 1963 and 1965, was released in December 2017. The album featured eight songs the band had never recorded or released commercially.
In May 2017, the No Filter Tour was announced, with fourteen shows in twelve different venues across Europe in September and October of the same year. It was later extended to go from May to July 2018, adding fourteen new dates across the UK and Europe, making it the band&#x27;s first UK tour since 2006. In November 2018, the Stones announced plans to bring the No Filter Tour to US stadiums in 2019, with 13 shows set to run from April to June. In March 2019, it was announced that Jagger would be undergoing heart valve replacement surgery, forcing the band to postpone the 17-date North American leg of their No Filter Tour. On 4 April 2019, it was announced that Jagger had completed his heart valve procedure in New York, was recovering (in hospital) after a successful operation, and could be released in the following few days. On 16 May, the Rolling Stones announced that the No Filter Tour would resume on 21 June with the 17 postponed dates rescheduled up to the end of August. In March 2020, the No Filter Tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Rolling Stones—featuring Jagger, Richards, Watts, and Wood at their homes—were one of the headline acts on Global Citizen&#x27;s &quot;One World: Together at Home&quot; on-line and on-screen concert on 18 April 2020, a global event featuring dozens of artists and comedians to support frontline healthcare workers and the World Health Organization during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 23 April, Jagger announced through his Facebook page the release (the same day at 5pm BST) of the single &quot;Living in a Ghost Town&quot;, a new Rolling Stones song recorded in London and Los Angeles in 2019 and finished in isolation (part of the new material that the band were recording in the studio before the COVID-19 lockdown), a song that the band &quot;thought would resonate through the times we&#x27;re living in&quot; and their first original one since 2012. The song reached number 1 on the German Singles Chart, the first time the Stones had reached the top spot in 52 years, and making them the oldest artists ever to do so.
The band&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; was reissued on 4 September 2020 and featured previously unreleased outtakes: such as &quot;Criss Cross&quot;, which was released as a single and music video on 9 July 2020; &quot;Scarlet&quot;, featuring Jimmy Page; and &quot;All the Rage&quot;. On 11 September 2020, the album topped the UK Albums Chart as the Rolling Stones became the first artist to top the chart across six different decades.

In August 2021, it was announced that Watts would undergo an unspecified medical procedure and would not perform on the remainder of the No Filter tour; the longtime Stones associate Steve Jordan filled in as drummer. Watts died on 24 August 2021, at the age of 80, in a London hospital with his family around him. For 10 days, the contents of the Rolling Stones&#x27; official website were replaced with a picture of Watts, in his memory. On 27 August, the band&#x27;s social media accounts shared a montage of pictures and videos of Watts. The band subsequently showed pictures and videos of Watts at the beginning of each concert on the No Filter tour. The short segment is roughly a minute long and plays a simple drum track by Watts. They became the highest-earning live act of 2021, surpassing Taylor Swift; since 2018 the two have traded the top two spots. The band began a new tour in 2022, with Jordan on drums.

Following reports in February 2023 that former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr would appear on their new album, representatives for the band confirmed that McCartney will appear but stated that Starr would not. This will mark the first time that McCartney and the Stones have collaborated on a studio album. Four months later, it was reported that Wyman would return for a song, more than 30 years after his departure from the band.
In August 2023, media outlets reported, based on an advertisement in a local UK newspaper, that a new Stones album might be released in September 2023. The &quot;Hackney Gazette&quot; advertisement made reference to several previous Stones hits, and linked to a fictitious diamond jeweller called &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot;, whose website privacy policy is that of Universal Music Group; the band&#x27;s logo was used to dot the letter &quot;i&quot; in &quot;diamonds&quot;. On 29 August, the band confirmed association with the website through posts on its social media profiles. Because of the advertisement, it was suspected that the album could be called &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot;. Elton John, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney, among others, are expected to guest on the new album. On 6 September 2023, Jagger, Richards and Wood appeared in a live Q&amp;A with Jimmy Fallon to announce that &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot; would be released on 20 October 2023. The album features the final two songs Charlie Watts recorded with the band prior to his death, and it also features former longtime bassist Bill Wyman on one of the album&#x27;s tracks, marking only his second studio recording with the band since 1991&#x27;s &quot;Flashpoint&quot; album. &quot;Angry&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single and music video (starring actress Sydney Sweeney), was also released during the Q&amp;A, with the song also landing on the &quot;EA Sports FC 24&quot; soundtrack. Jagger speculated that the band&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot; was 75% done by the time that album was released. Ten months later, Jagger stated that it is likely the band would release new music &quot;soon&quot;.

The subsequent Hackney Diamonds Tour took place from 28 April 2024 to 21 July 2024 and was generally well received, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; calling the band &quot;still as dangerous and vital as ever&quot; with other papers sharing the sentiment, including the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The band expressed interest that June in continuing the tour in 2025, telling Reuters &quot;We&#x27;ll consider those offers, where we&#x27;re going to go and where it will be fun, you know?...It could be Europe, could be South America, could be anywhere.&quot;

==Musical development==
The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band&#x27;s career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&amp;B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music—exemplified by Jones&#x27; collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka—as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days. The group started out covering early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Stones &quot;pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock &amp; roll that came to define hard rock&quot; with a &quot;strong yet subtly swinging rhythm&quot; provided by Wyman and Watts.

Jagger and Richards had a shared admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Little Walter influenced Brian Jones. Richards recalls, &quot;He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We&#x27;d turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, &#x27;Look, it&#x27;s all the same shit, man, and you can do it. Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair, stating in 2003, &quot;Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four.&quot; Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&amp;B artists, said it &quot;seemed the most real thing&quot; he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the &quot;most powerful music [he had] ever heard ... the most expressive&quot;. He also recalled, &quot;when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters—and there were a lot of us—in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, [it was] very ... heartwarming&quot;.

Despite the Rolling Stones&#x27; predilection for blues and R&amp;B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, &quot;Tell Me (You&#x27;re Coming Back)&quot;, as a &quot;pop rock ballad ... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers&quot;. &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, &quot;It&#x27;s a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn&#x27;t think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.&quot; The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.

Richards said of their early writing experiences, &quot;The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], &#x27;Well, at least we gave it a try ... Jagger opined, &quot;We were very pop-orientated. We didn&#x27;t sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it&#x27;s easy to write to order ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.&quot;

The writing of &quot;The Last Time&quot;, the Rolling Stones&#x27; first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it &quot;a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.&quot; The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones&#x27; number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones&#x27; songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.

Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the &quot;ancient art of weaving&quot; responsible for part of their sound—the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards&#x27; lead rather than the drummer&#x27;s. Likewise, Watts was primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre&#x27;s influences to the style of the band&#x27;s drumming. The following of Richards&#x27; lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards, and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes for a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger&#x27;s production skills. In the studio the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; are driven by Nicky Hopkins&#x27; piano playing. On &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.

Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, 1971), &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; (capo IV), &quot;Happy&quot; (capo IV), (&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, 1972), and &quot;Start Me Up&quot; (&quot;Tattoo You&quot;, 1981).

The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band&#x27;s affairs for many years. When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision-making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like having his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as &quot;World War III&quot;. Of making albums with the Stones, Richards referred to it in 2023 as &quot;controlled madness. Mick is the controller and I&#x27;m the madness.&quot;

Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded &quot;by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions&quot;. Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, &quot;changed music&quot; through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry.

Stephen Hyden writes:The Rolling Stones turn 50 next year, an unprecedented milestone for a rock group and confirmation of an obvious truism: Nobody survives like the world&#x27;s greatest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band. Starting out as a purist blues combo that fronted a bad-boy image while recording the occasional Lennon/McCartney pop tune and string-laden ballad to help secure their popularity, the Stones deftly moved through a number of guises in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s while remaining essentially the same band at its core. When arena-rock reigned, the Stones became an excessive live act whose decadence was on par with Led Zeppelin; when David Bowie and glam became the hippest thing in England, Mick Jagger lathered on the mascara and campy posturing. By the time of 1978&#x27;s &quot;Some Girls&quot;, the Stones absorbed the energy of New York City&#x27;s punk and disco scenes so completely that it reinvigorated the band&#x27;s career, spawning their final (to date) No. 1 single in the U.S., &quot;Miss You.&quot;

==Legacy==
Since their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones have survived multiple feuds. They have released 31 studio albums, 13 live albums, 28 official compilation albums and many recognised bootleg recordings, all of which comprise more than 340 songs. According to OfficialCharts.com, the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time. Their top single is &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, regarded by many at the time as &quot;the classic example of rock and roll&quot;. The Stones contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own &quot;codewords&quot; and slang, such as &quot;losing streak&quot; for menstrual period, which they have used throughout their catalogue of songs.

They pioneered the &quot;raw, blues-based sound&quot; that came to define hard rock and has been viewed as the musical &quot;vanguard of a major transfusion&quot; of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in Britain and the rest of the world. Muddy Waters was quoted as saying that the Rolling Stones and other English bands piqued the interest of American youth in blues musicians. After they came to the United States, sales of Waters&#x27; albums—and those of other blues musicians—increased public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music.

The Stones were supporters of the civil rights movement, having a clause in period contracts stating that they would not perform in segregated venues. Breach of this clause would fine the promoter £30,100 and allow the band to walk away. Their support of civil rights causes has continued to the current era.

In 1981, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the Stones &quot;are the great rock &amp; roll rhythm section of our time&quot; and are &quot;special primarily because they understand that a great rock &amp; roll band never takes too much for granted.&quot; In 2010, they ranked fourth on the magazine&#x27;s list of the Greatest Artists of All Time. Steven Van Zandt wrote: The Rolling Stones are my life. If it wasn&#x27;t for them, I would have been a Soprano for real. I first saw the Stones on TV, on The Hollywood Palace in 1964. In &#x27;64, the Beatles were perfect: the hair, the harmonies, the suits. They bowed together. Their music was extraordinarily sophisticated. The whole thing was exciting and alien but very distant in its perfection. The Stones were alien and exciting, too. But with the Stones, the message was, &quot;Maybe you can do this.&quot; The hair was sloppier. The harmonies were a bit off. And I don&#x27;t remember them smiling at all. They had the R&amp;B traditionalist&#x27;s attitude: &quot;We are not in show business. We are not pop music.&quot; And the sex in Mick Jagger&#x27;s voice was adult. This wasn&#x27;t pop sex – holding hands, playing spin the bottle. This was the real thing. Jagger had that conversational quality that came from R&amp;B singers and bluesmen, that sort of half-singing, not quite holding notes. The acceptance of Jagger&#x27;s voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock &amp; roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren&#x27;t so weird – even Bob Dylan.
&quot;The Telegraph&quot; has called Mick Jagger &quot;the Rolling Stone who changed music&quot;. The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the &quot;whole business model of popular music&quot;. The only artists to top the UK Album Charts in six different decades, they are tied with Elvis Presley and Robbie Williams for the second most number 1 albums on the Official UK Chart, surpassed only by the Beatles.

In 2002, CNN called the Stones &quot;far and away the most successful act in rock today&quot;, adding, &quot;since 1989 alone, the band has generated more than $1.5 billion in gross revenues. That total includes sales of records, song rights, merchandising, sponsorship money, and touring. The Stones have made more money than U2, or Springsteen, or Michael Jackson, or Britney Spears, or the Who—or whoever. Sure, Mick attended the London School of Economics, but his greatest talent, besides strutting and singing, is his ability to surround himself and the rest of the band with a group of very able executives.&quot; The Rolling Stones have sold over 240 million albums worldwide.

In a review of the band&#x27;s 2020 acoustic rendition of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; for Global Citizen&#x27;s &quot;One World: Together At Home&quot; on-line and on-screen concert, &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that they are &quot;still the masters of delivering unforgettable live performances.&quot; On their enduring appeal and reinvention, Rich Cohen of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote in 2016:

The band have received and been nominated for multiple awards including three Grammy Awards (and 12 nominations) and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986, the Juno Award for International Entertainer of the Year in 1991, U.K.&#x27;s Jazz FM Awards Album of the Year (2017) for their album &quot;Blue &amp; Lonesome&quot;, and &quot;NME&quot; (&quot;New Musical Express&quot;) awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary &quot;Crossfire Hurricane&quot;.

On Jagger&#x27;s 75th birthday in 2018, scientists named seven fossil stoneflies after present and former members of the band. Two species, &quot;Petroperla mickjaggeri&quot; and &quot;Lapisperla keithrichardsi&quot;, were placed within a new family Petroperlidae. The new family was named in honour of the Rolling Stones, derived from the Greek &quot;petra&quot; that stands for &quot;stone&quot;. The scientists referred to the fossils as &quot;Rolling Stoneflies&quot;. This theme was continued when NASA named a rock disturbed by the thrusters of the Mars InSight Lander &quot;Rolling Stones Rock&quot;, as announced by Robert Downey Jr. during the band&#x27;s 22 August 2019 performance in Pasadena, California. In 2020, a third species of Petroperlidae, &quot;Branchioperla ianstewarti&quot;, was named after Ian Stewart, pianist and founding member of the band.

In 2019, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked the Rolling Stones second on their list of the &quot;Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, based on the band&#x27;s US chart success. In 2022, the band featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail and their 60th anniversary was commemorated with a collectible coin by the Royal Mint. The band has 38 top-10 albums in the US, the most of any artist. They have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide.

==Live performances==
Since their first concert on 12 July 1962 at the Marquee Club in London, the Rolling Stones have performed more than two thousand concerts around the world and have gone on over 48 tours of varying length, including three of the highest-grossing tours of all time: Bridges to Babylon, Voodoo Lounge, and A Bigger Bang.

From small clubs and hotels in London with little room for Jagger to move around to selling out stadiums worldwide, Rolling Stones tours have changed significantly over the decades. The Stones&#x27; early setups were simple compared to what they became later in the band&#x27;s career, when elaborate stage designs, pyrotechnics, and giant screens were used. By the time the Stones toured America in 1969, they began to fill large halls and arenas, such as The Forum in Inglewood, California. They were also using more equipment, including lighting rigs and better sound equipment, than they had used in clubs.

The 1969 tour is considered a &quot;great watershed tour&quot; by Mick Jagger because they &quot;started hanging the sound and therefore hanging the lights&quot;. Attributing the birth of arena rock to the Stones 1969 US tour, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it 19 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history. Before this tour the loudest sound at large-capacity shows was often the crowd, so the Stones used lighting and sound systems that ensured they could be seen and heard in the biggest arenas. &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that their &quot;combination of front-of-house excellence and behind-the-scenes savvy took the business of touring to an entirely new level.&quot; During the 1972 tour, the Stones developed a complex light show that included giant mirrors that bounced the light off them.

During the 1975 Tour of the Americas, arena shows became an industry for the band, and the Stones hired a new lighting director, Jules Fisher. The props the band used on stage increased in both size and sophistication, similar to those on Broadway. They started to use multiple stages, from which they would select for a particular show. On this tour they had two versions of what Jagger referred to as the &quot;lotus stage&quot;. One version had a large Venetian (cylindrical) curtain, and the other had leaves that began in a folded up position and opened during the beginning of the concert. This period also included a variety of props, including inflatable penises and other gimmicks, and incorporated a number of circus tricks.

During the 1981–1982 American tour, the Stones worked with Japanese designer Kazuhide Yamazari in constructing their stages for stadium-sized locations and audiences. During this period, stages increased in size to include runways and movable sections of the stage going out into the audience. This tour used coloured panels and was one of the last Stones tours to do so before switching to devices such as video screens. Stadium shows provided a new challenge for the band.

Over time, their props and stage equipment have become increasingly sophisticated. When the Stones began to fill stadium-sized venues, or larger, they ran into the problem of the audience no longer being able to see them. This was particularly the case when they performed a free concert for an estimated 1.5 million people in Rio de Janeiro on the &quot;A Bigger Bang&quot; tour in 2006. The show required over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost in length. Due to the length of the beach on which the Stones performed, sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern down the length of the beach, to keep the sound in sync with the music from the stage; for every of beach, the sound would be delayed by an additional second.

<text>Tipu Sultan (&quot;Sultan Fateh Ali Sahab Tipu&quot;; 1 December 1751 – 4 May 1799) commonly referred to as Sher-e-Mysore or &quot;Tiger of Mysore&quot;, was a ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore based in South India. He was a pioneer of rocket artillery. He expanded the iron-cased Mysorean rockets and commissioned the military manual &quot;Fathul Mujahidin&quot;. The economy of Mysore reached a zenith during his reign. He deployed rockets against advances of British forces and their allies during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, including the Battle of Pollilur and Siege of Srirangapatna.

Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali used their French-trained army in alliance with the French in their struggle with the British, and in Mysore&#x27;s struggles with other surrounding powers: against the Marathas, Sira, and rulers of Malabar, Kodagu, Bednore, Carnatic, and Travancore. Tipu became the ruler of Mysore upon his father&#x27;s death from cancer in 1782 during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. He negotiated with the British in 1784 with the Treaty of Mangalore which ended the war in status quo ante bellum.

Tipu&#x27;s conflicts with his neighbours included the Maratha–Mysore War, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Gajendragad.

Tipu remained an enemy of the British East India Company. He initiated an attack on British-allied Travancore in 1789. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War, he was forced into the Treaty of Seringapatam, losing a number of previously conquered territories, including Malabar and Mangalore. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, a combined force of British East India Company troops supported by the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad defeated Tipu. He was killed on 4 May 1799 while defending his stronghold of Seringapatam.

Tipu also introduced administrative innovations during his rule, including a new coinage system and calendar, and a new land revenue system, which initiated the growth of the Mysore silk industry. He is known for his patronage to Channapatna toys.

== Early years ==
===Childhood===
Tipu Sultan was born in Devanahalli, in present-day Bangalore Rural district, about north of Bangalore on 1 December 1751. He was named &quot;Tipu Sultan&quot; after the saint Tipu Mastan Aulia of Arcot. Being illiterate, Hyder was very particular in giving his eldest son a prince&#x27;s education and a very early exposure to military and political affairs. At age of 17 onwards Tipu was given charge of diplomatic and military missions and supported his father Hyder in his wars.

Tipu&#x27;s father, Hyder Ali, was a military officer in service to the Kingdom of Mysore who had become the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Mysore in 1761 while his mother Fatima Fakhr-un-Nisa was the daughter of Mir Muin-ud-Din, the governor of the fort of Kadapa. Hyder Ali appointed able teachers to give Tipu an early education in subjects like Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kannada, Beary, Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, riding, shooting and fencing.

===Language===
Tipu Sultan&#x27;s mother tongue was Urdu. The French noted that &quot;Their language is Moorish[Urdu] but they also speak Persian.&quot; &quot;Moors&quot; at the time was a European designation for Urdu: &quot;I have a deep knowledge [&quot;je possède à fond&quot;] of the common tongue of India, called &quot;Moors&quot; by the English, and &quot;Ourdouzebain&quot; by the natives of the land.&quot;

== Early military service ==

=== Early Conflicts ===
Tipu Sultan was instructed in military tactics by French officers in the employment of his father. At age 15, he accompanied his father against the British in the First Mysore War in 1766. He commanded a corps of cavalry in the invasion of Carnatic in 1767 at age 16. He also took part in the First Anglo-Maratha War of 1775–1779.

Alexander Beatson, who published a volume on the Fourth Mysore War entitled &quot;View of the Origin and Conduct of the War with Tippoo Sultaun&quot;, described Tipu Sultan as follows: &quot;His stature was about five feet eight inches; he had a short neck, square shoulders, and was rather corpulent: his limbs were small, particularly his feet and hands; he had large full eyes, small arched eyebrows, and an aquiline nose; his complexion was fair, and the general expression of his countenance, not void of dignity&quot;.

===Second Anglo-Mysore War===

 In 1779, the British captured the French-controlled port of Mahé which Tipu had placed under his protection, providing some troops for its defence. In response, Hyder launched an invasion of the Carnatic, with the aim of driving the British out of Madras. During this campaign in September 1780, Tipu Sultan was dispatched by Hyder Ali with 10,000 men and 18 guns to intercept Colonel William Baillie who was on his way to join Sir Hector Munro. In the Battle of Pollilur, Tipu defeated Baillie. Out of 360 Europeans, about 200 were captured alive, and the sepoys, who were about 3800 men, suffered very high casualties. Munro was moving south with a separate force to join Baillie, but on hearing the news of the defeat he retreated to Madras, abandoning his artillery in a water tank at Kanchipuram.

Tipu Sultan defeated Colonel Braithwaite at Annagudi near Tanjore on 18 February 1782. Braithwaite&#x27;s forces, consisting of 100 Europeans, 300 cavalry, 1400 sepoys and 10 field pieces, was the standard size of the colonial armies. Tipu Sultan seized all guns and took the detachment prisoner. In December 1781 Tipu Sultan seized Chittur from the British. Tipu Sultan had gained sufficient military experience by the time Hyder Ali died on Friday, 6 December 1782. Some historians put Hyder Ali&#x27;s death at 2 or 3 days later or before due to the Hijri date being 1 Muharram, 1197 as per some records in Persian (which can result in a difference of 1 to 3 days due to the Lunar Calendar). He became the ruler of Mysore on Sunday, 22 December 1782 (the inscriptions in some of Tipu&#x27;s regalia show it as 20 Muharram, 1197 Hijri Sunday) in a simple coronation ceremony.
He subsequently worked on to check the advances of the British by making alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The Second Mysore War came to an end with the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore.

==Ruler of Mysore==
On 29 December 1782, Tipu Sultan crowned himself &quot;Badshah&quot; or Emperor of Mysore with the title Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur at age 32, and struck coinage.

===Conflicts with Maratha Confederacy===

The Maratha Empire under its new Peshwa Madhavrao I regained most of Indian subcontinent, twice defeating Tipu&#x27;s father in 1764 and then in 1767. In 1767 Maratha Peshwa Madhavrao defeated both Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan and entered Srirangapatna, the capital of Mysore. Hyder Ali accepted the authority of Madhavrao who gave him the title of Nawab of Mysore.

Subsequently, to escape the treaty, Tipu tried to take some Maratha forts in Southern India captured by in the previous war and also stopped the tribute to Marathas which was promised by Hyder Ali. This brought Tipu in direct conflict with the Marathas, leading to Maratha–Mysore War
Conflicts between Mysore (under Tipu) and Marathas:
* Siege of Nargund during February 1785 won by Mysore
* Siege of Badami during May 1786 in which Mysore surrendered
* Siege of Adoni during June 1786 won by Mysore
* Battle of Gajendragad, June 1786 won by Marathas
* Battle of Savanur during October 1786 won by Mysore
* Siege of Bahadur Benda during January 1787 won by Mysore

Conflict ended with Treaty of Gajendragad in March 1787, as per which Tipu returned all the territory captured by Hyder Ali to Maratha Empire. Tipu would elease Kalopant and return Adoni, Kittur, and Nargund to their previous rulers. Badami would be ceded to the Marathas and Tipu would also pay an annual tribute totaling 12 lakhs for an agreed period of 4 years to the Marathas. In return, Tipu Sultan would get all the region that he had captured during the war. This included Gajendragarh and Dharwar. The Marathas in return agreed to recognize his authority and to address Tipu sultan as &quot;Nabob Tipu Sultan Futteh Ally Khan&quot;. However the Marathas ultimately reneged on the treaty and in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War the Marathas presented their support to the British East India Company which helped the British to take over Mysore in 1799.

===The Invasion of Malabar (1766–1790)===

In 1766 when he was 15 years old Tipu accompanied his father on an invasion of Malabar. After the incident- Siege of Tellicherry in Thalassery in North Malabar, Hyder Ali started losing his territories in Malabar. Tipu came from Mysore to reinstate the authority over Malabar. After the Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789–90), due to the monsoon flood, the stiff resistance of the Travancore forces and news about the attack of British in Srirangapatnam he went back.

===Third Anglo-Mysore War===

In 1789, Tipu Sultan disputed the acquisition by Dharma Raja of Travancore of two Dutch-held fortresses in Cochin. In December 1789 he massed troops at Coimbatore, and on 28 December made an attack on the lines of Travancore, knowing that Travancore was (according to the Treaty of Mangalore) an ally of the British East India Company. On account of the staunch resistance by the Travancore army, Tipu was unable to break through the Tranvancore lines and the Maharajah of Travancore appealed to the East India Company for help. In response, Lord Cornwallis mobilised company and British military forces, and formed alliances with the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad to oppose Tipu. In 1790 the company forces advanced, taking control of much of the Coimbatore district. Tipu counter-attacked, regaining much of the territory, although the British continued to hold Coimbatore itself. He then descended into the Carnatic, eventually reaching Pondicherry, where he attempted without success to draw the French into the conflict.

In 1791 his opponents advanced on all fronts, with the main British force under Cornwallis taking Bangalore and threatening Srirangapatna. Tipu harassed the British supply and communication and embarked on a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy of denying local resources to the British. In this last effort he was successful, as the lack of provisions forced Cornwallis to withdraw to Bangalore rather than attempt a siege of Srirangapatna. Following the withdrawal, Tipu sent forces to Coimbatore, which they retook after a lengthy siege.

The 1792 campaign was a failure for Tipu. The allied army was well-supplied, and Tipu was unable to prevent the junction of forces from Bangalore and Bombay before Srirangapatna. After about two weeks of siege, Tipu opened negotiations for terms of surrender. In the ensuing treaty, he was forced to cede half his territories to the allies, and deliver two of his sons as hostages until he paid in full three crores and thirty lakhs rupees fixed as war indemnity to the British for the campaign against him. He paid the amount in two instalments and got back his sons from Madras.

===Napoleon&#x27;s attempt at a junction===
In 1794, with the support of French Republican officers, Tipu allegedly helped found the Jacobin Club of Mysore for &#x27;framing laws comfortable with the laws of the Republic&#x27;. He planted a Liberty Tree and declared himself Citizen Tipoo. In a 2005 paper, historian Jean Boutier argued that the club&#x27;s existence, and Tipu&#x27;s involvement in it, was fabricated by the East India Company in order to justify British military intervention against Tipu.

One of the motivations of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Egypt was to establish a junction with India against the British. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tippoo Sahib. Napoleon assured the French Directory that &quot;as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions.&quot; According to a 13 February 1798 report by Talleyrand: &quot;Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send a force of 15,000 men from Suez to India, to join the forces of Tipu-Sahib and drive away the English.&quot; Napoleon was unsuccessful in this strategy, losing the Siege of Acre in 1799 and at the Battle of Abukir in 1801.

==Death==

Horatio Nelson defeated François-Paul Brueys D&#x27;Aigalliers at the Battle of the Nile in Egypt in 1798. Three armies marched into Mysore in 1799—one from Bombay and two British, one of which included Arthur Wellesley. They besieged the capital Srirangapatna in the Fourth Mysore War. There were more than 60,000 soldiers of the British East India Company, approximately 4,000 Europeans and the rest Indians; while Tipu Sultan&#x27;s forces numbered only around 30,000. The betrayal by Tipu Sultan&#x27;s ministers in working with the British and weakening the walls to make an easy path for the British. The death of Tipu Sultan led British General Harris to exclaim &quot;Now India is ours.&quot;

When the British broke through the city walls, French military advisers told Tipu Sultan to escape via secret passages and to fight the rest of the wars from other forts, but he refused. Tipu famously said &quot;Better to live one day as a tiger than a thousand years as a sheep&quot;.
Tipu Sultan was killed at the Hoally (Diddy) Gateway, which was located from the N.E. Angle of the Srirangapatna Fort. He was buried the next afternoon at the Gumaz, next to the grave of his father. Many members of the British East India Company believed that Nawab of Carnatic Umdat Ul-Umra secretly provided assistance to Tipu Sultan during the war and sought his deposition after 1799. These five men include Mir Sadiq, Purnaiya, two military commanders Saiyed Saheb and Qamaruddin, and Mir Nadim, commandant of the fort of Seringapatam. The episode of treachery as narrated by Hasan starts with the disobedience of Tipu&#x27;s instructions. When he died there were jubilant celebrations in Britain, with authors, playwrights and painters creating works to celebrate it. The death of Tipu Sultan was celebrated with declaration of public holiday in Britain.

== Administration ==
Tipu introduced a new calendar, new coinage, and seven new government departments, during his reign, and made military innovations in the use of rocketry.

===Mysorean rockets===

Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, in his Tipu Sultan Shaheed Memorial Lecture in Bangalore (30 November 1991), called Tipu Sultan the innovator of the world&#x27;s first war rocket. Two of these rockets, captured by the British at Srirangapatna, were displayed in the Royal Artillery Museum in London. According to historian Dr Dulari Qureshi Tipu Sultan was a fierce warrior king and was so quick in his movement that it seemed to the enemy that he was fighting on many fronts at the same time. Tipu managed to subdue all the petty kingdoms in the south. He was also one of the few Indian rulers to have defeated British armies.

Tipu Sultan&#x27;s father had expanded on Mysore&#x27;s use of rocketry, making critical innovations in the rockets themselves and the military logistics of their use. He deployed as many as 1,200 specialised troops in his army to operate rocket launchers. These men were skilled in operating the weapons and were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target. The rockets had twin side sharpened blades mounted on them, and when fired &quot;en masse&quot;, spun and wreaked significant damage against a large army. Tipu greatly expanded the use of rockets after Hyder&#x27;s death, deploying as many as 5,000 rocketeers at a time. The rockets deployed by Tipu during the Battle of Pollilur were much more advanced than those the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missiles (up to 2 km range).

British accounts describe the use of the rockets during the third and fourth wars. During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. After Tipu&#x27;s defeat in the fourth war the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets. These became influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.

===Navy===
In 1786 Tipu Sultan, again following the lead of his father, decided to build a navy consisting of 20 battleships of 72 cannons and 20 frigates of 65 cannons. In the year 1790 he appointed Kamaluddin as his &quot;Mir Bahar&quot; and established massive dockyards at Jamalabad and Majidabad. Tipu Sultan&#x27;s board of admiralty consisted of 11 commanders in service of a &quot;Mir Yam&quot;. A &quot;Mir Yam&quot; led 30 admirals and each one of them had two ships. Tipu Sultan ordered that the ships have copper-bottoms, an idea that increased the longevity of the ships and was introduced to Tipu by Admiral Suffren.

===Army===
Due to their perpetual battle engagements, Haidar and Tipu required a disciplined standing army. Thus, Rajputs, Muslims and able tribal men were enrolled for full time service replacing the local militia called the &quot;Kandachar&quot; force of agricultural origin which existed in the Mysore army earlier. The removal of the Vokkaligas from the local militia which had taken part in wars for centuries and the imposition of higher taxes on them in place of their quit rent led indirectly to the implementation of Ryotwari system. Now the Ryots could not rely upon slaves for their agricultural activities since their slaves were enrolled in the army in some places. Besides paying higher taxes they had to endure the additional responsibility of feeding the slaves and financing their marriages. This led to the weakening of the system of slavery in Mysore.

=== Economy ===

The peak of Mysore&#x27;s economic power was under Tipu Sultan in the late 18th century. Along with his father Hyder Ali, he embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under his reign, Mysore overtook Bengal Subah as India&#x27;s dominant economic power, with highly productive agriculture and textile manufacturing. Mysore&#x27;s average income was five times higher than subsistence level at the time.

Tipu Sultan laid the foundation for the construction of the Kannambadi dam (present-day Krishna Raja Sagara or KRS dam) on the Kaveri river, as attested by an extant stone plaque bearing his name, but was unable to begin the construction. The dam was later built and opened in 1938. It is a major source of drinking water for the people of Mysore and Bangalore.

The Mysore silk industry was first initiated during the reign of Tipu Sultan. He sent an expert to Bengal Subah to study silk cultivation and processing, after which Mysore began developing polyvoltine silk.

The greater prominence of the Channapatna toys can be traced to patronage from Tipu Sultan, the historic ruler of Mysore, though these toys existed before this period historically given as gifts as part of Dusshera celebrations. It is known that he was an ardent admirer of arts, and in particular of woodwork.

==== Road development ====
Tipu Sultan was considered as pioneer of road construction, especially in Malabar, as part of his campaigns, he connected most of the cities by roads.

===Foreign relations===

;Mughal Empire

Both Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan owed nominal allegiance to the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; both were described as Nabobs by the British East India Company in all existing treaties. But unlike the Nawab of Carnatic, they did not acknowledge the overlordship of the Nizam of Hyderabad.

Immediately after his coronation as &quot;Badshah&quot;, Tipu Sultan sought the investiture of the Mughal emperor. He earned the title &quot;Nasib-ud-Daula&quot; with the heavy heart of those loyal to Shah Alam II. Tipu was a selfdeclared &quot;Sultan&quot; this fact drew towards him the hostility of Nizam Ali Khan, the Nizam of Hyderabad, who clearly expressed his hostility by dissuading the Mughal emperor and laying claims on Mysore. Disheartened, Tipu Sultan began to establish contacts with other Muslim rulers of that period.

Tipu Sultan was the master of his own diplomacy with foreign nations, in his quest to rid India of the East India Company and to ensure the international strength of France. Like his father before him he fought battles on behalf of foreign nations which were not in the best interests of Shah Alam II.

After Ghulam Qadir had Shah Alam II blinded on 10 August 1788, Tipu Sultan is believed to have broken into tears.

After the Fall of Seringapatam in 1799, the blind emperor did remorse for Tipu, but maintained his confidence in the Nizam of Hyderabad, who had now made peace with the British.

; Afghanistan

After facing substantial threats from the Marathas, Tipu Sultan began to correspond with Zaman Shah Durrani, the ruler of the Afghan Durrani Empire, so they could defeat the British and Marathas. Initially, Zaman Shah agreed to help Tipu, but the Persian attack on Afghanistan&#x27;s Western border diverted its forces, and hence no help could be provided to Tipu.

; Ottoman Empire

In 1787, Tipu Sultan sent an embassy to the Ottoman capital Constantinople, to the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid I requesting urgent assistance against the British East India Company. Tipu Sultan requested the Ottoman Sultan to send him troops and military experts. Furthermore, Tipu Sultan also requested permission from the Ottomans to contribute to the maintenance of the Islamic shrines in Mecca, Medina, Najaf and Karbala.

However, the Ottomans were themselves in crisis and still recuperating from the devastating Austro-Ottoman War and a new conflict with the Russian Empire had begun, for which Ottoman Turkey needed British alliance to keep off the Russians, hence it could not risk being hostile to the British in the Indian theatre.

Due to the Ottoman inability to organise a fleet in the Indian Ocean, Tipu Sultan&#x27;s ambassadors returned home only with gifts from their Ottoman brothers.

Nevertheless, Tipu Sultan&#x27;s correspondence with the Ottoman Empire and particularly its new Sultan Selim III continued till his final battle in the year 1799.

; Persia and Oman

Like his father before him, Tipu Sultan maintained friendly relations with Mohammad Ali Khan, ruler of the Zand dynasty in Persia. Tipu Sultan also maintained correspondence with Hamad bin Said, the ruler of the Sultanate of Oman.

;Qing China

Tipu&#x27;s and Mysore&#x27;s tryst with silk began in the early 1780s when he received an ambassador from the Qing dynasty-ruled China at his court. The ambassador presented him with a silk cloth. Tipu was said to be enchanted by the item to such an extent that he resolved to introduce its production in his kingdom. He sent a return journey to China, which returned after twelve years.

; France

Both Hyder Ali and Tipu sought an alliance with the French, the only European power still strong enough to challenge the British East India Company in the subcontinent. In 1782, Louis XVI concluded an alliance with the Peshwa Madhu Rao Narayan. This treaty enabled Bussy to move his troops to the Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the same year, French Admiral De Suffren ceremonially presented a portrait of Louis XVI to Haidar Ali and sought his alliance.

Napoleon conquered Egypt in an attempt to link with Tipu Sultan. In February 1798, Napoleon wrote a letter to Tipu Sultan appreciating his efforts of resisting the British annexation and plans, but this letter never reached Tipu and was seized by a British spy in Muscat. The idea of a possible Tipu-Napoleon alliance alarmed the British Governor, General Sir Richard Wellesley (also known as Lord Wellesley), so much that he immediately started large scale preparations for a final battle against Tipu Sultan.

===Social system===
====Judicial system====
Tipu Sultan appointed judges from both communities for Hindu and Muslim subjects. Qadi for Muslims and Pandit for Hindus in each province. Upper courts also had similar systems.

====Moral Administration====
Usage of liquor and prostitution were strictly prohibited in his administration. Usage and agriculture of psychedelics, such as Cannabis, was also prohibited.

Polyandry in Kerala was prohibited by Tipu Sultan. He passed a decree for all women to cover their breasts, which was not practised in Kerala in the previous era.

===Religious policy===

On a personal level, Tipu was a devout Muslim, saying his prayers daily and paying special attention to mosques in the area. Regular endowments were made during this period to about 156 Hindu temples, including the famed Ranganathaswami Temple at Srirangapatna. Many sources mention the appointment of Hindu officers in Tipu&#x27;s administration and his land grants and endowments to Hindu temples, which are cited as evidence for his religious tolerance.

His religious legacy has become a source of considerable controversy in India, with some groups (including Christians and even Muslims) proclaiming him a great warrior for the faith or &quot;Ghazi&quot; for both religious and political reasons. Various sources describe the massacres, imprisonment and forced conversion of Hindus (Kodavas of Coorg, Nairs of Malabar) and Christians (Catholics of Mangalore), the destruction of churches and temples, and the clamping down on Muslims (Mappila of Kerala, the Mahdavia Muslims, the rulers of Savanur and the people of Hyderabad State), which are sometimes cited as evidence for his intolerance.

====British accounts====
Historians such as Brittlebank, Hasan, Chetty, Habib, and Saletare, amongst others, argue that controversial stories of Tipu Sultan&#x27;s religious persecution of Hindus and Christians are largely derived from the work of early British authors (who were very much against Tipu Sultan&#x27;s independence and harboured prejudice against the Sultan) such as James Kirkpatrick and Mark Wilks, whom they do not consider to be entirely reliable and likely fabricated. A. S. Chetty argues that Wilks&#x27; account in particular cannot be trusted.

Irfan Habib and Mohibbul Hasan argue that these early British authors had a strong vested interest in presenting Tipu Sultan as a tyrant from whom the British had liberated Mysore. This assessment is echoed by Brittlebank in her recent work where she writes that Wilks and Kirkpatrick must be used with particular care as both authors had taken part in the wars against Tipu Sultan and were closely connected to the administrations of Lord Cornwallis and Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley.

====Relations with Hindus====
Tipu Sultan&#x27;s treasurer was Krishna Rao, Shamaiya Iyengar was his Minister of Post and Police, his brother Ranga Iyengar was also an officer, and Purnaiya held the very important post of &quot;Mir Asaf&quot;. Moolchand and Sujan Rai were his chief agents at the Mughal court, and his chief &quot;Peshkar&quot;, Suba Rao, was also a Hindu.

The Editor of Mysore Gazette reports of correspondence between his court and temples, and his having donated jewellery and deeded land grants to several temples, which he was compelled to for forming alliances with Hindu rulers. Between 1782 and 1799 Tipu Sultan issued 34 &quot;Sanads&quot; (deeds) of endowment to temples in his domain, while also presenting many of them with gifts of silver and gold plate.

The Srikanteswara Temple in Nanjangud still possesses a jeweled cup presented by the Sultan. He also gave a greenish linga; to Ranganatha temple at Srirangapatna, he donated seven silver cups and a silver camphor burner. This temple was hardly a stone&#x27;s throw from his palace from where he would listen with equal respect to the ringing of temple bells and the muezzin&#x27;s call from the mosque; to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale he gifted four cups, a plate and Spitoon in silver.

During the Maratha–Mysore War in 1791, a group of Maratha horsemen under Raghunath Rao Patwardhan raided the temple and &quot;matha&quot; of Sringeri &quot;Shankaracharya&quot;. They wounded and killed many people, including Brahmins, plundered the monastery of all its valuable possessions, and desecrated the temple by displacing the image of goddess Sarada.

The incumbent &quot;Shankaracharya&quot; petitioned Tipu Sultan for help. About 30 letters written in Kannada, which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan&#x27;s court and the Sringeri Shankaracharya, were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in Mysore. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:

&quot;People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date in this Kali age in accordance with the verse: &quot;Hasadbhih kriyate karma rudadbhir-anubhuyate&quot; (People do [evil] deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying).&quot; 

He immediately ordered the Asaf of Bednur to supply the Swami with 200 &quot;rahati&quot;s (&quot;fanam&quot;s) in cash and other gifts and articles. Tipu Sultan&#x27;s interest in the Sringeri temple continued for many years, and he was still writing to the Swami in the 1790s.

In light of this and other events, historian B. A. Saletare has described Tipu Sultan as a defender of the Hindu dharma, who also patronised other temples including one at Melkote, for which he issued a Kannada decree that the Shrivaishnava invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form. The temple at Melkote still has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented by the Sultan. Tipu Sultan also presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale. Tipu Sultan does seem to have repossessed unauthorised grants of land made to Brahmins and temples, but those which had proper &quot;sanads&quot; (certificates) were not. It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.

====Persecution of Kodavas outside Mysore====

Tipu got Runmust Khan, the &quot;Nawab of Kurnool&quot;, to launch a surprise attack upon the Kodavas who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains. Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

Mohibbul Hasan, Prof. Sheikh Ali, and other historians cast great doubt on the scale of the deportations and forced conversions in Coorg in particular. Hassan says that it is difficult to estimate the real number of Kodava captured by Tipu.

In a letter to Runmust Khan, Tipu himself stated: 
==The coinage system==

The coinage of Tipu Sultan is one of the most complex and fascinating series struck in India during the 18th century. Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became Mysore since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant pagoda), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These pagoda were always in the South Indian style until the reign of Haidar Ali (1761–1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II plus the Arabic letter &quot;ح&quot; as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue pagodas, mohurs and rupees, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large paisa was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new Persian names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:

Copper: Qutb &quot;قطب&quot; for the 1/8 paisa (Persian for the pole star) – Akhtar &quot;اختر&quot; for the 1/4 paisa (star) – Bahram &quot;بهرام&quot; for the 1/2 paisa (the planet Mars) – Zohra &quot;زهره&quot; for the paisa (the planet Venus) – either Othmani &quot;عثمانی&quot; for the double-paisa (the third caliph of the Rashidun) or Mushtari &quot;مشتری&quot; (the planet Jupiter).

Silver: Khizri &quot;خضری&quot; for the 1/32 rupee (Khizr the prophet) – Kazimi &quot;کاظمی&quot; for the 1/16 rupee (for Musa, the seventh Shi&#x27;ite Imam) – Ja&#x27;fari &quot;جعفری&quot; for the 1/8 rupee (Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, the sixth Shi&#x27;ite Imam) – Bâqiri &quot;باقری&quot; for the 1/4 rupee (Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam) – Abidi &quot;عبیدی&quot; for the 1/2 rupee (Ali Zain al-&#x27;Abidin, the fourth Imam) – Imami for the rupee (reference to the 12 Shi&#x27;ite Imams) – Haidari &quot;حیدری&quot; for the double-rupee (lion, for Ali b. Abi Talib, who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi&#x27;ite Imam).

Gold: Faruqi &quot;فاروقی&quot; for the pagoda (Umar al-Faruq, the second caliph) – Sadîqi &quot;صدیقی&quot; for the double-pagoda (Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first caliph) – Ahmadi &quot;احمدی&quot; for the four-pagoda ( &quot;most praised &quot;, one of the name of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the mohur, with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi &quot;مولودی&quot; system (AM1215-1219).

===Coinage dating system===

The denomination does not appear on the Hijri dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.

At the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the Hijri dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word &quot;walad &quot;, which means &quot;birth &quot;), based on the solar year and the birth year of Muhammad (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).

From the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki &quot;زکي&quot; for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( &quot;pure &quot;) – Azâl &quot;أزل&quot; for 38 ( &quot;eternity &quot;, year 2) – Jalal &quot;جَلال&quot; for 39 ( &quot;splendor &quot;, year 3) – Dalv &quot;دَلو&quot; for 40 (the sign of Aquarius, year 4) – Shâ &quot;شاه&quot; for 41 ( &quot;king &quot;, year 5) – Sârâ &quot;سارا&quot; for 42 ( &quot;fragrant &quot;, year 6) – Sarâb &quot;سراب&quot; for 43 ( &quot;mirage &quot;, for year 7) – Shitâ &quot;شتا&quot; for 44 ( &quot;winter &quot;, year 8) – Zabarjad &quot;زبرجد&quot; for 45 ( &quot;topaz &quot;, year 9) – sahar &quot;سَحَر&quot; ( &quot;dawn &quot;, year 10) – Sâher &quot;ساحِر&quot; ( &quot;magician &quot;, year 11).

==Assessment and legacy==
Assessments of Tipu Sultan have often been passionate and divided. Successive Indian National Congress governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan&#x27;s memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the Bharatiya Janata Party has been largely critical. School and college textbooks in India officially recognize him as a &quot;freedom-fighter&quot; along with many other rulers of the 18th century who fought European powers. The original copy of the Constitution of India bears a painting of Tipu Sultan.

In 2017 the 14th Indian president Ram Nath Kovind hailed Tipu Sultan in his address to the Karnataka Assembly on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the state secretariat Vidhana Soudha saying &quot;Tipu Sultan died a heroic death fighting the British. He was also a pioneer in the development and use of Mysore rockets in warfare. This technology was later adopted by the Europeans.&quot;

Tipu Sultan is also admired as a hero in Pakistan. Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that he admires Tipu Sultan as a freedom fighter.

Tipu also patronised art forms such as Ganjifa cards, effectively saving this art form. Ganjifa card of Mysore have the GI Tag today.

=== Sword and tiger ===

Tipu Sultan had lost his sword in a war with the Nairs of Travancore during the Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789), in which he was forced to withdraw due to the severe joint attack from the Travancore army and British army. The Nair army under the leadership of Raja Kesavadas again defeated the army of Tipu near Aluva. The Maharaja, Dharma Raja, gave the famous sword to the Nawab of Arcot, from whom the sword was taken as a war trophy by the British after annexing Arcot and sent to London. The sword was on display at the Wallace Collection, No. 1 Manchester Square, London.

Tipu was commonly known as the Tiger of Mysore and adopted this animal as the symbol (&quot;bubri/babri&quot;) of his rule. It is said that Tipu Sultan was hunting in the forest with a French friend. They came face to face with a tiger there. The tiger first pounced on the French soldier and killed him. Tipu&#x27;s gun did not work, and his dagger fell on the ground as the tiger jumped on him. He reached for the dagger, picked it up, and killed the tiger with it. That earned him the name &quot;the Tiger of Mysore&quot;. He even had French engineers build a mechanical tiger for his palace. The device, known as Tipu&#x27;s Tiger, is on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Not only did Tipu place relics of tigers around his palace and domain, but also had the emblem of a tiger on his banners and some arms and weapons. Sometimes this tiger was very ornate and had inscriptions within the drawing, alluding to Tipu&#x27;s faith – Islam. Historian Alexander Beatson reported that &quot;in his palace was found a great variety of curious swords, daggers, fusils, pistols, and blunderbusses; some were of exquisite workmanship, mounted with gold, or silver, and beautifully inlaid and ornamented with tigers&#x27; heads and stripes, or with Persian and Arabic verses&quot;.

The last sword used by Tipu in his last battle, at Sri Rangapatnam, and the ring worn by him were taken by the British forces as war trophies. Till April 2004, they were kept on display at the British Museum London as gifts to the museum from Maj-Gen Augustus W.H. Meyrick and Nancy Dowager. At an auction in London in April 2004, Vijay Mallya purchased the sword of Tipu Sultan and some other historical artefacts, and brought them back to India.

In October 2013, another sword owned by Tipu Sultan and decorated with his &quot;babri&quot; (tiger stripe motif) surfaced and was auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s. It was purchased for £98,500 by a telephone bidder.

===Tipu Sultan Jayanti===
In 2015, the Government of Karnataka, under the leadership of then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah from the Congress party, began to celebrate Tipu&#x27;s birth anniversary as the &quot;Tipu Sultan Jayanti&quot;. The Congress regime declared it as an annual event to be celebrated on 20 November. It was officially celebrated in Karnataka initially by the Minority Welfare department, and later by the Kannada &amp; Culture department. However, on 29 July 2019, the next Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa, who belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ordered the celebrations cancelled, saying: &quot;Legislators from Kodagu had highlighted incidents of violence during Tipu Jayanti.&quot;

Objecting against the cancellation of the celebrations, the previous Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said: &quot;BJP has cancelled it because of their hatred towards minorities. It&#x27;s a big crime. He [Tipu] was a king of Mysore and fought against the British [as] a freedom fighter. It was during his time when the foundation was laid for the Krishna Raja Sagara dam. He also tried to improve industry, agriculture and trade&quot;. The previous year, not a single JD(S) leader, including the then chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, attended the event, turning it into a fiasco.

The Lok Sabha Congress leader, Mallikarjun Kharge, also earlier criticized BJP and RSS for their opposition against holding the celebrations, and asked: &quot;When RSS can celebrate Nathuram Godse, can&#x27;t we celebrate Tipu Sultan?&quot;

<text>Telnet (short for &quot;telecommunications network&quot;) is a client/server application protocol that provides access to virtual terminals of remote systems on local area networks or the Internet. It is a protocol for bidirectional 8-bit communications. Its main goal was to connect terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes.

Telnet consists of two components: (1) the protocol itself which specifies how two parties are to communicate and (2) the software application that provides the service. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Telnet was developed as secret technology in 1969 beginning with , extended in , and standardized as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Standard STD 8, one of the first Internet standards. Telnet transmits all information including usernames and passwords in plaintext so it is not recommended for security-sensitive applications such as remote management of routers. Telnet&#x27;s use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of SSH. Some extensions to Telnet which would provide encryption have been proposed.

== Components ==
Telnet consists of two components: (1) the protocol itself and (2) the service component. The telnet protocol is a client-server protocol, based on a reliable connection-oriented transport. This protocol is used to establish a connection to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port number 23 or 2323, where a Telnet server application is listening. The Telnet protocol abstracts any terminal as a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT). The client must simulate a NVT using the NVT codes when messaging the server.

Telnet predated UDP/IP and originally ran over Network Control Protocol (NCP). The telnet service is best understood in the context of a user with a simple terminal using the local Telnet program (known as the client program) to run a logon session on a remote computer where the user&#x27;s communications needs are handled by a Telnet server program.

=== Telnet Protocol ===

==== History ====
Even though Telnet was an ad hoc protocol with no official definition until March 5, 1973, the name actually referred to &quot;Teletype Over Network Protocol&quot; as the (NIC 7176) on Telnet makes the connection clear:

Essentially, it used an 8-bit channel to exchange 7-bit ASCII data. Any byte with the high bit set was a special Telnet character. On March 5, 1973, a Telnet protocol standard was defined at UCLA with the publication of two NIC documents: Telnet Protocol Specification, NIC 15372, and Telnet Option Specifications, NIC 15373.

==== Extensions ====
Many extensions were made for Telnet because of its negotiable options protocol architecture. Some of these extensions have been adopted as Internet standards, IETF documents STD 27 through STD 32. Some extensions have been widely implemented and others are proposed standards on the IETF standards track (see below). 

=== Telnet service ===
The Telnet service is the application providing services over the Telnet protocol. Most operating systems provide a service that can be installed or enabled to provide Telnet services to clients.

== Security vulnerabilities ==
Telnet is vulnerable to network-based cyberattacks, such as packet sniffing sensitive information including passwords and fingerprinting. Telnet services can also be exploited to leak information about the server (such as hostnames, IP addresses and brand) by packet sniffing the banner. This information can then be searched to determine if a Telnet service accepts a connection without authentication. Telnet is also frequently exploited by malware due to being improperly configured. In fact, Telnet is targeted by attackers more frequently than other common protocols, especially when compared to UPnP, CoAP, MQTT, AMQP and XMPP . Common devices targeted are Internet of things devices, routers and modems.

The SANS Institute recommends that the use of Telnet for remote logins should be discontinued under normal circumstances for the following reasons:

* Telnet, by default, does not encrypt any data sent over the connection (including passwords), and so it is often feasible to eavesdrop on the communications and use the password later for malicious purposes; anybody who has access to a router, switch, hub or gateway located on the network between the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by and obtain login, password and whatever else is typed with a packet analyzer.
* Most Telnet implementations lack authentication. An estimated 22,887 Telnet-enabled devices found by security researchers not only lacked authentication but also provided unrestricted access to the system.
* Most Telnet authentication mechanisms are vulnerable to being intercepted by Man-in-the-middle attacks.
Extensions to Telnet provide Transport Layer Security (TLS) security and Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) authentication that address the above concerns. However, most Telnet implementations do not support these extensions; and they do not address other vulnerabilities such as parsing the banner information. Telnet over VPN is a viable option if SSHv2 is not supported, or a VPN is already used to securely tunnel other application data to the remote network the Telnet server is present in. However, precautions must be taken: ideally the VPN should terminate on the Telnet server itself, unless the LAN has additional security measures against eavesdropping and modification by other devices such as additional encryption and/or VLANs. This is because Telnet traffic leaves the VPN server in its insecure plaintext form after it is decrypted. The VPN software should be a trusted one that is heavily audited (e.g. OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPsec), using preferably certificate-based/public key mutual authentication.

IBM 5250 or 3270 workstation emulation is supported via custom telnet clients, TN5250/TN3270, and IBM i systems. Clients and servers designed to pass IBM 5250 data streams over Telnet generally do support SSL encryption, as SSH does not include 5250 emulation. Under IBM i (also known as OS/400), port 992 is the default port for TelnetS (Telnet over SSL/TLS).

== Uses ==
=== Historical uses ===
Historically, Telnet provided access to a command-line interface on a remote host. However, because of serious security concerns when using Telnet over an open network such as the Internet, its use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of SSH. The usage of Telnet for remote management has declined rapidly, especially on the public Internet, in favor of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. SSH provides much of the functionality of telnet, with the addition of strong encryption to prevent sensitive data such as passwords from being intercepted, and public key authentication, to ensure that the remote computer is actually who it claims to be.

=== Modern day uses ===
The Telnet client may be used in debugging network services such as SMTP, IRC, HTTP, FTP or POP3, to issue commands to a server and examine the responses. For example, Telnet client applications can establish an interactive TCP session to a port other than the Telnet server port. However, communication with such ports does not involve the Telnet protocol, because these services merely use a transparent 8-bit TCP connection, because most elements of the telnet protocol were designed around the idea of accessing a command line interface and none of these options or mechanisms is employed in most other internet service connections.

For example, a command line telnet client could make an HTTP request to a web server on TCP port 80 as follows:
$ telnet www.example.com 80
GET /path/to/file.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Connection: close
The older protocol is used these days only in rare cases to access decades-old legacy equipment that does not support more modern protocols. For example, a large number of industrial and scientific devices only have Telnet available as a communication option. Some are built with only a standard RS-232 port and use a serial server hardware appliance to provide the translation between the TCP/Telnet data and the RS-232 serial data. In such cases, SSH is not an option unless the interface appliance can be configured for SSH (or is replaced with one supporting SSH). 

Telnet is commonly used by amateur radio operators for providing public information.

Despite recommendation against it, security researchers estimated that 7,096,465 exposed systems on the Internet continue to use Telnet as of 2021. However, estimates of this number have varied significantly, depending on the number of ports scanned beyond the default TCP port 23.

== Technical details ==
The technical details of Telnet are defined by a variety of specifications including .

=== USASCII control codes ===
=== Telnet commands ===
Telnet commands consist of at least two bytes. The first byte is the IAC escape character (typically byte 255) followed by the byte code for a given command:
==== Interpret As Command ====
All data octets except 0xff are transmitted over Telnet as is.
(0xff, or 255 in decimal, is the IAC byte (Interpret As Command) which signals that the next byte is a telnet command. The command to insert 0xff into the stream is 0xff, so 0xff must be escaped by doubling it when sending data over the telnet protocol.)

=== Telnet options ===
Telnet also has a variety of options that terminals implementing Telnet should support.
==Telnet clients==
* AbsoluteTelnet is a telnet client for Windows. It also supports SSH and SFTP.
* Inetutils includes a telnet client and server and is installed by default on many Linux distributions.
* Line Mode Browser, a command line web browser
* NCSA Telnet
* PuTTY and plink command line are a free, open-source SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw TCP client for Windows, Linux, and Unix.
