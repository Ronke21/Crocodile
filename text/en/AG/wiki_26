<text>A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. It is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. It is composed of semiconductor material, usually with at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor&#x27;s terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more in miniature form are found embedded in integrated circuits. Because transistors are the key active components in practically all modern electronics, many people consider them one of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest inventions.

Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field-effect transistor (FET) in 1925, but it was not possible to construct a working device at that time. The first working device was a point-contact transistor invented in 1947 by physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement. The most widely used type of transistor, the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960. Transistors revolutionized the field of electronics and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios, calculators, computers, and other electronic devices.

Most transistors are made from very pure silicon, and some from germanium, but certain other semiconductor materials are sometimes used. A transistor may have only one kind of charge carrier in a field-effect transistor, or may have two kinds of charge carriers in bipolar junction transistor devices. Compared with the vacuum tube, transistors are generally smaller and require less power to operate. Certain vacuum tubes have advantages over transistors at very high operating frequencies or high operating voltages, such as Traveling-wave tubes and Gyrotrons. Many types of transistors are made to standardized specifications by multiple manufacturers.

==History==
The thermionic triode, a vacuum tube invented in 1907, enabled amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony. The triode, however, was a fragile device that consumed a substantial amount of power. In 1909, physicist William Eccles discovered the crystal diode oscillator. Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld filed a patent for a field-effect transistor (FET) in Canada in 1925, intended as a solid-state replacement for the triode. He filed identical patents in the United States in 1926 and 1928. However, he did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of high-quality semiconductor materials was still decades away, Lilienfeld&#x27;s solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built. In 1934, inventor Oskar Heil patented a similar device in Europe.

===Bipolar transistors===

From November 17 to December 23, 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input. Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors. The term &quot;transistor&quot; was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term &quot;transresistance&quot;. According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch, Shockley proposed that Bell Labs&#x27; first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor. Having unearthed Lilienfeld&#x27;s patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley&#x27;s proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a &quot;grid&quot; was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor. To acknowledge this accomplishment, Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain jointly received the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect&quot;.

Shockley&#x27;s team initially attempted to build a field-effect transistor (FET) by trying to modulate the conductivity of a semiconductor, but was unsuccessful, mainly due to problems with the surface states, the dangling bond, and the germanium and copper compound materials. Trying to understand the mysterious reasons behind this failure led them instead to invent the bipolar point-contact and junction transistors.

In 1948, the point-contact transistor was independently invented by physicists Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker while working at the &quot;Compagnie des Freins et Signaux Westinghouse&quot;, a Westinghouse subsidiary in Paris. Mataré had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from silicon and germanium in the German radar effort during World War II. With this knowledge, he began researching the phenomenon of &quot;interference&quot; in 1947. By June 1948, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, he produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947. Realizing that Bell Labs&#x27; scientists had already invented the transistor, the company rushed to get its &quot;transistron&quot; into production for amplified use in France&#x27;s telephone network, filing his first transistor patent application on August 13, 1948.

The first bipolar junction transistors were invented by Bell Labs&#x27; William Shockley, who applied for patent (2,569,347) on June 26, 1948. On April 12, 1950, Bell Labs chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks successfully produced a working bipolar NPN junction amplifying germanium transistor. Bell announced the discovery of this new &quot;sandwich&quot; transistor in a press release on July 4, 1951.

The first high-frequency transistor was the surface-barrier germanium transistor developed by Philco in 1953, capable of operating at frequencies up to . They were made by etching depressions into an n-type germanium base from both sides with jets of indium(III) sulfate until it was a few ten-thousandths of an inch thick. Indium electroplated into the depressions formed the collector and emitter.

AT&amp;T first used transistors in telecommunications equipment in the No. 4A Toll Crossbar Switching System in 1953, for selecting trunk circuits from routing information encoded on translator cards. Its predecessor, the Western Electric No. 3A phototransistor, read the mechanical encoding from punched metal cards.

The first prototype pocket transistor radio was shown by INTERMETALL, a company founded by Herbert Mataré in 1952, at the &quot;Internationale Funkausstellung Düsseldorf&quot; from August 29 to September 6, 1953. The first production-model pocket transistor radio was the Regency TR-1, released in October 1954. Produced as a joint venture between the Regency Division of Industrial Development Engineering Associates, I.D.E.A. and Texas Instruments of Dallas, Texas, the TR-1 was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was a near pocket-sized radio with four transistors and one germanium diode. The industrial design was outsourced to the Chicago firm of Painter, Teague and Petertil. It was initially released in one of six colours: black, ivory, mandarin red, cloud grey, mahogany and olive green. Other colours shortly followed.

The first production all-transistor car radio was developed by Chrysler and Philco corporations and was announced in the April 28, 1955, edition of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Chrysler made the Mopar model 914HR available as an option starting in fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, which reached dealership showrooms on October 21, 1955.

The Sony TR-63, released in 1957, was the first mass-produced transistor radio, leading to the widespread adoption of transistor radios. Seven million TR-63s were sold worldwide by the mid-1960s. Sony&#x27;s success with transistor radios led to transistors replacing vacuum tubes as the dominant electronic technology in the late 1950s.

The first working silicon transistor was developed at Bell Labs on January 26, 1954, by Morris Tanenbaum. The first production commercial silicon transistor was announced by Texas Instruments in May 1954. This was the work of Gordon Teal, an expert in growing crystals of high purity, who had previously worked at Bell Labs.

===Field-effect transistors===

The basic principle of the field-effect transistor (FET) was first proposed by physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld when he filed a patent for a device similar to MESFET in 1926, and for an insulated-gate field-effect transistor in 1928. The FET concept was later also theorized by engineer Oskar Heil in the 1930s and by William Shockley in the 1940s.

In 1945, JFET was patented by Heinrich Welker. Following Shockley&#x27;s theoretical treatment on JFET in 1952, a working practical JFET was made in 1953 by George C. Dacey and Ian M. Ross.

In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented the progenitor of MOSFET at Bell Labs, an insulated-gate FET (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Bardeen&#x27;s patent, and the concept of an inversion layer, forms the basis of CMOS and DRAM technology today.

In the early years of the semiconductor industry, companies focused on the junction transistor, a relatively bulky device that was difficult to mass-produce, limiting it to several specialized applications. Field-effect transistors (FETs) were theorized as potential alternatives, but researchers could not get them to work properly, largely due to the surface state barrier that prevented the external electric field from penetrating the material.

===MOSFET (MOS transistor)===

In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects. By 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field effect transistors; the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. They showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer. After this, J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, fabricated a high quality Si/SiO2 stack and published their results in 1960.

Following this research, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959 and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960. Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device. With its high scalability, much lower power consumption, and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits, allowing the integration of more than 10,000 transistors in a single IC.

Bardeen and Brattain&#x27;s 1948 inversion layer concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today. The CMOS (complementary MOS) was invented by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963. The first report of a floating-gate MOSFET was made by Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze in 1967.

In 1967, Bell Labs researchers Robert Kerwin, Donald Klein and John Sarace developed the self-aligned gate (silicon-gate) MOS transistor, which Fairchild Semiconductor researchers Federico Faggin and Tom Klein used to develop the first silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit.

A double-gate MOSFET was first demonstrated in 1984 by Electrotechnical Laboratory researchers Toshihiro Sekigawa and Yutaka Hayashi. The FinFET (fin field-effect transistor), a type of 3D non-planar multi-gate MOSFET, originated from the research of Digh Hisamoto and his team at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory in 1989.

==Importance==
Because transistors are the key active components in practically all modern electronics, many people consider them one of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest inventions.

The invention of the first transistor at Bell Labs was named an IEEE Milestone in 2009. Other Milestones include the inventions of the junction transistor in 1948 and the MOSFET in 1959.

The MOSFET is by far the most widely used transistor, in applications ranging from computers and electronics to communications technology such as smartphones. It has been considered the most important transistor, possibly the most important invention in electronics, and the device that enabled modern electronics. It has been the basis of modern digital electronics since the late 20th century, paving the way for the digital age. The US Patent and Trademark Office calls it a &quot;groundbreaking invention that transformed life and culture around the world&quot;. Its ability to be mass-produced by a highly automated process (semiconductor device fabrication), from relatively basic materials, allows astonishingly low per-transistor costs. MOSFETs are the most numerously produced artificial objects in history, with more than 13 sextillion manufactured by 2018. 

Although several companies each produce over a billion individually packaged (known as &quot;discrete&quot;) MOS transistors every year, the vast majority are produced in integrated circuits (also known as &quot;ICs&quot;, &quot;microchips,&quot; or simply &quot;chips&quot;), along with diodes, resistors, capacitors and other electronic components, to produce complete electronic circuits. A logic gate consists of up to about 20 transistors, whereas an advanced microprocessor, as of 2023, may contain as many as 134 billion transistors (and for exceptional chips, 2.6 trillion transistors, as of 2020). Transistors are often organized into logic gates in microprocessors to perform computation.

The transistor&#x27;s low cost, flexibility and reliability have made it ubiquitous. Transistorized mechatronic circuits have replaced electromechanical devices in controlling appliances and machinery. It is often easier and cheaper to use a standard microcontroller and write a computer program to carry out a control function than to design an equivalent mechanical system.

==Simplified operation==

A transistor can use a small signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger signal at another pair of terminals, a property called gain. It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, proportional to a weaker input signal, acting as an amplifier. It can also be used as an electrically controlled switch, where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.

There are two types of transistors, with slight differences in how they are used:

* A &quot;bipolar junction transistor (BJT)&quot; has terminals labeled base, collector and emitter. A small current at the base terminal, flowing between the base and the emitter, can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter.

* A &quot;field-effect transistor (FET)&quot; has terminals labeled gate, source and drain. A voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain.

The top image in this section represents a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit. A charge flows between emitter and collector terminals depending on the current in the base. Because the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode, a voltage drop develops between them. The amount of this drop, determined by the transistor&#x27;s material, is referred to as &quot;V&quot;BE. (Base Emitter Voltage)

===Transistor as a switch===

Transistors are commonly used in digital circuits as electronic switches which can be either in an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state, both for high-power applications such as switched-mode power supplies and for low-power applications such as logic gates. Important parameters for this application include the current switched, the voltage handled, and the switching speed, characterized by the rise and fall times.

In a switching circuit, the goal is to simulate, as near as possible, the ideal switch having the properties of an open circuit when off, the short circuit when on, and an instantaneous transition between the two states. Parameters are chosen such that the &quot;off&quot; output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry, the resistance of the transistor in the &quot;on&quot; state is too small to affect circuitry, and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect.

In a grounded-emitter transistor circuit, such as the light-switch circuit shown, as the base voltage rises, the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially. The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from the collector to the emitter. If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero (or near zero), the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance (light bulb) and the supply voltage. This is called &quot;saturation&quot; because the current is flowing from collector to emitter freely. When saturated, the switch is said to be &quot;on&quot;.

The use of bipolar transistors for switching applications requires biasing the transistor so that it operates between its cut-off region in the off-state and the saturation region (&quot;on&quot;). This requires sufficient base drive current. As the transistor provides current gain, it facilitates the switching of a relatively large current in the collector by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example of a light-switch circuit, as shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor is saturated. The base resistor value is calculated from the supply voltage, transistor C-E junction voltage drop, collector current, and amplification factor beta.

===Transistor as an amplifier===

The common-emitter amplifier is designed so that a small change in voltage (&quot;V&quot;in) changes the small current through the base of the transistor whose current amplification combined with the properties of the circuit means that small swings in &quot;V&quot;in produce large changes in &quot;V&quot;out.

Various configurations of single transistor amplifiers are possible, with some providing current gain, some voltage gain, and some both.

From mobile phones to televisions, vast numbers of products include amplifiers for sound reproduction, radio transmission, and signal processing. The first discrete-transistor audio amplifiers barely supplied a few hundred milliwatts, but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became available and amplifier architecture evolved.

Modern transistor audio amplifiers of up to a few hundred watts are common and relatively inexpensive.

==Comparison with vacuum tubes==
Before transistors were developed, vacuum (electron) tubes (or in the UK &quot;thermionic valves&quot; or just &quot;valves&quot;) were the main active components in electronic equipment.

===Advantages===
The key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace vacuum tubes in most applications are
* No cathode heater (which produces the characteristic orange glow of tubes), reducing power consumption, eliminating delay as tube heaters warm up, and immune from cathode poisoning and depletion.
* Very small size and weight, reducing equipment size.
* Large numbers of extremely small transistors can be manufactured as a single integrated circuit.
* Low operating voltages compatible with batteries of only a few cells.
* Circuits with greater energy efficiency are usually possible. For low-power applications (for example, voltage amplification) in particular, energy consumption can be very much less than for tubes.
* Complementary devices available, providing design flexibility including complementary-symmetry circuits, not possible with vacuum tubes.
* Very low sensitivity to mechanical shock and vibration, providing physical ruggedness and virtually eliminating shock-induced spurious signals (for example, microphonics in audio applications).
* Not susceptible to breakage of a glass envelope, leakage, outgassing, and other physical damage.

===Limitations===
Transistors may have the following limitations:

* They lack the higher electron mobility afforded by the vacuum of vacuum tubes, which is desirable for high-power, high-frequency operation such as that used in some over-the-air television transmitters and in travelling-wave tubes used as amplifiers in some satellites
* Transistors and other solid-state devices are susceptible to damage from very brief electrical and thermal events, including electrostatic discharge in handling. Vacuum tubes are electrically much more rugged.
* They are sensitive to radiation and cosmic rays (special radiation-hardened chips are used for spacecraft devices).
* In audio applications, transistors lack the lower-harmonic distortion the so-called tube sound which is characteristic of vacuum tubes, and is preferred by some.

Hence, a particular transistor may be described as &quot;silicon, surface-mount, BJT, NPN, low-power, high-frequency switch&quot;.

===Mnemonics===
Convenient mnemonic to remember the type of transistor (represented by an electrical symbol) involves the direction of the arrow. For the BJT, on an n–p–n transistor symbol, the arrow will &quot;Not Point iN&quot;. On a p–n–p transistor symbol, the arrow &quot;Points iN Proudly&quot;. However, this does not apply to MOSFET-based transistor symbols as the arrow is typically reversed (i.e. the arrow for the n–p–n points inside).

===Field-effect transistor (FET)===

The &quot;field-effect transistor&quot;, sometimes called a &quot;unipolar transistor&quot;, uses either electrons (in &quot;n-channel FET&quot;) or holes (in &quot;p-channel FET&quot;) for conduction. The four terminals of the FET are named &quot;source&quot;, &quot;gate&quot;, &quot;drain&quot;, and &quot;body&quot; (&quot;substrate&quot;). On most FETs, the body is connected to the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.

In a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the &quot;source&quot; region to the &quot;drain&quot; region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals, hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source. As the gate–source voltage () is increased, the drain–source current () increases exponentially for below threshold, and then at a roughly quadratic rate: (, where is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins) in the &quot;space-charge-limited&quot; region above threshold. A quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices, for example, at the 65 nm technology node.

For low noise at narrow bandwidth, the higher input resistance of the FET is advantageous.

FETs are divided into two families: &quot;junction FET&quot; (JFET) and &quot;insulated gate FET&quot; (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a &quot;metal–oxide–semiconductor FET&quot; (MOSFET), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a p–n diode with the channel which lies between the source and drains. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, both devices operate in the &quot;depletion-mode&quot;, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage.

Metal–semiconductor FETs (MESFETs) are JFETs in which the reverse biased p–n junction is replaced by a metal–semiconductor junction. These, and the HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors, or HFETs), in which a two-dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport, are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies (several GHz).

FETs are further divided into &quot;depletion-mode&quot; and &quot;enhancement-mode&quot; types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage. For enhancement mode, the channel is off at zero bias, and a gate potential can &quot;enhance&quot; the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can &quot;deplete&quot; the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices, while most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.

====Metal–oxide–semiconductor FET (MOSFET)====

The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET), also known as the metal–oxide–silicon transistor (MOS transistor, or MOS), is a type of field-effect transistor that is fabricated by the controlled oxidation of a semiconductor, typically silicon. It has an insulated gate, whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor, and the basic building block of most modern electronics. The MOSFET accounts for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.

===Bipolar junction transistor (BJT)===

Bipolar transistors are so named because they conduct by using both majority and minority carriers. The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, is a combination of two junction diodes and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an n–p–n transistor), or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a p–n–p transistor). This construction produces two p–n junctions: a base-emitter junction and a base-collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region. (Two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor.)

BJTs have three terminals, corresponding to the three layers of semiconductor—an &quot;emitter&quot;, a &quot;base&quot;, and a &quot;collector&quot;. They are useful in amplifiers because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current. In an n–p–n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter-base junction is forward-biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and the base-collector junction is reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from, the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased base-collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. As well, as the base is lightly doped (in comparison to the emitter and collector regions), recombination rates are low, permitting more carriers to diffuse across the base region. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled. Collector current is approximately β (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.

Unlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low-input-impedance device. Also, as the base-emitter voltage (&quot;V&quot;BE) is increased the base-emitter current and hence the collector-emitter current (&quot;I&quot;CE) increase exponentially according to the Shockley diode model and the Ebers-Moll model. Because of this exponential relationship, the BJT has a higher transconductance than the FET.

Bipolar transistors can be made to conduct by exposure to light because the absorption of photons in the base region generates a photocurrent that acts as a base current; the collector current is approximately β times the photocurrent. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called phototransistors.
===Usage of MOSFETs and BJTs===
The MOSFET is by far the most widely used transistor for both digital circuits as well as analog circuits, accounting for 99.9% of all transistors in the world. The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) was previously the most commonly used transistor during the 1950s to 1960s. Even after MOSFETs became widely available in the 1970s, the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity, up until MOSFET devices (such as power MOSFETs, LDMOS and RF CMOS) replaced them for most power electronic applications in the 1980s. In integrated circuits, the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits in the 1970s. Discrete MOSFETs (typically power MOSFETs) can be applied in transistor applications, including analog circuits, voltage regulators, amplifiers, power transmitters, and motor drivers.

Power diodes are often connected between certain terminals depending on specific use. IGBTs are particularly suitable for heavy-duty industrial applications. The ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) &quot;5SNA2400E170100&quot; , intended for three-phase power supplies, houses three n–p–n IGBTs in a case measuring 38 by 140 by 190 mm and weighing 1.5 kg. Each IGBT is rated at 1,700 volts and can handle 2,400 amperes
** Phototransistor.
** Emitter-switched bipolar transistor (ESBT) is a monolithic configuration of a high-voltage bipolar transistor and a low-voltage power MOSFET in cascode topology. It was introduced by STMicroelectronics in the 2000s, and abandoned a few years later around 2012.
** Multiple-emitter transistor, used in transistor–transistor logic and integrated current mirrors
** Multiple-base transistor, used to amplify very-low-level signals in noisy environments such as the pickup of a record player or radio front ends. Effectively, it is a very large number of transistors in parallel where, at the output, the signal is added constructively, but random noise is added only stochastically.
* Tunnel field-effect transistor, where it switches by modulating quantum tunneling through a barrier.
* Diffusion transistor, formed by diffusing dopants into semiconductor substrate; can be both BJT and FET.
* Unijunction transistor, which can be used as a simple pulse generator. It comprises the main body of either p-type or n-type semiconductor with ohmic contacts at each end (terminals &quot;Base1&quot; and &quot;Base2&quot;). A junction with the opposite semiconductor type is formed at a point along the length of the body for the third terminal (&quot;Emitter&quot;).
* Single-electron transistors (SET), consist of a gate island between two tunneling junctions. The tunneling current is controlled by a voltage applied to the gate through a capacitor.
* Nanofluidic transistor, controls the movement of ions through sub-microscopic, water-filled channels.
* Multigate devices:
** Tetrode transistor
** Pentode transistor
** Trigate transistor (prototype by Intel)
** Dual-gate field-effect transistors have a single channel with two gates in cascode, a configuration optimized for &quot;high-frequency amplifiers&quot;, &quot;mixers&quot;, and oscillators.
* Junctionless nanowire transistor (JNT), uses a simple nanowire of silicon surrounded by an electrically isolated &quot;wedding ring&quot; that acts to gate the flow of electrons through the wire. 
* Nanoscale vacuum-channel transistor, when in 2012, NASA and the National Nanofab Center in South Korea were reported to have built a prototype vacuum-channel transistor in only 150 nanometers in size, can be manufactured cheaply using standard silicon semiconductor processing, can operate at high speeds even in hostile environments, and could consume just as much power as a standard transistor.
* Organic electrochemical transistor.
* Solaristor (from solar cell transistor), a two-terminal gate-less self-powered phototransistor.
* Germanium–Tin Transistor
* Wood transistor
* Paper transistor
* Carbon-doped silicon–germanium (Si–Ge:C) transistor
* Diamond transistor
* Aluminum nitride transistor
* Super-lattice castellated field effect transistors

==Device identification==
Three major identification standards are used for designating transistor devices. In each, the alphanumeric prefix provides clues to the type of the device.

===Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC)===
The JEDEC part numbering scheme evolved in the 1960s in the United States. The JEDEC &quot;EIA-370&quot; transistor device numbers usually start with &quot;2N&quot;, indicating a three-terminal device. Dual-gate field-effect transistors are four-terminal devices, and begin with 3N. The prefix is followed by a two-, three- or four-digit number with no significance as to device properties, although early devices with low numbers tend to be germanium devices. For example, 2N3055 is a silicon n–p–n power transistor, 2N1301 is a p–n–p germanium switching transistor. A letter suffix, such as &quot;A&quot;, is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.

===Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS)===
In Japan, the JIS semiconductor designation (|JIS-C-7012), labels transistor devices starting with &quot;2S&quot;, e.g., 2SD965, but sometimes the &quot;2S&quot; prefix is not marked on the package–a 2SD965 might only be marked &quot;D965&quot; and a 2SC1815 might be listed by a supplier as simply &quot;C1815&quot;. This series sometimes has suffixes, such as &quot;R&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;BL&quot;, standing for &quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, etc., to denote variants, such as tighter &quot;h&quot;FE (gain) groupings.

===European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA)===
The European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA) uses a numbering scheme that was inherited from Pro Electron when it merged with EECA in 1983. This scheme begins with two letters: the first gives the semiconductor type (A for germanium, B for silicon, and C for materials like GaAs); the second letter denotes the intended use (A for diode, C for general-purpose transistor, etc.). A three-digit sequence number (or one letter and two digits, for industrial types) follows. With early devices this indicated the case type. Suffixes may be used, with a letter (e.g. &quot;C&quot; often means high &quot;h&quot;FE, such as in: BC549C) or other codes may follow to show gain (e.g. BC327-25) or voltage rating (e.g. BUK854-800A). The more common prefixes are:

===Proprietary===
Manufacturers of devices may have their proprietary numbering system, for example CK722. Since devices are second-sourced, a manufacturer&#x27;s prefix (like &quot;MPF&quot; in MPF102, which originally would denote a Motorola FET) now is an unreliable indicator of who made the device. Some proprietary naming schemes adopt parts of other naming schemes, for example, a PN2222A is a (possibly Fairchild Semiconductor) 2N2222A in a plastic case (but a PN108 is a plastic version of a BC108, not a 2N108, while the PN100 is unrelated to other xx100 devices).

Military part numbers sometimes are assigned their codes, such as the British Military CV Naming System.

Manufacturers buying large numbers of similar parts may have them supplied with &quot;house numbers&quot;, identifying a particular purchasing specification and not necessarily a device with a standardized registered number. For example, an HP part 1854,0053 is a (JEDEC) 2N2218 transistor which is also assigned the CV number: CV7763

===Naming problems===
With so many independent naming schemes, and the abbreviation of part numbers when printed on the devices, ambiguity sometimes occurs. For example, two different devices may be marked &quot;J176&quot; (one the J176 low-power JFET, the other the higher-powered MOSFET 2SJ176).

As older &quot;through-hole&quot; transistors are given surface-mount packaged counterparts, they tend to be assigned many different part numbers because manufacturers have their systems to cope with the variety in pinout arrangements and options for dual or matched n–p–n + p–n–p devices in one pack. So even when the original device (such as a 2N3904) may have been assigned by a standards authority, and well known by engineers over the years, the new versions are far from standardized in their naming.

==Construction==
===Semiconductor material===
The first BJTs were made from germanium (Ge). Silicon (Si) types currently predominate but certain advanced microwave and high-performance versions now employ the &quot;compound semiconductor&quot; material gallium arsenide (GaAs) and the &quot;semiconductor alloy&quot; silicon–germanium (SiGe). Single-element semiconductor material (Ge and Si) is described as &quot;elemental&quot;.

Rough parameters for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given in the adjacent table. These parameters will vary with an increase in temperature, electric field, impurity level, strain, and sundry other factors.

The &quot;junction forward voltage&quot; is the voltage applied to the emitter-base junction of a BJT to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to &quot;drive&quot; the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with an increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction, the change is −2.1 mV/°C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes.

The density of mobile carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is a function of the electric field forming the channel and of various other phenomena such as the impurity level in the channel. Some impurities, called dopants, are introduced deliberately in making a MOSFET, to control the MOSFET electrical behavior.

The &quot;electron mobility&quot; and &quot;hole mobility&quot; columns show the average speed that electrons and holes diffuse through the semiconductor material with an electric field of 1 volt per meter applied across the material. In general, the higher the electron mobility the faster the transistor can operate. The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect. However, Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium arsenide:
# Its maximum temperature is limited.
# It has relatively high leakage current.
# It cannot withstand high voltages.
# It is less suitable for fabricating integrated circuits.
Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the &quot;high-electron-mobility transistor&quot; (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.

Maximum junction temperature values represent a cross-section taken from various manufacturers&#x27; datasheets. This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be damaged.

&quot;Al–Si junction&quot; refers to the high-speed (aluminum-silicon) metal–semiconductor barrier diode, commonly known as a Schottky diode. This is included in the table because some silicon power IGFETs have a parasitic reverse Schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication process. This diode can be a nuisance, but sometimes it is used in the circuit.

===Packaging===

Discrete transistors can be individually packaged transistors or unpackaged transistor chips.

Transistors come in many different semiconductor packages (see image). The two main categories are &quot;through-hole&quot; (or &quot;leaded&quot;), and &quot;surface-mount&quot;, also known as &quot;surface-mount device&quot; (SMD). The &quot;ball grid array&quot; (BGA) is the latest surface-mount package. It has solder &quot;balls&quot; on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power ratings.

Transistor packages are made of glass, metal, ceramic, or plastic. The package often dictates the power rating and frequency characteristics. Power transistors have larger packages that can be clamped to heat sinks for enhanced cooling. Additionally, most power transistors have the collector or drain physically connected to the metal enclosure. At the other extreme, some surface-mount &quot;microwave&quot; transistors are as small as grains of sand.

Often a given transistor type is available in several packages. Transistor packages are mainly standardized, but the assignment of a transistor&#x27;s functions to the terminals is not: other transistor types can assign other functions to the package&#x27;s terminals. Even for the same transistor type the terminal assignment can vary (normally indicated by a suffix letter to the part number, q.e. BC212L and BC212K).

Nowadays most transistors come in a wide range of SMT packages. In comparison, the list of available through-hole packages is relatively small. Here is a short list of the most common through-hole transistors packages in alphabetical order:
ATV, E-line, MRT, HRT, SC-43, SC-72, TO-3, TO-18, TO-39, TO-92, TO-126, TO220, TO247, TO251, TO262, ZTX851.

Unpackaged transistor chips (die) may be assembled into hybrid devices. The IBM SLT module of the 1960s is one example of such a hybrid circuit module using glass passivated transistor (and diode) die. Other packaging techniques for discrete transistors as chips include &quot;direct chip attach&quot; (DCA) and &quot;chip-on-board&quot; (COB).

====Flexible transistors====
Researchers have made several kinds of flexible transistors, including organic field-effect transistors. Flexible transistors are useful in some kinds of flexible displays and other flexible electronics.

<doc id="30012" wikidata="Q11471" url="?curid=30012" title="Time">
<text>Time is the continuous progression of existence that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events (or the intervals between them), and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.

Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second, which is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms. General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.

Throughout history, time has been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science. Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and has been a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (&quot;time is money&quot;) as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day (&quot;&quot;carpe diem&quot;&quot;) and in human life spans.

== Definition ==

The concept of time can be complex. Multiple notions exist and defining time in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars. Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems. Traditional definitions of time involved the observation of periodic motion such as the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, and the passage of a free-swinging pendulum. More modern systems include the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. Although these systems differ from one another, with careful measurements they can be synchronized.

In physics, time is a fundamental concept to define other quantities, such as velocity. To avoid a circular definition, time in physics is operationally defined as &quot;what a clock reads&quot;, specifically a count of repeating events such as the SI second. Although this aids in practical measurements, it does not address the essence of time. Physicists developed the concept of the spacetime continuum, where events are assigned four coordinates: three for space and one for time. Events like particle collisions, supernovas, or rocket launches have coordinates that may vary for different observers, making concepts like &quot;now&quot; and &quot;here&quot; relative. In general relativity, these coordinates do not directly correspond to the causal structure of events. Instead, the spacetime interval is calculated and classified as either space-like or time-like, depending on whether an observer exists that would say the events are separated by space or by time. Since the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers—a fact first publicly demonstrated by the Michelson–Morley experiment—all observers will consistently agree on this definition of time as a causal relation.

General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. In quantum mechanics, time is treated as a universal and absolute parameter, differing from general relativity&#x27;s notion of independent clocks. The problem of time consists of reconciling these two theories. As of 2024, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.

== Measurement ==
Methods of temporal measurement, or chronometry, generally take two forms. The first is a calendar, a mathematical tool for organising intervals of time on Earth, consulted for periods longer than a day. The second is a clock, a physical mechanism that indicates the passage of time, consulted for periods less than a day. The combined measurement marks a specific moment in time from a reference point, or &quot;epoch&quot;.

=== History of the calendar ===
Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago. Lunar calendars were among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 lunar months (either 354 or 384 days). Without intercalation to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years.

Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization, in which they developed the Maya calendar, consisting of multiple interrelated calendars. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based; the Haab&#x27; calendar has 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five epagomenal days at the end of the year. In conjunction, the Maya also used a 260-day sacred calendar called the Tzolk&#x27;in.

The reforms of Julius Caesar in 45 BC put the Roman world on a solar calendar. This Julian calendar was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical solstices and equinoxes to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. Pope Gregory XIII introduced a correction in 1582; the Gregorian calendar was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the world.

During the French Revolution, a new clock and calendar were invented as part of the dechristianization of France and to create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The French Republican Calendar&#x27;s days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 (duodecimal) system used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was abolished in 1806.

=== History of other devices ===

A large variety of devices have been invented to measure time. The study of these devices is called horology. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means.

A sundial is any device that uses the direction of sunlight to cast shadows from a gnomon onto a set of markings calibrated to indicate the local time, usually to the hour. The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night. Obelisks made as a gnomon were built as early as . An Egyptian device that dates to , similar in shape to a bent T-square, also measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a nonlinear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.

Alarm clocks reportedly first appeared in ancient Greece with a water clock made by Plato that would set off a whistle. The hydraulic alarm worked by gradually filling a series of vessels with water. After some time, the water emptied out of a siphon. Inventor Ctesibius revised Plato&#x27;s design; the water clock uses a float as the power drive system and uses a sundial to correct the water flow rate.

In medieval philosophical writings, the atom was a unit of time referred to as the smallest possible division of time. The earliest known occurrence in English is in Byrhtferth&#x27;s &quot;Enchiridion&quot; (a science text) of 1010–1012, where it was defined as 1/564 of a &quot;momentum&quot; (1 minutes), and thus equal to 15/94 of a second. It was used in the &quot;computus&quot;, the process of calculating the date of Easter. The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the water clock, or &quot;clepsydra&quot;, one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I. They could be used to measure the hours even at night but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The ancient Greeks and the people from Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers, in particular, made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, Chinese inventors and engineers invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an escapement mechanism.
Incense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in temples and churches across the globe. Water clocks, and, later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. The passage of the hours at sea can also be marked by bell. The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea. Richard of Wallingford (1292–1336), abbot of St. Alban&#x27;s abbey, famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical orrery about 1330. The hourglass uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time. They were also used in navigation. Ferdinand Magellan used 18 glasses on each ship for his circumnavigation of the globe (1522). The English word clock probably comes from the Middle Dutch word &quot;klocke&quot; which, in turn, derives from the medieval Latin word &quot;clocca&quot;, which ultimately derives from Celtic and is cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean bell.

Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by Galileo Galilei and especially Christiaan Huygens with the invention of pendulum-driven clocks along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi. There is also a clock that was designed to keep time for 10,000 years called the Clock of the Long Now. Alarm clock devices were later mechanized. Levi Hutchins alarm clock has been credited as the first American alarm clock, though it can only ring at 4 a.m. Antoine Redier was also credited as the first person to patent an adjustable mechanical alarm clock in 1847. Digital forms of alarm clocks became more accessible through digitization and integration with other technologies, such as smartphones.

The most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years, and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments. Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the atoms used is caesium; most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations. Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. A portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards is called a chronometer. Initially, the term was used to refer to the marine chronometer, a timepiece used to determine longitude by means of celestial navigation, a precision first achieved by John Harrison. More recently, the term has also been applied to the chronometer watch, a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency COSC.

In modern times, the Global Positioning System in coordination with the Network Time Protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe. , the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 12 attoseconds (1.2 × 10−17 seconds), about 3.7 × 1026 Planck times. The time measured was the delay caused by out-of-sync electron waves&#x27; interference patterns.

=== Units ===
The second (s) is the SI base unit. A minute (min) is 60 seconds in length (or, rarely, 59 or 61 seconds when leap seconds are employed), and an hour is 60 minutes or 3600 seconds in length. A day is usually 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length; however, the duration of a calendar day can vary due to daylight saving time and leap seconds.

== Time standards ==
A time standard is a specification for measuring time: assigning a number or calendar date to an instant (point in time), quantifying the duration of a time interval, and establishing a chronology (ordering of events). In modern times, several time specifications have been officially recognized as standards, where formerly they were matters of custom and practice. The invention in 1955 of the caesium atomic clock has led to the replacement of older and purely astronomical time standards such as sidereal time and ephemeris time, for most practical purposes, by newer time standards based wholly or partly on atomic time using the SI second.

International Atomic Time (TAI) is the primary international time standard from which other time standards are calculated. Universal Time (UT1) is mean solar time at 0° longitude, computed from astronomical observations. It varies from TAI because of the irregularities in Earth&#x27;s rotation. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is an atomic time scale designed to approximate Universal Time. UTC differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds. UTC is kept within 0.9 second of UT1 by the introduction of one-second steps to UTC, the leap second. The Global Positioning System broadcasts a very precise time signal based on UTC time.

The surface of the Earth is split into a number of time zones. Standard time or civil time in a time zone deviates a fixed, round amount, usually a whole number of hours, from some form of Universal Time, usually UTC. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from UTC. For example, time zones at sea are based on UTC. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to daylight saving time transitions.

Some other time standards are used mainly for scientific work. Terrestrial Time is a theoretical ideal scale realized by TAI. Geocentric Coordinate Time and Barycentric Coordinate Time are scales defined as coordinate times in the context of the general theory of relativity, with TCG applying to Earth&#x27;s center and TCB to the solar system&#x27;s barycenter. Barycentric Dynamical Time is an older relativistic scale related to TCB that is still in use.

== Philosophy ==

=== Religion ===

==== Cyclical views of time ====

Many ancient cultures, particularly in the East, had a cyclical view of time. In these traditions, time was often seen as a recurring pattern of ages or cycles, where events and phenomena repeated themselves in a predictable manner. One of the most famous examples of this concept is found in Hindu philosophy, where time is depicted as a wheel called the &quot;Kalachakra&quot; or &quot;Wheel of Time.&quot; According to this belief, the universe undergoes endless cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction.

Similarly, in other ancient cultures such as those of the Mayans, Aztecs, and Chinese, there were also beliefs in cyclical time, often associated with astronomical observations and calendars. These cultures developed complex systems to track time, seasons, and celestial movements, reflecting their understanding of cyclical patterns in nature and the universe.

The cyclical view of time contrasts with the linear concept of time more common in Western thought, where time is seen as progressing in a straight line from past to future without repetition.

==== Time in Abrahamic religions ====
In general, the Islamic and Judeo-Christian world-view regards time as linear and directional, beginning with the act of creation by God. The traditional Christian view sees time ending, teleologically, with the eschatological end of the present order of things, the &quot;end time&quot;. Though some Christian theologians (such as Augustine of Hippo and Aquinas) believe that God is outside of time, seeing all events simultaneously, that time did not exist before God, and that God created time.

In the Old Testament book Ecclesiastes, traditionally ascribed to Solomon (970–928 BC), time (as the Hebrew word עידן, זמן &quot;iddan&quot; (&#x27;age&#x27;, as in &quot;Ice age&quot;) &quot;zĕman&quot;(time) is often translated) is a medium for the passage of predestined events. (Another word, زمان&quot; זמן&quot; &quot;zamān&quot;, meant &quot;time fit for an event&quot;, and is used as the modern Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew equivalent to the English word &quot;time&quot;.)

==== Time in Greek mythology ====
The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, Chronos and Kairos. The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally &quot;the right or opportune moment&quot;, relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.

In Greek mythology, Chronos (ancient Greek: Χρόνος) is identified as the personification of time. His name in Greek means &quot;time&quot; and is alternatively spelled Chronus (Latin spelling) or Khronos. Chronos is usually portrayed as an old, wise man with a long, gray beard, such as &quot;Father Time&quot;. Some English words whose etymological root is khronos/chronos include &quot;chronology&quot;, &quot;chronometer&quot;, &quot;chronic&quot;, &quot;anachronism&quot;, &quot;synchronise&quot;, and &quot;chronicle&quot;.

==== Time in Kabbalah &amp; Rabbinical thought====
Rabbis sometimes saw time like &quot;an accordion that was expanded and collapsed at will.&quot; According to Kabbalists, &quot;time&quot; is a paradox and an illusion.

==== Time in Advaita Vedanta ====
According to Advaita Vedanta, time is integral to the phenomenal world, which lacks independent reality. Time and the phenomenal world are products of &quot;maya&quot;, influenced by our senses, concepts, and imaginations. The phenomenal world, including time, is seen as impermanent and characterized by plurality, suffering, conflict, and division. Since phenomenal existence is dominated by temporality (&quot;kala&quot;), everything within time is subject to change and decay. Overcoming pain and death requires knowledge that transcends temporal existence and reveals its eternal foundation.

=== In Western philosophy ===

Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide prominent philosophers. One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe—a dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. Isaac Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time.

The opposing view is that &quot;time&quot; does not refer to any kind of &quot;container&quot; that events and objects &quot;move through&quot;, nor to any entity that &quot;flows&quot;, but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare events. This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant, holds that &quot;time&quot; is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled. Furthermore, it may be that there is a subjective component to time, but whether or not time itself is &quot;felt&quot;, as a sensation, or is a judgment, is a matter of debate.

In philosophy, time was questioned throughout the centuries; what time is and if it is real or not. Ancient Greek philosophers asked if time was linear or cyclical and if time was endless or . These philosophers had different ways of explaining time; for instance, ancient Indian philosophers had something called the Wheel of Time. It is believed that there was repeating ages over the lifespan of the universe. This led to beliefs like cycles of rebirth and reincarnation. The Greek philosophers believe that the universe was infinite, and was an illusion to humans. Plato believed that time was made by the Creator at the same instant as the heavens. He also says that time is a period of motion of the heavenly bodies. Aristotle believed that time correlated to movement, that time did not exist on its own but was relative to motion of objects. He also believed that time was related to the motion of celestial bodies; the reason that humans can tell time was because of orbital periods and therefore there was a duration on time.

The &quot;Vedas&quot;, the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy dating to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320 million years. Ancient Greek philosophers, including Parmenides and Heraclitus, wrote essays on the nature of time. Plato, in the &quot;Timaeus&quot;, identified time with the period of motion of the heavenly bodies. Aristotle, in Book IV of his &quot;Physica&quot; defined time as &#x27;number of movement in respect of the before and after&#x27;. In Book 11 of his &quot;Confessions&quot;, St. Augustine of Hippo ruminates on the nature of time, asking, &quot;What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.&quot; He begins to define time by what it is not rather than what it is, an approach similar to that taken in other negative definitions. However, Augustine ends up calling time a &quot;distention&quot; of the mind (Confessions 11.26) by which we simultaneously grasp the past in memory, the present by attention, and the future by expectation.

Philosophers in the 17th and 18th century questioned if time was real and absolute, or if it was an intellectual concept that humans use to understand and sequence events. These questions lead to realism vs anti-realism; the realists believed that time is a fundamental part of the universe, and be perceived by events happening in a sequence, in a dimension. Isaac Newton said that we are merely occupying time, he also says that humans can only understand relative time. Isaac Newton believed in absolute space and absolute time; Leibniz believed that time and space are relational. The differences between Leibniz&#x27;s and Newton&#x27;s interpretations came to a head in the famous Leibniz–Clarke correspondence. Relative time is a measurement of objects in motion. The anti-realists believed that time is merely a convenient intellectual concept for humans to understand events. This means that time was useless unless there were objects that it could interact with, this was called relational time. René Descartes, John Locke, and David Hume said that one&#x27;s mind needs to acknowledge time, in order to understand what time is. Immanuel Kant believed that we can not know what something is unless we experience it first hand.
Immanuel Kant, in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, described time as an &quot;a priori&quot; intuition that allows us (together with the other &quot;a priori&quot; intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience. With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, &quot;time&quot; does not refer to any kind of entity that &quot;flows,&quot; that objects &quot;move through,&quot; or that is a &quot;container&quot; for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category.

Henri Bergson believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as &quot;Duration&quot;. Duration, in Bergson&#x27;s view, was creativity and memory as an essential component of reality.

According to Martin Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we &quot;are&quot; time. Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of &quot;having been&quot;, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes &quot;being ahead of oneself&quot; when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future; we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.

Modern era philosophers asked: is time real or unreal, is time happening all at once or a duration, is time tensed or tenseless, and is there a future to be? There is a theory called the tenseless or B-theory; this theory says that any tensed terminology can be replaced with tenseless terminology. For example, &quot;we will win the game&quot; can be replaced with &quot;we do win the game&quot;, taking out the future tense. On the other hand, there is a theory called the tense or A-theory; this theory says that our language has tense verbs for a reason and that the future can not be determined. There is also something called imaginary time, this was from Stephen Hawking, who said that space and imaginary time are finite but have no boundaries. Imaginary time is not real or unreal, it is something that is hard to visualize. Philosophers can agree that physical time exists outside of the human mind and is objective, and psychological time is mind-dependent and subjective.

=== Unreality ===
In 5th century BC Greece, Antiphon the Sophist, in a fragment preserved from his chief work &quot;On Truth&quot;, held that: &quot;Time is not a reality (hypostasis), but a concept (noêma) or a measure (metron).&quot; Parmenides went further, maintaining that time, motion, and change were illusions, leading to the paradoxes of his follower Zeno. Time as an illusion is also a common theme in Buddhist thought.

These arguments often center on what it means for something to be &quot;unreal&quot;. Modern physicists generally believe that time is as &quot;real&quot; as space—though others, such as Julian Barbour, argue quantum equations of the universe take their true form when expressed in the timeless realm containing every possible &quot;now&quot; or momentary configuration of the universe. J. M. E. McTaggart&#x27;s 1908 article &quot;The Unreality of Time&quot; argues that, since every event has the characteristic of being both present and not present (i.e., future or past), that time is a self-contradictory idea.

Another modern philosophical theory called presentism views the past and the future as human-mind interpretations of movement instead of real parts of time (or &quot;dimensions&quot;) which coexist with the present. This theory rejects the existence of all direct interaction with the past or the future, holding only the present as tangible. This is one of the philosophical arguments against time travel. This contrasts with eternalism (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the growing block theory (the present and the past are real, but the future is not).

== Physical definition ==

Until Einstein&#x27;s reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space in 1907, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for any event. Non-relativistic classical mechanics is based on this Newtonian idea of time. Einstein, in his special theory of relativity, postulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all observers. He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.

The theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in Minkowski spacetime, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a light-year is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two events in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an &quot;invariant interval&quot;, which can be either space-like, light-like, or time-like. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any frame of reference, there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the &quot;invariant interval&quot; between the events is independent of the observer and their velocity.

=== Arrow of time ===
Unlike space, where an object can travel in the opposite directions (and in 3 dimensions), time appears to have only one dimension and only one direction—the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet most laws of physics allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. There are only a few physical phenomena that violate the reversibility of time. This time directionality is known as the arrow of time. Acknowledged examples of the arrow of time are:
# Radiative arrow of time, manifested in waves (e.g., light and sound) travelling only expanding (rather than focusing) in time (see light cone);
# Entropic arrow of time: according to the second law of thermodynamics an isolated system evolves toward a larger disorder rather than orders spontaneously;
# Quantum arrow time, which is related to irreversibility of measurement in quantum mechanics according to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics;
# Weak arrow of time: preference for a certain time direction of weak force in particle physics (see violation of CP symmetry);
# Cosmological arrow of time, which follows the accelerated expansion of the Universe after the Big Bang.

The relationships between these different arrows of time is a hotly debated topic in theoretical physics.

The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy must increase over time. Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in a similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.

=== Classical mechanics ===
In non-relativistic classical mechanics, Newton&#x27;s concept of &quot;relative, apparent, and common time&quot; can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people&#x27;s experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. The 1860s Maxwell&#x27;s equations described that light always travels at a constant speed (in a vacuum). However, classical mechanics assumed that motion was measured relative to a fixed reference frame. The Michelson–Morley experiment contradicted the assumption. Einstein later proposed a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the conclusion that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.

=== Spacetime ===

Time has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in Einstein&#x27;s special relativity and general relativity. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the spatial reference frame of the observer, and the human perception, as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks, are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew&#x27;s thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.

On the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship&#x27;s direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew&#x27;s perception of time is different from the stationary observer&#x27;s; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the past is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the future is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.

=== Dilation ===

Einstein showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on cause and effect, measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Subatomic particles exist for a well-known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest.

According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle&#x27;s frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to &quot;slow down&quot; for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or &quot;warped&quot;) by high-speed motion.

Einstein (&quot;The Meaning of Relativity&quot;): &quot;Two events taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously.&quot; Einstein wrote in his book, &quot;Relativity&quot;, that simultaneity is also relative, i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.

According to general relativity, time also runs slower in stronger gravitational fields; this is gravitational time dilation. The effect of the dilation becomes more noticeable in a mass-dense object. A famous example of time dilation is a thought experiment of a subject approaching the event horizon of a black hole. As a consequence of how gravitational fields warp spacetime, the subject will experience gravitational time dilation. From the perspective of the subject itself, they will experience time normally. Meanwhile, an observer from the outside will see the subject move closer to the black hole until the extreme, in which the subject appears &#x27;frozen&#x27; in time and eventually fade to nothingness due to the diminishing amount of light returning.

=== Relativistic versus Newtonian ===
The animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the Galilean and Lorentz transformations applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively. In the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory (&quot;world line&quot;) of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. In both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.

In the Newtonian description these changes are such that &quot;time&quot; is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the &#x27;now&#x27; (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer). However, in the relativistic description the &quot;observability of events&quot; is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the &quot;light cone&quot; of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of &quot;absolute time&quot; is no longer applicable: events move up and down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.

=== Quantization ===
Time quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories (the Standard Model of Particles and Interactions and general relativity) time is not quantized.

Planck time (~ 5.4 × 10−44 seconds) is the unit of time in the system of natural units known as Planck units. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that attempt to describe phenomena at this scale exist; an example is loop quantum gravity.

== Travel ==

Time travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal &quot;flow&quot; of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) &quot;persist&quot; in some way. Time travel has been a plot device in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards or forwards in time has never been verified as a process, and doing so presents many theoretical problems and contradictory logic which to date have not been overcome. Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a time machine.

A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of causality; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a temporal paradox. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between branch points, parallel realities, or universes. The many-worlds interpretation has been used as a way to solve causality paradoxes arising from time travel. Any quantum event creates another branching timeline, and all possible outcomes coexist without any wave function collapse. This interpretation was an alternative but is opposite from the Copenhagen interpretation, which suggests that wave functions do collapse. In science, hypothetical faster-than-light particles are known as tachyons; the mathematics of Einstein&#x27;s relativity suggests that they would have an &quot;imaginary rest mass&quot;. Some interpretations suggest that it might move backward in time. General relativity permits the existence of closed timelike curves, which could allow an observer to travel back in time to the same space. Though for the Gödel metric, such an occurrence requires a globally rotating universe, which has been contradicted by observations of the redshifts of distant galaxies and the cosmic background radiation.

Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, free will either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. A famous example is the grandfather paradox, in which a person is supposed to travel back in time to kill their own grandfather. This would not be possible to enact because it is a historical fact that one&#x27;s grandfather was not killed before his child (one&#x27;s parent) was conceived. This view does not simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in their past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from. The Novikov self-consistency principle asserts that due to causality constraints, time travel to the past is impossible.

== Perception ==

The specious present refers to the time duration wherein one&#x27;s perceptions are considered to be in the present. The experienced present is said to be &#x27;specious&#x27; in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not a durationless instant. The term &quot;specious present&quot; was first introduced by the psychologist E. R. Clay, and later developed by William James.

=== Biopsychology ===
The brain&#x27;s judgment of time is known to be a highly distributed system, including at least the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia as its components. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping. Mental chronometry is the use of response time in perceptual-motor tasks to infer the content, duration, and temporal sequencing of cognitive operations. Judgments of time can be altered by temporal illusions (like the kappa effect), age, psychoactive drugs, and hypnosis. The sense of time is impaired in some people with neurological diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and attention deficit disorder.

Psychoactive drugs can impair the judgment of time. Stimulants can lead both humans and rats to overestimate time intervals, while depressants can have the opposite effect. The level of activity in the brain of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine may be the reason for this. Such chemicals will either excite or inhibit the firing of neurons in the brain, with a greater firing rate allowing the brain to register the occurrence of more events within a given interval (speed up time) and a decreased firing rate reducing the brain&#x27;s capacity to distinguish events occurring within a given interval (slow down time).

Psychologists assert that time seems to go faster with age, but the literature on this age-related perception of time remains controversial. Those who support this notion argue that young people, having more excitatory neurotransmitters, are able to cope with faster external events. Some also argued that the perception of time is also influenced by memory and how much one have experienced; for example, as one get older, they will have spend less part of their total life waiting a month. Meanwhile children&#x27;s expanding cognitive abilities allow them to understand time in a different way. Two- and three-year-olds&#x27; understanding of time is mainly limited to &quot;now and not now&quot;. Five- and six-year-olds can grasp the ideas of past, present, and future. Seven- to ten-year-olds can use clocks and calendars. Socioemotional selectivity theory proposed that when people perceive their time as open-ended and nebulous, they focus more on future-oriented goals.

=== Spatial conceptualization ===
Although time is regarded as an abstract concept, there is increasing evidence that time is conceptualized in the mind in terms of space. That is, instead of thinking about time in a general, abstract way, humans think about time in a spatial way and mentally organize it as such. Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal events in a specific way.

This spatial representation of time is often represented in the mind as a mental timeline (MTL). Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal order. These origins are shaped by many environmental factors—for example, literacy appears to play a large role in the different types of MTLs, as reading/writing direction provides an everyday temporal orientation that differs from culture to culture. In Western cultures, the MTL may unfold rightward (with the past on the left and the future on the right) since people read and write from left to right. Western calendars also continue this trend by placing the past on the left with the future progressing toward the right. Conversely, speakers of Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, and Hebrew read from right to left, and their MTLs unfold leftward (past on the right with future on the left); evidence suggests these speakers organize time events in their minds like this as well.

This linguistic evidence that abstract concepts are based in spatial concepts also reveals that the way humans mentally organize time events varies across cultures—that is, a certain specific mental organization system is not universal. So although Western cultures typically associate past events with the left and future events with the right according to a certain MTL, this kind of MTL is not the spatial organization of all cultures. Although most developed nations use an egocentric spatial system, there is recent evidence that some cultures use an allocentric spatialization, often based on environmental features.

A study of the indigenous Yupno people of Papua New Guinea focused on the directional gestures used when individuals used time-related words. When speaking of the past (such as &quot;last year&quot; or &quot;past times&quot;), individuals gestured downhill, where the river of the valley flowed into the ocean. When speaking of the future, they gestured uphill, toward the source of the river. This was common regardless of which direction the person faced, revealing that the Yupno people may use an allocentric MTL, in which time flows uphill.

A similar study of the Pormpuraawans, an aboriginal group in Australia, revealed a similar distinction in which when asked to organize photos of a man aging &quot;in order,&quot; individuals consistently placed the youngest photos to the east and the oldest photos to the west, regardless of which direction they faced. This directly clashed with an American group that consistently organized the photos from left to right. Therefore, this group also appears to have an allocentric MTL, but based on the cardinal directions instead of geographical features.

The wide array of distinctions in the way different groups think about time leads to the broader question that different groups may also think about other abstract concepts in different ways as well, such as causality and number.

== Use ==
In sociology and anthropology, time discipline is the general name given to social and economic rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the measurement of time, the social currency and awareness of time measurements, and people&#x27;s expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others. Arlie Russell Hochschild and Norbert Elias have written on the use of time from a sociological perspective.

The use of time is an important issue in understanding human behavior, education, and travel behavior. Time-use research is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20–30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.

Time management is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.

== Sequence of events ==
A sequence of events, or series of events, is a sequence of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with causality relationships among the items. Because of causality, cause precedes effect, or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause. A sequence of events can be presented in text, tables, charts, or timelines. The description of the items or events may include a timestamp. A sequence of events that includes the time along with place or location information to describe a sequential path may be referred to as a world line.

Uses of a sequence of events include stories, historical events (chronology), directions and steps in procedures, and timetables for scheduling activities. A sequence of events may also be used to help describe processes in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence of events may be focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., plans, schedules, procedures, timetables), or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes, projections). The use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as machines (cam timer), documentaries (&quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot;), law (choice of law), finance (directional-change intrinsic time), computer simulation (discrete event simulation), and electric power transmission (sequence of events recorder). A specific example of a sequence of events is the timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

<text>Tifinagh (Tuareg Berber language: ; Neo-Tifinagh: ; Berber Latin alphabet: ; ) is a script used to write the Berber languages. Tifinagh is descended from the ancient Libyco-Berber alphabet. The traditional Tifinagh, sometimes called Tuareg Tifinagh, is still favored by the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert in southern Algeria, northeastern Mali, northern Niger, and northern Burkina Faso for writing the Tuareg languages. Neo-Tifinagh is an alphabet developed by the Berber Academy by adopting Tuareg Tifinagh for use for Kabyle; it has been since modified for use across North Africa.

Tifinagh is one of three major competing Berber orthographies alongside the Berber Latin alphabet and the Arabic alphabet. Tifinagh is the official script for Tamazight, an official language of Morocco and Algeria. However, outside of symbolic cultural uses, Latin remains the dominant script for writing Berber languages throughout North Africa.

The ancient Libyco-Berber script was used by the ancient northern Berbers known as Libyco-Berbers, also known as Numidians, Afri, and Mauretanians, who inhabited the northern parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and the Canary Islands.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tifinagh&quot; (singular &quot;tafinəq&quot; &lt; *ta-finəɣ-t) is thought by some scholars to be a Berberized feminine plural cognate or adaptation of the Latin word &quot;Punicus&quot; &#x27;Punic, Phoenician&#x27; through the Berber feminine prefix &quot;ti-&quot; and the root √FNƔ &lt; *√PNQ &lt; Latin &quot;Punicus&quot;; thus &quot;tifinagh&quot; could possibly mean &#x27;the Phoenician (letters)&#x27; or &#x27;the Punic letters&#x27;. Others support an etymology involving the Tuareg verb &quot;efnegh&quot; &#x27;to write&#x27;. However, the Tuareg verb &quot;efnegh&quot; is probably derived from the noun &quot;Tifinagh&quot; because all the northern Berbers of Morocco, northern Algeria, Tunisia and northern Libya have a different (and probably older) verb &quot;ari ~ aru ~ ara&quot; &#x27;to write&#x27;.

==Libyco-Berber==

Before or during the existence of the ancient Berber kingdoms of Numidia (northern Algeria) and Mauretania (northern Morocco), between 202 BCE–25 BCE, many inscriptions were engraved using the Libyco-Berber script, also known as Ancient Libyan (). The Libyco-Berber script is found in thousands of stone inscriptions and engravings throughout Morocco, northern Algeria, Tunisia, northern Libya and the Canary Islands.

The exact evolution of both Libyco-Berber and Tifinagh is still unclear. The latter writing system was widely used in antiquity by speakers of the largely undeciphered Numidian language, also called Old Libyan, throughout Africa and on the Canary Islands. The script&#x27;s origin is uncertain, with some scholars suggesting it is related to, descended or developed from the Phoenician alphabet while others argue an independent conception with slight Phoenician influences. Its first appearance is also uncertain, but it is no older than the first millennium BCE, with the oldest remains likely originating from the 6th century BCE. It disappeared in the northernmost areas of North Africa during the 8th century, after the Arab conquest of the Maghreb, Libyco-Berber along with Latin being replaced by the Arabic script.

The Libyco-Berber script was a pure abjad; it had no vowels. Gemination was not marked. The writing was usually from the bottom to the top, although right-to-left, and even other orders, were also found. The letters took different forms when written vertically than when they were written horizontally.

==Tuareg Tifinagh==

The ancient Libyco-Berber script branched into the Tuareg Tifinagh script which is used to this day to write the Berber Tuareg languages, which belong to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family. Early uses of the script have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres. Among these are the 1,500 year old monumental tomb of the Tuareg matriarch Tin Hinan, where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.

According to M. C. A. MacDonald, the Tuareg are &quot;an entirely oral society in which memory and oral communication perform all the functions which reading and writing have in a literate society ... The Tifinagh are used primarily for games and puzzles, short graffiti and brief messages.&quot;

Occasionally, the script has been used to write other neighbouring languages such as Tagdal, which belongs to a separate Songhay family.

===Orthography===
Common forms of the letters are illustrated at left, including various ligatures of &quot;t&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. Gemination, though phonemic, is not indicated in Tifinagh. The letter &quot;t&quot;, ⵜ, is often combined with a preceding letter to form a ligature. Most of the letters have more than one common form, including mirror-images of the forms shown above.

When the letters &quot;l&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are adjacent to themselves or to each other, the second is offset, either by inclining, lowering, raising, or shortening it. For example, since the letter &quot;l&quot; is a double line, ||, and &quot;n&quot; a single line, |, the sequence &quot;nn&quot; may be written |/ to differentiate it from &quot;l&quot;. Similarly, &quot;ln&quot; is ||/, &quot;nl&quot; |//, &quot;ll&quot; ||//, &quot;nnn&quot; |/|, etc.

Traditionally, the Tifinagh script does not indicate vowels except word-finally, where a single dot stands for any vowel (or ⵢ and ⵓ for -i and -u, respectively, in Ahaggar Tifinagh). In some areas, Arabic vowel diacritics are combined with Tifinagh letters to transcribe vowels, or &quot;y, w&quot; may be used for long &quot;ī&quot; and &quot;ū&quot;.

==Neo-Tifinagh==
=== Development ===
Neo-Tifinagh is the modern fully alphabetic script developed by the Berber Academy, based in Paris.

Initially, the academy had to choose a script to transliterate the Berber language. The choice between Tifinagh and Latin scripts then sparked intense debate both within and outside the Academy.

Mohand Arav Bessaoud, a founding member of the academy and strong Tifinagh advocate, recounted the resistance he faced from prominent figures like Mouloud Mammeri and Ramdane Achab, who argued that Tifinagh was archaic, obsolete, non-cursive, and impractical. Despite the criticism, Bessaoud persisted in promoting Tifinagh.&quot;Achab Ramdane opposed my actions, calling it rekindling extinguished embers&quot; - Said Bessaouad 

=== Efforts to promote Tifinagh ===
In 1970, a meeting took place to decide on a system of writing. Influenced by Mahdjoubi Ahardane, Bessaoud opted for Tifinagh. Ahardane argued that Tifinagh was not merely a script but a testament to Berber history and identity. Further steps were taken afterwards regarding the standardization of the script.

By 1973, Ammar Negadi, a prominent Chaoui writer and fervent advocate of the Tifinagh script, passionately defended the use of Tifinagh, he has been elected secretary general of the Berber Academy, now called Agraw Imazighen, in the Paris region. propagating the academy&#x27;s publications and cultural activities.

Negadi reflected on his efforts: &quot;I distributed all of Agraw Imazighen&#x27;s writings throughout the Aurès region starting in 1973. The goal wasn&#x27;t regular correspondence but widespread dissemination of Tifinagh.&quot; Neo-Tifinagh was spread by the Berber Academy&#x27;s active promotion of the script, including its usage in their bulletin, &quot;Imazighen&quot;, which was widely read by Berber communities in Algeria and Morocco.

The official activities of the Berber Academy ceased when Mohand Bessaoud Arav was imprisoned.

By 1980, Negadi founded his spin-off organization UPA (Amazigh People&#x27;s Union), which published a bulletin in both Latin and Tifinagh, called &quot;Azaghen/Link&quot;. He remained convinced that Tifinagh was the best graphical tool to express Berber language and culture, seeing it as part of the cultural heritage and identity to be defended.

The UPA bulletins continued to promote the Tifinagh alphabet, while activist Messaoud Nedjahi streamlined its characters from 50 to 26. This process inspired the Afus Deg Fus association to create the first set of standardized Neo-Tifinagh fonts in 1993.

Neo-Tifinagh has since undergone further reform and is used in various contexts throughout North Africa. The Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture has standardized Neo-Tifinagh for use as the official orthography of Standard Moroccan Amazigh, an official language of Morocco.

=== Political history ===
The promotion of Neo-Tifinagh by the Berber Academy and Ammar Negadi&#x27;s UPA was part of the efforts to spread Berberism throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The use of Neo-Tifinagh in their publications was influential in raising Berber consciousness; one reader has described its effect as being &quot;the proof that we actually existed.&quot;

The Moroccan state arrested and imprisoned people using Neo-Tifinagh during the 1980s and 1990s. The Algerian Black Spring was also partly caused by this repression of Berber language.

In the 1980s, the Berber flag, which was designed in 1970 and uses the Tifinagh letter &quot;z&quot; (Tifinagh: ⵣ) from the root of &quot;Amazigh&quot;, began being used in demonstrations. The flag was adopted by the World Amazigh Congress in 1997.

In Morocco, following the creation of Standard Moroccan Amazigh in 2001, the 2003 adoption of Neo-Tifinagh served as a way to compromise between the deeply split proponents of the Latin script versus the Arabic script as Amazigh&#x27;s official orthography. This choice, however, has also resulted in backlash from many Amazigh activists, who find Tifinagh to be limiting when compared to the Latin script.

In Libya, the government of Muammar Gaddafi consistently banned Tifinagh from being used in public contexts such as store displays and banners. After the Libyan Civil War, the National Transitional Council has shown an openness towards the Berber language. The rebel Libya TV, based in Qatar, has included the Berber language and the Neo-Tifinagh alphabet in some of its programming.

Tifinagh continues to be used as &quot;an emblem of distinctive Berber identity and nationhood.&quot;

=== Modern use ===
Due to the official adoption of Neo-Tifinagh in Morocco in 2003, the script has been adapted by the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture for modern digital use. Government websites in Morocco may be displayed in Neo-Tifinagh.

Starting in 2003, Neo-Tifinagh was used for a small duration of Moroccan elementary school to teach Standard Moroccan Amazigh. However, practical use of Tifinagh in Morocco remains rare; one Amazigh activist has summarized the situation with the anecdote that he &quot;[knows] that some books that were written in Tifinagh were read by only two people ... the one who wrote the book and the one who did the editing!&quot; Public displays of Tifinagh in Morocco remains restricted primarily to signage and other culturally conspicuous uses.

Despite Neo-Tifinagh&#x27;s Algerian origins through the Berber Academy and UPA, the Latin alphabet became the predominant used script. Debate in what script to use for Berber languages tends to view the Latin and Arabic scripts as the primary options.

As of 2012, Tifinagh is &quot;not widely used in education or the media in any country.&quot;

==Letters==

The following are the letters of Neo-Tifinagh and traditional Tuareg Tifinagh:



===Unicode===
Tifinagh was added to the Unicode Standard in March 2005, with the release of version 4.1.

The Unicode block range for Tifinagh is U+2D30–U+2D7F:

<text>The Turkic languages are a language family of more than 35 documented languages, spoken by the Turkic peoples of Eurasia from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe to Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia (Siberia), and West Asia. The Turkic languages originated in a region of East Asia spanning from Mongolia to Northwest China, where Proto-Turkic is thought to have been spoken, from where they expanded to Central Asia and farther west during the first millennium. They are characterized as a dialect continuum.

Turkic languages are spoken by some 200 million people. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish, spoken mainly in Anatolia and the Balkans; its native speakers account for about 38% of all Turkic speakers, followed by Uzbek.

Characteristic features such as vowel harmony, agglutination, subject-object-verb order, and lack of grammatical gender, are almost universal within the Turkic family. 
There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility, upon moderate exposure, among the various Oghuz languages, which include Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Chaharmahali Turkic, Gagauz, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish, as well as Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar. Other Turkic languages demonstrate varying amounts of mutual intelligibility within their subgroups as well. Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided into two branches: Oghur, of which the only surviving member is Chuvash, and Common Turkic, which includes all other Turkic languages.

Turkic languages show many similarities with the Mongolic, Tungusic, Koreanic, and Japonic languages. These similarities have led some linguists (including Talât Tekin) to propose an Altaic language family, though this proposal is widely rejected by historical linguists. Similarities with the Uralic languages even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the Ural-Altaic hypothesis. However, there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies. The shared characteristics between the languages are attributed presently to extensive prehistoric language contact.

==Characteristics==


Turkic languages are null-subject languages, have vowel harmony (with the notable exception of Uzbek due to strong Persian-Tajik influence), converbs, extensive agglutination by means of suffixes and postpositions, and lack of grammatical articles, noun classes, and grammatical gender. Subject–object–verb word order is universal within the family. In terms of the level of vowel harmony in the Turkic language family, Tuvan is characterized as almost fully harmonic whereas Uzbek is the least harmonic or not harmonic at all. Taking into account the documented historico-linguistic development of Turkic languages overall, both inscriptional and textual, the family provides over one millennium of documented stages as well as scenarios in the linguistic evolution of vowel harmony which, in turn, demonstrates harmony evolution along a confidently definable trajectory Though vowel harmony is a common characteristic of major language families spoken in Inner Eurasia (Mongolic, Tungusic, Uralic and Turkic), the type of harmony found in them differs from each other, specifically, Uralic and Turkic have a shared type of vowel harmony (called &quot;palatal vowel harmony&quot;) whereas Mongolic and Tungusic represent a different type.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language is suggested to be somewhere between the Transcaspian steppe and Northeastern Asia (Manchuria), with genetic evidence pointing to the region near South Siberia and Mongolia as the &quot;Inner Asian Homeland&quot; of the Turkic ethnicity. Similarly several linguists, including Juha Janhunen, Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that modern-day Mongolia is the homeland of the early Turkic language. Relying on Proto-Turkic lexical items about the climate, topography, flora, fauna, people&#x27;s modes of subsistence, Turkologist Peter Benjamin Golden locates the Proto-Turkic Urheimat in the southern, taiga-steppe zone of the Sayan-Altay region.

Extensive contact took place between Proto-Turks and Proto-Mongols approximately during the first millennium BC; the shared cultural tradition between the two Eurasian nomadic groups is called the &quot;Turco-Mongol&quot; tradition. The two groups shared a similar religion system, Tengrism, and there exists a multitude of evident loanwords between Turkic languages and Mongolic languages. Although the loans were bidirectional, today Turkic loanwords constitute the largest foreign component in Mongolian vocabulary.

Italian historian and philologist Igor de Rachewiltz noted a significant distinction of the Chuvash language from other Turkic languages. According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider it an independent Chuvash family similar to Uralic and Turkic languages. Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for the classification purposes.

Some lexical and extensive typological similarities between Turkic and the nearby Tungusic and Mongolic families, as well as the Korean and Japonic families has in more recent years been instead attributed to prehistoric contact amongst the group, sometimes referred to as the Northeast Asian sprachbund. A more recent (circa first millennium BC) contact between &quot;core Altaic&quot; (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic) is distinguished from this, due to the existence of definitive common words that appear to have been mostly borrowed from Turkic into Mongolic, and later from Mongolic into Tungusic, as Turkic borrowings into Mongolic significantly outnumber Mongolic borrowings into Turkic, and Turkic and Tungusic do not share any words that do not also exist in Mongolic.
Turkic languages also show some Chinese loanwords that point to early contact during the time of Proto-Turkic.

===Early written records===
The first established records of the Turkic languages are the eighth century AD Orkhon inscriptions by the Göktürks, recording the Old Turkic language, which were discovered in 1889 in the Orkhon Valley in Mongolia. The &quot;Compendium of the Turkic Dialects&quot; (&quot;Divânü Lügati&#x27;t-Türk&quot;), written during the 11th century AD by Kaşgarlı Mahmud of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, constitutes an early linguistic treatment of the family. The &quot;Compendium&quot; is the first comprehensive dictionary of the Turkic languages and also includes the first known map of the Turkic speakers&#x27; geographical distribution. It mainly pertains to the Southwestern branch of the family.

The Codex Cumanicus (12th–13th centuries AD) concerning the Northwestern branch is another early linguistic manual, between the Kipchak language and Latin, used by the Catholic missionaries sent to the Western Cumans inhabiting a region corresponding to present-day Hungary and Romania. The earliest records of the language spoken by Volga Bulgars, debatably the parent or a distant relative of Chuvash language, are dated to the 13th–14th centuries AD.

===Geographical expansion and development===

With the Turkic expansion during the Early Middle Ages (c. 6th–11th centuries AD), Turkic languages, in the course of just a few centuries, spread across Central Asia, from Siberia to the Mediterranean. Various terminologies from the Turkic languages have passed into Persian, Urdu, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese, Mongolian, Hungarian and to a lesser extent, Arabic.

The geographical distribution of Turkic-speaking peoples across Eurasia since the Ottoman era ranges from the North-East of Siberia to Turkey in the West. (See picture in the box on the right above.)

For centuries, the Turkic-speaking peoples have migrated extensively and intermingled continuously, and their languages have been influenced mutually and through contact with the surrounding languages, especially the Iranian, Slavic, and Mongolic languages.

This has obscured the historical developments within each language and/or language group, and as a result, there exist several systems to classify the Turkic languages. The modern genetic classification schemes for Turkic are still largely indebted to Samoilovich (1922).

The Turkic languages may be divided into six branches:
*Turkic
**Common Turkic
***Oghuz Turkic (Southwestern)
***Kipchak Turkic (Northwestern)
***Karluk Turkic (Southeastern)
***Siberian Turkic (Northeastern)
***Arghu Turkic
**Oghur Turkic
In this classification, Oghur Turkic is also referred to as Lir-Turkic, and the other branches are subsumed under the title of Shaz-Turkic or Common Turkic. It is not clear when these two major types of Turkic can be assumed to have diverged.

With less certainty, the Southwestern, Northwestern, Southeastern and Oghur groups may further be summarized as West Turkic, the Northeastern, Kyrgyz-Kipchak, and Arghu (Khalaj) groups as East Turkic.

Geographically and linguistically, the languages of the Northwestern and Southeastern subgroups belong to the central Turkic languages, while the Northeastern and Khalaj languages are the so-called peripheral languages.

Hruschka, et al. (2014) use computational phylogenetic methods to calculate a tree of Turkic based on phonological sound changes.
===Schema===
The following isoglosses are traditionally used in the classification of the Turkic languages:
* Rhotacism (or in some views, zetacism), e.g. in the last consonant of the word for &quot;nine&quot; *tokkuz. This separates the Oghur branch, which exhibits /r/, from the rest of Turkic, which exhibits /z/. In this case, rhotacism refers to the development of *-/r/, *-/z/, and *-/d/ to /r/,*-/k/,*-/kh/ in this branch. See Antonov and Jacques (2012) on the debate concerning rhotacism and lambdacism in Turkic.
* Intervocalic *d, e.g. the second consonant in the word for &quot;foot&quot; *hadaq
* Suffix-final -G, e.g. in the suffix *lIG, in e.g. *tāglïg
Additional isoglosses include:
* Preservation of word initial *h, e.g. in the word for &quot;foot&quot; *hadaq. This separates Khalaj as a peripheral language.
* Denasalisation of palatal *ń, e.g. in the word for &quot;moon&quot;, *āń

*In the standard Istanbul dialect of Turkish, the &quot;ğ&quot; in &quot;dağ&quot; and &quot;dağlı&quot; is not realized as a consonant, but as a slight lengthening of the preceding vowel.

== Members ==
The following table is based mainly upon the classification scheme presented by Lars Johanson.

==Vocabulary comparison==
The following is a brief comparison of cognates among the basic vocabulary across the Turkic language family (about 60 words). Despite being cognates, some of the words may denote a different meaning.

Empty cells do not necessarily imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language may be formed from another stem and is not cognate with the other words in the row or that a loanword is used in its place.

Also, there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another, and so the &quot;Common meaning&quot; given is only approximate. In some cases, the form given is found only in some dialects of the language, or a loanword is much more common (e.g. in Turkish, the preferred word for &quot;fire&quot; is the Persian-derived &quot;ateş&quot;, whereas the native &quot;od&quot; is dead). Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.


Azerbaijani &quot;ǝ&quot; and &quot;ä&quot;: IPA /æ/

Azerbaijani &quot;q&quot;: IPA /g/, word-final &quot;q&quot;: IPA /x/

Turkish and Azerbaijani &quot;ı&quot;, Karakhanid &quot;ɨ&quot;, Turkmen &quot;y&quot;, and Sakha &quot;ï&quot;: IPA /ɯ/

Turkmen &quot;ň&quot;, Karakhanid &quot;ŋ&quot;: IPA /ŋ/

== Other possible relations ==
The Turkic language family is currently regarded as one of the world&#x27;s primary language families. Turkic is one of the main members of the controversial Altaic language family, but Altaic currently lacks support from a majority of linguists. None of the theories linking Turkic languages to other families have a wide degree of acceptance at present. Shared features with languages grouped together as Altaic have been interpreted by most mainstream linguists to be the result of a sprachbund.

=== Rejected or controversial theories ===

=== Korean ===
The possibility of a genetic relation between Turkic and Korean, independently from Altaic, is suggested by some linguists. The linguist Kabak (2004) of the University of Würzburg states that Turkic and Korean share similar phonology as well as morphology. Li Yong-Sŏng (2014) suggest that there are several cognates between Turkic and Old Korean. He states that these supposed cognates can be useful to reconstruct the early Turkic language. According to him, words related to nature, earth and ruling but especially to the sky and stars seem to be cognates.

The linguist Choi suggested already in 1996 a close relationship between Turkic and Korean regardless of any Altaic connections:

Many historians also point out a close non-linguistic relationship between Turkic peoples and Koreans. Especially close were the relations between the Göktürks and Goguryeo.

=== Uralic ===
Some linguists suggested a relation to Uralic languages, especially to the Ugric languages. This view is rejected and seen as obsolete by mainstream linguists. Similarities are because of language contact and borrowings mostly from Turkic into Ugric languages. Stachowski (2015) states that any relation between Turkic and Uralic must be a contact one.

<text>The Sound of Music is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, and a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. It is based on the 1949 memoir of Maria von Trapp, &quot;The Story of the Trapp Family Singers&quot;. Set in Austria on the eve of the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938, the musical tells the story of Maria, who takes a job as governess to a large family while she decides whether to become a nun. She falls in love with the children, and eventually their widowed father, Captain von Trapp. He is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy, but he opposes the Nazis. He and Maria decide on a plan to flee Austria with the children. Many songs from the musical have become standards, including &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, &quot;Edelweiss&quot;, &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;, and the title song &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

The original Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, opened in 1959 and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical, out of nine nominations. The first London production opened at the Palace Theatre in 1961. The show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since then. It was adapted as a 1965 film musical starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein, as Oscar Hammerstein died of stomach cancer nine months after the Broadway premiere.

==History==
After viewing &quot;The Trapp Family&quot;, a 1956 West German film about the Trapp family, and its 1958 sequel (&quot;The Trapp Family in America&quot;), stage director Vincent J. Donehue thought that the project would be perfect for his friend Mary Martin; Broadway producers Leland Hayward and Richard Halliday (Martin&#x27;s husband) agreed. The producers originally envisioned a non-musical play that would be written by Lindsay and Crouse and that would feature songs from the repertoire of the Trapp Family Singers. Then they decided to add an original song or two, perhaps by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But it was soon agreed that the project should feature all new songs and be a musical rather than a play.

Details of the history of the von Trapp family were altered for the musical. The real Georg von Trapp did live with his family in a villa in Aigen, a suburb of Salzburg. He wrote to the Nonnberg Abbey in 1926 asking for a nun to help tutor his sick daughter, and the Mother Abbess sent Maria. His wife, Agathe Whitehead, had died in 1922. The real Maria and Georg married at the Nonnberg Abbey in 1927. Lindsay and Crouse altered the story so that Maria was governess to all of the children, whose names and ages were changed, as was Maria&#x27;s original surname (the show used &quot;Rainer&quot; instead of &quot;Kutschera&quot;). The von Trapps spent some years in Austria after Maria and the Captain married and he was offered a commission in Germany&#x27;s navy. Since von Trapp opposed the Nazis by that time, the family left Austria after the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, going by train to Italy and then traveling on to London and the United States. To make the story more dramatic, Lindsay and Crouse had the family, soon after Maria&#x27;s and the Captain&#x27;s wedding, escape over the mountains to Switzerland on foot.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
In Salzburg, Federal State of Austria, just before World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot;. One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills (&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;). She returns late to the abbey where the Mother Abbess and the other nuns have been considering what to do about the free-spirit (&quot;Maria&quot;). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song (&quot;My Favorite Things&quot;). The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is suited for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.

Maria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a boatswain&#x27;s call. They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music (&quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;).

Rolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the eldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she (&quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen&quot;). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot; to distract them.

Captain von Trapp arrives a month later from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schraeder and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances (&quot;How Can Love Survive&quot;). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with &quot;Heil&quot;. The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that the children need him to show his love for them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schraeder. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.

The Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (the Nazi German annexation of Austria). Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the Ländler. When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song (&quot;So Long, Farewell&quot;). Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzburg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.

At the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her monastic vows; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live (&quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;).

===Act II===
Max teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with the Captain about the imminent &quot;Anschluss&quot;, trying to convince him that it is inevitable (&quot;No Way to Stop It&quot;). When he refuses to compromise on his opposition to it, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be &quot;An Ordinary Couple&quot;. As they marry, the nuns reprise &quot;Maria&quot; against the wedding processional.

While Maria and the Captain are on their honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzburg Festival. Herr Zeller, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the region, demands to know why they are not flying the Flag of Nazi Germany now that the &quot;Anschluss&quot; has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of the Nazi German occupation, the Captain decides the children should not sing at the event. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married (&quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)&quot;). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.

At the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, Max brings out the Captain&#x27;s guitar. Captain von Trapp sings &quot;Edelweiss&quot;, as a goodbye to his homeland, while using Austria&#x27;s national flower as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp family&#x27;s last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing &quot;So Long, Farewell&quot; (reprise), leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the Nazis start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they aren&#x27;t there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the Alps as the nuns reprise &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;.

* † Sometimes replaced by &quot;Something Good&quot;, which was written for the film version.
* ‡ Replaced by &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot; in the 1998 revival.
* In some productions, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; follows &quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen&quot; in the thunderstorm scene, while &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot; is shifted to the concert scene.
* Many stage revivals have also included &quot;I Have Confidence&quot; and &quot;Something Good&quot;, which were written by Richard Rodgers for the film version (since the film was made after original lyricist Oscar Hammerstein&#x27;s death).
* Although many people believe that &quot;Edelweiss&quot; is a traditional Austrian song, it was written for the musical and did not become known in Austria until after the film&#x27;s success.
* The Ländler dance performed by Maria and the Captain during the party is only loosely based on the traditional Austrian dance of the same name.

==Productions==

===Original productions===

&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; premiered at New Haven&#x27;s Shubert Theatre where it played an eight-performance tryout in October and November 1959 before another short tryout in Boston. The musical then opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 16, 1959, moved to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on November 6, 1962, and closed on June 15, 1963, after 1,443 performances. The director was Vincent J. Donehue, and the choreographer was Joe Layton. The original cast included Mary Martin as Maria, Theodore Bikel as Captain Georg von Trapp, Patricia Neway as Mother Abbess, Kurt Kasznar as Max Detweiler, Marion Marlowe as Elsa Schraeder, Brian Davies as Rolf, Lauri Peters as Liesl and Muriel O&#x27;Malley as Sister Margaretta. Patricia Brooks, June Card and Tatiana Troyanos were ensemble members in the original production. The show tied for the Tony Award for Best Musical with &quot;Fiorello!&quot;. Other awards included Martin for Best Actress in a Musical, Neway for Best Featured Actress, Best Scenic Design (Oliver Smith) and Best Conductor And Musical Director (Frederick Dvonch). Bikel and Kasznar were nominated for acting awards, and Donehue was nominated for his direction. The entire children&#x27;s cast was nominated for Best Featured Actress category as a single nominee, even though two of the children were boys.

Martha Wright replaced Martin in the role of Maria on Broadway in October 1961, followed by Karen Gantz in July 1962, Jeannie Carson in August 1962 and Nancy Dussault in September 1962. Jon Voight, who later married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf from September 1961 to June 1962. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O&#x27;Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: &quot;I promised myself then that if I could afford it, I would never do a run as long as that again.&quot; The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.

The musical premiered in London&#x27;s West End at the Palace Theatre on May 18, 1961, and ran for 2,385 performances. It was directed by Jerome Whyte and used the original New York choreography, supervised by Joe Layton, and the original sets designed by Oliver Smith. The cast included Jean Bayless as Maria, followed by Sonia Rees, Roger Dann as Captain von Trapp, Constance Shacklock as Mother Abbess, Eunice Gayson as Elsa Schraeder, Harold Kasket as Max Detweiler, Barbara Brown as Liesl, Nicholas Bennett as Rolf and Olive Gilbert as Sister Margaretta.

===1981 London revival===
In 1981, at producer Ross Taylor&#x27;s urging, Petula Clark agreed to star in a revival of the show at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. Michael Jayston played Captain von Trapp, Honor Blackman was the Baroness and June Bronhill played the Mother Abbess. Other notable cast members included Helen Anker, John Bennett and Martina Grant. Despite her misgivings that, at age 49, she was too old to play the role convincingly, Clark opened to unanimous rave reviews and the largest advance sale in the history of British theatre at that time. Maria von Trapp, who attended the opening night performance, described Clark as &quot;the best&quot; Maria ever. Clark extended her initial six-month contract to thirteen months. Playing to 101 percent of seating capacity, the show set the highest attendance figure for a single week (October 26–31, 1981) of any British musical production in history (as recorded in &quot;The Guinness Book of Theatre&quot;). It was the first stage production to incorporate the two additional songs (&quot;Something Good&quot; and &quot;I Have Confidence&quot;) that Richard Rodgers composed for the film version. &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; had a similar context to the film version, while the short verse &quot;A Bell is No Bell&quot; was extended into a full-length song for Maria and the Mother Abbess. &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot; was set in a new scene at a village fair.

The cast recording of this production was the first to be recorded digitally. It was released on CD for the first time in 2010 by the UK label Pet Sounds and included two bonus tracks from the original single issued by Epic to promote the production.

===1998 Broadway revival===
Director Susan H. Schulman staged the first Broadway revival of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, with Rebecca Luker as Maria and Michael Siberry as Captain von Trapp. It also featured Patti Cohenour as Mother Abbess, Jan Maxwell as Elsa Schraeder, Fred Applegate as Max Detweiler, Dashiell Eaves as Rolf, Patricia Conolly as Frau Schmidt and Laura Benanti, in her Broadway debut, as Luker&#x27;s understudy. Later, Luker and Siberry were replaced by Richard Chamberlain as the Captain and Benanti as Maria. Lou Taylor Pucci made his Broadway debut as the understudy for Kurt von Trapp. The production opened on March 12, 1998, at the Martin Beck Theatre, and closed on June 20, 1999, after 533 performances. This production was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. It then toured in North America.

===2006 London revival===

An Andrew Lloyd Webber production opened on November 15, 2006, at the London Palladium, produced by Live Nation&#x27;s David Ian and Jeremy Sams. Following failed negotiations with Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson, the role of Maria was cast through a UK talent search reality TV show called &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?&quot; The talent show was produced by (and featured) Andrew Lloyd Webber and also featured presenter/comedian Graham Norton and a judging panel of David Ian, John Barrowman and Zoë Tyler.

Connie Fisher was selected by public voting as the winner of the show. In early 2007, Fisher suffered from a heavy cold that prevented her from performing for two weeks. To prevent further disruptions, an alternate Maria, Aoife Mulholland, a fellow contestant on &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?&quot;, played Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinee performances. Simon Shepherd was originally cast as Captain von Trapp, but after two preview performances he was withdrawn from the production, and Alexander Hanson moved into the role in time for the official opening date along with Lesley Garrett as the Mother Abbess. After Garrett left, Margaret Preece took the role. The cast also featured Lauren Ward as the Baroness, Ian Gelder as Max, Sophie Bould as Liesl, and Neil McDermott as Rolf. Other notable replacements included Simon Burke and Simon MacCorkindale as the Captain and newcomer Amy Lennox as Liesl. Summer Strallen replaced Fisher in February 2008, with Mulholland portraying Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinees.

The revival received enthusiastic reviews, especially for Fisher, Preece, Bould and Garrett. A cast recording of the London Palladium cast was released. The production closed on February 21, 2009, after a run of over two years and was followed by a UK national tour, described below.

==Reception==
Most reviews of the original Broadway production were favorable. Richard Watts Jr. of the &quot;New York Post&quot; stated that the show had &quot;strangely gentle charm that is wonderfully endearing. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; strives for nothing in the way of smash effects, substituting instead a kind of gracious and unpretentious simplicity.&quot; The &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot; pronounced &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; &quot;the loveliest musical imaginable. It places Rodgers and Hammerstein back in top form as melodist and lyricist. The Lindsay-Crouse dialogue is vibrant and amusing in a plot that rises to genuine excitement.&quot; The &quot;New York Journal American&quot;″s review opined that &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is &quot;the most mature product of the team ... it seemed to me to be the full ripening of these two extraordinary talents&quot;.

Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a mixed assessment. He praised Mary Martin&#x27;s performance, saying &quot;she still has the same common touch ... same sharp features, goodwill, and glowing personality that makes music sound intimate and familiar&quot; and stated that &quot;the best of the &quot;Sound of Music&quot; is Rodgers and Hammerstein in good form&quot;. However, he said, the libretto &quot;has the hackneyed look of the musical theatre replaced with &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1943. It is disappointing to see the American musical stage succumbing to the clichés of operetta.&quot; Walter Kerr&#x27;s review in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; was unfavorable: &quot;Before &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is halfway through its promising chores it becomes not only too sweet for words but almost too sweet for music&quot;, stating that the &quot;evening suffer[s] from little children&quot;.

==Cast recordings==
Columbia Masterworks recorded the original Broadway cast album at the Columbia 30th Street Studio in New York City a week after the show&#x27;s 1959 opening. The album was the label&#x27;s first deluxe package in a gatefold jacket, priced $1 higher than previous cast albums. It was No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; best-selling albums chart for 16 weeks in 1960. It was released on CD from Sony in the Columbia Broadway Masterworks series. In 1959, singer Patti Page recorded the title song from the show for Mercury Records on the day that the musical opened on Broadway. The 1961 London production was recorded by EMI and released on the HMV label and later re-issued on CD in 1997, on the Broadway Angel label.

The 1965 film soundtrack was released by RCA Victor and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. RCA Victor also released an album of the 1998 Broadway revival produced by Hallmark Entertainment and featuring the full revival cast, including Rebecca Luker, Michael Siberry, Jan Maxwell and Fred Applegate. The Telarc label made a studio cast recording of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra conducted by Erich Kunzel (1987). The lead roles went to opera stars: Frederica von Stade as Maria, Håkan Hagegård as Captain von Trapp, and Eileen Farrell as the Mother Abbess. The recording &quot;includes both the two new songs written for the film version and the three Broadway songs they replace, as well as a previously unrecorded verse of &quot;An Ordinary Couple&quot;&quot;. The 2006 London revival was recorded and has been released on the Decca Broadway label. There have been numerous studio cast albums and foreign cast albums issued, though many have only received regional distribution. According to the cast album database, there are 62 recordings of the score that have been issued over the years.

The soundtrack from the 2013 NBC television production starring Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer was released on CD and digital download in December 2013 on the Sony Masterworks label. Also featured on the album are Audra McDonald, Laura Benanti and Christian Borle.

<text>Trip hop is a musical genre that originated in the late 1980s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol, England. It has been described as a psychedelic fusion of hip hop and electronica with slow tempos and an atmospheric sound, often incorporating elements of jazz, soul, funk, reggae, dub, R&amp;B, and other genres, typically of electronic music, as well as sampling from movie soundtracks and other eclectic sources.

The style emerged as a more experimental variant of breakbeat from the Bristol sound scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, incorporating influences from jazz, soul, funk, dub, and rap music. It was pioneered by acts like Massive Attack, UNKLE, Tricky, and Portishead. The term was first coined in a 1994 &quot;Mixmag&quot; piece about American producer DJ Shadow. Trip hop achieved commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as &quot;Europe&#x27;s alternative choice in the second half of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Common musical aesthetics include a bass-heavy drumbeat, often providing the slowed down breakbeat samples similar to standard 1990s hip hop beats, giving the genre a more psychedelic and mainstream feel. Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&amp;B, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&amp;B, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird, and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps.

Trip hop is also known for its melancholic sound. This may be partly due to the fact that several acts were inspired by post-punk bands; Tricky and Massive Attack both covered and sampled songs of Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Cure. Tricky opened his second album &quot;Nearly God&quot; with a version of &quot;Tattoo&quot;, a proto-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees initially recorded in 1983.

Trip hop tracks often incorporate Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments such as the theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop differs from hip hop in theme and overall tone. Contrasting with gangsta rap and its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural atmospherics influenced by experimental folk and rock acts of the seventies, such as John Martyn, combined with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop may be said to &quot;transcend&quot; the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo.

==History==
===Late 1980s–1991: Origins===
The term &quot;trip-hop&quot; first appeared in print in June 1994. Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for &quot;Mixmag&quot;, used it to describe &quot;In/Flux&quot;, a single by American producer DJ Shadow and UK act RPM, with the latter signed to Mo&#x27; Wax Records.

In Bristol, hip hop began to seep into the consciousness of a subculture already well-schooled in Jamaican forms of music. DJs, MCs, b-boys and graffiti artists grouped together into informal soundsystems. Like the pioneering Bronx crews of DJs Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, the soundsystems provided party music for public spaces, often in the economically deprived council estates from which some of their members originated. Bristol&#x27;s soundsystem DJs, drawing heavily on Jamaican dub music, typically used a laid-back, slow and heavy drum beat (&quot;down tempo&quot;).

Bristol&#x27;s Wild Bunch crew became one of the soundsystems to put a local spin on the international phenomenon, helping to birth Bristol&#x27;s signature sound of trip hop, often termed &quot;the Bristol Sound&quot;. The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence, DJ Milo (Milo Johnson, aka DJ Nature) founding member of the Wild Bunch and the person generally accepted as the creator of the Bristol sound and therefore, trip-hop; MC Adrian &quot;Tricky Kid&quot; Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew &quot;Mushroom&quot; Vowles and Grant &quot;Daddy G&quot; Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s, the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack, a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists.

Another influence came from Gary Clail&#x27;s Tackhead soundsystem. Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart. The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart &amp; the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label. Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a premature version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released &quot;Angel&quot;, one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s.

===1991–1997: Mainstream breakthrough===
Massive Attack&#x27;s first album &quot;Blue Lines&quot; was released in 1991 to huge success in the United Kingdom. &quot;Blue Lines&quot; was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album&#x27;s hit single &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; and other tracks were not seen as hip hop songs in a conventional sense despite similarities in production methods such as using sample-based rhythms. Co-produced by Jonny Dollar, the orchestral &quot;Unfinished&quot; featured R&amp;B singer Shara Nelson, and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack&#x27;s career. Massive Attack released their second album entitled &quot;Protection&quot; in 1994. Although Tricky stayed on in a lesser role and Hooper again produced, the fertile dance music scene of the early 1990s had informed the record, and it was seen as an even more significant shift away from the Wild Bunch era.

In the June 1994 issue of the UK magazine &quot;Mixmag&quot;, music journalist Andy Pemberton used the term &quot;trip hop&quot; to describe the hip hop instrumental &quot;In/Flux&quot;, a 1993 single by San Francisco&#x27;s DJ Shadow, and other similar tracks released on the Mo&#x27; Wax label and being played in London clubs at the time. &quot;In/Flux&quot;, with its mixed up bpms, spoken word samples, strings, melodies, bizarre noises, prominent bass, and slow beats, gave the listener the impression they were on a musical trip, according to Pemberton. Soon, however, Massive Attack&#x27;s dubby, jazzy, psychedelic, electronic textures, rooted in hip hop sampling technique but taking flight into many styles, were described by journalists as the template of the eponymous genre.

In 1993, Icelandic musician Björk released &quot;Debut&quot;, produced by Wild Bunch member Nellee Hooper. The album, although rooted in four-on-the-floor house music, contained elements of trip hop and is credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop. She had been in contact with London&#x27;s underground electronic music scene and was romantically involved with trip-hop musician Tricky. Björk further embraced trip-hop with her 1995 album &quot;Post&quot; by collaborating with Tricky and Howie B. &quot;Homogenic&quot;, her 1997 album, has been described as a pinnacle of trip hop music.

Trip-hop neared the peak of its popularity in 1994 and 1995, with artists such as Howie B and Earthling making significant contributions. Ninja Tune, the independent record label founded by the duo Coldcut, significantly influenced the trip-hop sound in London and beyond with breakthrough artists DJ Food, 9 Lazy 9, Up, Bustle &amp; Out, Funki Porcini and The Herbaliser, among others. The period also marked the debut of two acts who, along with Massive Attack, would define the Bristol scene for years to come.

In 1994, Portishead, a trio comprising singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released their debut album &quot;Dummy&quot;. Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead&#x27;s primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs. Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of &quot;Blue Lines&quot;), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, &quot;Dummy&quot; was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year, giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead&#x27;s music was also widely imitated, to the point that they distanced themselves from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize, with Barrow stating &quot;The whole trip-hop tag was nonsense. It was developed by people in London, and the people in Bristol just had to put up with it.&quot;.

Tricky also released his debut solo album, &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; in 1995, to great critical acclaim. The album was produced largely in collaboration with Mark Saunders. Tricky employed whispered, often abstract stream-of-consciousness lyrics, remote from the gangsta-rap braggadocio of the mid-1990s US hip-hop scene. Even more unusually, many of the solo songs on &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; featured little of Tricky&#x27;s own voice: his then-lover, Martina Topley-Bird, sang them, including her re-imagining of rap group Public Enemy&#x27;s 1988 song &quot;Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos&quot;, while other songs were male-female duets dealing with sex and love in oblique ways, over beds of sometimes dissonant samples. Within a year, Tricky had released two more full-length albums, although they failed to find the same popularity as his Bristol contemporaries Massive Attack and Portishead. Through his collaborations with Björk, however, he exerted influence closer to the pop and alternative rock mainstream, and he developed a large cult fan-base.

Although not as popular in the United States, bands like Portishead and Sneaker Pimps saw moderate airplay on alternative-rock stations across the country.

===1997–2010: Continued success and new directions===
After the initial success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, the artists who made their own interpretations of the genre include Archive, Baby Fox, Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Anomie Belle, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists incorporated trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed use of the term &quot;post-trip hop&quot; was in an October 2002 article of &quot;The Independent&quot;, and was used to describe the band Second Person.

Trip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, PJ Harvey, How to Destroy Angels, Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, , Beck, Alanis Morissette, The xx and Deftones. Several tracks on Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; also displayed a trip hop influence. Various prominent artists and groups, such as Janet Jackson, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Björk, and Radiohead, have also been influenced by the genre. Trip hop has spawned several subgenres, including illbient (dub-based trip hop which combines ambient and industrial hip hop).

Trip hop continued to influence notable artists in the 2000s. Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver incorporated trip hop in their ambient/electronic/jazzy album &quot;Perdition City&quot;. Atmospheric rock band Antimatter included some trip hop elements in their first two albums. Australian composer Rob Dougan proposed a mix of trip hop beats, orchestral music and electronics. RJD2 began his career as a DJ, but in 2001, began releasing albums under El-P&#x27;s Def Jux Label. Zero 7&#x27;s album &quot;Simple Things&quot;, and in particular, its lead single &quot;Destiny&quot;, was regarded highly by underground listeners and achieved significant popularity. In 2006, Gotye debuted his second studio album, &quot;Like Drawing Blood&quot;. The songs on the album featured down-tempo hip-hop beats and dub style bass reminiscent of trip hop. Hip hop groups Zion I and the Dub Pistols also displayed heavy trip hop influence. Norwegian singer and songwriter Kate Havnevik is a classically trained musician, but also incorporates trip hop into her work.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s trip hop achieved crossover success in the United States, often lumped under the &quot;electronica&quot; label. Trip hop songs were featured in film soundtracks of this era such as the &quot;Matrix&quot; series. Many producers who were not explicitly trip-hop artists also displayed its influence during this time. Daniel Nakamura, aka Dan the Automator, released two albums that were heavily inspired by trip hop. His 2000 album &quot;Deltron 3030&quot; was a concept album about a rapper from the future, portrayed by Del the Funky Homosapien. 2001 saw the release of his side project, Lovage and the album &quot;Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By&quot;, with special guests Mike Patton, Prince Paul, Maseo, Damon Albarn, and Afrika Bambaataa. British producer Fatboy Slim&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars&quot;, was his most commercially successful release. Another heavily trip-hop influenced band, Elsiane, published their first album &quot;Hybrid&quot; in 2007, creating a &quot;mellow, hypnotic atmosphere utilized in the ’90s by big names like Massive Attack, Portishead, etc.&quot;

===2010–present===
Major notable trip hop releases from 2010s include Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Heligoland,&quot; their first studio album in seven years; and Dutch&#x27;s &quot;A Bright Cold Day&quot; in 2010, the latter group including Jedi Mind Tricks producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind.

DJ Shadow&#x27;s &quot;The Less You Know, the Better&quot; was released in 2011 after a highly publicised unveiling of songs, including appearances on Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show and previews at a performance in Antwerp in August 2010. The album was met with &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; on Metacritic, with some criticising Shadow&#x27;s lack of originality. Sam Richards of &quot;NME&quot; felt that the album sounded &quot;like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place.&quot;

Beak&#x27;s album titled &quot;Beak»&quot; was released in 2012 and received high scores from journalists, including an 8/10 from &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot; magazine.

Lana Del Rey released her second album, &quot;Born to Die&quot; in 2012, which contained a string of trip hop ballads. The album topped the charts in eleven countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom; it has sold 3.4 million copies worldwide as of 2013 according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

Following the 2013 release of &quot;EP2&quot;, the music of FKA Twigs was described in a &quot;Pitchfork Magazine&quot; article as &quot;trip hop for a new time&quot;, with &quot;a menacing undertow reminiscent of Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Mezzanine&quot;.&quot;

In September 2021, the Sneaker Pimps released the album &quot;Squaring the Circle&quot; which had been their first release in over 20 years, featuring Simonne Jones on some of the tracks. The album, while rooted in Trip Hop, had much more of a Pop styling than previous efforts.

In April 2024, Irish rock band Fontaines D.C. released &quot;Starburster&quot;, the lead single from their fourth album &quot;Romance&quot;. Critics &quot;Consequence&quot; and &quot;Clash&quot; described the track as trip hop.

<doc id="30027" wikidata="Q36620" url="?curid=30027" title="Tycho Brahe">
<text>Tycho Brahe ( ; ; born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, ; 14 December 154624 October 1601), generally called Tycho for short, was a Danish astronomer of the Renaissance, known for his comprehensive and unprecedentedly accurate astronomical observations. He was known during his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist. He was the last major astronomer before the invention of the telescope. Tycho Brahe has also been described as the greatest pre-telescopic astronomer.

In 1572, Tycho noticed a completely new star that was brighter than any star or planet. Astonished by the existence of a star that ought not to have been there, he devoted himself to the creation of ever more accurate instruments of measurement over the next fifteen years (1576–1591). King Frederick II granted Tycho an estate on the island of Hven and the money to build Uraniborg, the first large observatory in Christian Europe. He later worked underground at Stjerneborg, where he realised that his instruments in Uraniborg were not sufficiently steady. His unprecedented research program both turned astronomy into the first modern science and also helped launch the Scientific Revolution.

An heir to several noble families, Tycho was well educated. He worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of Copernican heliocentrism with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system, and devised the Tychonic system, his own version of a model of the Universe, with the Sun orbiting the Earth, and the planets as orbiting the Sun. In (1573), he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm. His measurements indicated that &quot;new stars&quot;, , now called &quot;supernovae&quot;, moved beyond the Moon, and he was able to show that comets were not atmospheric phenomena, as was previously thought.

In 1597, Tycho was forced by the new king, Christian IV, to leave Denmark. He was invited to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer, and built an observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou. Before his death in 1601, he was assisted for a year by Johannes Kepler, who went on to use Tycho&#x27;s data to develop his own three laws of planetary motion.

==Life==
===Family===
Tycho Brahe was born as heir to several of Denmark&#x27;s most influential noble families. In addition to his immediate ancestry with the Brahe and the Bille families, he counted the Rud, Trolle, Ulfstand, and Rosenkrantz families among his ancestors. Both of his grandfathers and all of his great-grandfathers had served as members of the Danish king&#x27;s Privy Council. His paternal grandfather and namesake, Thyge Brahe, was the lord of Tosterup Castle in Scania and died in battle during the 1523 Siege of Malmö during the Lutheran Reformation Wars.

His maternal grandfather, Claus Bille, lord to Bohus Castle and a second cousin of Swedish king Gustav Vasa, participated in the Stockholm Bloodbath on the side of the Danish king against the Swedish nobles. Tycho&#x27;s father, Otte Brahe, a royal Privy Councilor (like his own father), married Beate Bille, a powerful figure at the Danish court holding several royal land titles. Tycho&#x27;s parents are buried under the floor of the church of Kågeröd, four kilometres east of Knutstorp Castle.

===Early years===
Tycho was born on 14 December 1546, at his family&#x27;s ancestral seat at Knutstorp (; ), about north of Svalöv in then Danish Scania. He was the oldest of 12 siblings, 8 of whom lived to adulthood, including Steen Brahe and Sophia Brahe. His twin brother died before being baptized. Tycho later wrote an ode in Latin to his dead twin, which was printed in 1572 as his first published work. An epitaph, originally from Knutstorp, but now on a plaque near the church door, shows the whole family, including Tycho as a boy.

When he was only two years old Tycho was taken away to be raised by his uncle Jørgen Thygesen Brahe and his wife Inger Oxe, sister to Peder Oxe, Steward of the Realm, who were childless. It is unclear why Otte Brahe reached this arrangement with his brother, but Tycho was the only one of his siblings not to be raised by his mother at Knutstorp. Instead, Tycho was raised at Jørgen Brahe&#x27;s estate at Tosterup and at Tranekær on the island of Langeland, and later at Næsbyhoved Castle near Odense, and later again at the Castle of Nykøbing on the island of Falster. Tycho later wrote that Jørgen Brahe &quot;raised me and generously provided for me during his life until my eighteenth year; he always treated me as his own son and made me his heir&quot;.

From ages 6 to 12, Tycho attended Latin school, probably in Nykøbing. At age 12, on 19 April 1559, Tycho began studies at the University of Copenhagen. There, following his uncle&#x27;s wishes, he studied law, but also studied a variety of other subjects and became interested in astronomy. At the university, Aristotle was a staple of scientific theory, and Tycho likely received a thorough training in Aristotelian physics and cosmology. He experienced the solar eclipse of 21 August 1560, and was greatly impressed by the fact that it had been predicted, although the prediction based on current observational data was a day off. He realized that more accurate observations would be the key to making more exact predictions. He purchased an ephemeris and books on astronomy, including Johannes de Sacrobosco&#x27;s , Petrus Apianus&#x27;s and Regiomontanus&#x27;s .

Jørgen Thygesen Brahe, however, wanted Tycho to educate himself in order to become a civil servant, and sent him on a study tour of Europe in early 1562. 15-year-old Tycho was given as mentor the 19-year-old Anders Sørensen Vedel, whom he eventually talked into allowing the pursuit of astronomy during the tour. Vedel and his pupil left Copenhagen in February 1562. On 24 March, they arrived in Leipzig, where they matriculated at the Lutheran Leipzig University. In 1563, he observed a close conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, and noticed that the Copernican and Ptolemaic tables used to predict the conjunction were inaccurate. This led him to realise that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night, using the most accurate instruments obtainable. He began maintaining detailed journals of all his astronomical observations. In this period, he combined the study of astronomy with astrology, laying down horoscopes for different famous personalities.

When Tycho and Vedel returned from Leipzig in 1565, Denmark was at war with Sweden, and as vice-admiral of the Danish fleet, Jørgen Brahe had become a national hero for having participated in the sinking of the Swedish warship &quot;Mars&quot; during the First battle of Öland (1564). Shortly after Tycho&#x27;s arrival in Denmark, Jørgen Brahe was defeated in the action of 4 June 1565, and shortly afterwards died of a fever. Stories have it that he contracted pneumonia after a night of drinking with the Danish King Frederick II when the king fell into the water in a Copenhagen canal and Brahe jumped in after him. Brahe&#x27;s possessions passed on to his wife Inger Oxe, who considered Tycho with special fondness.

===Tycho&#x27;s nose===
In 1566, Tycho left to study at the University of Rostock. There he studied with professors of medicine at the university&#x27;s famous medical school and became interested in medical alchemy and herbal medicine. On 29 December 1566 at the age of 20, Tycho lost part of his nose in a sword duel with a fellow Danish nobleman, his third cousin Manderup Parsberg. At an engagement party at the home of Professor Lucas Bachmeister on 10 December the two had drunkenly quarreled over who was the superior mathematician. On 29 December, the cousins resolved their feud with a duel in the dark. Though the two were later reconciled, in the duel Tycho lost the bridge of his nose and gained a broad scar across his forehead.

He received the best possible care at the university and wore a prosthetic nose for the rest of his life. It was kept in place with paste or glue and said to be made of silver and gold. In November 2012, Danish and Czech researchers reported that the prosthesis was actually made of brass after chemically analyzing a small bone sample from the nose from the body exhumed in 2010. The prostheses made of gold and silver were mostly worn for special occasions, rather than everyday wear.

===Science and life on Uraniborg===
In April 1567, Tycho returned home from his travels, with a firm intention of becoming an astrologer. Although he had been expected to go into politics and the law, like most of his kinsmen, and although Denmark was still at war with Sweden, his family supported his decision to dedicate himself to the sciences. His father wanted him to take up law, but Tycho was allowed to travel to Rostock and then to Augsburg, where he built a great quadrant, then Basel, and Freiburg. In 1568, he was appointed a canon at Roskilde Cathedral, a largely honorary position that allowed him to focus on his studies.

At the end of 1570, he was informed of his father&#x27;s ill health, so he returned to Knutstorp Castle, where his father died on 9 May 1571. The war was over, and the Danish lords soon returned to prosperity. Soon, another uncle, Steen Bille, helped him build an observatory and alchemical laboratory at Herrevad Abbey, where Tycho was assisted by his keenest disciple, his younger sister Sophie Brahe. Tycho was acknowledged by King Frederick II, who proposed to him that an observatory be built to better study the night sky. After accepting this proposal, the location for the Uraniborg&#x27;s construction was set on an island called Hven, now Ven in the Sound not too far from Copenhagen, the earliest large observatory in Christian Europe.

Tycho Brahe was highly appreciated by King Frederick II, and he was accepted and supported by people of high social status. He was supported by the church. The support Tycho Brahe received from the king allowed him to continue his research and make significant contributions to the field of astronomy.

In the late 16th century, Tycho Brahe built an observatory called Uraniborg. It was built on the island of Hven located between the provinces of Zealand (Sjælland) and Scania (Skåne). The island was then an administrative part of Zealand. Later, after the Peace of Roskilde in 1658, Scania was conquered by the Swedes. In 1660, Hven became part of Sweden. In Tycho&#x27;s time, it was all Denmark. He lived on Hven for approximately 21 years. He began to build Uraniborg in 1576 and moved there soon after. As Uraniborg was a significant and advanced observatory, it took years to complete.

Uraniborg was a place where Tycho Brahe could research and analyze his previous findings, as well as explore new discoveries. Tycho Brahe was an astronomer of the pre-telescope era. Using just his naked eye, he observed the planets, moon, stars, and space and recorded everything he saw while completing a multitude of calculations daily. The location of Uraniborg was strategically chosen, with seclusion and support being the primary reasons for building on the island of Hven. Seclusion was essential for accurate observation, and gave Tycho Brahe a better way to focus on his work without worrying about interruptions from other people. Seclusion was also important for observation, as there was nothing interfering with time, light, or motion observations.

Tycho Brahe was a perfectionist, and by being secluded he had complete control over his research and was not limited by anyone else&#x27;s restrictions, enabling him to develop innovative research. He could focus all of his energy on his work, without receiving any backlash or questioning from anyone. The seclusion gave him the freedom to pursue his research without limitations and paved the way for groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astronomy. Uraniborg was one of the most advanced observatories of its time, equipped with several astronomical instruments, including quadrant instruments, sextants, and astronomical clocks.

Tycho Brahe&#x27;s observations and calculations at Uraniborg allowed him to develop more accurate solar system models. He compiled the most extensive and accurate catalog of stellar positions up to that time. Tycho Brahe&#x27;s observations and calculations at Uraniborg allowed him to lay the groundwork for astronomers in the future. 

Despite the success Tycho Brahe had on Hven, he eventually left the island after a disagreement with the new king of Denmark, Christian IV. In 1597, Tycho Brahe moved to Prague, where he continued his work and was eventually appointed by Emperor Rudolf II in 1601 as imperial mathematician. However, Uraniborg remained a significant landmark in the history of astronomy. 

====Morganatic marriage to Kirsten Jørgensdatter====
Towards the end of 1571, Tycho fell in love with Kirsten, daughter of Jørgen Hansen, the Lutheran minister in Knudstrup. As she was a commoner, Tycho never formally married her, since if he did he would lose his noble privileges. However, Danish law permitted morganatic marriage, which meant that a nobleman and a common woman could live together openly as husband and wife for three years, and their alliance then became a legally binding marriage. However, each would maintain their social status, and any children they had together would be considered commoners, with no rights to titles, landholdings, coat of arms, or even their father&#x27;s noble name. 

While King Frederick respected Tycho&#x27;s choice of wife, himself having been unable to marry the woman he loved, many of Tycho&#x27;s family members disagreed, and many churchmen continued to hold the lack of a divinely sanctioned marriage against him. Kirsten Jørgensdatter gave birth to their first daughter, Kirstine, named after Tycho&#x27;s late sister, on 12October 1573. Kirstine died from the plague in 1576. Tycho wrote a heartfelt elegy for her tombstone. In 1574, they moved to Copenhagen where their daughter Magdalene was born. Later the family followed him into exile. Kirsten and Tycho lived together for almost thirty years until Tycho&#x27;s death. Together, they had eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood.

====1572 supernova====

On 11 November 1572, Tycho observed, from Herrevad Abbey, a very bright star, now numbered SN 1572, which had unexpectedly appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. Because it had been maintained since antiquity that the world beyond the Moon&#x27;s orbit was eternally unchangeable, with celestial immutability being a fundamental axiom of the Aristotelian world-view, other observers held that the phenomenon was something in the terrestrial sphere below the Moon. However, Tycho observed that the object showed no daily parallax against the background of the fixed stars. This implied that it was at least farther away than the Moon and those planets that do show such parallax. He found that the object did not change its position relative to the fixed stars over several months, as all planets did in their periodic orbital motions, even the outer planets, for which no daily parallax was detectable.

This suggested that it was not even a planet, but a fixed star in the stellar sphere beyond all the planets. In 1573, he published a small book , coining the term nova for a &quot;new&quot; star. We now classify this star as a supernova and know that it is 7,500 light-years from Earth. This discovery was decisive for his choice of astronomy as a profession. Tycho was strongly critical of those who dismissed the implications of the astronomical appearance, writing in the preface to : (&quot;O thick wits. O blind watchers of the sky&quot;). The publication of his discovery made him a well-known name among scientists in Europe.

====Lord of Hven====
Tycho continued with his detailed observations, often assisted by his first assistant and student, his younger sister Sophie. In 1574, Tycho published the observations made in 1572 from his first observatory at Herrevad Abbey. He then started lecturing on astronomy, but gave it up and left Denmark in spring 1575 to tour abroad. He first visited William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel&#x27;s observatory at Kassel, then went on to Frankfurt, Basel, and Venice, where he acted as an agent for the Danish king, contacting artisans and craftsmen whom the king wanted to work on his new palace at Elsinore. Upon his return, the King wished to repay Tycho&#x27;s service by offering him a position worthy of his family. He offered him a choice of lordships of militarily and economically important estates, such as the castles of Hammershus or Helsingborg.

Tycho was reluctant to take up a position as a lord of the realm, preferring to focus on his science. He wrote to his friend Johannes Pratensis, &quot;I did not want to take possession of any of the castles our benevolent king so graciously offered me. I am displeased with society here, customary forms and the whole rubbish&quot;. Tycho secretly began to plan to move to Basel, wishing to participate in the burgeoning academic and scientific life there. The King heard of Tycho&#x27;s plans, and desiring to keep the distinguished scientist, in 1576 he offered Tycho the island of Hven in Øresund and funding to set up an observatory.

Until then, Hven had been property directly under the Crown. The 50 families on the island considered themselves to be freeholding farmers, but with Tycho&#x27;s appointment as Feudal Lord of Hven, this changed. Tycho took control of agricultural planning, requiring the peasants to cultivate twice as much as they had done before, and he exacted corvée labor from the peasants for the construction of his new castle. The peasants complained about Tycho&#x27;s excessive taxation and took him to court. The court established Tycho&#x27;s right to levy taxes and labor. The result was a contract detailing the mutual obligations of lord and peasants on the island.

Tycho envisioned his castle Uraniborg as a temple dedicated to the muses of arts and sciences, rather than as a military fortress. It was named after Urania, the muse of astronomy. Construction began in 1576, with a laboratory for his alchemical experiments in the cellar. Uraniborg was inspired by the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio. It was one of the first buildings in northern Europe to show influence from Italian renaissance architecture.

When he realized that the towers of Uraniborg were not adequate as observatories, because of the instruments&#x27; exposure to the elements and the movement of the building, he constructed an underground observatory close to Uraniborg called Stjerneborg (Star Castle) in 1584. This consisted of several hemispherical crypts which contained the great equatorial armillary, large azimuth quadrant, zodiacal armillary, largest azimuth quadrant of steel and the trigonal sextant.

The basement of Uraniborg included an alchemical laboratory, with 16 furnaces for conducting distillations and other chemical experiments. Unusually for the time, Tycho established Uraniborg as a research centre, where almost 100 students and artisans worked from 1576 to 1597. Uraniborg contained a printing press and a paper mill, both among the first in Scandinavia, enabling Tycho to publish his own manuscripts, on locally made paper with his own watermark. He created a system of ponds and canals to run the wheels of the paper mill. Another resident of Uraniborg was a man with dwarfism named Jeppe, whom Tycho believed had the ability to predict the future, and he allegedly was able to correctly predict the chances of recovery or death of ill people in Hven.

Over the years he worked on Uraniborg, Tycho was assisted by a number of students and protegés, many of whom went on to their own careers in astronomy. Among them were Christian Sørensen Longomontanus, later one of the main proponents of the Tychonic model and Tycho&#x27;s replacement as royal Danish astronomer, Peder Flemløse, Elias Olsen Morsing, and Cort Aslakssøn. Tycho&#x27;s instrument-maker Hans Crol formed part of the scientific community on the island.

==== Great Comet of 1577 ====
Tycho observed the great comet that was visible in the Northern sky from November 1577 to January 1578. Within Lutheranism, it was commonly believed that celestial objects like comets were powerful portents, announcing the coming apocalypse. Several Danish amateur astronomers observed the object and published prophesies of impending doom. Tycho was able to determine that the comet&#x27;s distance to Earth was much greater than the distance of the Moon, so that the comet could not have originated in the &quot;earthly sphere&quot;, confirming his prior anti-Aristotelian conclusions about the fixed nature of the sky beyond the Moon.

Tycho realized that the comet&#x27;s tail was always pointing away from the Sun. He calculated its diameter, mass, and the length of its tail, and speculated about the material it was made of. Through nightly observations of the comet, Tycho Brahe estimated its closest approach to Earth at about 230 times the Earth&#x27;s radius. He also analyzed its motion, suggesting an orbit located between Mercury and Venus.

At this point, he had not yet broken with Copernican heliocentrism, and observing the comet inspired him to try to develop an alternative Copernican model, in which the Earth was immobile. Tycho Brahe&#x27;s comet observations challenged the prevailing theory of solid celestial spheres. With the comet likely traveling between Mercury and Venus, the notion of these rigid spheres became untenable. It suggested a vast emptiness where objects like the comet, potentially quite large, could move freely and exhibit properties unlike those previously understood. The second half of his manuscript about the comet dealt with the astrological and apocalyptic aspects of the comet. Tycho rejected the prophesies of his competitors. Instead, he made his own predictions of dire political events in the near future. Among his predictions was bloodshed in Moscow, and the imminent fall of Ivan the Terrible by 1583.

==== Support from the Crown ====
The support that Tycho received from the Crown was substantial, amounting to 1% of the annual total revenue at one point in the 1580s. Tycho often held large social gatherings in his castle. Pierre Gassendi wrote that Tycho had a tame elk and that his mentor the Landgrave Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel asked whether there was an animal faster than a deer. Tycho replied that there was none, but he could send his tame elk. When Wilhelm replied he would accept one in exchange for a horse, Tycho replied with the sad news that the elk had just died on a visit to entertain a nobleman at Landskrona. Apparently, during dinner, the elk had drunk a lot of beer, fallen down the stairs, and died.

Among the many noble visitors to Hven was James VI of Scotland, who married the Danish princess Anne. He gave gold coins to the ferryman and to the builders and workers at Tycho&#x27;s paper mill. After his visit to Hven in 1590, James wrote a poem comparing Tycho with Apollon and Phaethon.

As part of Tycho&#x27;s duties to the Crown, in exchange for his estate, he fulfilled the functions of a royal astrologer. At the beginning of each year, he had to present an Almanac to the court, predicting the influence of the stars on the political and economic prospects of the year. At the birth of each prince, he prepared their horoscopes, predicting their fates. He also worked as a cartographer with his former tutor Anders Sørensen Vedel on mapping out all of the Danish realm. An ally of the king and friendly with Queen Sophie, both his mother Beate Bille and adoptive mother Inger Oxe had been her court maids, he secured a promise from the King that ownership of Hven and Uraniborg would pass to his heirs.

====Publications, correspondence and scientific disputes====

In 1588, Tycho&#x27;s royal benefactor died, and a volume of Tycho&#x27;s great two-volume work (&quot;Introduction to the New Astronomy&quot;) was published. The first volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the reduction of the observations of 1572–73 involved much research to correct the stars&#x27; positions for refraction, precession, the motion of the Sun etc., and was not completed in Tycho&#x27;s lifetime. It was published in Prague in 1602–1603.

The second volume, titled (&quot;Second Book About Recent Phenomena in the Celestial World&quot;) and devoted to the comet of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588. Besides the comet observations, it included an account of Tycho&#x27;s system of the world. The third volume was intended to treat the comets of 1580 and following years in a similar manner. It was never published, or written, though a great deal of material about the comet of 1585 was put together and published in 1845 with the observations of this comet.

While at Uraniborg, Tycho maintained correspondence with scientists and astronomers across Europe. He inquired about other astronomers&#x27; observations and shared his own technological advances to help them achieve more accurate observations. Thus, his correspondence was crucial to his research. Often, correspondence was not just private communication between scholars, but also a way to disseminate results and arguments and to build progress and scientific consensus. Through correspondence, Tycho was involved in several personal disputes with critics of his theories. Prominent among them were John Craig, a Scottish physician who was a strong believer in the authority of the Aristotelian worldview, and Nicolaus Reimers Baer, known as Ursus, an astronomer at the Imperial court in Prague, whom Tycho accused of having plagiarized his cosmological model.

Craig refused to accept Tycho&#x27;s conclusion, that the comet of 1577 had to be located within the aetherial sphere, rather than within the atmosphere of Earth. Craig tried to contradict Tycho by using his own observations of the comet, and by questioning his methodology. Tycho published an &quot;apologia&quot; (a defense) of his conclusions, in which he provided additional arguments, as well as condemning Craig&#x27;s ideas in strong language for being incompetent. Another dispute concerned the mathematician Paul Wittich, who, after staying on Hven in 1580, taught Count Wilhelm of Kassel and his astronomer Christoph Rothmann to build copies of Tycho&#x27;s instruments without permission from Tycho. Craig, who had studied with Wittich, accused Tycho of minimizing Wittich&#x27;s role in developing some of the trigonometric methods used by Tycho. In his dealings with these disputes, Tycho made sure to leverage his support in the scientific community, by publishing and disseminating his own answers and arguments.

===Exile and later years===

When Frederick died in 1588, his son and heir Christian IV was only 11 years old. A regency council was appointed to rule for the young prince-elect until his coronation in 1596. The head of the council (Steward of the Realm) was Christoffer Valkendorff, who disliked Tycho after a conflict between them, and hence Tycho&#x27;s influence at the Danish court steadily declined. Feeling that his legacy on Hven was in peril, he approached the Dowager Queen Sophie and asked her to affirm in writing her late husband&#x27;s promise to endow Hven to Tycho&#x27;s heirs. 

He realized that the young king was more interested in war than in science, and was of no mind to keep his father&#x27;s promise. King Christian IV followed a policy of curbing the power of the nobility, by confiscating their estates to minimize their income bases, by accusing nobles of misusing their offices and of heresies against the Lutheran church. Tycho, who was known to sympathize with the Philippists, followers of Philip Melanchthon, was among the nobles who fell out of grace with the new king. The king&#x27;s unfavorable disposition towards Tycho was likely also a result of efforts by several of his enemies at court to turn the king against him.

In addition to Valkendorff, Tycho&#x27;s enemies included the king&#x27;s doctor Peter Severinus, who also had personal gripes with Tycho. Several gnesio-Lutheran Bishops suspected Tycho of heresya suspicion motivated by his known Philippist sympathies, his pursuits in medicine and alchemy, both of which he practiced without the church&#x27;s approval, and his prohibiting the local priest on Hven to include the exorcism in the baptismal ritual. Among the accusations raised against Tycho were his failure to adequately maintain the royal chapel at Roskilde, and his harshness and exploitation of the Hven peasantry.
Tycho became even more inclined to leave when a mob of commoners, possibly incited by his enemies at court, rioted in front of his house in Copenhagen. Tycho left Hven in 1597, bringing some of his instruments with him to Copenhagen, and entrusting others to a caretaker on the island. Shortly before leaving, he completed his star catalogue giving the positions of 1,000 stars. After some unsuccessful attempts at influencing the king to let him return, including showcasing his instruments on the wall of the city, he acquiesced to exile. He wrote his most famous poem, &quot;Elegy to Dania&quot; in which he chided Denmark for not appreciating his genius.

The instruments he had used in Uraniborg and Stjerneborg were depicted and described in detail in his star catalogue or &quot;Instruments for the restoration of astronomy&quot;, first published in 1598. The King sent two envoys to Hven to describe the instruments left behind by Tycho. Unversed in astronomy, the envoys reported to the king that the large mechanical contraptions such as his large quadrant and sextant were &quot;useless and even harmful&quot;.

From 1597 to 1598, he spent a year at the castle of his friend Heinrich Rantzau at Haus Wandesburg in Wandsbek outside Hamburg. Then they moved for a while to Wittenberg, where they stayed in the former home of Philip Melanchthon.

In 1599, he obtained the patronage of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and moved to Prague, as Imperial Court Astronomer. Tycho built a new observatory in a castle in Benátky nad Jizerou, 50 km from Prague, and worked there for one year. The emperor then brought him back to Prague, where he stayed until his death. At the imperial court even Tycho&#x27;s wife and children were treated like nobility, which they had never been at the Danish court.

Tycho received financial support from several nobles in addition to the emperor, including Oldrich Desiderius Pruskowsky von Pruskow, to whom he dedicated his famous . In return for their support, Tycho&#x27;s duties included preparing astrological charts and predictions for his patrons at events such as births, weather forecasting, and astrological interpretations of significant astronomical events, such as the supernova of 1572, sometimes called Tycho&#x27;s supernova, and the Great Comet of 1577.

====Relationship with Kepler====
In Prague, Tycho worked closely with Kepler, his assistant. Kepler was a convinced Copernican, and considered Tycho&#x27;s model to be mistaken, and derived from simple &quot;inversion&quot; of the Sun&#x27;s and Earth&#x27;s positions in the Copernican model. Together, the two worked on a new star catalogue based on his own accurate positionsthis catalogue became the &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot;. Also at the court in Prague was the mathematician Nicolaus Reimers (Ursus), with whom Tycho had previously corresponded, and who, like Tycho, had developed a geo-heliocentric planetary model, which Tycho considered to have been plagiarized from his own.

Kepler had previously spoken highly of Ursus, but now found himself in the problematic position of being employed by Tycho and having to defend his employer against Ursus&#x27; accusations, even though he disagreed with both of their planetary models. In 1600, he finished the tract (defense of Tycho against Ursus). Kepler had great respect for Tycho&#x27;s methods and the accuracy of his observations and considered him to be the new Hipparchus, who would provide the foundation for a restoration of the science of astronomy.

===Illness, death, and investigations===
Tycho suddenly contracted a bladder or kidney ailment after attending a banquet in Prague. He died eleven days later, on 24 October 1601, at the age of 54. According to Kepler&#x27;s first-hand account, Tycho had refused to leave the banquet to relieve himself because it would have been a breach of etiquette. After he returned home, he was no longer able to urinate, except eventually in very small quantities and with excruciating pain. The night before he died, he suffered from a delirium during which he was frequently heard to exclaim that he hoped he would not seem to have lived in vain. 

Before dying, he urged Kepler to finish the &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot; and expressed the hope that he would do so by adopting Tycho&#x27;s own planetary system, rather than that of the polymath Nicolaus Copernicus. It was reported that Tycho had written his own epitaph, &quot;He lived like a sage and died like a fool.&quot; A contemporary physician attributed his death to a kidney stone, but no kidney stones were found during an autopsy performed after his body was exhumed in 1901. Modern medical assessment is that his death was more likely caused by either a burst bladder, prostatic hypertrophy, acute prostatitis, or prostate cancer, which led to urinary retention, overflow incontinence, and uremia.

Investigations in the 1990s suggested that Tycho may not have died from urinary problems, but instead from mercury poisoning. It was speculated that he had been intentionally poisoned. The two main suspects were his assistant, Johannes Kepler, whose motives would be to gain access to Tycho&#x27;s laboratory and chemicals, and his cousin, Erik Brahe, at the order of friend-turned-enemy Christian IV, because of rumors that Tycho had had an affair with Christian&#x27;s mother.

In February 2010, the Prague city authorities approved a request by Danish scientists to exhume the remains, and in November 2010 a group of Czech and Danish scientists from Aarhus University collected bone, hair and clothing samples for analysis. The scientists, led by Jens Vellev, analyzed Tycho&#x27;s beard hair once again. The team reported in November 2012 that there was not enough mercury present to substantiate murder, and there were no lethal levels of any poisons present. The team&#x27;s conclusion was that &quot;it is impossible that Tycho Brahe could have been murdered&quot;. 

The findings were confirmed by scientists from the University of Rostock, who examined a sample of Tycho&#x27;s beard hairs that had been taken in 1901. Although traces of mercury were found, these were present only in the outer scales. Therefore, mercury poisoning as the cause of death was ruled out. The study suggests that the accumulation of mercury may have come from the &quot;precipitation of mercury dust from the air during [Tycho&#x27;s] long-term alchemistic activities&quot;. 

Tycho is buried in the Church of Our Lady before Týn, in Old Town Square near the Prague Astronomical Clock.

==Career: observing the heavens==

===Observational astronomy===

Tycho&#x27;s view of science was driven by his passion for accurate observations, and the quest for improved instruments of measurement drove his life&#x27;s work. Tycho was the last major astronomer to work without the aid of a telescope, soon to be turned skyward by Galileo Galilei and others. Given the limitations of the naked eye for making accurate observations, he devoted many of his efforts to improving the accuracy of the existing types of instrumentthe sextant and the quadrant. He designed larger versions of these instruments, which allowed him to achieve much higher accuracy. Because of the accuracy of his instruments, he quickly realized the influence of wind and the movement of buildings, and instead opted to mount his instruments underground directly on the bedrock.

Tycho&#x27;s observations of stellar and planetary positions were noteworthy both for their accuracy and quantity. With an accuracy approaching one arcminute, his celestial positions were much more accurate than those of any predecessor or contemporaryabout five times as accurate as the observations of Wilhelm of Hesse. asserts of Tycho&#x27;s Star Catalog D, &quot;In it, Tycho achieved, on a mass scale, a precision far beyond that of earlier catalogers. Cat D represents an unprecedented confluence of skills: instrumental, observational, &amp; computationalall of which combined to enable Tycho to place most of his hundreds of recorded stars to an accuracy of ordermag 1&#x27;!&quot;

He aspired to a level of accuracy in his estimated positions of celestial bodies of being consistently within an arcminute of their real celestial locations, and also claimed to have achieved this level. But, in fact, many of the stellar positions in his star catalogues were less accurate than that. The median errors for the stellar positions in his final published catalog were about 1.5&#x27;, indicating that only half of the entries were more accurate than that, with an overall mean error in each coordinate of around 2&#x27;. 

Although the stellar observations as recorded in his observational logs were more accurate, varying from 32.3&quot; to 48.8&quot; for different instruments, systematic errors of as much as 3&#x27; were introduced into some of the stellar positions Tycho published in his star catalogdue, for instance, to his application of an erroneous ancient value of parallax and his neglect of polestar refraction. Incorrect transcription in the final published star catalogue, by scribes in Tycho&#x27;s employ, was the source of even larger errors, sometimes by many degrees.

Celestial objects observed near the horizon and above appear with a greater altitude than the real one, due to atmospheric refraction, and one of Tycho&#x27;s most important innovations was that he worked out and published the very first tables for the systematic correction of this possible source of error. But, as advanced as they were, they attributed no refraction whatever above 45° altitude for solar refraction, and none for starlight above 20° altitude.

To perform the huge number of multiplications needed to produce much of his astronomical data, Tycho relied heavily on the then-new technique of &quot;prosthaphaeresis&quot;, an algorithm for approximating products based on trigonometric identities that predated logarithms.

===Instruments===

Many of Tycho&#x27;s observations and discoveries were done with the aid of various instruments, many of which he himself made. The process that went into creating and refining his devices was haphazard at first, but were critical in the advancement of his observations. He pioneered an early example while he was a student in Leipzig. While he was gazing at the stars he realized that he needed a better way to write down not just his observations but also the angles and descriptions as well. So, he pioneered the use of the observational. In this notebook, he made his observations and asked himself questions to try and answer later on. Tycho also made sketches of what he saw as well from comets to the motions of planets.

His astronomical instrument innovation continued after his schooling. When he gained access to his inheritance, he went straight to work creating brand new instruments to replace the ones he used as a student. Tycho created a quadrant that was thirty-nine centimeters in diameter and added a new type of sight to it called a &quot;pinnacidia&quot;, or light cutters as it is translated. This brand-new sight meant that the old pinhole style sight was rendered obsolete. When the sights of the pinnacidia were aligned in the correct manner the object that it is lined up with it will look exactly the same from both ends. This instrument was kept still on a heavy duty base and adjusted via a brass plumb line and thumb screws, all of which helped give Tycho Brahe more accurate measurements of the heavens.

There were times that the instruments Tycho made were for a specific purpose or an event that he was witness to. Such was the case in 1577 when he first started construction of what would be called Uraniborg. In that year a comet was spotted moving across the sky. During this period of time Tycho made many observations, and one of the instruments that he used to make his observations was called a brass azimuthal quadrant. At sixty-five centimeters in radius it was a large instrument built either in 1576 or 1577, just in time for Tycho to use it to observe the path and distance of the 1577 comet. This instrument helped him to accurately track the comet&#x27;s path as it crossed the orbits of the solar system.

A great many more instruments were constructed at Tycho Brahe&#x27;s new manor on Hven called Uraniborg. It was a combination of a home, observatories and laboratory where he made some of his discoveries along with many of his instruments. Several of these instruments were very large, such as a steel azimuth quadrant equipped with a brass arc that was six feet (or 194 centimeters) in diameter. This and other instruments were placed in the two observatories attached to the manor.

=== The Tychonic cosmological model ===

Although Tycho admired Copernicus and was the first to teach his theory in Denmark, he was unable to reconcile Copernican theory with the basic laws of Aristotelian physics, which he believed to be foundational. He was critical of the observational data that Copernicus built his theory on, which he correctly considered to be inaccurate. Instead, Tycho proposed a &quot;geo-heliocentric&quot; system in which the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth, while the other planets orbited the Sun. His system had many of the observational and computational advantages of Copernicus&#x27; system. It provided a safe position for those astronomers who were dissatisfied with older models, but reluctant to accept heliocentrism. 

It gained a following after 1616, when the Catholic Church declared the heliocentric model to be contrary to philosophy and Christian scripture, and only able to be discussed as a computational convenience. Tycho&#x27;s system offered a major innovation in that it eliminated the idea of transparent rotating crystalline spheres to carry the planets in their orbits. Kepler and other Copernican astronomers, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Tycho to adopt the heliocentric model of the Solar System. To Tycho, the idea of a moving Earth was &quot;in violation not only of all physical truth but also of the authority of Holy Scripture, which ought to be paramount.&quot;

Tycho held that the Earth was too sluggish and massive to be continuously in motion. According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens, whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending, were made of aether, a substance not found on Earth, that caused objects to move in a circle. By contrast, objects on Earth seem to have motion only when moved, and the natural state of objects on its surface was rest. Tycho said the Earth was an inert body, not readily moved. He acknowledged that the rising and setting of the Sun and stars could be explained by a rotating Earth, as Copernicus had said, still:

such a fast motion could not belong to the earth, a body very heavy and dense and opaque, but rather belongs to the sky itself whose form and subtle and constant matter are better suited to a perpetual motion, however fast.

Tycho believed that, if the Earth did orbit the Sun, there should be an observable stellar parallax every six months (the stars&#x27; positions would change thanks to Earth&#x27;s changing position). The lack of any stellar parallax was explained by the Copernican theory as being due to the stars&#x27; enormous distances from Earth. Tycho noted and attempted to measure the apparent relative sizes of the stars in the sky. He used geometry to show that the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the Sun to Saturn and to be seen at these distances the stars would have to be gigantic, at least as big as the orbit of the Earth, and of course vastly larger than the Sun. Tycho said:

Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.

Copernicans offered a religious response to Tycho&#x27;s geometry: titanic, distant stars might seem unreasonable, but they were not, for the Creator could make his creations that large if He wanted. In fact, Rothmann responded to this argument of Tycho&#x27;s by saying:

[W]hat is so absurd about [an average star] having size equal to the whole [orbit of the Earth]? What of this is contrary to divine will, or is impossible by divine Nature, or is inadmissible by infinite Nature? These things must be entirely demonstrated by you, if you will wish to infer from here anything of the absurd. These things that vulgar sorts see as absurd at first glance are not easily charged with absurdity, for in fact divine Sapience and Majesty is far greater than they understand. Grant the vastness of the Universe and the sizes of the stars to be as great as you likethese will still bear no proportion to the infinite Creator. It reckons that the greater the king, so much greater and larger the palace befitting his majesty. So how great a palace do you reckon is fitting to GOD?

Religion played a role in Tycho&#x27;s geocentrismhe cited the authority of scripture in portraying the Earth as being at rest. He rarely used Biblical arguments alone. To him they were a secondary objection to the idea of Earth&#x27;s motion, and over time he came to focus on scientific arguments, but he did take Biblical arguments seriously.

Tycho&#x27;s 1587 geo-heliocentric model differed from those of other geo-heliocentric astronomers, such as Wittich, Reimarus Ursus, Helisaeus Roeslin and David Origanus, in that the orbits of Mars and the Sun intersected. This was because Tycho had come to believe the distance of Mars from the Earth at opposition (that is, when Mars is on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun) was less than that of the Sun from the Earth. Tycho believed this because he came to believe Mars had a greater daily parallax than the Sun. In 1584, in a letter to a fellow astronomer, Brucaeus, he had claimed that Mars had been further than the Sun at the opposition of 1582, because he had observed that Mars had little or no daily parallax. He said he had therefore rejected Copernicus&#x27;s model because it predicted Mars would be at only two-thirds the distance of the Sun. 

He apparently later changed his mind to the opinion that Mars at opposition was indeed nearer the Earth than the Sun was, but apparently without any valid observational evidence in any discernible Martian parallax. Such intersecting Martian and solar orbits meant that there could be no solid rotating celestial spheres, because they could not possibly interpenetrate. Arguably, this conclusion was independently supported by the conclusion that the comet of 1577 was superlunary, because it showed less daily parallax than the Moon and thus must pass through any celestial spheres in its transit. While Tycho Brahe and his contemporaries lacked a fully developed alternative to Aristotelian physics, Brahe&#x27;s comet observations cast significant doubt on its validity. 

===Lunar theory===
Tycho&#x27;s distinctive contributions to lunar theory include his discovery of the variation of the Moon&#x27;s longitude. This represents the largest inequality of longitude after the equation of the center and the evection. He also discovered librations in the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit, relative to the ecliptic (which is not a constant of about 5° as had been believed before him, but fluctuates through a range of over a quarter of a degree), and accompanying oscillations in the longitude of the lunar node. These represent perturbations in the Moon&#x27;s ecliptic latitude. Tycho&#x27;s lunar theory doubled the number of distinct lunar inequalities, relative to those anciently known, and reduced the discrepancies of lunar theory to about a fifth of their previous amounts. It was published posthumously by Kepler in 1602, and Kepler&#x27;s own derivative form appears in Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot; of 1627.

=== Subsequent developments in astronomy ===
Kepler used Tycho&#x27;s records of the motion of Mars to deduce laws of planetary motion, enabling calculation of astronomical tables with unprecedented accuracy (the &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot;) and providing powerful support for a heliocentric model of the Solar System.
Galileo&#x27;s 1610 telescopic discovery that Venus shows a full set of phases refuted the pure geocentric Ptolemaic model. After that it seems 17th-century astronomy mostly converted to geo-heliocentric planetary models that could explain these phases just as well as the heliocentric model could, but without the latter&#x27;s disadvantage of the failure to detect any annual stellar parallax that Tycho and others regarded as refuting it. 

The three main geo-heliocentric models were the Tychonic, the Capellan with just Mercury and Venus orbiting the Sun such as favoured by Francis Bacon, for example, and the extended Capellan model of Riccioli with Mars also orbiting the Sun whilst Saturn and Jupiter orbit the fixed Earth. The Tychonic model was probably the most popular, albeit probably in what was known as &#x27;the semi-Tychonic&#x27; version with a daily rotating Earth. This model was advocated by Tycho&#x27;s ex-assistant and disciple Longomontanus, in his 1622 &quot;Astronomia Danica&quot;, that was the intended completion of Tycho&#x27;s planetary model with his observational data, and which was regarded as the canonical statement of the complete Tychonic planetary system. Longomontanus&#x27; work was published in several editions and used by many subsequent astronomers. Through him, the Tychonic system was adopted by astronomers as far away as China.

The ardent anti-heliocentric French astronomer Jean-Baptiste Morin devised a Tychonic planetary model with elliptical orbits published in 1650 in a simplified, Tychonic version of the &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot;. Another geocentric French astronomer, Jacques du Chevreul, rejected Tycho&#x27;s observations including his description of the heavens and the theory that Mars was below the Sun. Some acceptance of the Tychonic system persisted through the 17th century and in places until the early 18th century. It was supported after a 1633 decree about the Copernican controversy, by &quot;a flood of pro-Tycho literature&quot; of Jesuit origin. Among pro-Tycho Jesuits, Ignace Pardies declared in 1691 that it was still the commonly accepted system, and Francesco Blanchinus reiterated that as late as 1728. 

Persistence of the Tychonic system, especially in Catholic countries, has been attributed to its satisfaction of a need, relative to Catholic doctrine, for &quot;a safe synthesis of ancient and modern&quot;. After 1670, even many Jesuit writers only thinly disguised their Copernicanism. In Germany, the Netherlands, and England, the Tychonic system &quot;vanished from the literature much earlier&quot;.

James Bradley&#x27;s discovery of stellar aberration, published in 1729, eventually gave direct evidence excluding the possibility of all forms of geocentrism including Tycho&#x27;s. Stellar aberration could only be satisfactorily explained on the basis that the Earth is in annual orbit around the Sun, with an orbital velocity that combines with the finite speed of the light coming from an observed star or planet, to affect the apparent direction of the body observed.

===Work in medicine, alchemy and astrology===
Tycho worked in medicine and alchemy. He was influenced by the Swiss physician Paracelsus, who considered the human body to be directly affected by celestial bodies. Tycho used Paracelsus&#x27;s ideas to connect empiricism and natural science, and religion and astrology. Using his herbal garden at Uraniborg, Tycho produced recipes for herbal medicines, and used them to treat fever and plague. His herbal medicines were in use until the end of the 19th century. 

The expression &quot;Tycho Brahe days&quot; referred to &quot;unlucky days&quot; that were featured in almanacs from the 1700s onwards, but which have no direct connection to Tycho or his work. Whether because Tycho realized that astrology was not an empirical science, or because he feared religious repercussions, he did not publicise his own astrological work. For example, two of his more astrological treatises, one on weather predictions and an almanac, were published in the names of his assistants, in spite of the fact that he worked on them personally. Some scholars have argued that he lost faith in horoscope astrology over the course of his career, and others that he simply changed his public communication on the topic as he realized that connections with astrology could influence the reception of his empirical astronomical work.

==Legacy==

===Biographies===

The first biography of Tycho, which was also the first full-length biography of any scientist, was written by Gassendi in 1654. In 1779, Tycho de Hoffmann wrote of Tycho&#x27;s life in his history of the Brahe family. In 1913, Dreyer published Tycho&#x27;s collected works, facilitating further research. Early modern scholarship on Tycho tended to see the shortcomings of his astronomical model, painting him as a mysticist recalcitrant in accepting the Copernican revolution, and valuing mostly his observations that allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of planetary movement. Especially in Danish scholarship, Tycho was depicted as a mediocre scholar and a traitor to the nationperhaps because of the important role in Danish historiography of Christian IV as a warrior king. 

In the second half of the 20th century, scholars began reevaluating his significance, and studies by Kristian Peder Moesgaard, Owen Gingerich, Robert Westman, Victor E. Thoren, John R. Christianson and C. Doris Hellman focused on his contributions to science, and demonstrated that while he admired Copernicus he was simply unable to reconcile his basic theory of physics with the Copernican view. Christianson&#x27;s work showed the influence of Tycho&#x27;s Uraniborg as a training center for scientists who after studying with Tycho went on to make contributions in various scientific fields.

===Scientific legacy===
Although Tycho&#x27;s planetary model was soon discredited, his astronomical observations were an essential contribution to the scientific revolution. The traditional view of Tycho is that he was primarily an empiricist who set new standards for precise and objective measurements. This appraisal originated in Gassendi&#x27;s 1654 biography, &quot;Tychonis Brahe, equitis Dani, astronomorum coryphaei, vita&quot;. It was furthered by Dreyer&#x27;s biography in 1890, which was long the most influential work on Tycho. According to historian of science Helge Kragh, this assessment grew out of Gassendi&#x27;s opposition to Aristotelianism and Cartesianism, and fails to account for the diversity of Tycho&#x27;s activities.

The Tycho Brahe Prize, inaugurated in 2008, is awarded annually by the European Astronomical Society in recognition of the pioneering development or exploitation of European astronomical instrumentation, or major discoveries based largely on such instruments.

===Cultural legacy===
Tycho&#x27;s discovery of the new star was the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; magazine published an article by Donald Olson, Marilynn S. Olson and Russell L. Doescher arguing, in part, that Tycho&#x27;s supernova was also the same &quot;star that&#x27;s westward from the pole&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Tycho is directly referenced in Sarah Williams&#x27; poem : &quot;Reach me down my Tycho Brahé,I would know him when we meet&quot;. Though, the poem&#x27;s oft quoted line comes later: &quot;Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; / I have loved the stars too truly to be fearful of the night.&quot; 

Alfred Noyes in his &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot; (the first part of &quot;The Torch-bearers&quot; of 1922) included a long biographical poem in honour of Brahe, elaborating on the known history in a highly romantic and imaginative way.

The lunar crater Tycho is named in his honour, as is the crater Tycho Brahe on Mars and the minor planet 1677 Tycho Brahe in the asteroid belt. The bright supernova, SN 1572, is also known as Tycho&#x27;s Nova and the Tycho Brahe Planetarium in Copenhagen is also named after him, as is the palm genus &quot;Brahea&quot;.

<text>The A-Team is an American action-adventure television series that ran on NBC from January 23, 1983 to March 8, 1987, about a fictitious United States Army Special Forces team who were imprisoned by a court martial for a crime they did not commit, but escaped to Los Angeles. They found work as soldiers of fortune, while trying to clear their names and avoid capture by the authorities. The series was created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo and was a joint production of Universal Television and Stephen J. Cannell Productions for NBC. A feature film based on the series was released by 20th Century Fox in 2010.

==History==
&quot;The A-Team&quot; was created by writers and producers Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo at the behest of Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment&#x27;s president. Cannell was fired from ABC in the early 1980s, after failing to produce a hit show for the network, and was hired by NBC; his first project was &quot;The A-Team&quot;. Tartikoff pitched the series to Cannell as a combination of &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;Mad Max&quot;, and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, with &quot;Mr. T driving the car&quot;.

&quot;The A-Team&quot; was not considered commercially promising, although Cannell has said that George Peppard suggested it would be a huge hit &quot;before we ever turned on a camera&quot;. The show became popular; the first regular episode, which aired after Super Bowl XVII on January 30, 1983, reached 26.4% of the television audience, placing fourth in the top 10 Nielsen-rated shows.

The show is prominent in popular culture for its cartoonish violence (with few injuries even with heavy weapons), formulaic episodes, the team&#x27;s ingenuity in improvising weaponry and vehicles out of seemingly random parts, and its distinctive theme song. The show boosted the career of Mr. T, who portrayed the show&#x27;s initial central character B. A. Baracus. Some of the show&#x27;s catchphrases, such as &quot;I love it when a plan comes together&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&#x27;s on the jazz&quot;, and &quot;I ain&#x27;t gettin&#x27; on no plane!&quot; have appeared on T-shirts and other merchandise.

The term &quot;A-Team&quot; is a nickname coined for the Operational Detachments Alpha (ODA) of the U.S. Special Forces during the Vietnam War. The U.S. Army Special Forces still uses the term ODA for its 12-man direct operations teams.

In a Yahoo! survey of 1,000 US television viewers published in October 2003, &quot;The A-Team&quot; was voted the &quot;oldie&quot; television show viewers would most like to see revived, beating such popular television series from the 1980s as &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;The A-Team&quot; has a standard plot structure of independent episodes with few references to past events, and few overarching stories except the characters&#x27; continuing motivation to clear their names. In explaining the ratings drop during the show&#x27;s fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt complained that &quot;the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome&quot;. Reporter Adrian Lee called the plots &quot;stunningly simple&quot; in a 2006 article for &quot;The Express&quot; (UK newspaper), citing such recurring elements &quot;as BA&#x27;s fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items&quot;. The show became emblematic of &quot;fit-for-TV warfare&quot; due to its depiction of ferocious combat scenes with lethal weapons, where the participants are never killed and rarely seriously injured, with the notable exception of General Fulbright. (&quot;See also&quot; On-screen violence section.)

As the television ratings of &quot;The A-Team&quot; fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show&#x27;s final season in 1986–87 to increase viewership. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative, propositions them to work for him. In exchange, he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions.

===Connections to the Vietnam War===
As a back story, the members of the A-Team were originally members of the 5th Special Forces Group during the Vietnam War. In the episode &quot;Bad Time on the Border&quot;, Lieutenant Colonel John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith called them &quot;ex-Green Berets&quot;. Their commanding officer Colonel Morrison ordered them to rob the Bank of Hanoi to help end the war. They succeeded, but on their return to base four days after the end of the war, they discovered that Morrison had been killed by the enemy and his headquarters burned down, destroying the proof that the A-Team were acting under orders. They were arrested, and imprisoned at Fort Bragg, from which they quickly escaped before trial.

An article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; (UK) published shortly after the premiere of &quot;The A-Team&quot; in the United Kingdom, characterized it as an idealization of the Vietnam War, and an example of the war slowly becoming accepted and assimilated into American culture.

==Episodes==
The show ran for five seasons on the NBC television network, from January 23, 1983, to December 30, 1986 (with one additional, previously unbroadcast episode shown on March 8, 1987), for a total of 98 episodes.

==Characters==

&quot;The A-Team&quot; revolves around the four members of a former commando outfit, now mercenaries. Their leader is Lieutenant Colonel John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith (George Peppard), whose plans tend to be unorthodox but effective. Lieutenant Templeton Peck (Dirk Benedict in the TV series, Tim Dunigan appeared as Templeton Peck in the pilot), usually called &quot;Face&quot; or &quot;Faceman&quot;, is a smooth-talking con man who is second-in-command, and the appropriator of vehicles and other useful items. The team&#x27;s pilot is Captain H.M. &quot;Howling Mad&quot; Murdock (Dwight Schultz), who has been declared insane and lives in a Veterans&#x27; Affairs mental institution for the first four seasons. The team&#x27;s strong man and mechanic is Sergeant First Class Bosco &quot;B.A.&quot;, or &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;, Baracus (Mr. T).

Until the first half of the second season, the team was assisted by reporter Amy Amanda Allen (Melinda Culea). In the second half of the second season, Allen was replaced by fellow reporter Tawnia Baker (Marla Heasley). The character of Tia Fulbright (Tia Carrere), a Vietnam war orphan now living in the United States, was meant to join the team in the fifth season, but she was replaced by Frankie Santana (Eddie Velez), who served as the team&#x27;s special effects expert. Velez was added to the opening credits of the fifth season after its second episode.

===Casting===
Although the part of Face was written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell with Dirk Benedict in mind, NBC insisted that the part should be played by another actor. Therefore, in the pilot, Face was portrayed by Tim Dunigan, who was later replaced by Benedict, with the comment that Dunigan was &quot;too tall and too young&quot;. According to Dunigan: &quot;I look even younger on camera than I am. So it was difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended when I was a sophomore in high school.&quot;

Tia Carrere was intended to join the principal cast of the show in its fifth season after appearing in the season four finale, providing a tie to the team&#x27;s inception during the war. Unfortunately for this plan, Carrere was under contract to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, which prevented her from joining &quot;The A-Team&quot;. Her character was abruptly dropped as a result.

According to Mr. T in &quot;Bring Back... The A-Team&quot; in 2006, the role of B. A. Baracus was written specifically for him. This is corroborated by Cannell&#x27;s own account of the initial concept proposed by Tartikoff.

James Coburn, who co-starred in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, was considered for the role of Hannibal in &quot;The A-Team&quot;, and George Peppard (Hannibal) was the original consideration for the role of Vin (played by Steve McQueen instead) in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 scores 53% (19 reviews), and season 5 scores 60% (5 reviews).

===Awards===
&quot;The A-Team&quot; was nominated for three Emmy Awards: in 1983 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the pilot episode, in 1984 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the episode &quot;When You Comin&#x27; Back, Range Rider?&quot;, and in 1987 (Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series) for the episode &quot;Firing Line&quot;.

===Ratings===
During the show&#x27;s first three seasons, &quot;The A-Team&quot; viewership included an average of 20% to 24% of all American television households. The first regular episode (&quot;Children of Jamestown&quot;), reached 26.4% of the television watching audience, placing fourth in the top 10 rated shows, according to the Nielsen ratings. By March, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, now on its regular Tuesday timeslot, dropped to the eighth spot, but rated a 20.5%. During the sweeps week in May of that year, &quot;The A-Team&quot; dropped again but remained steady at 18.5%, and rose to 18.8% during the second week of May sweeps. These were the highest ratings NBC had achieved in five years. During the second season, the ratings continued to soar, reaching fourth place in the twenty-highest rated programs, behind &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, in January (mid-season), while during the third season, it was beaten out only by two other NBC shows, including &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.

In the fourth season, &quot;The A-Team&quot; experienced a dramatic fall in ratings, as it started to lose its position while television viewership increased. As such, the ratings, while stable, were relatively lower. The season premiere ranked a 17.4% (a 26% audience share on that timeslot) on the Nielsen Rating scale, but ratings quickly declined after that. In October, &quot;The A-Team&quot; had fallen to 19th and by Super Bowl Night had fallen further, to 29th on the night where the show had originally scored its first hit three years earlier. For the remainder of its fourth season &quot;The A-Team&quot; managed to hang around the 20th spot, far from the top 10 position it had enjoyed during its first three seasons.

After four years on Tuesday, NBC moved &quot;The A-Team&quot; to a new timeslot on Friday for what would be its final season. Ratings continued to drop, and &quot;The A-Team&quot; later fall out of the top 50. In November 1986, NBC canceled the series, declining to order the last nine episodes of what would have been a 22-episode season. The final season ranked 61st with a 12.8 average rating.

===International===
&quot;The A-Team&quot; has been broadcast worldwide and international response has been varied. In 1984, main cast members George Peppard, Mr. T, Dirk Benedict, and Dwight Schultz were invited to the Netherlands. Peppard was the first to receive the invitation and thus thought the invitation applied only to him. When the other cast members were also invited, Peppard declined. The immense turn-out for the stars was unforeseen, and they were forced to leave early as a security measure. A video was released in which Schultz apologised and thanked everyone who had attended.

Although ratings soared during its early seasons, many US television critics described the show largely as cartoonish and thereby wrote the series off. Most reviews focused on acting and the formulaic nature of the episodes, most prominently the absence of actual killing in a show about Vietnam War veterans.

The show was a huge hit in Italy in the mid-1980s to the 1990s. In Indonesia, &quot;The A-Team&quot; also gained success as a big hit since the television network RCTI aired the show in December 1989 until 1994.

==On-screen violence==
The violence presented in &quot;The A-Team&quot; is highly sanitized. People do not have visible wounds and blood though they might have a limp and sling, nor does the A-Team kill people. The results of violence are only ever presented when required for the script. After almost every car crash, there is a brief shot showing the occupants of the vehicle climbing out of the mangled or burning wreck, even in helicopter crashes. However, more of these types of takes were dropped near the end of the fourth season. According to co-creator Stephen J. Cannell, this part of the show became a running joke for the writing staff and they would at times test the limits of believability on purpose.

The show has been described as cartoonish and likened to &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. Dean P. of the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; described the violence in the show as &quot;hypocritical&quot; and that &quot;the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored. After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects.&quot; Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A-Team used &quot;antineutron bullets—they destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being&quot;. According to certain estimates, an episode of &quot;The A-Team&quot; held up to 46 violent acts. Cannell responded: &quot;They were determined to make a point, and we were too big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue.&quot; Originally, &quot;The A-Team&#x27;s&quot; status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; and &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a 1986 article that &quot;...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety&quot;.

==GMC Vandura==

The 1983 GMC Vandura van used by the A-Team, with its characteristic red stripe, black and red turbine mag wheels, and rooftop spoiler, is an enduring pop culture icon. The customized 1994 GMC van in &quot;The A-Team&quot; movie was displayed at the 2010 New York International Auto Show.

==Merchandise==
The huge success of the series yielded a vast array of merchandise, including toys, video games, and snacks released worldwide. This includes several sets of trading cards and stickers, action figures from Galoob, B.A.&#x27;s van, Face&#x27;s Corvette, helicopters, trucks, and jeeps from model car manufacturer Ertl. It includes jigsaw puzzles, View-Master reels, an electric race car track, and a TYCO produced train set. Following the original cancellation of the series, further merchandise has appeared as the series has achieved cult status, including an &quot;A-Team&quot; van by Hot Wheels. In 2016, Lego released a pack that includes a B.A. Baracus minifigure and constructible van, which unlocks additional &quot;A-Team&quot; themed content in the video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, including all four team members as playable characters.

===Comics===
Marvel Comics produced a three-issue &quot;A-Team&quot; comic book series, which was later reprinted as a trade paperback. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, an &quot;A-Team&quot; comic strip appeared for several years in the 1980s as part of the children&#x27;s television magazine and comic &quot;Look-In&quot;, to tie in with the British run of the series. It was preceded by a short run in the final year (1984) of &quot;TV Comic&quot;.

===Books===
Several novels are based on the series, the first six published in America by Dell and in Britain by Target Books, and the last four only published in Britain. The first six are credited to Charles Heath. The books are generally found in paperback form, although hardback copies (with different cover artwork) were also released.
* &quot;The A-Team&quot; (adapted from the pilot written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell)
* &quot;Small But Deadly Wars&quot; (adapted from the episodes &quot;A Small and Deadly War&quot; written by Lupo and &quot;Black Day at Bad Rock&quot; written by Patrick Hasburgh)
* &quot;When You Comin&#x27; Back, Range Rider?&quot; (adapted from the episode of the same name written by Lupo)
* &quot;Old Scores to Settle&quot; (adapted from the episodes &quot;The Only Church in Town&quot; written by Babs Greyhosky and &quot;Recipe for Heavy Bread&quot; written by Cannell, although the novel features the latter episode first)

In the United Kingdom from 1985 to 1988, four Annuals were produced, each consisting of text and comic strip stories, puzzles, and photos of the show&#x27;s stars, with a further one produced by Marvel Comics consisting of several reprinted comic strips, released in 1989 and 1990.

A Panini set of stickers, which adapt six TV episodes (from the first and earlier second season) using shots from the episodes, can be stuck into an accompanying book, with text under each inserted sticker to narrate the story.

===Theme song and soundtrack===
The original main theme composed by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter (in a performance credited to Post) was released on the vinyl LP &quot;Mike Post – Television Theme Songs&quot; (Elektra Records E1-60028Y, 1982) and again on the &quot;Mike Post – Mike Post&quot; LP (RCA Records AFL1-5183, 1984), both long out-of-print; however, this was not the same version of the theme as on-screen. The theme from seasons two through four (including the opening narration and sound effects), was also released on TVT&#x27;s &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits: 70s and 80s&quot;. A 7-inch single of the song credited to Post was released on RCA in 1984.

The French version of the song has lyrics, which mirror the spoken description of the show in the English opening credits. The theme has been ranked among the best TV themes ever, with TV weatherman Al Roker sharing that opinion, and using the song to &quot;get jazzed up&quot; in the morning.

Though no original music other than the theme has been released, in 1984 EMI issued an album of re-recorded material from the series conducted by Daniel Caine, reissued by Silva Screen on compact disc in 1999, SILVAD 3509.

===Video games===
Video games were released for numerous platforms, mostly as shooter games.

In 1985, &quot;The A-Team&quot; was published and released on the Commodore 64 by Courbois Software. It is an action game, in the form of a top-down shooter, in which players assume the role of an unnamed soldier charged with doing battle against the A-Team in the form large floating heads. Players are positioned on the bottom portion of the screen and move left and right, shooting upwards at the A-team as they move left to right, each with their own attack pattern based on the personalities of each character. The player eliminates each member by shooting them enough times, defeating each one to end a round with the process repeated with each round being harder than the last. Players have three lives and are killed on one hit. The game is endless meaning there is no way to complete it. The only achievement during prolonged play is getting the highest score. A strange notable trait this game has the digitized version of the main theme for &quot;Star Wars&quot; that plays on the title screen instead of &quot;The A-Team&#x27;s&quot; theme.

In 1989, &quot;El Equipo A&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The A-Team&quot;) was developed and published by Zafiro Software Division as a side scrolling shooter for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MS-DOS, and MSX. Gameplay consists of levels scrolling to the left or right depending on the level as players shoot various enemies such as soldiers, tanks, and jeeps while avoiding shooting innocent civilians and the A-Team as they appear on screen. The game is only in Spanish and from most of the gameplay, low quality, and different graphics, the game is a bootleg version of &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; each based the original&#x27;s respective platforms that manages to reuse many of their same overall mechanics as a whole.

On June 15, 2010, &quot;The A-Team&quot; was released by GameHouse and RealNetworks under Fox Digital Entertainment and is based on the 2010 film for the iPhone as an overhead scrolling, third person, action shooter with cover based mechanics for the purpose of marketing the film. Players control the A-team as they battle enemies with melee hand-to-hand or ranged weapon combat and can switch between each member during levels. Some levels allowed players to control an attack helicopter the shoot enemies and destroy objects. Voice-overs from B.A. Baracus are portrayed by Quinton Jackson from the film.

==Production==
===Filming===
The series was co-produced by former actor John Ashley who narrated the movie.

===Weapons===
In early episodes, the team used Colt AR-15 SP1 semi-automatic rifles (with automatic sound effects, simulating the M16), while in later seasons they used the Ruger Mini-14, and on rare occasions, the selective fire AC-556K variant of the Mini-14. Hannibal is also seen using an M60 machine gun (which Hannibal called &quot;Baby&quot;) in some episodes as well as a Micro-uzi. MAC-11s with parts added to simulate the Uzi appear in at least two early episodes. Hannibal&#x27;s sidearms are either a nickel-plated Smith &amp; Wesson Model 59, or a stainless steel Smith &amp; Wesson Model 639. Unusually in the episode &quot;Black Day at Bad Rock&quot; he is seen carrying a Browning Hi-Power. Face&#x27;s usual sidearm is a Colt Lawman Mk III, though he does use Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers in latter seasons. Many antagonists and members of the team use 1911s as well. Starting from Season 4, the then-exotic Steyr AUG bullpup rifle also became prominent in the series. &quot;So many different firearms were used in the 1980s hit &quot;The A-Team&quot; that it&#x27;s impossible to list them all. For five seasons, the wrongly accused foursome used rifles, handguns, submachine guns and shotguns to bring justice for the little guy while trying to stay out of jail. Regardless of the number of explosions or rounds fired, nobody ever got seriously hurt except for the occasional flesh wound of a team member.&quot; The &quot;American Rifleman&quot; declared &quot;The A-Team&quot; the Number One Show on Television to regularly feature firearms.

==Home media==
Universal Studios has released all five seasons of &quot;The A-Team&quot; on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4. In Region 2, a complete series set titled &quot;The A-Team—The Ultimate Collection&quot; was released on October 8, 2007. A complete series set was released in Region 1 on June 8, 2010 including 25 discs packaged in a replica of the black van. The complete series set was released in Region 4 on November 3, 2010. All 5 seasons were re-released in Region 2 with new packaging on June 21, 2010. The series was remastered and released on Blu-ray disc in the United Kingdom by Fabulous Films on October 17, 2016.

==Legacy==
===&quot;Bring Back... The A-Team&quot; (2006)===
On May 18, 2006, Channel 4 in the UK attempted to reunite the surviving cast members of &quot;The A-Team&quot; for the show &quot;Bring Back...&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Bring Back...The A-Team&quot;. Justin Lee Collins presented the challenge, securing interviews and appearances from Dirk Benedict, Dwight Schultz, Marla Heasley, Jack Ging, series co-creator Stephen Cannell, and Mr. T.

Collins eventually united Benedict, Schultz, Heasley, Ging and Cannell, along with William Lucking, Lance LeGault, and George Peppard&#x27;s son, Christian. Mr. T was unable to make the meeting, which took place in the Friar&#x27;s Club in Beverly Hills, but he appeared on the show for a brief talk with Collins.

===Feature film===

A feature film based on &quot;The A-Team&quot; was released on June 11, 2010, and was produced by 20th Century Fox. The film stars Liam Neeson as Hannibal, Bradley Cooper as Faceman, Quinton Jackson as B.A. and Sharlto Copley as Murdock with Jessica Biel as the team&#x27;s ally and Patrick Wilson as the film&#x27;s villain, Agent Lynch while both Dirk Benedict (Faceman) and Dwight Schultz (Murdock) made brief cameo appearances in the film (as a prisoner using a sunbed and a psychiatrist overseeing Murdock&#x27;s shock therapy, respectively); because of timing issues, these scenes were moved to the end of the credits. They were later reinserted for the extended-cut of the film.

===Reboot series===

In September 2015, Fox announced the development of a reboot &quot;A-Team&quot; series with Chris Morgan as executive producer with Cannell&#x27;s daughter, Tawnia McKiernan, and Albert Kim writing. The team has male and female characters.

<text>Sir Terence David John Pratchett (28 April 1948 – 12 March 2015) was an English author, humorist, and satirist, best known for the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of 41 comic fantasy novels published between 1983 and 2015, and for the apocalyptic comedy novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; (1990), which he co-wrote with Neil Gaiman.

Pratchett&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Carpet People&quot;, was published in 1971. The first &quot;Discworld&quot; novel, &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, was published in 1983, after which Pratchett wrote an average of two books a year. The final &quot;Discworld&quot; novel, &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, was published in August 2015, five months after his death.

With more than 100 million books sold worldwide in 43 languages, Pratchett was the UK&#x27;s best-selling author of the 1990s. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and was knighted for services to literature in the 2009 New Year Honours. In 2001, he won the annual Carnegie Medal for &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;, the first &quot;Discworld&quot; book marketed for children. He received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010.

In December 2007 Pratchett announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He later made a substantial public donation to the Alzheimer&#x27;s Research Trust (now Alzheimer&#x27;s Research UK, ARUK), filmed three television programmes chronicling his experiences with the condition for the BBC, and became a patron of ARUK. Pratchett died on 12 March 2015, at the age of 66.

==Early life and education==
Pratchett was born on 28 April 1948 in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, England, the only child of David (1921–2006), a mechanic, and Eileen Pratchett (1922–2010), a secretary, of Hay-on-Wye. His maternal grandparents came from Ireland. Pratchett attended Holtspur School, where he was bullied for his speech impediments. He was bothered by the head teacher, who, he said, thought &quot;he could tell how successful you were going to be in later life by how well you could read or write at the age of six&quot;.

Pratchett&#x27;s family moved to Bridgwater, Somerset, briefly in 1957. He passed his eleven plus exam in 1958, earning a place at High Wycombe Technical High School, where he was a key member of the debating society and wrote stories for the school magazine. Pratchett described himself as a &quot;non-descript&quot; student and, in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry, credited his education to the Beaconsfield Public Library.

Pratchett&#x27;s early interests included astronomy. He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space, owned a telescope and wanted to be an astronomer, but lacked the necessary mathematical skills. He developed an interest in science fiction and attended science fiction conventions from about 1963–1964, but stopped a few years later when he got his first job as a trainee journalist at the local paper. His early reading included the works of H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and &quot;every book you really ought to read&quot;, which he later regarded as &quot;getting an education&quot;.

Pratchett published his first short story, &quot;Business Rivals&quot;, in the High Wycombe Technical School&#x27;s magazine in 1962. It is the tale of a man named Crucible who finds the Devil in his flat in a cloud of sulphurous smoke. &quot;The Hades Business&quot; was published in the school magazine when he was 13, and published commercially when he was 15.

Pratchett earned five O-levels and started A-level courses in Art, English and History. His initial career choice was journalism and he left school at 17, in 1965, to start an apprenticeship with Arthur Church, the editor of the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot;. In this position he wrote, among other things, more than 80 stories for the &quot;Children&#x27;s Circle&quot; section under the name Uncle Jim. Two of the stories contain characters found in his novel &quot;The Carpet People&quot; (1971). While on from his apprenticeship, Pratchett finished his A-Level in English and took the National Council for the Training of Journalists proficiency course.

==Career==
In 1968 Pratchett interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director of a small publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. Pratchett mentioned that he had written a manuscript, &quot;The Carpet People&quot;. Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by Pratchett. It received strong, although few, reviews and was followed by the science fiction novels &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot; (1976) and &quot;Strata&quot; (1981). In the 1970s and 1980s, Pratchett published stories in a regional newspaper under the pseudonym Patrick Kearns.

After various positions in journalism, in 1979 Pratchett became press officer for the South West Region of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in an area that covered three nuclear power stations. He later joked that he had demonstrated &quot;impeccable timing&quot; by making this career change so soon after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania, US, and said he would &quot;write a book about his experiences if he thought anyone would actually believe them&quot;.

The first &quot;Discworld&quot; novel, &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, was published in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983. Pratchett gave up working for the CEGB to make his living through writing in 1987, after finishing the fourth &quot;Discworld&quot; novel, &quot;Mort&quot;. His sales increased quickly and many of his books occupied top places on bestseller lists; he was the UK&#x27;s bestselling author of the 1990s. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Pratchett was the top-selling and highest earning UK author in 1996. Some of his books have been published by Doubleday, another Transworld imprint. In the United States, where his books are published by HarperCollins, Pratchett had poorer sales, marketing and distribution until 2005, when &quot;Thud!&quot; reached the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

According to the &quot;Bookseller&#x27;s Pocket Yearbook&quot; (2005), in 2003 Pratchett&#x27;s UK sales amounted to 3.4% of the fiction market by hardback sales and 3.8% by value, putting him in second place behind J. K. Rowling (6% and 5.6%, respectively), while in the paperback sales list Pratchett came 5th with 1.2% and 1.3% by value (behind James Patterson (1.9% and 1.7%), Alexander McCall Smith, John Grisham and J. R. R. Tolkien). He has UK sales of more than 2.5 million copies a year. His 2011 &quot;Discworld&quot; novel &quot;Snuff&quot; became the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. As of 2023, Pratchett&#x27;s works have sold more than 100 million copies in 43 languages.

==Personal life==
Pratchett married Lyn Purves at the Congregational Church, Gerrards Cross, on 5 October 1968. They moved to Rowberrow, Somerset, in 1970. Their daughter Rhianna Pratchett, also a writer, was born there in 1976. In 1993 the family moved to Broad Chalke, a village west of Salisbury, Wiltshire.

Pratchett was the patron of the Friends of High Wycombe Library. In 2013 he gave a talk at Beaconsfield Library, which he had visited as a child, and donated the income from the event to it. He also visited his former school to speak to the students.

Pratchett often wore large black hats, in a style described as &quot;more that of urban cowboy than city gent&quot;. Concern for the future of civilisation prompted him to install five kilowatts of photovoltaic cells (for solar energy) at his house in 2007.

Pratchett had an observatory built in his back garden and was a keen astronomer from childhood. He made a 2005 appearance on the BBC programme &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; and appeared on the 50th anniversary of the show in 2007. He travelled on a cruise ship from Taiwan to watch the 2009 solar eclipse.

===Computing===
Pratchett started to use computers for writing as soon as they were available to him. His first computer was a ZX81; the first computer he used properly for writing was an Amstrad CPC 464, later replaced by an IBM PC compatible. Pratchett was one of the first authors to routinely use the Internet to communicate with fans, and was a contributor to the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett from 1992. However, he did not consider the Internet a hobby, just another &quot;thing to use&quot;. He had many computers in his house, with a bank of six monitors to ease writing. When he travelled, he always took a portable computer, originally a 1992 Olivetti Quaderno, with him to write.

In a 1995 interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Pratchett expressed concern about the potential spread of misinformation online. He felt that there was a &quot;kind of parity of esteem of information&quot; on the internet, and gave the example of Holocaust denial being presented on the same terms as peer-reviewed research, with no easy way to gauge reliability. Gates disagreed, saying that online authorities would index and check facts and sources in a much more sophisticated way than in print. The interview was rediscovered in 2019, and seen by Pratchett&#x27;s biographer as prescient of fake news.

Pratchett was an avid video game player, and collaborated in the creation of a number of game adaptations of his books. He favoured games that are &quot;intelligent and have some depth&quot;, citing &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004) and fan missions for &quot;Thief&quot; as examples. The red army in &quot;Interesting Times&quot; prompted comparisons to the 1991 puzzle game &quot;Lemmings&quot;. When asked about this connection, Pratchett said: &quot;Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can&#x27;t imagine how anyone thought that ... Not only did I wipe &quot;Lemmings&quot; from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn&#x27;t get it back.&quot; He described &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; (2006) as his favourite video game, saying that he used many of its non-combat-oriented fan-made mods, and contributed to the development of at least one popular fan-made mod.

===Natural history===
Pratchett had a fascination with natural history that he referred to many times, and he owned a greenhouse full of carnivorous plants. He described them in the biographical notes on the dust jackets of some of his books, and elsewhere, as &quot;not as interesting as people think&quot;. By &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; the account had become that &quot;he used to grow carnivorous plants, but now they&#x27;ve taken over the greenhouse and he avoids going in&quot;.

In 1995, a fossil of a sea-turtle from the Eocene epoch of New Zealand was named &quot;Psephophorus terrypratchetti&quot; in his honour by the palaeontologist Richard Köhler.

In 2016, Pratchett fans unsuccessfully petitioned the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to name chemical element 117, temporarily called &quot;ununseptium&quot;, as &quot;octarine&quot; with the proposed symbol Oc (pronounced &quot;ook&quot;). The final name chosen for element 117 was &quot;tennessine&quot; with the symbol Ts.

Pratchett was a trustee for the Orangutan Foundation but was pessimistic about the future of orangutans. His activities included visiting Borneo with a Channel 4 film crew to make an episode of &quot;Jungle Quest&quot; in 1995, seeing orangutans in their natural habitat. Following Pratchett&#x27;s lead, fan events such as the Discworld Conventions have adopted Orangutan Foundation as their nominated charity, which has been acknowledged by the foundation. One of Pratchett&#x27;s most popular fictional characters, the Librarian, is a wizard who was transformed into an orangutan in a magical accident and decides to remain in that condition as it is so convenient for his work.

===Views on religion===
Pratchett, who was brought up in a Church of England family, described himself as an atheist and a humanist. He was a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association) and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society.

Pratchett wrote that he read the Old Testament as a child and &quot;was horrified&quot;, but liked the New Testament and thought that Jesus &quot;had a lot of good things to say ... But I could never see the two testaments as one coherent narrative&quot;. He then read &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, which &quot;all made perfect sense ... Evolution was far more thrilling to me than the biblical account.&quot; He said that he had never disliked religion and thought it had a purpose in human evolution. In an interview Pratchett cites a quotation from the protagonist in his novel &quot;Nation&quot;, &quot;It is better to build a seismograph than to worship the volcano&quot;, a statement Pratchett said he agreed with.

Pratchett told &quot;The Times&quot; in 2008: &quot;I believe in the same God that Einstein did ... And it is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that on the other side of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows.&quot; In an interview on &quot;Front Row&quot; he described an experience of hearing his dead father&#x27;s voice and feeling a sense of peace. Commentators took these statements to mean that Pratchett had become religious, but Pratchett responded in an article published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in which he denied that he had found God, and clarified that he believed the voice had come from a memory of his father and a sense of personal elation.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
In August 2007, Pratchett was misdiagnosed as having had a minor stroke a few years before, which doctors believed had damaged the right side of his brain. In December 2007, he announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which had been responsible for the &quot;stroke&quot;. He had a rare form of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a disease in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel.

Describing the diagnosis as an &quot;embuggerance&quot; in a radio interview, Pratchett appealed to people to &quot;keep things cheerful&quot; and proclaimed that &quot;we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism&quot;. He stated he felt he had time for &quot;at least a few more books yet&quot;, and added that while he understood the impulse to ask &quot;is there anything I can do?&quot;, in this case he would only entertain such offers from &quot;very high-end experts in brain chemistry&quot;. Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.
In March 2008, Pratchett announced he was donating $1 million (about £494,000) to the Alzheimer&#x27;s Research Trust (later called Alzheimer&#x27;s Research UK), and that he was shocked &quot;to find out that funding for Alzheimer&#x27;s research is just 3% of that to find cancer cures&quot;. He said: &quot;I am, along with many others, scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the cure comes along.&quot;

In April 2008, Pratchett worked with the BBC to make a two-part documentary series about his illness, &quot;Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot;. The first part was broadcast on BBC Two on 4 February 2009, drawing 2.6 million viewers and a 10.4% audience share. The second, broadcast on 11 February 2009, drew 1.72 million viewers and a 6.8% audience share. The documentary won a BAFTA award in the Factual Series category.

On 26 November 2008, Pratchett met Gordon Brown, then Prime Minister of the UK, and asked for an increase in dementia research funding. Pratchett tested a prototype device to address his condition. The ability of the device to alter the course of the illness has been met with skepticism from Alzheimer&#x27;s researchers.

In an article published in 2009 Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (a term he disliked) before his disease progressed to a critical point. He later said that he felt &quot;it should be possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with medical help, rather than suffer&quot;. Pratchett was selected to give the 2010 BBC Richard Dimbleby Lecture, &quot;Shaking Hands With Death&quot;, broadcast on 1 February 2010. Pratchett introduced his lecture on the topic of assisted death (he preferred this to the term &quot;assisted suicide&quot;), but the main text was read by his friend Tony Robinson because his condition made it difficult for him to read. In June 2011, Pratchett presented a BBC television documentary, &quot;Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die,&quot; about assisted suicide. It won the Best Documentary award at the Scottish BAFTAs in November 2011.

In September 2012, Pratchett told an interviewer: &quot;I have to tell you that I thought I&#x27;d be a lot worse than this by now, and so did my specialist.&quot; In the same interview he said that the cognitive part of his mind was &quot;untouched&quot; and his symptoms were physical (normal for PCA). However, in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, citing his condition and &quot;other age-related ailments&quot;.

===Death and legacy===
Pratchett died at his home from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on the morning of 12 March 2015. He was 66 years old. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported an unidentified source as saying that, despite his previous discussion of assisted suicide, his death had been natural. After Pratchett&#x27;s death, his assistant, Rob Wilkins, wrote from the official Terry Pratchett Twitter account:
Public figures who paid tribute included the British prime minister David Cameron, the comedian Ricky Gervais, and the authors Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Brooks, Margaret Atwood, George R. R. Martin, and Neil Gaiman. Pratchett was memorialised in graffiti in East London. The video game companies Frontier Developments and Valve added elements to their games named after him. Users of the social news site Reddit organised a tribute by which an HTTP header, &quot;codice_1&quot;, was added to web sites&#x27; responses, a reference to the &quot;Discworld&quot; novel &quot;Going Postal&quot;, in which &quot;the clacks&quot; (a semaphore system, used as &quot;Discworld&quot; equivalent to a telegraph) are programmed to repeat the name of its creator&#x27;s deceased son; the sentiment in the novel is that no one is ever forgotten as long as their name is still spoken. A June 2015 web server survey reported that approximately 84,000 websites had been configured with the header. Pratchett&#x27;s humanist funeral service was held on 25 March 2015.

In 2015, Pratchett&#x27;s estate announced an endowment in perpetuity to the University of South Australia. The Sir Terry Pratchett Memorial Scholarship supports a Masters scholarship at the university&#x27;s Hawke Research Institute.

In 2023, several stories published in a regional newspaper in the 1970s and 1980s under the pen name Patrick Kearns were discovered to have been authored by Pratchett. They were published as &quot;A Stroke of the Pen: The Lost Stories&quot; in October 2023.

==Awards and honours==


Pratchett received a knighthood for &quot;services to literature&quot; in the 2009 UK New Year Honours list. He was previously appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire, also for &quot;services to literature&quot;, in 1998. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Pratchett commented in the &quot;Ansible&quot; science fiction/fan newsletter, &quot;I suspect the &#x27;services to literature&#x27; consisted of refraining from trying to write any&quot;, but added, &quot;Still, I cannot help feeling mightily chuffed about it.&quot; On 31 December 2008, it was announced that Pratchett would be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen&#x27;s 2009 New Year Honours. Afterwards he said, &quot;You can&#x27;t ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I&#x27;d get myself a horse and a sword.&quot; In 2010, Pratchett created his own sword from deposits of iron he had found in a field near his home as he believed a knight should have a sword.

Ten honorary doctorates were conferred on Pratchett: from the University of Warwick in 1999, the University of Portsmouth in 2001, the University of Bath in 2003, the University of Bristol in 2004, Buckinghamshire New University in 2008, the University of Dublin in 2008, Bradford University in 2009, University of Winchester in 2009, The Open University in 2013 for his contribution to Public Service and his last, from the University of South Australia, in May 2014. 
Pratchett was made an adjunct Professor in the School of English at Trinity College Dublin in 2010, with a role in postgraduate education in creative writing and popular literature.

Pratchett won the British Book Awards&#x27; &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction Author of the Year&quot; category in 1994, the British Science Fiction Award in 1989 for his novel &quot;Pyramids&quot;, and a Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 2008 for &quot;Making Money&quot;. He won the 2001 Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, which recognised &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot; as the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book published in the UK. &quot;Night Watch&quot; won the 2003 Prometheus Award for best libertarian novel. Four of the five &quot;Discworld&quot; novels that centre on the trainee witch Tiffany Aching won the annual Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2016. In 2005, &quot;Going Postal&quot; was shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel; however, Pratchett recused himself, stating that stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of Worldcon. In the same year, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; won a Mythopoeic Award. In 2008, &quot;Making Money&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel. &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; won the 2010 Andre Norton Award, presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) as a part of the Nebula Award ceremony.

In 2016 the SFWA named Pratchett the recipient of Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award, given for &quot;significant impact on the science fiction or fantasy landscape&quot;. He received the NESFA Skylark Award in 2009 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010. In 2011 he won Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association, a lifetime honour for &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot;. The librarians cited nine &quot;Discworld&quot; novels published from 1983 to 2004 and observed that &quot;Pratchett&#x27;s tales of Discworld have won over generations of teen readers with intelligence, heart, and undeniable wit. Comic adventures that fondly mock the fantasy genre, the Discworld novels expose the hypocrisies of contemporary society in an intricate, ever-expanding universe. With satisfyingly multilayered plots, Pratchett&#x27;s humor honors the intelligence of the reader. Teens eagerly lose themselves in a universe with no maps.&quot; In 2003, BBC conducted The Big Read to identify the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Best-loved Novel&quot; and finally published a ranked list of the &quot;Top 200&quot;. Pratchett&#x27;s highest-ranking novel was &quot;Mort&quot;, number 65, but he and Charles Dickens were the only authors with five in the Top 100 (four of his were from the &quot;Discworld&quot; series). He also led all authors with fifteen novels in the Top 200.

An asteroid (127005 Pratchett) is named after Pratchett. In 2013, Pratchett was named Humanist of the Year by the British Humanist Association for his campaign to fund research into Alzheimers, his contribution to the right to die public debate and his Humanist values. Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novels have led to dedicated conventions, the first in Manchester in 1996, then worldwide, often with the author as guest of honour. Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book signing tour; queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as the author continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time. His fans were not restricted by age or gender, and he received a large amount of fan mail from them. Pratchett enjoyed meeting fans and hearing what they think about his books, saying that since he was well paid for his novels, his fans were &quot;everything&quot; to him.

In March 2017, Beaconsfield Town Council commissioned a commemorative plaque dedicated to Pratchett for Beaconsfield Library.

===Coat of Arms===
In 2010, Pratchett was granted his own coat of arms following his knighthood. The arms were designed by Hubert Chesshyre and granted by Letters Patent of Garter and Clarenceux Kings of Arms. The owl is a morepork, which taken together with the ankh is a reference to the city of Ankh-Morpork. The image of a morpork holding an ankh appears in the fictional Ankh-Morpork City Arms. The motto &quot;Noli Timere Messorem&quot; is a corrected version of the dog Latin &quot;Non Timetis Messor&quot;, the motto of Death&#x27;s son-in-law and former apprentice, Mort of Sto Helit and his heirs. The phrase is a reference to the song &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; by Blue Öyster Cult.
==Writing==
Pratchett said that to write, you must read extensively, both inside and outside your chosen genre and to the point of &quot;overflow&quot;. He advised that writing is hard work, and that writers must &quot;make grammar, punctuation and spelling a part of your life&quot;. However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as &quot;an unavoidable consequence&quot; rather than the reason for writing.

===Fantasy genre===
Although during his early career he wrote for the science fiction and horror genres, Pratchett later focused almost entirely on fantasy, and said: &quot;It is easier to bend the universe around the story.&quot; In the acceptance speech for his Carnegie Medal, he said: &quot;Fantasy isn&#x27;t just about wizards and silly wands. It&#x27;s about seeing the world from new directions&quot;, pointing to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In the same speech, he acknowledged benefits of these works for the genre.

Pratchett believed he owed &quot;a debt to the science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of&quot; and disliked the term &quot;magical realism&quot;, which, he said, is &quot;like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people&quot;. He expressed annoyance that fantasy is &quot;unregarded as a literary form&quot;, arguing that it &quot;is the oldest form of fiction&quot;; he said he was infuriated when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres. He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental to the way we understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.

===Style and themes===
Pratchett&#x27;s earliest &quot;Discworld&quot; novels were written largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the &quot;Discworld&quot; series evolved into straightforward (though still comedic) satire.

Pratchett had a tendency to avoid using chapters, arguing in a Book Sense interview that &quot;life does not happen in regular chapters, nor do movies, and Homer did not write in chapters&quot;, adding &quot;I&#x27;m blessed if I know what function they serve in books for adults&quot;. However, there were exceptions; &quot;Going Postal&quot; and &quot;Making Money&quot; and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters. Pratchett said that he used chapters in the young adult novels because &quot;[his] editor screams until [he] does&quot;, but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary &quot;stopping point&quot; that got in the way of the narrative.

Characters, place names, and titles in Pratchett&#x27;s books often contain puns, allusions and cultural references. Some characters are parodies of well-known characters: for example, Pratchett&#x27;s character Cohen the Barbarian, also called Ghengiz Cohen, is a parody of Conan the Barbarian and Genghis Khan, and his character Leonard of Quirm is a parody of Leonardo da Vinci.

Another feature of his writing is the use of dialogue in small capitals, without quotation marks, for utterances by the character Death.

Pratchett was an only child, and his characters are often without siblings. Pratchett explained, &quot;In fiction only children are the interesting ones.&quot;

&quot;Discworld&quot; novels often included a modern innovation and its introduction to the world&#x27;s medieval setting, such as a public police force (&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;), guns (&quot;Men at Arms&quot;), cinema (&quot;Moving Pictures&quot;), investigative journalism (&quot;The Truth&quot;), the postage stamp (&quot;Going Postal&quot;), modern banking (&quot;Making Money&quot;), and the steam engine (&quot;Raising Steam&quot;). The &quot;clacks&quot;, the tower-to-tower semaphore system that sprang up in later novels, is a mechanical optical telegraph (as created by the Chappe brothers and employed during the French Revolution) before wired electric telegraph chains, with all the change and turmoil that such an advancement implies. The resulting social upheaval driven by these changes serves as the setting for the main story.

===Influences===
Pratchett&#x27;s earliest inspirations were &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; by Kenneth Grahame, and the works of H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. His literary influences were P.G. Wodehouse, Tom Sharpe, Jerome K. Jerome, Roy Lewis, Alan Coren, G. K. Chesterton, and Mark Twain.

== Works ==

=== &quot;Discworld&quot; ===

The &quot;Discworld&quot; series consists of 41 novels and a variety of supporting material. Pratchett began writing the &quot;Discworld&quot; series in order to &quot;have fun with some of the cliches&quot;. The Discworld is a large disc resting on the backs of four giant elephants, all supported by the giant turtle Great A&#x27;Tuin as it swims its way through space. The books were published essentially in chronological order, and advancements can be seen in the development of the Discworld civilisations, such as the creation of paper money in Ankh-Morpork.

====&quot;The Science of Discworld&quot;====
Pratchett wrote four &quot;Science of Discworld&quot; books in collaboration with professor of mathematics Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen, both of the University of Warwick: &quot;The Science of Discworld&quot; (1999), &quot;The Science of Discworld II: The Globe&quot; (2002), &quot;The Science of Discworld III: Darwin&#x27;s Watch&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Science of Discworld IV: Judgement Day&quot; (2013).

All four books have chapters that alternate between fiction and non-fiction: the fictional chapters are set within the Discworld universe, where characters observe, and experiment on, a universe with the same physics as ours. The non-fiction chapters (written by Stewart and Cohen) explain the science behind the fictional events.

In 1999, Pratchett appointed both Cohen and Stewart as &quot;Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University&quot; at the same ceremony at which the University of Warwick awarded him an honorary degree.

====&quot;Folklore of Discworld&quot;====
Pratchett collaborated with the folklorist Dr Jacqueline Simpson on &quot;The Folklore of Discworld&quot; (2008), a study of the relationship between many of the persons, places and events described in the &quot;Discworld&quot; books and their counterparts in myths, legends, fairy tales and folk customs on Earth.

===Other writing===
Pratchett&#x27;s first two adult novels, &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot; (1976) and &quot;Strata&quot; (1981), were both science fiction, the latter taking place partly on a disc-shaped world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his &quot;Discworld&quot; series and novels for children, with two exceptions: &quot;Good Omens&quot; (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which was nominated for both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and &quot;Nation&quot; (2008), a book for young adults.

After writing &quot;Good Omens&quot; Pratchett brainstormed with Larry Niven on a story that became the short novel &quot;Rainbow Mars&quot;. Niven eventually completed the story on his own, but he states in the afterword that a number of Pratchett&#x27;s ideas remained in the finished version.

Pratchett also collaborated with the British science fiction author Stephen Baxter on a parallel Earth series. The first novel, entitled &quot;The Long Earth&quot; was published on 21 June 2012. A second novel, &quot;The Long War&quot;, was released on 18 June 2013. &quot;The Long Mars&quot; was published in 2014. The fourth book in the series, &quot;The Long Utopia&quot;, was published in June 2015, and the fifth, &quot;The Long Cosmos&quot;, in June 2016.

In 2012, the first volume of Pratchett&#x27;s collected short fiction was published under the title &quot;A Blink of the Screen&quot;. In 2014 a similar collection was published of Pratchett&#x27;s non-fiction, entitled &quot;A Slip of the Keyboard&quot;.

Pratchett wrote dialogue for a mod for the game &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; (2006), which added a Nord companion named Vilja. He also worked on a similar mod for &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; (2011), which featured Vilja&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter.

=== Children&#x27;s literature ===
Pratchett&#x27;s first children&#x27;s novel was also his first published novel: &quot;The Carpet People&quot; in 1971, which Pratchett substantially rewrote and re-released in 1992. The next, &quot;Truckers&quot; (1988), was the first in &quot;The Nome Trilogy&quot; of novels for young readers (also known as &quot;The Bromeliad Trilogy&quot;), about small gnome-like creatures called &quot;Nomes&quot;, and the trilogy continued in &quot;Diggers&quot; (1990) and &quot;Wings&quot; (1990). Subsequently, Pratchett wrote the &quot;Johnny Maxwell&quot; trilogy, about the adventures of a boy called Johnny Maxwell and his friends, comprising &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; (1992), &quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot; (1993) and &quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot; (1996).
&quot;Nation&quot; (2008) marked his return to the non-&quot;Discworld&quot; children&#x27;s novel, and this was followed in 2012 by &quot;Dodger&quot;, a children&#x27;s novel set in Victorian London. On 21 November 2013 Doubleday Children&#x27;s released Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Jack Dodger&#x27;s Guide to London&quot;.

In 2001, he wrote &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;, his first &quot;Discworld&quot; book marketed for children.

Pratchett also wrote a five-book children&#x27;s series featuring a trainee witch, Tiffany Aching, and taking place on &quot;Discworld&quot;, beginning with The Wee Free Men in 2003.

In September 2014, a collection of children&#x27;s stories, &quot;Dragons at Crumbling Castle&quot;, written by Pratchett, and illustrated by Mark Beech, was published. This was followed by another collection, &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Vacuum Cleaner&quot;, also illustrated by Mark Beech, in 2016. A third volume, &quot;Father Christmas&#x27;s Fake Beard&quot;, was released in 2017. A fourth collection, &quot;The Time-travelling Caveman&quot;, was released in September 2020. A final collection, &quot;A Stroke of the Pen: The Lost Stories&quot;, was published in October 2023, collecting 20 stories written by Pratchett for newspapers in the 1970s and 80s under pseudonyms such as &quot;Patrick Kearns&quot; which had not previously been attributed to Pratchett.

===Unfinished texts===
Pratchett&#x27;s daughter, the writer Rhianna Pratchett, is the custodian of the &quot;Discworld&quot; franchise. She said that she had no plans to publish her father&#x27;s unfinished work or continue the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. Pratchett told Neil Gaiman that anything that he had been working on at the time of his death should be destroyed by a steamroller. On 25 August 2017 his former assistant Rob Wilkins fulfilled this wish by arranging for Pratchett&#x27;s hard drive to be crushed under a steamroller at the Great Dorset Steam Fair.

According to Wilkins, Pratchett left &quot;an awful lot&quot; of unfinished writing, &quot;10 titles I know of and fragments from many other bits and pieces&quot;. Pratchett had mentioned two new texts, &quot;Scouting for Trolls&quot; and a &quot;Discworld&quot; novel following a new character. The notes left behind outline ideas about &quot;how the old folk of the Twilight Canyons solve the mystery of a missing treasure and defeat the rise of a Dark Lord despite their failing memories&quot;; &quot;the secret of the crystal cave and the carnivorous plants in the Dark Incontinent&quot;, about Constable Feeney of the Watch, first introduced in &quot;Snuff&quot;, involving how he &quot;solves a whodunnit among the congenitally decent and honest goblins&quot;; and a second book about Amazing Maurice from &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;.

==Works about Pratchett==
A collection of essays about Pratchett&#x27;s writings is compiled in the book &quot;Terry Pratchett: Guilty of Literature&quot;, edited by Andrew M. Butler, Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn, published by Science Fiction Foundation in 2000. A second, expanded edition was published by Old Earth Books in 2004. Andrew M. Butler wrote the &quot;Pocket Essentials Guide to Terry Pratchett&quot; published in 2001. &quot;Writers Uncovered: Terry Pratchett&quot; is a biography for young readers by Vic Parker, published by Heinemann Library in 2006.

A BBC docudrama based on Pratchett&#x27;s life, &quot;Terry Pratchett: Back In Black&quot;, was broadcast in February 2017, starring Paul Kaye as Pratchett. Neil Gaiman was involved with the project which used Pratchett&#x27;s own words. Pratchett&#x27;s assistant, Rob Wilkins, said that Pratchett was working on this documentary before he died. According to the BBC, finishing it would &quot;show the author was still having the last laugh&quot;.

The English author, critic and performer Marc Burrows wrote an unofficial biography, &quot;The Magic of Terry Pratchett&quot;, published by Pen &amp; Sword on 6 July 2020. Though it was not endorsed by the Pratchett estate, prior to its publication they did wish Burrows &quot;all the best&quot; regarding the book through the official Pratchett Twitter account. It received generally favourable reviews and won the 2021 Locus Award for Non-Fiction.

In 2022, Wilkins wrote the official biography, &quot;Terry Pratchett: A Life with Footnotes&quot;. The biography was well received. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Tristram Fane Saunders wrote that it &quot;spins magic from mundanity in precisely the way Pratchett himself did&quot;. However, in a review for the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Kevin Power called it more a collection of fan notes than a serious biography.

In April 2023, &quot;Entering Discworld Population&quot;, an episode of the podcast &quot;Imaginary Worlds&quot;, was released to mark the 75th anniversary of Pratchett&#x27;s birth. It discussed four of Pratchett&#x27;s recurring fiction characters as representative of his underlying philosophy.

<doc id="30030" wikidata="Q8736" url="?curid=30030" title="Treaty of Versailles">
<text>The Treaty of Versailles was a peace treaty signed on 28 June 1919. As the most important treaty of World War I, it ended the state of war between Germany and most of the Allied Powers. It was signed in the Palace of Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which led to the war. The other Central Powers on the German side signed separate treaties. Although the armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the actual fighting, and agreed certain principles and conditions including the payment of reparations, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. Germany was not allowed to participate in the negotiations before signing the treaty.

The treaty required Germany to disarm, make territorial concessions, extradite alleged war criminals, agree to Kaiser Wilhelm being put on trial, recognise the independence of states whose territory had previously been part of the German Empire, and pay reparations to the Entente powers. The most critical and controversial provision in the treaty was: &quot;The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.&quot; The other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles. This article, Article 231, became known as the &quot;War Guilt&quot; clause.

Critics including John Maynard Keynes declared the treaty too harsh, styling it as a &quot;Carthaginian peace&quot;, and saying the reparations were excessive and counterproductive. On the other hand, prominent Allied figures such as French Marshal Ferdinand Foch criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently. This is still the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists.

The result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left no one satisfied. In particular, Germany was neither pacified nor conciliated, nor was it permanently weakened. The United States never ratified the Versailles treaty; instead it made a separate peace treaty with Germany, albeit based on the Versailles treaty. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the Locarno Treaties, which improved relations between Germany and the other European powers. The reparation system was reorganized and payments reduced in the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. Bitter resentment of the treaty powered the rise of the Nazi Party, and eventually the outbreak of a second World War.

Although it is often referred to as the &quot;Versailles Conference&quot;, only the actual signing of the treaty took place at the historic palace. Most of the negotiations were in Paris, with the &quot;Big Four&quot; meetings taking place generally at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d&#x27;Orsay.

==Background==
===First World War===

War broke out following the July Crisis in 1914. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, followed quickly by Germany declaring war on Russia on 1 August, and on Belgium and France on 3 August. The German invasion of Belgium on 3 August led to a declaration of war by Britain on Germany on 4 August, creating the conflict that became the First World War. Two alliances faced off, the Central Powers (led by Germany) and the Triple Entente (led by Britain, France and Russia). Other countries entered as fighting raged widely across Europe, as well as the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Having seen the overthrow of the Tsarist regime in the February Revolution and the Kerensky government in the October Revolution, the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic under Vladimir Lenin in March 1918 signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, amounting to a surrender that was highly favourable to Germany. Sensing victory before the American Expeditionary Forces could be ready, Germany now shifted forces to the Western Front and tried to overwhelm the Allies. It failed. Instead, the Allies won decisively on the battlefield, overwhelmed Germany&#x27;s Turkish, Austrian, and Bulgarian allies, and forced an armistice in November 1918 that resembled a surrender.

===Role of the Fourteen Points===
The United States entered the war against the Central Powers in 1917 and President Woodrow Wilson played a significant role in shaping the peace terms. His expressed aim was to detach the war from nationalistic disputes and ambitions. On 8 January 1918, Wilson issued the Fourteen Points. They outlined a policy of free trade, open agreements, and democracy. While the term was not used, self-determination was assumed. It called for a negotiated end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe&#x27;s borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a League of Nations to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all states.
It called for what it characterised as a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial annexation. The Fourteen Points were based on the research of the Inquiry, a team of about 150 advisors led by foreign-policy advisor Edward M. House, into the topics likely to arise in the expected peace conference.

===Armistice===

During the autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse. Desertion rates within the German army began to increase, and civilian strikes drastically reduced war production. On the Western Front, the Allied forces launched the Hundred Days Offensive and decisively defeated the German western armies. Sailors of the Imperial German Navy at Kiel mutinied in response to the naval order of 24 October 1918, which prompted uprisings in Germany, which became known as the German Revolution. The German government tried to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that they surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.

Many aspects of the Versailles treaty that were later criticised were agreed first in the 11 November armistice agreement, whilst the war was still ongoing. These included the German evacuation of German-occupied France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Alsace-Lorraine, and the left bank of the Rhine (all of which were to be administered by the Allies under the armistice agreement), the surrender of a large quantity of war materiel, and the agreed payment of &quot;reparation for damage done&quot;.

German forces evacuated occupied France, Belgium, and Luxembourg within the fifteen days required by the armistice agreement. By late 1918, Allied troops had entered Germany and began the occupation of the Rhineland under the agreement, in the process establishing bridgeheads across the Rhine in case of renewed fighting at Cologne, Koblenz, and Mainz. Allied and German forces were additionally to be separated by a 10 km-wide demilitarised zone.

===Blockade===
Both Germany and Great Britain were dependent on imports of food and raw materials, most of which had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The Blockade of Germany was a naval operation conducted by the Allied Powers to stop the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs reaching the Central Powers. The German was mainly restricted to the German Bight and used commerce raiders and unrestricted submarine warfare for a counter-blockade. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 stated that civilians had died during the Allied blockade, although an academic study in 1928 put the death toll at 

The blockade was maintained for eight months after the Armistice in November 1918, into the following year of 1919. Foodstuffs imports into Germany were controlled by the Allies after the Armistice with Germany until Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. In March 1919, Churchill informed the House of Commons, that the ongoing blockade was a success and &quot;Germany is very near starvation.&quot; From January 1919 to March 1919, Germany refused to agree to Allied demands that Germany surrender its merchant ships to Allied ports to transport food supplies. Some Germans considered the armistice to be a temporary cessation of the war and knew, if fighting broke out again, their ships would be seized. Over the winter of 1919, the situation became desperate and Germany finally agreed to surrender its fleet in March. The Allies then allowed for the import of 270,000 tons of foodstuffs.

Both German and non-German observers have argued that these were the most devastating months of the blockade for German civilians, though disagreement persists as to the extent and who is truly at fault. According to Max Rubner 100,000 German civilians died due to the continuation blockade after the armistice. In the UK, Labour Party member and anti-war activist Robert Smillie issued a statement in June 1919 condemning continuation of the blockade, claiming 100,000 German civilians had died as a result.

==Negotiations==
Talks between the Allies to establish a common negotiating position started on 18 January 1919, in the (Clock Room) at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.
Initially, 70 delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. Russia was excluded due to their signing of a separate peace (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) and early withdrawal from the war. Furthermore, German negotiators were excluded to deny them an opportunity to divide the Allies diplomatically.

Initially, a &quot;Council of Ten&quot; (comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) met officially to decide the peace terms. This council was replaced by the &quot;Council of Five&quot;, formed from each country&#x27;s foreign ministers, to discuss minor matters. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and United States President Woodrow Wilson formed the &quot;Big Four&quot; (at one point becoming the &quot;Big Three&quot; following the temporary withdrawal of Orlando). These four men met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions, which were later ratified by the entire assembly. The minor powers attended a weekly &quot;Plenary Conference&quot; that discussed issues in a general forum but made no decisions. These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final text of the treaty.

===French aims===
France had lost 1.3 million soldiers, including French men aged France had also been more physically damaged than any other nation; the so-called zone rouge (Red Zone), the most industrialized region and the source of most coal and iron ore in the north-east, had been devastated, and in the final days of the war, mines had been flooded and railways, bridges and factories destroyed.
Clemenceau intended to ensure the security of France, by weakening Germany economically, militarily, territorially and by supplanting Germany as the leading producer of steel in Europe.
British economist and Versailles negotiator John Maynard Keynes summarized this position as attempting to &quot;set the clock back and undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had accomplished.&quot;

Clemenceau told Wilson: &quot;America is far away, protected by the ocean. Not even Napoleon himself could touch England. You are both sheltered; we are not&quot;.
The French wanted a frontier on the Rhine, to protect France from a German invasion and compensate for French demographic and economic inferiority.
American and British representatives refused the French claim and after two months of negotiations, the French accepted a British pledge to provide an immediate alliance with France if Germany attacked again, and Wilson agreed to put a similar proposal to the Senate. Clemenceau had told the Chamber of Deputies, in December 1918, that his goal was to maintain an alliance with both countries. Clemenceau accepted the offer, in return for an occupation of the Rhineland for fifteen years and that Germany would also demilitarise the Rhineland.

French negotiators required reparations, to make Germany pay for the destruction induced throughout the war and to decrease German strength. The French also wanted the iron ore and coal of the Saar Valley, by annexation to France.
The French were willing to accept a smaller amount of World War I reparations than the Americans would concede and Clemenceau was willing to discuss German capacity to pay with the German delegation, before the final settlement was drafted. In April and May 1919, the French and Germans held separate talks, on mutually acceptable arrangements on issues like reparation, reconstruction and industrial collaboration. France, along with the British Dominions and Belgium, opposed League of Nations mandates and favored annexation of former German colonies.

The French, who had suffered significantly in the areas occupied by Germany during the war, were in favour of trying German war criminals, including the Kaiser. In the face of American objections that there was no applicable existing law under which the Kaiser could be tried, Clemenceau took the view that the &quot;law of responsibility&quot; overruled all other laws and that putting the Kaiser on trial offered the opportunity to establish this as an international precedent.

===British aims===

Britain had suffered heavy financial costs but suffered little physical devastation during the war. British public opinion wanted to make Germany pay for the War.
Public opinion favoured a &quot;just peace&quot;, which would force Germany to pay reparations and be unable to repeat the aggression of 1914, although those of a &quot;liberal and advanced opinion&quot; shared Wilson&#x27;s ideal of a peace of reconciliation.

In private Lloyd George opposed revenge and attempted to compromise between Clemenceau&#x27;s demands and the Fourteen Points, because Europe would eventually have to reconcile with Germany.
Lloyd George wanted terms of reparation that would not cripple the German economy, so that Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner. By arguing that British war pensions and widows&#x27; allowances should be included in the German reparation sum, Lloyd George ensured that a large amount would go to the British Empire.

Lloyd George also intended to maintain a European balance of power to thwart a French attempt to establish itself as the dominant European power. A revived Germany would be a counterweight to France and a deterrent to Bolshevik Russia. Lloyd George also wanted to neutralize the German navy to keep the Royal Navy as the greatest naval power in the world; dismantle the German colonial empire with several of its territorial possessions ceded to Britain and others being established as League of Nations mandates, a position opposed by the Dominions.

Together with the French, the British favoured putting German war criminals on trial, and included the Kaiser in this. Already in 1916 Herbert Asquith had declared the intention &quot;to bring to justice the criminals, whoever they be and whatever their station&quot;, and a resolution of the war cabinet in 1918 reaffirmed this intent. Lloyd George declared that the British people would not accept a treaty that did not include terms on this, though he wished to limit the charges solely to violation of the 1839 treaty guaranteeing Belgian neutrality. The British were also well aware that the Kaiser having sought refuge in the Netherlands meant that any trial was unlikely to take place and therefore any Article demanding it was likely to be a dead letter.

===American aims===
Before the American entry into the war, Wilson had talked of a &quot;peace without victory&quot;. This position fluctuated following the US entry into the war. Wilson spoke of the German aggressors, with whom there could be no compromised peace.
On 8 January 1918, however, Wilson delivered a speech (known as the Fourteen Points) that declared the American peace objectives: the rebuilding of the European economy, self-determination of European and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, the promotion of free trade, the creation of appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, the creation of a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace. The aim of the latter was to provide a forum to revise the peace treaties as needed, and deal with problems that arose as a result of the peace and the rise of new states.

Wilson brought along top intellectuals as advisors to the American peace delegation, and the overall American position echoed the Fourteen Points. Wilson firmly opposed harsh treatment on Germany. While the British and French wanted to largely annex the German colonial empire, Wilson saw that as a violation of the fundamental principles of justice and human rights of the native populations, and favored them having the right of self-determination via the creation of mandates. The promoted idea called for the major powers to act as disinterested trustees over a region, aiding the native populations until they could govern themselves.
In spite of this position and in order to ensure that Japan did not refuse to join the League of Nations, Wilson favored turning over the former German colony of Shandong, in Eastern China, to the Japanese Empire rather than return the area to the Republic of China&#x27;s control.
Further confounding the Americans, was US internal partisan politics. In November 1918, the Republican Party won the Senate election by a slim margin. Wilson, a Democrat, refused to include prominent Republicans in the American delegation making his efforts seem partisan, and contributed to a risk of political defeat at home.

On the subject of war crimes, the Americans differed to the British and French in that Wilson&#x27;s proposal was that any trial of the Kaiser should be solely a political and moral affair, and not one of criminal responsibility, meaning that the death penalty would be precluded. This was based on the American view, particularly those of Robert Lansing, that there was no applicable law under which the Kaiser could be tried. Additionally, the Americans favoured trying other German war criminals before military tribunals rather than an international court, with prosecutions being limited to &quot;violation[s] of the laws and customs of war&quot;, and opposed any trials based on violations against what was called &quot;laws of humanity&quot;.

===Italian aims===
Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and his foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, an Anglican of British origins, worked primarily to secure the partition of the Habsburg Empire and their attitude towards Germany was not as hostile. Generally speaking, Sonnino was in line with the British position while Orlando favored a compromise between Clemenceau and Wilson. Within the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles, Orlando obtained certain results such as the permanent membership of Italy in the security council of the League of Nations and a promised transfer of British Jubaland and French Aozou strip to the Italian colonies of Somalia and Libya respectively. Italian nationalists, however, saw the War as a &quot;mutilated victory&quot; for what they considered to be little territorial gains achieved in the other treaties directly impacting Italy&#x27;s borders. Orlando was ultimately forced to abandon the conference and resign. Orlando refused to see World War I as a mutilated victory, replying at nationalists calling for a greater expansion that &quot;Italy today is a great state...on par with the great historic and contemporary states. This is, for me, our main and principal expansion.&quot; Francesco Saverio Nitti took Orlando&#x27;s place in signing the treaty of Versailles.

The Italian leadership were divided on whether to try the Kaiser. Sonnino considered that putting the Kaiser on trial could result in him becoming a &quot;patriotic martyr&quot;. Orlando, in contrast, stated that &quot;the ex-Kaiser ought to pay like other criminals&quot;, but was less sure about whether the Kaiser should be &quot;tried&quot; as a criminal or merely have a political verdict cast against him. Orlando also considered that &quot;[t]he question of the constitution of the Court presents almost insurmountable difficulties&quot;.

==Treaty content and signing==

In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including Articles 227 to 231 (i.e., the Articles related to the extradition of the Kaiser for trial, the extradition of German war criminals for trial before Allied tribunals, the handing over of documents relevant for war crimes trials, and accepting liability for war reparations). In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within On 23 June, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.
On 28 June 1919, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the immediate impetus for the war), the peace treaty was signed. The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes, the prohibition on the merging of the Republic of German Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations, freedom of navigation on major European rivers, to the returning of a Quran to the king of Hedjaz.

===Territorial changes===
The treaty stripped Germany of of territory and 7 million people. It also required Germany to give up the gains made via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and grant independence to the protectorates that had been established.
In Western Europe, Germany was required to recognize Belgian sovereignty over Moresnet and cede control of the Eupen-Malmedy area. Within six months of the transfer, Belgium was required to conduct a plebiscite on whether the citizens of the region wanted to remain under Belgian sovereignty or return to German control, communicate the results to the League of Nations and abide by the League&#x27;s decision. The Belgian transitional administration, under High Commissioner General Herman Baltia, was responsible for the organisation and control of this process, held between January and June 1920. The plebiscite itself was held without a secret ballot, and organized as a consultation in which all citizens who opposed the annexation had to formally register their protest. Ultimately, only 271 of 33,726 voters signed the protest list, of which 202 were German state servants. After the Belgian government reported this result, the League of Nations confirmed the change of status on 20 September 1920, with the line of the German-Belgian border finally fixed by a League of Nations commission in 1922. To compensate for the destruction of French coal mines, Germany was to cede the output of the Saar coalmines to France and control of the Saar to the League of Nations for 15 years; a plebiscite would then be held to decide sovereignty.
The treaty restored the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to France by rescinding the treaties of Versailles and Frankfurt of 1871 as they pertained to this issue.
France was able to make the claim that the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine were indeed part of France and not part of Germany by disclosing a letter sent from the Prussian King to the Empress Eugénie that Eugénie provided, in which William I wrote that the territories of Alsace-Lorraine were requested by Germany for the sole purpose of national defense and not to expand the German territory. The sovereignty of Schleswig-Holstein was to be resolved by a plebiscite to be held at a future time (see Schleswig Plebiscites).

In Central Europe Germany was to recognize the independence of Czechoslovakia and cede parts of the province of Upper Silesia to them.
Germany had to recognize the independence of Poland, which had regained its independence following a national revolution against the occupying Central Powers, and renounce &quot;all rights and title&quot; over Polish territory. Portions of Upper Silesia were to be ceded to Poland, with the future of the rest of the province to be decided by plebiscite. The border would be fixed with regard to the vote and to the geographical and economic conditions of each locality.
The Province of Posen (now Poznań), which had come under Polish control during the Greater Poland Uprising, was also to be ceded to Poland.
Pomerelia (Eastern Pomerania), on historical and ethnic grounds, was transferred to Poland so that the new state could have access to the sea and became known as the Polish Corridor.
The sovereignty of part of southern East Prussia was to be decided via plebiscite while the East Prussian Soldau area, which was astride the rail line between Warsaw and Danzig, was transferred to Poland outright without plebiscite.
An area of was transferred to Poland under the agreement.
Memel was to be ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, for disposal according to their wishes.
Germany was to cede the city of Danzig and its hinterland, including the delta of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea, for the League of Nations to establish the Free City of Danzig.

===Mandates===

Article 119 of the treaty required Germany to renounce sovereignty over former colonies and Article 22 converted the territories into League of Nations mandates under the control of Allied states. Togoland and German Kamerun (Cameroon) were transferred to France, aside from portions given to Britain, British Togoland and British Cameroon. Ruanda and Urundi were allocated to Belgium, whereas German South-West Africa went to South Africa and Britain obtained German East Africa. As compensation for the German invasion of Portuguese Africa, Portugal was granted the Kionga Triangle, a sliver of German East Africa in northern Mozambique.
Article 156 of the treaty transferred German concessions in Shandong, China, to Japan, not to China. Japan was granted all German possessions in the Pacific north of the equator and those south of the equator went to Australia, except for German Samoa, which was taken by New Zealand.

===Military restrictions===
The treaty was comprehensive and complex in the restrictions imposed upon the post-war German armed forces (the ). The provisions were intended to make the incapable of offensive action and to encourage international disarmament.
Germany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920 to leave an army of no more than in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions. The treaty laid down the organisation of the divisions and support units, and the General Staff was to be dissolved.
Military schools for officer training were limited to three, one school per arm, and conscription was abolished. Private soldiers and non-commissioned officers were to be retained for at least twelve years and officers for a minimum of with former officers being forbidden to attend military exercises. To prevent Germany from building up a large cadre of trained men, the number of men allowed to leave early was limited.
The number of civilian staff supporting the army was reduced and the police force was reduced to its pre-war size, with increases limited to population increases; paramilitary forces were forbidden.
The Rhineland was to be demilitarized, all fortifications in the Rhineland and east of the river were to be demolished and new construction was forbidden.
Military structures and fortifications on the islands of Heligoland and Düne were to be destroyed.
Germany was prohibited from the arms trade, limits were imposed on the type and quantity of weapons and prohibited from the manufacture or stockpile of chemical weapons, armoured cars, tanks and military aircraft.
The German navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and was limited to a maximum of six light cruisers (not exceeding ), twelve destroyers (not exceeding ) and twelve torpedo boats (not exceeding ) and was forbidden submarines.
The manpower of the navy was not to exceed including manning for the fleet, coast defences, signal stations, administration, other land services, officers and men of all grades and corps. The number of officers and warrant officers was not allowed to exceed 
Germany surrendered eight battleships, eight light cruisers, forty-two destroyers, and fifty torpedo boats for decommissioning. Thirty-two auxiliary ships were to be disarmed and converted to merchant use.
Article 198 prohibited Germany from having an air force, including naval air forces, and required Germany to hand over all aerial related materials. In conjunction, Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft or related material for a period of six months following the signing of the treaty.

===Reparations===
In Article 231 Germany accepted responsibility for the losses and damages caused by the war &quot;as a consequence of the ... aggression of Germany and her allies.&quot; The treaty required Germany to compensate the Allied powers, and it also established an Allied &quot;Reparation Commission&quot; to determine the exact amount which Germany would pay and the form that such payment would take. The commission was required to &quot;give to the German Government a just opportunity to be heard&quot;, and to submit its conclusions by . In the interim, the treaty required Germany to pay an equivalent of 20 billion gold marks ($5 billion) in gold, commodities, ships, securities or other forms. The money would help to pay for Allied occupation costs and buy food and raw materials for Germany.

===Guarantees===
To ensure compliance, the Rhineland and bridgeheads east of the Rhine were to be occupied by Allied troops for fifteen years.
If Germany had not committed aggression, a staged withdrawal would take place; after five years, the Cologne bridgehead and the territory north of a line along the Ruhr would be evacuated. After ten years, the bridgehead at Coblenz and the territories to the north would be evacuated and after fifteen years remaining Allied forces would be withdrawn.
If Germany reneged on the treaty obligations, the bridgeheads would be reoccupied immediately.

===International organizations===
Part I of the treaty, in common with all the treaties signed during the Paris Peace Conference, was the Covenant of the League of Nations, which provided for the creation of the League, an organization for the arbitration of international disputes.
Part XIII organized the establishment of the International Labour Office, to regulate hours of work, including a maximum working day and week; the regulation of the labour supply; the prevention of unemployment; the provision of a living wage; the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment; the protection of children, young persons and women; provision for old age and injury; protection of the interests of workers when employed abroad; recognition of the principle of freedom of association; the organization of vocational and technical education and other measures.
The treaty also called for the signatories to sign or ratify the International Opium Convention.

===War Crimes===
Article 227 of the Versailles treaty required the handing over of Kaiser Wilhelm for trial &quot;for supreme offence against international treaties and the sanctity of treaties&quot; before a bench of five allied judges – one British, one American, one French, one Italian, and one Japanese. If found guilty the judges were to &quot;fix such punishment which it considers should be imposed&quot;. The death penalty was therefore not precluded. Article 228 allowed the Allies to demand the extradition of German war criminals, who could be tried before military tribunals for crimes against &quot;the laws and customs of war&quot; under Article 229. To provide an evidentiary basis for such trials, Article 230 required the German government to transfer information and documents relevant to such trials.

==Reactions==
===Britain===
The delegates of the Commonwealth and British Government had mixed thoughts on the treaty, with some seeing the French policy as being greedy and vindictive. Lloyd George and his private secretary Philip Kerr believed in the treaty, although they also felt that the French would keep Europe in a constant state of turmoil by attempting to enforce the treaty. Delegate Harold Nicolson wrote &quot;are we making a good peace?&quot;, while General Jan Smuts (a member of the South African delegation) wrote to Lloyd-George, before the signing, that the treaty was unstable and declared &quot;Are we in our sober senses or suffering from shellshock? What has become of Wilson&#x27;s 14 points?&quot; He wanted the Germans not be made to sign at the &quot;point of the bayonet&quot;.
Smuts issued a statement condemning the treaty and regretting that the promises of &quot;a new international order and a fairer, better world are not written in this treaty&quot;. Lord Robert Cecil said that many within the Foreign Office were disappointed by the treaty. The treaty received widespread approval from the general public. Bernadotte Schmitt wrote that the &quot;average Englishman ... thought Germany got only what it deserved&quot; as a result of the treaty, but public opinion changed as German complaints mounted.

Former wartime British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and the Independent Liberal opposition in the British Parliament after the 1918 general election believed the treaty was too punitive. Asquith campaigned against it while running for another House of Commons seat in the 1920 Paisley by-election.

Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, following the German re-militarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, stated that he was &quot;pleased&quot; that the treaty was &quot;vanishing&quot;, expressing his hope that the French had been taught a &quot;severe lesson&quot;.

==== Status of British Dominions ====
The Treaty of Versailles was an important step in the status of the British Dominions under international law. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa had each made significant contributions to the British war effort, but as separate countries, rather than as British colonies. India also made a substantial troop contribution, although under direct British control, unlike the Dominions. The four Dominions and India all signed the Treaty separately from Britain, a clear recognition by the international community that the Dominions were no longer British colonies. &quot;Their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers, but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of Britain.&quot; By signing the Treaty individually, the four Dominions and India also were founding members of the League of Nations in their own right, rather than simply as part of the British Empire.

===France===
The signing of the treaty was met with roars of approval, singing, and dancing from a crowd outside the Palace of Versailles. In Paris proper, people rejoiced at the official end of the war, the return of Alsace and Lorraine to France, and that Germany had agreed to pay reparations.

While France ratified the treaty and was active in the League, the jubilant mood soon gave way to a political backlash for Clemenceau. The French Right saw the treaty as being too lenient and saw it as failing to achieve all of France&#x27;s demands. Left-wing politicians attacked the treaty and Clemenceau for being too harsh (the latter turning into a ritual condemnation of the treaty, for politicians remarking on French foreign affairs, as late as August 1939). Marshal Ferdinand Foch stated &quot;this (treaty) is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.&quot;; a criticism over the failure to annex the Rhineland and for compromising French security for the benefit of the United States and Britain. When Clemenceau stood for election as President of France in January 1920, he was defeated.

===Italy===
Reaction in the Kingdom of Italy to the treaty was extremely negative. The country had suffered high casualties, yet failed to achieve most of its major war goals, notably gaining control of the Dalmatian coast and Fiume. President Wilson rejected Italy&#x27;s claims on the basis of &quot;national self-determination.&quot; For their part, Britain and France—who had been forced in the war&#x27;s latter stages to divert their own troops to the Italian front to stave off collapse—were disinclined to support Italy&#x27;s position at the peace conference. Differences in negotiating strategy between Premier Vittorio Orlando and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino further undermined Italy&#x27;s position at the conference. A furious Vittorio Orlando suffered a nervous collapse and at one point walked out of the conference (though he later returned). He lost his position as prime minister just a week before the treaty was scheduled to be signed, effectively ending his active political career. Anger and dismay over the treaty&#x27;s provisions helped pave the way for the establishment of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist dictatorship three years later.

===Portugal===
Portugal entered the war on the Allied side in 1916 primarily to ensure the security of its African colonies, which were threatened with seizure by both Britain and Germany. To this extent, she succeeded in her war aims. The treaty recognized Portuguese sovereignty over these areas and awarded her small portions of Germany&#x27;s bordering overseas colonies, including the Kionga Triangle. Otherwise, Portugal gained little at the peace conference. Her promised share of German reparations never materialized, and a seat she coveted on the executive council of the new League of Nations went instead to Spain—which had remained neutral in the war. In the end, Portugal ratified the treaty, but got little out of the war, which cost more than 8,000 Portuguese Armed Forces troops and as many as 100,000 of her African colonial subjects their lives.

===United States===
After the Versailles conference, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson claimed that &quot;at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!&quot; However, Wilson had refused to bring any leading members of the Republican party, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, into the talks. The Republicans controlled the United States Senate after the election of 1918, and were outraged by Wilson&#x27;s refusal to discuss the war with them. The senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two-thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.

A discontent bloc of 12–18 &quot;Irreconcilables&quot;, mostly Republicans but also representatives of the Irish and German Democrats, fiercely opposed the treaty. One bloc of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge. A second group of Democrats supported the treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with &quot;reservations&quot;, especially on Article 10, so that the League of Nations could not draw the US into war without the consent of the US Congress. All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them. But Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.

The closest the treaty came to passage was on 19 November 1919, as Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to end the chances of ratification permanently. Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the treaty, saying it favored the British.

After Wilson&#x27;s presidency, his successor Republican President Warren G. Harding continued American opposition to the formation of the League of Nations. Congress subsequently passed the Knox–Porter Resolution bringing a formal end to hostilities between the United States and the Central Powers. It was signed into law by President Harding on 2 July 1921. Soon after, the US–German Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Berlin on 25 August 1921. Article 1 of this treaty obliged the German government to grant to the U.S. government all rights and privileges that were enjoyed by the other Allies that had ratified the Versailles treaty. Two similar treaties were signed with Austria and Hungary on 24 and 29 August 1921, in Vienna and Budapest respectively.

====Edward House&#x27;s views====
Wilson&#x27;s former friend Edward Mandell House, present at the negotiations, wrote in his diary on 29 June 1919:

I am leaving Paris, after eight fateful months, with conflicting emotions. Looking at the conference in retrospect, there is much to approve and yet much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those who are saying that the treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris.

===China===
Many in China felt betrayed as the German territory in China was handed to Japan. Wellington Koo refused to sign the treaty and the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only nation that did not sign the Treaty of Versailles at the signing ceremony. The sense of betrayal led to great demonstrations in China such as the May 4th movement. There was immense dissatisfaction with Duan Qirui&#x27;s government, which had secretly negotiated with the Japanese in order to secure loans to fund their military campaigns against the south. On 12 June 1919, the Chinese cabinet was forced to resign and the government instructed its delegation at Versailles not to sign the treaty. As a result, relations with the Western world deteriorated.

===Germany===

On 29 April, the German delegation under the leadership of the Foreign Minister Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau arrived in Versailles. On 7 May, when faced with the conditions dictated by the victors, including the so-called &quot;War Guilt Clause&quot;, von Brockdorff-Rantzau replied to Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd George: &quot;We can sense the full force of hatred that confronts us here. ... You demand from us to confess we were the only guilty party of war; such a confession in my mouth would be a lie.&quot;
Because Germany was not allowed to take part in the negotiations, the German government issued a protest against what it considered to be unfair demands, and a &quot;violation of honour&quot;, soon afterwards withdrawing from the proceedings of the peace conference.

Germans of all political shades denounced the treaty. The so-called &quot;War Guilt Clause&quot; that they saw as blaming Germany for starting the war was seen as an insult to the nation&#x27;s honour. The clauses calling on the Germans to hand over alleged war criminals also caused deep offence, as many of those accused were seen as heroes, and also because the Allies were seen as applying one-sided justice. They referred to the treaty as &quot;the &quot;Diktat&quot;&quot; since its terms were presented to Germany on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Germany&#x27;s first democratically elected head of government, Philipp Scheidemann, resigned rather than sign the treaty. In an emotional and polemical address to the Weimar National Assembly on 12 May 1919, he called the treaty a &quot;horrific and murderous witch&#x27;s hammer&quot;, and exclaimed: At the end of his speech, Scheidemann stated that, in the government&#x27;s opinion, the treaty was unacceptable.
After Scheidemann&#x27;s resignation, a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer. President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen&#x27;s disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west—and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg—after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener—concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. But rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities.

Upon receiving Hindenburg&#x27;s answer, the Bauer government recommended signing the treaty with the proviso that the &quot;war-guilt&quot; clause and the articles that required the extradition of war criminals and of the former Emperor be excluded. After the Allies refused anything other than full acceptance of the treaty, the National Assembly voted in favour of signing it by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). The result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline. The Bauer government included the following statement with the acceptance:The honour of the German people will not be affected by an act of violence. After the appalling suffering of the last four years, the German people lack any means to defend it externally. Therefore, yielding to overwhelming force and without abandoning its view of the outrageous injustice of the peace terms, the Government of the German Republic declares that it is prepared to accept and sign the peace terms imposed by the Allied and Associated Governments.

Foreign minister Hermann Müller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116.

===Japan===
The disenfranchised and often colonized &quot;non-white&quot; world held high expectations that a new order would open up an unheralded opportunity to have a principle of racial equality recognized by the leading global powers. Japanese diplomacy had bitter memories of the rhetoric of the Yellow Peril, and the arrogance, underwritten by the assumptions about a White Man&#x27;s Burden, memories aggravated by the rise of racial discrimination against their business men, severe immigration restrictions on Asiatics, and court judgments hostile to Japanese interests, which characterized Western states&#x27; treatment of their nationals. Japan&#x27;s delegation, among whose plenipotentiaries figured Baron Makino and Ambassador Chinda Sutemi, was led by its elder statesman Saionji Kinmochi.

Versailles represented a chance to overturn this imposed inferiority, whose tensions were strengthened particularly in Japan&#x27;s relationship with the United States during WW1. Confidence in their growing industrial strength, and conquest of Germany&#x27;s Far East possessions, together with their proven fidelity to the Entente would, it was thought, allow them finally to take their rightful place among the victorious Great Powers. They solicited support especially from the American delegation to obtain recognition for the principle of racial equality at the League of Nations Commission. Their proposals to this end were consistently rebuffed by British, French, American and Australian diplomats, who were all sensitive to their respective countries&#x27; internal pressures. Wilson himself was an enactor of segregationist policies in the United States, Clemenceau openly ridiculed them, Arthur Balfour considered Africans inferior to Europeans – equality was only true of people within particular nations – while William Hughes, adopting a &quot;slap the Jap&quot; attitude, was a vocal defender of a White Australia policy.

Japan&#x27;s attempt, buttressed by the Chinese emissary Wellington Koo among others, to incorporate a Racial Equality Proposal in the treaty, had broad support, but was effectively declined when it was rejected by the United States, Great Britain and Australia, despite a powerfully persuasive speech delivered by Makino.

Japan itself both prior to and during WW1 had embarked on a vigorous expansion of continental colonialism, whose aims were justified in terms of uniting Asians, such as Koreans and Chinese, who were seen as belonging to the same race and culture as the Japanese (: ), though it was geared to subordinating them to Japan&#x27;s interests in a paternalistic manner. Aspiring to be accepted as a world actor with similar status to the traditional Western powers, Japan envisaged an Asian Monroe Doctrine, where Japan&#x27;s proper sphere of geostrategic interests in Asia would be recognized. Some years earlier, Japan secured both British and French support for its claims to inherit rights that Germany had exercised both in China and in the Pacific Ocean north of the Equator. American policy experts, unaware of these secret agreements, nonetheless suggested that Japan had adopted a Prussian model that would imperil China&#x27;s own search for autonomy, and these considerations influenced Wilson.

Nonetheless Japan emerged from the Treaty with territorial gains, including the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory and all the territories of German New Guinea north of the Equator, forming the South Seas Mandate.

==Implementation==
===Reparations===
On 5 May 1921, the reparation Commission established the London Schedule of Payments and a final reparation sum of 132 billion gold marks to be demanded of all the Central Powers. This was the public assessment of what the Central Powers combined could pay, and was also a compromise among Belgian, British, and French demands and assessments. Furthermore, the Commission recognized that the Central Powers could pay little and that the burden would fall upon Germany. As a result, the sum was split into different categories, of which Germany was only required to pay 50 billion gold marks ( billion); this being the genuine assessment of the commission on what Germany could pay, and allowed the Allied powers to save face with the public by presenting a higher figure. Furthermore, payments made between 1919 and 1921 of roughly 8 billion marks, most of it credit for state assets (e.g., German state railways in the Danzig corridor) transferred to Allied countries were taken into account reducing the sum to 41 billion gold marks.

In order to meet this sum, Germany could pay in cash or kind: coal, timber, chemical dyes, pharmaceuticals, livestock, agricultural machines, construction materials, and factory machinery. Germany&#x27;s assistance with the restoration of the university library of Leuven, which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum. Territorial changes imposed by the treaty were also factored in. The payment schedule required  million within twenty-five days and then  million annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports. The German Government was to issue bonds at five per cent interest and set up a sinking fund of one per cent to support the payment of reparations.

===Territorial changes===
In February and March 1920, the Schleswig Plebiscites were held. The people of Schleswig were presented with only two choices: Danish or German sovereignty. The northern Danish-speaking area voted for Denmark while the southern German-speaking area voted for Germany, resulting in the province being partitioned. The East Prussia plebiscite was held on 11 July 1920. There was a out with the population wishing to remain with Germany. Further plebiscites were held in Eupen-Malmedy and Neutral Moresnet. On 20 September 1920, the League of Nations allotted these territories to Belgium. These latter plebiscites were followed by a boundary commission in 1922, followed by the new Belgian-German border being recognized by the German Government on 15 December 1923.
The transfer of the Hultschin area, of Silesia, to Czechoslovakia was completed on 3 February 1921.

Following the implementation of the treaty, Upper Silesia was initially governed by Britain, France, and Italy. Between 1919 and 1921, three major outbreaks of violence took place between German and Polish civilians, resulting in German and Polish military forces also becoming involved.
In March 1921, the Inter-Allied Commission held the Upper Silesia plebiscite, which was peaceful despite the previous violence. The plebiscite resulted in the population voting for the province to remain part of Germany.
Following the vote, the League of Nations debated the future of the province.
In 1922, Upper Silesia was partitioned: Oppeln, in the north-west, remained with Germany while Silesia Province, in the south-east, was transferred to Poland.

Memel remained under the authority of the League of Nations, with a French Armed Forces garrison, until January 1923.
On 9 January 1923, the Lithuanian Army invaded the territory during the Klaipėda Revolt.
The French garrison withdrew, and in February the Allies agreed to attach Memel as an &quot;autonomous territory&quot; to Lithuania. On 8 May 1924, after negotiations between the Lithuanian Government and the Conference of Ambassadors and action by the League of Nations, the annexation of Memel was ratified. Lithuania accepted the Memel Statute, a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status while responsibility for the territory remained with the great powers. The League of Nations mediated between the Germans and Lithuanians on a local level, helping the power-sharing arrangement last until 1939.

On 13 January 1935, 15 years after the Saar Basin had been placed under the protection of the League of Nations, a plebiscite was held to determine the future of the area. were cast, with ( the ballot) in favour of union with Germany; were cast for the status quo, and for union with France. The region returned to German sovereignty on 1 March 1935. When the result was announced including from Germany fled to France.

===Rhineland occupation===

In late 1918, American, Belgian, British, and French troops entered the Rhineland to enforce the armistice. Before the treaty, the occupation force stood at roughly 740,000 men. Following the signing of the peace treaty, the numbers drastically decreased and by 1926 the occupation force numbered only 76,000 men.
As part of the 1929 negotiations that would become the Young Plan, Gustav Stresemann, and Aristide Briand negotiated the early withdrawal of Allied forces from the Rhineland.
On 30 June 1930, after speeches and the lowering of flags, the last troops of the Anglo-French-Belgian occupation force withdrew from Germany.

Belgium maintained an occupation force of roughly 10,000 troops throughout the initial years.
This figure fell to 7,102 by 1926, and continued to fall as a result of diplomatic developments.

The British Second Army, with some 275,000 veteran soldiers, entered Germany in late 1918. In March 1919, this force became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). The total number of troops committed to the occupation rapidly dwindled as veteran soldiers were demobilized, and were replaced by inexperienced men who had finished basic training following the cessation of hostilities.
By 1920, the BAOR consisted of only 40,594 men and the following year had been further reduced to 12,421. The size of the BAOR fluctuated over the following years, but never rose above 9,000 men. The British did not adhere to all obligated territorial withdrawals as dictated by Versailles, on account of Germany not meeting her own treaty obligations.
A complete withdrawal was considered, but rejected in order to maintain a presence to continue acting as a check on French ambitions and prevent the establishment of an autonomous Rhineland Republic.

The French Army of the Rhine was initially 250,000 men strong, including at a peak 40,000 African colonial troops (). By 1923, the French occupation force had decreased to roughly 130,000 men, including 27,126 African troops.
The troop numbers peaked again at 250,000 during the occupation of the Ruhr, before decreasing to 60,000 men by 1926. Germans viewed the use of French colonial troops as a deliberate act of humiliation, and used their presence to create a propaganda campaign dubbed the Black Shame. This campaign lasted throughout the 1920s and 30s, although peaked in 1920 and 1921. For example, a 1921 German Government memo detailed 300 acts of violence from colonial troops, which included 65 murders and 170 sexual offenses. Historical consensus is that the charges were exaggerated for political and propaganda purposes, and that the colonial troops behaved far better than their white counterparts. An estimated 500–800 Rhineland Bastards were born as a result of fraternization between colonial troops and German women, and who would later be persecuted.

The United States Third Army entered Germany with . In June 1919, the Third Army demobilized and by 1920 the US occupation force had been reduced to . Wilson further reduced the garrison to , before Warren G. Harding&#x27;s inauguration in 1921. On 7 January 1923, after the Franco–Belgian occupation of the Ruhr, the US senate legislated the withdrawal of the remaining force.
On 24 January, the American garrison started their withdrawal from the Rhineland, with the final troops leaving in early February.

==Violations==
===Reparations===
In June 1921 Germany made the first cash payment of 1 billion gold marks due under the London Schedule of Payments. However, this was the only full payment of cash made under the unamended schedule, and from then until the Dawes plan began operation in late 1924 only small cash payments were made. Whilst in-kind payments of goods such as coal and timber were made throughout 1922, these were never paid in full, and in December 1922 Germany was declared in default of timber deliveries by a 3-to-1 vote of the Reparations Commission, the British representative casting the sole opposing vote. On 9 January of the following year, after Germany had defaulted either partially or wholly on coal deliveries for the thirty-fourth time in thirty-six months, the Reparations Commission also declared Germany in default of coal reparations and authorised the occupation of the Ruhr coalfields in order to secure the deliveries, again with the British representative casting the sole opposing vote and all other votes being in favour.

In a move that was condemned by the British, French, Belgian, and Italian engineers supported by French and Belgian forces occupied the Ruhr area on 11 January 1923. The German government answered with &quot;passive resistance&quot;, which meant that coal miners and railway workers refused to obey any instructions by the occupation forces. Production and transportation came to a standstill, but the financial consequences, including the payment in paper currency of striking workers by the German government, contributed to German hyperinflation in the period from late 1921 to 1924. Consequently, passive resistance was called off in late 1923. The end of passive resistance in the Ruhr allowed Germany to undertake a currency reform and to negotiate the Dawes Plan, which led to the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr Area in 1925. The agreement of the Dawes plan in late 1924 also led to a resumption of reparations payments in hard cash and gold. Total receipts from the Ruhr occupation summed to 900 million gold marks.

From the agreement of the Dawes Plan in late 1924 until July 1931 when payment was suspended under a proposal by Herbert Hoover as a result of the Great Depression, reparations payments were made regularly and on time both in cash and in-kind, though always slightly less than was required under the plan. The one year suspension of payments under the Hoover Moratorium was to be converted into a permanent moratorium according to a proposal created at the Lausanne Conference of 1932, however the agreement was never ratified. The government of Adolf Hitler declared all further payments cancelled in 1933, and no further reparations payments were made until after the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War. Germany finally paid off its debts under the Versailles treaty, which had been reduced by 50% at the 1953 London Debt Conference, in 2010.

===Military===
In 1920, the head of the Hans von Seeckt clandestinely re-established the General Staff, by expanding the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (Troop Office); purportedly a human resources section of the army. In March, German troops entered the Rhineland under the guise of attempting to quell possible unrest by the Communist Party of Germany and in doing so violated the demilitarized zone. In response, French troops advanced farther into Germany until the German troops withdrew.

German officials conspired systematically to evade the clauses of the treaty, by failing to meet disarmament deadlines, refusing Allied officials access to military facilities, and maintaining and hiding weapon production. As the treaty did not ban German companies from producing war material outside of Germany, companies moved to the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. Bofors was bought by Krupp, and in 1921 German troops were sent to Sweden to test weapons.
The establishment of diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, via the Genoa Conference and Treaty of Rapallo, was also used to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles. Publicly, these diplomatic exchanges were largely in regards to trade and future economic cooperation. But secret military clauses were included that allowed for Germany to develop weapons inside the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it allowed for Germany to establish three training areas for aviation, chemical and tank warfare. In 1923, the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; made several claims about the state of the German Armed Forces: that it had equipment for , was transferring army staff to civilian positions in order to obscure their real duties, and warned of the militarization of the German police force by the exploitation of the Krümper system. 

The Weimar Government also funded domestic rearmament programs, which were covertly funded with the money camouflaged in &quot;X-budgets&quot;, worth up to an additional the disclosed military budget.
By 1925, German companies had begun to design tanks and modern artillery. During the year, over half of Chinese arms imports were German and worth 13 million &quot;Reichsmarks.&quot; In January 1927, following the withdrawal of the Allied disarmament committee, Krupps ramped up production of armor plate and artillery.
 Production increased so that by 1937, military exports had increased to &quot;Reichsmarks&quot;. Production was not the only violation: &quot;Volunteers&quot; were rapidly passed through the army to make a pool of trained reserves, and paramilitary organizations were encouraged with the illegally militarized police. Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) were not limited by the treaty, thus this loophole was exploited and as such the number of NCOs were vastly in excess to the number needed by the .

In December 1931, the finalized a second rearmament plan that called for 480 million &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; to be spent over the following five years: this program sought to provide Germany the capability of creating and supplying a defensive force of 21 divisions supported by aircraft, artillery, and tanks. This coincided with a 1 billion &quot;Reichsmark&quot; programme that planned for additional industrial infrastructure that would be able to permanently maintain this force. As these programs did not require an expansion of the military, they were nominally legal.
On 7 November 1932, the Reich Minister of Defense Kurt von Schleicher authorized the illegal Plan for a standing army of 21 divisions based on soldiers and a large militia. Later in the year at the World Disarmament Conference, Germany withdrew to force France and Britain to accept German equality of status. London attempted to get Germany to return with the promise of all nations maintaining an equality in armaments and security. The British later proposed and agreed to an increase in the to men, and for Germany to have an air force half the size of the French. It was also negotiated for the French Army to be reduced.

In October 1933, following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the founding of the Nazi regime, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. In March 1935, Germany reintroduced conscription followed by an open rearmament programme and the official unveiling of the Luftwaffe (air force), and signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement that allowed a surface fleet the size of the Royal Navy. The resulting rearmament programmes were allotted 35 billion &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; over an eight-year period.

===Territorial===
On 7 March 1936, German troops entered and remilitarized the Rhineland.
On 12 March 1938, following German pressure to the collapse of the Austrian Government, German troops crossed into Austria and the following day Hitler announced the &quot;Anschluss&quot;: the annexation of Austria by Germany.
The following year, on 23 March 1939, Germany annexed Memel from Lithuania.

===War criminals===

Despite &quot;hang the Kaiser&quot; being a popular slogan of the time, particularly in Britain, the proposed trial of the Kaiser under Article 227 of the Versailles treaty never took place. Defying popular British anger at the Kaiser, and the fact that putting the Kaiser on trial was originally a British proposal, Lloyd George refused to support French calls for the Kaiser to be extradited from the Netherlands where he was living in exile. The Dutch authorities refused extradition, and the former Kaiser died there in 1941.

Article 228 allowed for the extradition of German war criminals to stand trial before Allied tribunals. Originally a list of as many of 20,000 alleged criminals was prepared by the Allies, however this was later reduced. Following the ratification of the treaty in January 1920, the Allies submitted a request that 890 (or 895) alleged war criminals be extradited for trial. France and Belgium each requested the extradition of 334 individuals including von Hindenburg and Ludendorff for the damages they had inflicted on Belgium and the mass deportations they had overseen from both France and Belgium. Britain submitted a list of 94 names, including von Tirpitz for the sinkings of civilian shipping by German U-boats. Italy&#x27;s request included 29 names divided between those accused of mistreating prisoners of war and those responsible for U-Boat sinkings. Romania requested the extradition of 41 individuals including von Mackensen. Poland requested 51 people be extradited, and Yugoslavia (successor to wartime Serbia) four. Germany refused extradition, however, claiming that carrying out such a request to extradite people widely regarded as heroes in Germany would likely result in the fall of the government, but made a counter-offer of holding trials at Leipzig, an offer that was ultimately accepted by the Allies.

After subsequent negotiation, the list of alleged war criminals submitted by the Allies for trial at Leipzig was reduced to 45, however, this ultimately also ended up being too many for the German authorities, and in the end only 12 officers were put on trial – six from the British list, five from the French one, and one from the Belgian list. The British list included only low-level officers and enlisted men, including a prison-guard accused of beating prisoners of war and two U-Boat commanders who sank hospital ships (the Dover Castle and the Llandovery Castle). In contrast the French list were all high-ranking officials, including Lieutenant-General Karl Stenger, who was accused of massacring French prisoners of war. The Belgian case involved a man accused of mistreating and imprisoning Belgian children. However, when the Germans announced that the trial would be under German law, with the German prosecutor being able to exercise prosecutorial discretion, the French and Belgians withdrew from the process in protest. Only half of the cases led to conviction, with superior orders being allowed as a defence in the Dover Castle case, and in mitigation in the Llandovery Castle case where the officer responsible had massacred seamen in lifeboats. All but one of the people put forward by the French were acquitted, including Karl Stenger, who was showered with flowers by German spectators. The Belgian case was also acquitted.

The Commission of Allied Jurists responded to these proceedings on 22 January 1922 by declaring that the Leipzig court had failed to carry out its mandate by failing to convict accused who should have been convicted, and by showing excessive leniency even where people had been convicted. The Allied Jurists recommended that extradition of war criminals be requested under Article 228. However, no further extradition request was made, though trials were held in France and Belgium of German war criminals &quot;in absentia&quot;.

==Historical assessments==
Historians are split on the impact of the treaty. Some saw it as a good solution in a difficult time, others saw it as a disastrous measure that would anger the Germans to seek revenge. The actual impact of the treaty is also disputed.

In his book &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot;, John Maynard Keynes referred to the Treaty of Versailles as a &quot;Carthaginian peace&quot;, a misguided attempt to destroy Germany on behalf of French revanchism, rather than to follow the fairer principles for a lasting peace set out in Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, which Germany had accepted at the armistice. He stated: &quot;I believe that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.&quot;
Keynes had been the principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference, and used in his passionate book arguments that he and others (including some US officials) had used at Paris. He believed the sums being asked of Germany in reparations were many times more than it was possible for Germany to pay, and that these would produce drastic instability.

French economist Étienne Mantoux disputed that analysis. During the 1940s, Mantoux wrote a posthumously published book titled &quot;The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes&quot; in an attempt to rebut Keynes&#x27; claims. More recently economists have argued that the restriction of Germany to a small army saved it so much money it could afford the reparations payments.

It has been argued—for instance by historian Gerhard Weinberg in his book &quot;A World at Arms&quot;—that the treaty was in fact quite advantageous to Germany. The Bismarckian Reich was maintained as a political unit instead of being broken up, and Germany largely escaped post-war military occupation (in contrast to the situation following World War II). In a 1995 essay, Weinberg noted that with the disappearance of Austria-Hungary and with Russia withdrawn from Europe, that Germany was now the dominant power in Eastern Europe.

The British military historian Correlli Barnett argued that the Treaty of Versailles was &quot;extremely lenient in comparison with the peace terms that Germany herself, when she was expecting to win the war, had had in mind to impose on the Allies&quot;. Furthermore, he said, it was &quot;hardly a slap on the wrist&quot; when contrasted with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that Germany had imposed on a defeated Russian SFSR in March 1918, which had taken away a third of Russia&#x27;s population (albeit mostly of non-Russian ethnicity), one-half of Russia&#x27;s industrial undertakings and nine-tenths of Russia&#x27;s coal mines, coupled with an indemnity of six billion marks. Eventually, even under the &quot;cruel&quot; terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany&#x27;s economy had been restored to its pre-war status.

Barnett also argues that, in strategic terms, Germany was in fact in a superior position following the Treaty than she had been in 1914. Germany&#x27;s eastern frontiers faced Russia and Austria, who had both in the past balanced German power. Barnett asserts that its post-war eastern borders were safer, because the former Austrian Empire fractured after the war into smaller, weaker states, Russia was wracked by revolution and civil war, and the newly restored Poland was no match for even a defeated Germany. In the West, Germany was balanced only by France and Belgium, both of which were smaller in population and less economically vibrant than Germany. Barnett concludes by saying that instead of weakening Germany, the treaty &quot;much enhanced&quot; German power.
Britain and France should have (according to Barnett) &quot;divided and permanently weakened&quot; Germany by undoing Bismarck&#x27;s work and partitioning Germany into smaller, weaker states so it could never have disrupted the peace of Europe again.
By failing to do this and therefore not solving the problem of German power and restoring the equilibrium of Europe, Britain &quot;had failed in her main purpose in taking part in the Great War&quot;.

The British historian of modern Germany Richard J. Evans wrote that during the war the German right was committed to an annexationist program which aimed at Germany annexing most of Europe and Africa. Consequently, any peace treaty that did not leave Germany as the conqueror would be unacceptable to them. Short of allowing Germany to keep all the conquests of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Evans argued that there was nothing that could have been done to persuade the German right to accept Versailles. Evans further noted that the parties of the Weimar Coalition, namely the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Christian democratic Centre Party, were all equally opposed to Versailles, and it is false to say as some historians have that opposition to Versailles also equalled opposition to the Weimar Republic. Finally, Evans argued that it is untrue that Versailles caused the premature end of the Republic, instead contending that it was the Great Depression of the early 1930s that put an end to German democracy. He also argued that Versailles was not the &quot;main cause&quot; of National Socialism and the German economy was &quot;only marginally influenced by the impact of reparations&quot;.

Ewa Thompson points out that the treaty allowed numerous nations in Central and Eastern Europe to liberate themselves from oppressive German rule, a fact that is often neglected by Western historiography, more interested in understanding the German point of view. In nations that found themselves free as the result of the treaty—such as Poles or Czechs—it is seen as a symbol of recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by their much larger aggressive neighbours.

Resentment caused by the treaty sowed fertile psychological ground for the eventual rise of the Nazi Party, but the German-born Australian historian Jürgen Tampke argued that it was &quot;a perfidious distortion of history&quot; to argue that the terms prevented the growth of democracy in Germany and aided the growth of the Nazi Party; saying that its terms were not as punitive as often held and that German hyper-inflation in the 1920s was partly a deliberate policy to minimise the cost of reparations. As an example of the arguments against the he quotes Elizabeth Wiskemann who heard two officer&#x27;s widows in Wiesbaden complaining that &quot;with their stocks of linen depleted they had to have their linen washed once a fortnight (every two weeks) instead of once a month!&quot;

The German historian Detlev Peukert wrote that Versailles was far from the impossible peace that most Germans claimed it was during the interwar period, and though not without flaws was actually quite reasonable to Germany. Rather, Peukert argued that it was widely believed in Germany that Versailles was a totally unreasonable treaty, and it was this &quot;perception&quot; rather than the &quot;reality&quot; of the Versailles treaty that mattered. Peukert noted that because of the &quot;millenarian hopes&quot; created in Germany during World War I when for a time it appeared that Germany was on the verge of conquering all of Europe, any peace treaty the Allies of World War I imposed on the defeated &quot;German Reich&quot; were bound to create a nationalist backlash, and there was nothing the Allies could have done to avoid that backlash. Having noted that much, Peukert commented that the policy of rapprochement with the Western powers that Gustav Stresemann carried out between 1923 and 1929 were constructive policies that might have allowed Germany to play a more positive role in Europe, and that it was not true that German democracy was doomed to die in 1919 because of Versailles. Finally, Peukert argued that it was the Great Depression and the turn to a nationalist policy of autarky within Germany at the same time that finished off the Weimar Republic, not the Treaty of Versailles.

French historian Raymond Cartier states that millions of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland and in Posen-West Prussia were placed under foreign rule in a hostile environment, where harassment and violation of rights by authorities are documented.
Cartier asserts that, out of 1,058,000 Germans in Posen-West Prussia in 1921, 758,867 fled their homelands within five years due to Polish harassment. These sharpening ethnic conflicts would lead to public demands to reattach the annexed territory in 1938 and become a pretext for Hitler&#x27;s annexations of Czechoslovakia and parts of Poland.

According to David Stevenson, since the opening of French archives, most commentators have remarked on French restraint and reasonableness at the conference, though Stevenson notes that &quot;[t]he jury is still out&quot;, and that &quot;there have been signs that the pendulum of judgement is swinging back the other way.&quot;

===Territorial changes===
The Treaty of Versailles resulted in the creation of several thousand miles of new boundaries, with maps playing a central role in the negotiations at Paris. The plebiscites initiated due to the treaty have drawn much comment. Historian Robert Peckham wrote that the issue of Schleswig &quot;was premised on a gross simplification of the region&#x27;s history. ... Versailles ignored any possibility of there being a third way: the kind of compact represented by the Swiss Federation; a bilingual or even trilingual Schleswig-Holsteinian state&quot; or other options such as &quot;a Schleswigian state in a loose confederation with Denmark or Germany, or an autonomous region under the protection of the League of Nations.&quot;
In regard to the East Prussia plebiscite, historian Richard Blanke wrote that &quot;no other contested ethnic group has ever, under un-coerced conditions, issued so one-sided a statement of its national preference&quot;. Richard Debo wrote &quot;both Berlin and Warsaw believed the Soviet invasion of Poland had influenced the East Prussian plebiscites. Poland appeared so close to collapse that even Polish voters had cast their ballots for Germany&quot;.

In regard to the Silesian plebiscite, Blanke observed &quot;given that the electorate was at least 60% Polish-speaking, this means that about one &#x27;Pole&#x27; in three voted for Germany&quot; and &quot;most Polish observers and historians&quot; have concluded that the outcome of the plebiscite was due to &quot;unfair German advantages of incumbency and socio-economic position&quot;. Blanke alleged &quot;coercion of various kinds even in the face of an allied occupation regime&quot; occurred, and that Germany granted votes to those &quot;who had been born in Upper Silesia but no longer resided there&quot;. Blanke concluded that despite these protests &quot;there is plenty of other evidence, including Reichstag election results both before and after 1921 and the large-scale emigration of Polish-speaking Upper Silesians to Germany after 1945, that their identification with Germany in 1921 was neither exceptional nor temporary&quot; and &quot;here was a large population of Germans and Poles—not coincidentally, of the same Catholic religion—that not only shared the same living space but also came in many cases to see themselves as members of the same national community&quot;. Prince Eustachy Sapieha, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, alleged that Soviet Russia &quot;appeared to be intentionally delaying negotiations&quot; to end the Polish-Soviet War &quot;with the object of influencing the Upper Silesian plebiscite&quot;. Once the region was partitioned, both &quot;Germany and Poland attempted to &#x27;cleanse&#x27; their shares of Upper Silesia&quot; via oppression resulting in Germans migrating to Germany and Poles migrating to Poland. Despite the oppression and migration, Opole Silesia &quot;remained ethnically mixed.&quot;

Frank Russell wrote that, in regard to the Saar plebiscite, the inhabitants &quot;were not terrorized at the polls&quot; and the &quot;totalitarian [Nazi] German regime was not distasteful to most of the Saar inhabitants and that they preferred it even to an efficient, economical, and benevolent international rule.&quot; When the outcome of the vote became known, 4,100 (including 800 refugees who had previously fled Germany) residents fled over the border into France.

===Military terms and violations===
During the formulation of the treaty, the British wanted Germany to abolish conscription but be allowed to maintain a volunteer Army. The French wanted Germany to maintain a conscript army of up to 200,000 men in order to justify their own maintenance of a similar force. Thus the treaty&#x27;s allowance of 100,000 volunteers was a compromise between the British and French positions. Germany, on the other hand, saw the terms as leaving them defenseless against any potential enemy.
Bernadotte Everly Schmitt wrote that &quot;there is no reason to believe that the Allied governments were insincere when they stated at the beginning of Part V of the Treaty ... that in order to facilitate a general reduction of the armament of all nations, Germany was to be required to disarm first.&quot; A lack of American ratification of the treaty or joining the League of Nations left France unwilling to disarm, which resulted in a German desire to rearm. Schmitt argued &quot;had the four Allies remained united, they could have forced Germany really to disarm, and the German will and capacity to resist other provisions of the treaty would have correspondingly diminished.&quot;

Max Hantke and Mark Spoerer wrote &quot;military and economic historians [have] found that the German military only insignificantly exceeded the limits&quot; of the treaty before 1933. Adam Tooze concurred, and wrote &quot;To put this in perspective, annual military spending by the Weimar Republic was counted not in the billions but in the hundreds of millions of &quot;Reichsmarks&quot;&quot;; for example, the Weimar Republic&#x27;s 1931 program of 480 million &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; over five years compared to the Nazi Government&#x27;s 1933 plan to spend 4.4 billion &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; per year.
P. M. H. Bell argued that the British Government was aware of later Weimar rearming, and lent public respectability to the German efforts by not opposing them, an opinion shared by Churchill.
Norman Davies wrote that &quot;a curious oversight&quot; of the military restrictions were that they &quot;did not include rockets in its list of prohibited weapons&quot;, which provided Wernher von Braun an area to research within eventually resulting in &quot;his break [that] came in 1943&quot; leading to the development of the V-2 rocket.

=== Rise of the Nazis ===
The Treaty created much resentment in Germany, which was exploited by Adolf Hitler in his rise to power at the helm of Nazi Germany. Central to this was belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, which held that the German army had not lost the war and had been betrayed by the Weimar Republic, who negotiated an unnecessary surrender. The Great Depression exacerbated the issue and led to a collapse of the German economy. Though the treaty may not have caused the crash, it was a convenient scapegoat. Germans viewed the treaty as a humiliation and eagerly listened to Hitler&#x27;s oratory which blamed the treaty for Germany&#x27;s ills. Hitler promised to reverse the depredations of the Allied powers and recover Germany&#x27;s lost territory and pride, which has led to the treaty being cited as a cause of World War II.

Hermann Göring first met Adolf Hitler at a speech which Hitler gave at a rally against French demands for the extradition of alleged German war criminals under the Versailles treaty.

<text>Mort is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. Published in 1987, it is the fourth &quot;Discworld&quot; novel and the first to focus on the character Death, who only appeared as a side character in the previous novels. The title is the name of its main character, and is also a play on words: in French and Catalan, &quot;mort&quot; means &quot;death&quot;, while in Romanian means &quot;dead&quot;. The French language edition is titled &quot;Mortimer&quot;, and the Catalan language edition is titled &quot;Morth&quot;.

In 2004, Pratchett stated that &quot;Mort&quot; was the first Discworld novel with which he was &quot;pleased&quot;, stating that in previous books, the plot had existed to support the jokes, but that in &quot;Mort&quot;, the plot was integral.

==Plot summary==
As a teenager, Mort has a personality and temperament that makes him unsuited to the family farming business. Mort&#x27;s father Lezek takes him to a local hiring fair in the hope that Mort will land an apprenticeship. Just before the last stroke of midnight, Death arrives and takes Mort on as an apprentice. Death takes Mort to his domain, where he meets Death&#x27;s elderly manservant Albert, and his adopted daughter Ysabell. Mort later accompanies Death as he travels to collect the soul of the King of Sto Lat, who is due to be assassinated by the scheming Duke of Sto Helit. After Mort unsuccessfully tries to prevent the assassination, Death warns him that all deaths are predetermined, and that he cannot interfere with fate.

Death assigns Mort to collect the soul of Princess Keli, daughter of the murdered king, but he instead kills the assassin the Duke had sent after her. Keli lives, but shortly after the assassin&#x27;s death people begin acting as if something had happened without knowing why, namely what would be funeral preparations and acts of mourning. She soon finds that the rest of the world no longer acknowledges her existence unless she confronts them and even then they forget her immediately after. She subsequently employs the wizard Igneous Cutwell, who is able to see her as he is trained to see things that are invisible to normal people to make her existence clear to the public. Mort eventually discovers that his actions have created an alternate reality in which Keli lives, but he also learns that it is being overridden by the original reality and will eventually cease to exist, killing Keli. While consulting Cutwell, Mort sees a picture of Unseen University&#x27;s founder, Alberto Malich, noting that he bears a resemblance to Albert.

Mort and Ysabell travel into the Stack, a library in Death&#x27;s domain that holds the biographies of everyone who has ever lived, in order to investigate Albert, eventually discovering that he is indeed Malich. They further learn that Malich had feared monsters waiting for him in the afterlife, and performed a reversed version of the Rite of AshkEnte in the hope of keeping Death away from him. The spell backfired and sent him to Death&#x27;s side, where he has remained in order to put off his demise. During this time, Death, yearning to relish what being human is like, travels to Ankh-Morpork to indulge in new experiences, including getting drunk, dancing, gambling and finding a job. Mort in turn starts to become more like Death, adopting his mannerisms and aspects of his personality, while his own is slowly overridden.

Death&#x27;s absence forces Mort to collect the next two souls, who are both located on separate parts of the Disc (in the Agatean Empire and Tsort, respectively), and due to die on the same night that the alternate reality will be destroyed. Before he and Ysabell leave to collect the souls, Mort uses the part of Death within him to force Albert to provide a spell that will slow down the alternate reality&#x27;s destruction. After Mort and Ysabell leave, Albert returns to Unseen University, under the identity of Malich. His eagerness to live on the Disc is reinvigorated during this time, and he has the wizards perform the Rite of AshkEnte in the hope of finally escaping Death&#x27;s grasp. The ritual summons both Death and the part of Death that had been taking Mort over, restoring him to normal. Unaware of Albert&#x27;s treachery, Death takes him back into his service, the Librarian preventing the wizard&#x27;s escape.

Mort and Ysabell travel to Keli&#x27;s palace, where the princess and Cutwell have organised a hasty coronation ceremony in the hope that Keli can be crowned queen before the alternate reality is destroyed. With the reality now too small for Albert&#x27;s spell, Mort and Ysabell save Keli and Cutwell from being destroyed with the alternate reality. They return to Death&#x27;s domain to find a furious Death waiting for them, the latter having learned of Mort&#x27;s actions from Albert. Death dismisses Mort and attempts to take the souls of Keli and Cutwell, but Mort challenges him to a duel for them. Though Death eventually wins the duel, he spares Mort&#x27;s life and sends him back to the Disc.

Death convinces the gods to change the original reality so that Keli rules in place of the Duke, who was inadvertently killed during Death and Mort&#x27;s duel due to the destruction of his lifetimer. Mort and Ysabell – who have fallen in love over the course of the story – get married, and are made Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit by Keli, while Cutwell is made the Master of the Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber. Death attends Mort and Ysabell&#x27;s wedding reception, where he warns Mort that he will have to make sure that the original Duke&#x27;s destiny is fulfilled, and presents him with the alternate reality he created, now shrunk to the size of a large pearl, before the two part on amicable terms.

==Adaptations==

Stephen Briggs adapted the novel for the stage in 1992.

The novel was adapted as a graphic novel, &quot;Mort: The Big Comic&quot;, published in 1994.

The novel has been adapted by Robin Brooks for BBC Radio Four. Narrated by Anton Lesser, with Geoffrey Whitehead as Death, Carl Prekopp as Mort, Clare Corbett as Ysabell and Alice Hart as Princess Keli, the programme was first broadcast in four parts in mid-2004 and has been repeated frequently, most recently on Radio 4 Extra.

On 15 December 2007 a German-language stage musical adaptation premiered in Hamburg.

An English musical adaptation of &quot;Mort&quot; was presented in Guildford in August 2008 by Youth Music Theatre UK. The adaptation was by Jenifer Toksvig (sister of Sandi Toksvig) and the composer was Dominic Haslam. A new production, directed by Luke Sheppard, was staged at the Greenwich Theatre in 2011.

==Cancelled adaptation==
After the film &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, Disney animators John Musker and Ron Clements planned that their next project would be an animated film version of &quot;Mort&quot;, but their failure to obtain the film rights prevented them from continuing with the project, instead creating &quot;Moana&quot;.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Mort&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #96, and stated that &quot;After a slightly less successful experiment in &quot;Equal Rites&quot;, Pratchett has sussed the combination of hilarity with a tortuous plot, and the rest of us would-be humorists hate him for it.&quot;

In the BBC&#x27;s 2003 Big Read contest, viewers voted on the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Best-loved Book&quot;; &quot;Mort&quot; was among the Top 100 and chosen as the most popular of Pratchett&#x27;s novels.

<text>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.
He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web&#x27;s subsequent explosive development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.

Berners-Lee was previously a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder&#x27;s chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe. In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. He received the 2016 Turing Award &quot;for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale&quot;. He was named in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.

==Early life==
Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management.

Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.

From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics. While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.

==Career and research==

After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.

Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.

After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole&#x27;s Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset. He ran the company&#x27;s technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a &quot;real-time remote procedure call&quot; which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.

In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet:


Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall, who called his proposals &quot;vague, but exciting&quot;. Robert Cailliau had independently proposed a project to develop a hypertext system at CERN, and joined Berners-Lee as a partner in his efforts to get the web off the ground. They used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which Berners-Lee designed and built the first web browser. His software also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).

Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get started with your own website. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a public invitation for collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.

In a list of 80 cultural moments that shaped the world, chosen by a panel of 25 eminent scientists, academics, writers and world leaders in 2016, the invention of the World Wide Web was ranked number one, with the entry stating, &quot;The fastest growing communications medium of all time, the Internet has changed the shape of modern life forever. We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world.&quot;

In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone.

Berners-Lee participated in Curl Corp&#x27;s attempt to develop and promote the Curl programming language.

In 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset. In December 2004, he accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web.

In a &quot;Times&quot; article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes (&quot;//&quot;) in a web address were &quot;unnecessary&quot;. He told the newspaper that he easily could have designed web addresses without the slashes. &quot;There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time,&quot; he said in his lighthearted apology.

===Policy work===

By 2010, he created data.gov.uk alongside Nigel Shadbolt. Commenting on the Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said: &quot;The changes signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around.&quot; He went on to say: &quot;Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.&quot;

In November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation (WWWF).

Berners-Lee is one of the pioneer voices in favour of net neutrality, and has expressed the view that ISPs should supply &quot;connectivity with no strings attached&quot;, and should neither control nor monitor the browsing activities of customers without their expressed consent. He advocates the idea that net neutrality is a kind of human network right: &quot;Threats to the Internet, such as companies or governments that interfere with or snoop on Internet traffic, compromise basic human network rights.&quot; Berners-Lee participated in an open letter to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He and 20 other Internet pioneers urged the FCC to cancel a vote on 14 December 2017 to uphold net neutrality. The letter was addressed to Senator Roger Wicker, Senator Brian Schatz, Representative Marsha Blackburn and Representative Michael F. Doyle.

Berners-Lee was honoured as the &quot;Inventor of the World Wide Web&quot; during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer. He tweeted &quot;This is for everyone&quot; which appeared in LED lights attached to the chairs of the audience.

Berners-Lee joined the board of advisors of start-up State.com, based in London. As of May 2012, he is president of the Open Data Institute, which he co-founded with Nigel Shadbolt in 2012.

The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013, and Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft. The A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Berners-Lee will work with those aiming to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission&#x27;s worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.

Berners-Lee holds the founders chair in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he heads the Decentralized Information Group and is leading Solid, a joint project with the Qatar Computing Research Institute that aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. In October 2016, he joined the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University as a professorial research fellow and as a fellow of Christ Church, one of the Oxford colleges.

From the mid-2010s, Berners-Lee initially remained neutral on the emerging Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) proposal with its controversial digital rights management (DRM) implications. In March 2017 he felt he had to take a position which was to support the EME proposal. He reasoned EME&#x27;s virtues whilst noting DRM was inevitable. As W3C director, he went on to approve the finalised specification in July 2017. His stance was opposed by some including Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the anti-DRM campaign Defective by Design and the Free Software Foundation. Varied concerns raised included being not supportive of the Internet&#x27;s open philosophy against commercial interests and risks of users being forced to use a particular web browser to view specific DRM content. The EFF raised a formal appeal which did not succeed and the EME specification became a formal W3C recommendation in September 2017.

On 30 September 2018, Berners-Lee announced his new open-source startup Inrupt to fuel a commercial ecosystem around the Solid project, which aims to give users more control over their personal data and lets them choose where the data goes, who&#x27;s allowed to see certain elements and which apps are allowed to see that data.

In November 2019, at the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin, Berners-Lee and the WWWF launched &quot;Contract for the Web&quot;, a campaign initiative to persuade governments, companies and citizens to commit to nine principles to stop &quot;misuse&quot;, with the warning that &quot;if we don&#x27;t act nowand act togetherto prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering [its potential for good]&quot;.

===Awards and honours===

Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours &quot;for services to the global development of the Internet&quot;, and was invested formally on 16 July 2004.

On 13 June 2007, he was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM), an order restricted to 24 living members, plus any honorary members. Bestowing membership of the Order of Merit is within the personal purview of the Sovereign and does not require recommendation by ministers or the Prime Minister.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001. He was also elected as a member into the American Philosophical Society in 2004 and the National Academy of Engineering in 2007.

He has been conferred honorary degrees from a number of universities around the world, including Manchester (his parents worked on the Manchester Mark 1 in the 1940s), Harvard and Yale.

In 2012, Berners-Lee was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.

In 2013, he was awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. On 4 April 2017, he received the 2016 Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s Turing Award for his invention of the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and their fundamental protocols and algorithms.

==Personal life==
Berners-Lee has said &quot;I like to keep work and personal life separate.&quot;

Berners-Lee married Nancy Carlson, an American computer programmer, in 1990. She was also working in Switzerland at the World Health Organization. They had two children and divorced in 2011. In 2014, he married Rosemary Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James&#x27;s Palace in London. Leith is a Canadian Internet and banking entrepreneur and a founding director of Berners-Lee&#x27;s World Wide Web Foundation. The couple also collaborate on venture capital to support artificial intelligence companies.

Berners-Lee was raised as an Anglican, but he turned away from religion in his youth. After he became a parent, he became a Unitarian Universalist (UU). When asked whether he believes in God, he stated: &quot;Not in the sense of most people, I&#x27;m atheist and Unitarian Universalist.&quot;

The web&#x27;s source code was auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s in London during 23–30 June 2021, as a non-fungible token (NFT) by TimBL. Selling for US$5,434,500, it was reported the proceeds would be used to fund initiatives by TimBL and Leith.

<doc id="30035" wikidata="Q12393" url="?curid=30035" title="The Legend of Zelda">
<text>is a video game series created by the Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is primarily developed and published by Nintendo; some portable installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Flagship, Vanpool, Grezzo, and Tantalus Media.

The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young man of the elf-like Hylian race, and Princess Zelda, a princess within the bloodline of the goddess Hylia, as they fight to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal antagonist of the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that created Hyrule, to remake the world in his own dark image. When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can grant any wish its user desires, but if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the three virtues of Power, Courage, and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody the required virtue.

Although their personalities and backstory differ from game to game, the incarnations of Link and Zelda often have many traits in common, such as Link often being left-handed and clad in green, and Zelda being associated with wisdom, light, and prophecy. While the conflict with Ganon serves as a backbone for the series, some games have featured other settings and antagonists, with Link traveling or being sent to these other lands in their time of need.

Since &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was released in 1986, the series has expanded to include 21 entries on all of Nintendo&#x27;s major game consoles, as well as a number of spin-offs. An American animated TV series based on the games aired in 1989 and manga adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have been produced in Japan since 1997. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; is one of Nintendo&#x27;s most successful franchises; several of its entries are considered among the greatest video games of all time.

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; games feature a mix of puzzles, action-adventure, and exploration. These elements have remained constant throughout the series, with refinements and additions featured in each new game. Later games in the series include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests, the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas. Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; magic swords, shields, and bows and arrows), while others are unique to a single game. Though the games contain role-playing elements (&quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; is the only one to include an experience system), they emphasize straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of series like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. The game&#x27;s role-playing elements, however, have led to much debate over whether or not the &quot;Zelda&quot; games should be classified as action role-playing games, a genre on which the series has had a strong influence. Miyamoto himself disagreed with the role-playing label, and classified &quot;Zelda&quot; as &quot;a real-time adventure game&quot;; he said that he was &quot;not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and numbers&quot; but wanted &quot;to preserve as much of that &quot;live&quot; feeling as possible&quot;, and felt that action games are better suited to convey to players.

Every game in the main &quot;Zelda&quot; series has consisted of three principal areas: an overworld which connects all other areas, in which movement is multidirectional, allowing the player some degree of freedom of action; areas of interaction with other characters (merely caves or hidden rooms in the first game, but expanding to entire towns and cities in subsequent games) in which the player gains special items or advice, can purchase equipment or complete side quests; and dungeons, areas of labyrinthine layout, usually underground, comprising a wide range of difficult enemies, bosses, and items. Each dungeon usually has one major item inside, which can be essential for solving many of the puzzles within that dungeon and often plays a crucial role in defeating that dungeon&#x27;s boss, as well as progressing through the game. In nearly every &quot;Zelda&quot; game, navigating a dungeon is aided by locating a map, which reveals its layout, and a magic compass, which reveals the location of significant and smaller items such as keys and equipment. In later games, the dungeon includes a special &quot;big key&quot; that will unlock the door to battle the dungeon&#x27;s boss enemy and open the item chest.

In most &quot;Zelda&quot; games, the player&#x27;s HP or life meter is represented by a line of hearts, each heart typically representing two hit points. At the start of the game the player only has three hearts; players can increase their max hearts by finding heart-shaped crystals called &quot;Heart Containers&quot;. Full heart containers are usually received at the end of dungeons and dropped by dungeon bosses. Smaller &quot;Pieces of Heart&quot; are awarded for completing side quests or found hidden around the game world in various places, and require a certain number (usually four) to form a full heart container. Health can be replenished by picking up hearts left by defeated enemies or destroyed objects, consuming items such as potions or food, or going to a Great Fairy Fountain to have the Great Fairy heal Link completely. Occasionally the player will find fairies hidden in specific locations; these fairies can either heal Link immediately or be kept in empty bottles, and will revive the player the next time they die.

The games pioneered a number of features that were to become industry standards. The original &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; was the first console game with a save function that enabled players to stop playing and then resume later. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; introduced a targeting system that let the player lock the camera on to enemy or friendly non-player characters which simplified 3D combat.

=== Inspiration ===
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was principally inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s &quot;explorations&quot; as a young boy in the hillsides, forests, and caves surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan where he ventured into forests with secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages. According to Miyamoto, one of his most memorable experiences was the discovery of a cave entrance in the middle of the woods. After some hesitation, he apprehensively entered the cave, and explored its depths with the aid of a lantern. Miyamoto has referred to the creation of the &quot;Zelda&quot; games as an attempt to bring to life a &quot;miniature garden&quot; for players to play with in each game of the series.

The story and setting were developed by Takashi Tezuka. Seeking to create a fairytale adventure game, Tezuka drew inspirations from fantasy books such as J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. According to Keiji Terui, who wrote the backstory in the first game&#x27;s manual, the location named Death Mountain was initially a working title for the legend of the Triforce which was written with inspirations from the battles of medieval Europe. The Master Sword was introduced as Excalibur in the French version of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, which is regarded as reminiscent to the legend of King Arthur. Celtic mythology inspired the name of Link&#x27;s steed, Epona, based on Epona, Celtic goddess of fertility.

Hearing of American novelist, socialite and painter Zelda Fitzgerald, Miyamoto thought the name sounded &quot;pleasant and significant&quot;. Paying tribute, he chose to name the princess after her, and titled it &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Link and the fairy were inspired by Peter Pan and Tinker Bell. When the series made the transition to 3D, the combat system of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was based on the chanbara (samurai) style of Japanese sword fighting.

=== Audio ===
Games in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series frequently feature in-game musical instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are widespread. Often, instruments trigger game events: for example, the recorder in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; can reveal secret areas, as well as warp Link to the dungeon entrances. This warping with music feature has also been used in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; and &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, playing instruments is a core part of the game, with the player needing to play the instrument through the use of the game controller to succeed. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; is &quot;[one of the] first contemporary non-dance title[s] to feature music-making as part of its gameplay&quot;, using music as a heuristic device and requiring the player to utilise songs to progress in the game – a game mechanic that is also present in &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda Theme&quot; is a recurring piece of music that was created for the first game. The composer and sound director of the series, Koji Kondo, initially planned to use Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; as the game&#x27;s title theme, but was forced to change it when he learned, late in the game&#x27;s development cycle, that the copyright for the orchestral piece had not yet expired. As a result, Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day.

Up until &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; series avoided using voice acting in speaking roles, relying instead on written dialogue. Series producer Eiji Aonuma previously stated that as Link is entirely mute, having the other characters speak while Link remains silent &quot;would be off-putting&quot;. Instead of theme music for different locations, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; plays natural ambience around the player as main sounds, in addition to some minimalist piano music.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, which has developed a deep history and wide geography over the series&#x27;s many releases. Much of the backstory of the creation of Hyrule was revealed in the games &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, and &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;. Hyrule&#x27;s principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like humanoids called Hylians, which include the player character, Link, and the eponymous princess, Zelda.

The fictional universe established by the &quot;Zelda&quot; games sets the stage for each adventure. Some games take place in different lands with their own back-stories. Hytopia is a connected kingdom, Labrynna and Holodrum are different countries separate from the Kingdom of Hyrule, Termina and Lorule serve as parallel worlds, and Koholint is an island far away from Hyrule that appears to be part of a dream.

=== Story ===

According to the in-game backstories, the world of Hyrule was created by the three golden goddesses: Din, Farore, and Nayru. Before departing, the goddesses left a sacred artifact called the Triforce, which could grant powers to the user. It physically manifests itself as three golden triangles in which each embodies one of the goddesses&#x27; virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom. However, because the Triforce has no will of its own and it can not judge between good and evil, it will grant any wish indiscriminately. Because of this, it was placed within an alternate world called the &quot;Sacred Realm&quot; or the &quot;Golden Land&quot; until one worthy of its power and has balanced virtues of Power, Wisdom, and Courage in their heart could obtain it, in its entirety. If a person is not of a balanced heart, the triforce part that the user mostly believes in will stay with that person and the remainder will seek out others. In order to master and control the triforce as a whole, the user must get the other parts found in other individuals and bring them together to reunite them. The Sacred Realm can itself be affected by the heart of those who enter it: those who are pure will make it a paradise, while those who are evil will transform it into a dark realm.

In &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, the Triforce was sought by the Demon King Demise, an eternal being that had conquered time itself. After a long battle against the goddess Hylia, guardian of the Triforce, Demise was sealed away within her temple. Hylia, placing the Hylians on a floating island in the sky called Skyloft to protect them, orchestrated a means to stop the demon from escaping: creating the Goddess Sword (later becoming the Master Sword) for her chosen hero and discarding her divinity to be reborn among the people of Skyloft. In time, Zelda and Link (the reborn Hylia and her predestined warrior) enacted the goddess&#x27;s plan and Demise was destroyed, but he vowed that his rage would be reborn and forever plague those descended from Link and Zelda. Following the establishment of Hyrule Kingdom, Demise&#x27;s prophecy came to fruition in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, when Ganondorf&#x27;s attempt to get the Triforce scattered it with him gaining the Triforce of Power. The Triforce of Wisdom ended up with the Hylian princesses descended from Zelda, each named after her, while the Triforce of Courage is passed to a youth named Link across generations. While the Triforces of Power and Wisdom have been part of the series since the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, it was in &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; that the Triforce of Courage was introduced, being obtained by Link at the end of his quest. The Triforce, or even a piece of it, is not always distributed as a whole. Such as in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, Link must find all the pieces (called Triforce Shards) of the Triforce of Courage before he can return to Hyrule. Even in the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, Zelda breaks her Triforce of Wisdom into 8 pieces for Link to find, before she was captured by Ganon.

==== Fictional chronology ====

The chronology of the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; series was a subject of much debate among fans until an official timeline was released within the &quot;Hyrule Historia&quot; collector&#x27;s book, first released in Japan in December 2011. Prior to its release, in a 2003 interview, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed the existence of an internal document which connected all the games, with series producer Eiji Aonuma later revealing in 2010 the confidential nature of this document, which only Miyamoto himself and the director of each game had access to.

In-game content, marketing material, and developer statements once partially established a timeline of the released installments: the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was followed by &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; as a direct sequel, which takes place several years later; &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; is a prequel to the previous two games, and is followed by &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;; &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; is a prequel to &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; and takes the story many centuries back - according to character designer Satoru Takizawa, it was meant to implicitly tell the story of the Imprisoning War, and was followed by &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; as a direct sequel, set a few months later; &quot;Four Swords&quot;, upon its release, was considered the oldest tale in the series&#x27;s chronology, predating &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;; &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; takes place in one of the parallel timelines that emerged from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, more than a century later, in the &quot;adult era&quot;; &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, upon its release, was considered to be a direct sequel to &quot;Four Swords&quot;, set sometime after its events; &quot;The Minish Cap&quot; is a prequel to &quot;Four Swords&quot;, telling of the origins of villain Vaati and the creation of the Four Sword; &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; takes place in another of the parallel timelines that emerged from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, more than a century later, in the &quot;child era&quot;; &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, and is followed by &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot;, which is set about a century later on a land far away from the setting of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;. &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; precedes &quot;The Minish Cap&quot;, telling the story of the creation of the Master Sword. &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; takes place six generations after &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, and features the Triforce being reunited, and Ganon being resurrected; &quot;Tri Force Heroes&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, which takes place several years later; &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and its direct sequel, &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; take place after all previous games in the series, without specifying a direct connection to any of the three timeline branches.

In the early 2000s, Nintendo of America released a timeline on the official website of the series as one of the possible interpretation of the events from all entries released up to that point, featuring a single protagonist named Link, the &quot;Hero of Time&quot; from its first adventure in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot;, &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;, the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, and finally &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;. In 2011, series translator Daniel Owsen revealed that, at one point, his coworkers at Nintendo of America and him conceived another complete timeline and intended to make it available online, but the Japanese series developers rejected the idea so that the placement of each game would be kept open to the imagination of the players.

On December 21, 2011, to celebrate 25th anniversary of the series, the &quot;Hyrule Historia&quot; art book was published by Shogakukan, which contained an official timeline of the fictional chronology of the series up to that point. This timeline subsequently posits that following &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, it splits into three alternate routes: in one, Ganon is not defeated, leading into the Imprisoning War and &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;, &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; (&quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, &quot;Tri Force Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Echoes of Wisdom&quot; were released after the timeline), &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot;. The second and third, where Ganon is defeated by Link, lead to a split timeline between his childhood (where Zelda sends him back in time so he can use the wisdom he has gained to warn young Zelda of the horrifying fate of Hyrule) and adulthood (where adult Zelda lives on to try and rebuild her kingdom). His childhood continues with &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, followed by &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; and &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;. The timeline from his adult life continues into &quot;Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; and &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot;.

In 2018, Nintendo revealed &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;″s timeline placement after all previous games in the series, without specifying a connection to any of the three timeline branches. Aonuma and &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; director Hidemaro Fujibayashi justified the vague placement with the previous idea of keeping it open to players&#x27; imaginations. Nintendo moved &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; to take place before &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;. In 2020, Nintendo released &quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;, a gameplay-wise sequel to the 2014 spin-off game &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot; marketed as a prequel to &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, being set 100 years before the latter game, but with the events of &quot;Age of Calamity&quot; diverging from the backstory established in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, creating an alternate timeline separate from it.

=== Characters ===
==== Link ====

The central protagonist of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage. In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player characters (NPCs). Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview that he named the protagonist &quot;Link&quot; because the character is/was supposed to be the &quot;link&quot; between the player and the game world. The various Links each have a special title, such as &quot;Hero of Time&quot;, &quot;Hero of Winds&quot; or &quot;Hero of the Wild&quot;. Like many silent protagonists in video games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, etc., but he is not mute - dialogue from him is referenced second-hand by in-game characters, despite not being seen or heard by the player. Link is depicted as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted responses.

==== Princess Zelda ====

Princess Zelda is the princess of Hyrule and the guardian of the Triforce of Wisdom. Her name is present in many of her female ancestors and descendants. While most games require Link to save Zelda from Ganon, she sometimes plays a supporting role in battle, using magical powers and weapons such as Light Arrows to aid Link. With the exception of the CD-i games, she was not playable in the main series until &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot;, where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player. Zelda appears under various other aliases and alter egos, including Sheik (in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;) and Tetra (in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;). In &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, it is revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline. The name &quot;Zelda&quot; derives from the American novelist Zelda Fitzgerald.

==== Ganon ====

Ganon, also known as Ganondorf in his humanoid form, is the main antagonist and the final boss in the majority of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; games. In the series, Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert brigands called the Gerudo, which consists entirely of female warriors save for one man born every one hundred years. He is significantly taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary between games, often taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar. His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often his plans include him kidnapping Princess Zelda and planning to achieve domination of Hyrule and presumably the world beyond it. To this end, he seeks the Triforce, a powerful magical relic. He often possesses a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength, but it is often not enough to accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the remaining Triforce pieces. Unlike Link, Zelda, and most other recurring characters, he is actually the same person in every game, with the exception of &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, where he is a reincarnation of the original. In each game the battles with him are different and he fights using different styles. The game &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; indicates that Ganon is a reincarnation of an evil deity known as Demise.

==Development==
=== 1986–1997: 2D origins ===

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan in February 1986, on the Famicom Disk System. A cartridge version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, using battery-backed memory, was released in 1987 in the United States on August 22, and in Europe on November 27. The game features a &quot;Second Quest&quot;, accessible either upon completing the game, or by registering one&#x27;s name as &quot;ZELDA&quot; when starting a new quest. The &quot;Second Quest&quot; features different dungeons and item placement, and more difficult enemies. A modified version of the original Famicom game, &quot;BS Zelda no Densetsu&quot;, was released for the Super Famicom&#x27;s satellite-based expansion, Satellaview, in August 1995, in Japan. A second Satellaview game, &quot;BS Zelda no Densetsu MAP2&quot; was released for the Satellaview in December the same year. Both games featured rearranged dungeons, an altered overworld, and new voice-acted plot-lines.
The second game, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, was released for the Famicom Disk System in Japan in January 1987, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe in September and North America in December 1988. The game exchanged the top-down perspective for side-scrolling (though the top-down point of view was retained for overworld areas), and introduced RPG elements (such as experience points) not used previously or thereafter in the series. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Zelda II&quot; were released in gold-colored cartridges instead of the console&#x27;s regular grey cartridges. Both were re-released in the final years of the Nintendo Entertainment System with grey cartridges.
Four years later, &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; returned to the top-down view (under a 3/4 perspective), and added the concept of an alternate dimension, the Dark World. The game was released for the Super NES in November 1991. A downloadable version of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; and an exclusive modified version called &quot;BS Zelda no Densetsu Inishie no Sekiban&quot; were released on the Satellaview in Japan in March 1997. &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. The SNES version was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in January 2007, on the Wii U Virtual Console, and on Nintendo Switch Online.
Three &quot;Zelda&quot;-themed LCD games were created between 1989 and 1992. The &quot;Zelda&quot; version of Nintendo&#x27;s Game &amp; Watch series was released first in August 1989 as a dual-screen handheld electronic game similar in appearance to today&#x27;s Nintendo DS. It was re-released in 1998 as a Toymax, Inc. Mini Classic and was later included as an unlockable extra in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot;, a 2002 compilation for the Game Boy Advance. While the Game &amp; Watch &quot;Zelda&quot; was developed in-house by Nintendo, the subsequent two LCD games were developed by third parties under license by Nintendo. In October 1989, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was developed by Nelsonic as part of its Game Watch line. This game was an actual digital watch with primitive gameplay based on the original &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot;. In 1992, Epoch Co. developed &quot;Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce&quot; for its Barcode Battler II console. The game employed card-scanning technology similar to the later-released Nintendo e-Reader.
The next game, &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, for Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy, is the first &quot;Zelda&quot; for a handheld, and the first set outside Hyrule and to exclude Princess Zelda. &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; was re-released, in full color, as a launch game for the Game Boy Color in 1998 as &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening DX&quot;. This remaster features additions such as an extra color-based dungeon and a photo shop that allows interaction with the Game Boy Printer. &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening DX&quot; was released on the 3DS&#x27; Virtual Console in June 2011. An HD remake of &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.
Three video games were developed and released on CD-i in the early 1990s as a product of a compromise between Philips and Nintendo, after the companies failed to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Created independently with no observation by or influence from Nintendo, the games are , and later, &quot;Zelda&#x27;s Adventure&quot;. Nintendo never acknowledged them in the &quot;Zelda&quot; timeline, and they are considered to be in a separate, self-contained canon. These games are widely acknowledged to be the worst installments in the series, though have since gained a cult following in the form of internet memes.

=== 1998–2001: Transition to 3D ===

After five years without a new game, the series made the transition to 3D with &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for the Nintendo 64, which was released in November 1998. This game, initially known as &quot;Zelda 64&quot;, retains the core gameplay of the previous 2D games, and was very successful commercially and critically, considered by many critics and gamers to be the best video game of all time, and ranking highly on IGN and EGM&#x27;s &quot;greatest games of all time&quot; lists, as well as scoring perfect scores in several video game publications. In February 2006, it was ranked by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; as the best game released for a Nintendo console. The game was originally developed for the poorly selling, Japanese-only 64DD, but was converted to cartridge format when the 64DD hardware was delayed. A new gameplay mechanic, lock-on targeting, is used in the game, which focuses the camera on a nearby target and alters the player&#x27;s actions relative to that target. Such mechanics allow precise sword fighting in a 3D space. The game heavily uses context-sensitive button play, which enabled the player to control various actions with Link using only one button on the Nintendo 64&#x27;s controller. Each action was handled slightly differently but all used the &#x27;A&#x27; button to perform. For instance, standing next to a block and pressing &#x27;A&#x27; made Link grab it (enabling him to push/pull it), but moving forwards into a block and pressing &#x27;A&#x27; allowed Link to climb the block. The game featured the first appearance of Link&#x27;s horse, Epona, allowing Link to travel quickly across land and fire arrows from horseback. Those who preordered the game received a gold-colored cartridge in a limited edition box with a golden plastic card affixed, reading &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. In some stores that had this &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; quickly sell out, a small and rare Zelda pin was given instead. It is the sword and shield emblem with &quot;Zelda&quot; written on it. Very few of them are known to remain. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was re-released on the GameCube in 2002, when it was offered as a pre-order incentive for &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; in the U.S., Canada and Japan. It includes the cancelled 64DD expansion for &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; known as &quot;Ura Zelda&quot; during development. Named &quot;Ocarina of Time Master Quest&quot;, the game was given reorganized dungeon layouts for greater difficulty. Europe continued to receive this &quot;Two-Game Bonus Disc&quot; free in every copy of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, except for the discounted Player&#x27;s Choice version. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was available through the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service. Nintendo re-released it for the Wii U Virtual Console in July 2015. &quot;Ocarina of Time 3D&quot; for the 3DS, featuring remade graphics and stereoscopic 3D, was released in mid-June 2011. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; has been made available on the higher tier of Nintendo Switch Online in HD resolution.
&quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;″s follow-up, &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, was released in April 2000. It uses the same 3D game engine as the previous game, and added a time-based concept, in which Link, the protagonist, relives the events of three days as many times as needed to complete the game&#x27;s objectives. It was originally called &quot;Zelda Gaiden&quot;, a Japanese title that translates as &quot;Zelda Side story&quot;. Gameplay changed significantly; in addition to the time-limit, Link can use masks to transform into creatures with unique abilities. While &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; retains the graphical style of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, it is also a departure, particularly in its atmosphere. It features motion-blur, unlike its predecessor. The game is darker in tone, dealing with death and tragedy in a manner not previously seen in the series, and has a sense of impending doom, as a large moon slowly descends upon the land of Termina to destroy all life. All copies of &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; are gold cartridges. A limited &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; lenticular cartridge label was offered as the pre-order incentive. Copies of the game that are not collector&#x27;s editions feature a normal sticker cartridge label. &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; was available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console catalogues. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask 3D&quot; was released for 3DS in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia in February 2015. The Nintendo 64 version was added to Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022; with this, all of the 3D games in the series have been re-released in HD resolution.
&quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot; were released simultaneously for the Game Boy Color in 2001, and interact using passwords or a Game Link Cable. After one game has been completed, the player is given a password that allows the other game to be played as a sequel. They were developed by Flagship in conjunction with Nintendo, with supervision from Miyamoto. After the team experimented with porting the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; to the Game Boy Color, they decided to make an original trilogy to be called the &quot;Triforce Series&quot;. When the password system linking the three games proved too troublesome, the concept was reduced to two games at Miyamoto&#x27;s suggestion. These two games became &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;, which is more puzzle-based, and &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot;, which is more action-oriented. Both titles were later released on the 3DS Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online.

=== 2002–2005: Introduction of Toon Link and multiplayer ===

The Game Boy Advance release of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; in 2002 featured a new game, &quot;Four Swords&quot;, the first multiplayer &quot;Zelda&quot;. This game introduced Toon Link, a name first used in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; to refer to cartoon-based visual designs of Link. &quot;Four Swords Anniversary Edition&quot; was released in September 2011, as free DSiWare available until February 20, 2012.


When Nintendo revealed the GameCube on August 24, 2000, the day before Nintendo&#x27;s Space World 2000 exposition, a software demonstration showed a realistically styled real-time duel between Ganondorf and Link. Fans and the media speculated that the battle might be from a &quot;Zelda&quot; game in development at the time. At Space World 2001, Nintendo showed a cel-shaded &quot;Zelda&quot; game, later released as &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; in December 2002. Due to poor reception, nothing further was shown until a playable demonstration was ready. Miyamoto felt &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; would &quot;extend &quot;Zelda&quot;″s reach to all ages&quot;. The gameplay centers on controlling wind with a baton called the &quot;Wind Waker&quot; and sailing a small boat around an island-filled ocean, retaining similar gameplay mechanics as the previous 3D games in the series. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, released for the GameCube in 2003, included the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Zelda II&quot;, &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, and a demo of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD&quot; was released for Wii U in 2013.
&quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot; was released for the GameCube in early 2004 in Japan and America, and January 2005 in Europe. Based on the handheld &quot;Four Swords&quot;, &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot; was another deviation from previous &quot;Zelda&quot; gameplay, focusing on level-based and multiplayer gameplay. The game contains 24 levels and a map screen; there is no connecting overworld. For multiplayer features, each player must use a Game Boy Advance system linked to the GameCube via a Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. The game features a single-player campaign, in which using a Game Boy Advance is optional. &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot; includes two gameplay modes: &quot;Hyrulean Adventure&quot;, with a plot and gameplay similar to other &quot;Zelda&quot; games, and &quot;Shadow Battle&quot;, in which multiple Links, played by multiple players, battle each other. The Japanese and Korean versions include an exclusive third segment, &quot;Navi Trackers&quot; (originally designed as the stand-alone game &quot;Tetra&#x27;s Trackers&quot;), which contains spoken dialogue for most of the characters, unlike other games in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series.
In November 2004 in Japan and Europe, and January 2005 in America, Nintendo released &quot;The Minish Cap&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. In &quot;The Minish Cap&quot; Link can shrink in size using a mystical, sentient hat named Ezlo. While shrunk, he can see previously explored parts of a dungeon from a different perspective, and enter areas through otherwise-impassable openings. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.

=== 2006–2011: Motion and touch-based swordplay ===

In November 2006, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; was released as the first &quot;Zelda&quot; game on the Wii, and later in December as the last Nintendo-published game for the GameCube, the console for which it was originally developed. The Wii version features motion controls and a reversed world where everything that is in the west on the GameCube is in the east on the Wii. The display is mirrored in order to make Link right-handed to make use of the Wii Remote feel more natural for the majority of players. The game chronicles the struggle of a young adult Link to confront the troubles of the &quot;Twilight Realm&quot;, a mysterious force that appears around and interacts with Hyrule. When he enters this realm, he is transformed into a wolf, and loses the ability to use his sword, shield or other items, but gains other abilities such as sharpened senses from his new form. &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; includes an incarnation of Link&#x27;s horse, Epona, for fast transportation, and features mounted battle scenarios including boss battles that were not seen in previous games. &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; diverted from the cel-shading of &quot;Wind Waker&quot;, integrating graphics featuring more detailed textures, giving the game a darker atmosphere. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD&quot; released for Wii U in 2016.
At 2006 Game Developers Conference, a new title &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; for the Nintendo DS was shown. It revealed traditional top-down &quot;Zelda&quot; gameplay optimised for the DS&#x27;s features, with a cel-shaded 3D graphical style similar to &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; for Gamecube. The game is a direct sequel to &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;. &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; was released in June 2007, for Japan and October for North America and Europe. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.
The next &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; game for the DS, &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot;, was released in December 2009. In this game, the &quot;spirit tracks&quot;, railroads which chain an ancient evil, are disappearing from Hyrule. Zelda and Link go to the &#x27;Spirit Tower&#x27; (the ethereal point of convergence for the tracks) to find out why, but villains steal Zelda&#x27;s body for the resurrection of the Demon King. Rendered disembodied, Zelda is left a spirit, and only Link (and a certain few sages) can see her. Together they go on a quest to restore the spirit tracks, defeat the Demon King, and return Zelda to her body. Using a modified engine of that used in &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, the notably new feature in this game is that the Phantom Guardians seen in &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; are, through a series of events, periodically controllable. It was the first time in the series that both Link and Zelda work together on the quest. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.
A new &quot;Zelda&quot; game for Wii was in development since the end of 2000s. The new title was revealed at E3 2010 as &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, but its release was delayed to 2011. The game, the earliest in the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; timeline, reveals the origins of Hyrule, Ganon (here known as Demise), and many elements featured in previous games; it uses Wii&#x27;s MotionPlus feature as well. It was released in November 2011; the first run included a 25th Anniversary CD of fully orchestrated music from various Zelda games, including &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;. It was made available for download on Wii U in September 2016. &quot;An HD remaster&quot;, with optional button-only controls, was released for Nintendo Switch in 2021.

=== 2013–present: Open-world emphasis ===

In 2013, Nintendo released &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, a sequel to &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. Progression is more open-ended than previous titles, with the possibility of completing many of the game&#x27;s dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles require the use of rented or purchased items.
&quot;Tri Force Heroes&quot;, a cooperative multiplayer game, was released for the 3DS in October 2015.


While Nintendo had showcased a Wii U demo reel at E3 2011 that depicted Link fighting a monster in HD and the first original HD &quot;Zelda&quot; game was scheduled for a 2015 release, it was delayed. The title was finally revealed at E3 2016 as &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, and the game was released in March 2017, as the last Nintendo-published game for the Wii U and a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. Similar to the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, players are given little instruction and can explore the world freely. The world is designed to encourage exploration and experimentation and the main story quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.
A &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; sequel, &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, was released on the Switch in May 2023. New to &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; are the battery-powered Zonai devices, which the player can use for combat, propulsion, exploration, and more. The game also features the new abilities to fuse materials together, ascend through ceilings, reverse objects&#x27; movement through time, and autobuild structures.
&quot;Echoes of Wisdom&quot;, which features Zelda as the main protagonist, was released in September 2024.

== Other games ==
=== Cancelled games ===
Throughout the lifespan of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, a number of games (including main series games as well as re-releases and spin-offs) in varying states of completeness have had their releases cancelled. Perhaps the earliest of these was Gottlieb&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda Pinball Machine&quot; (cancelled in 1993). After securing a license from Nintendo to produce two Nintendo-franchise-based pinball machines, pinball designer Jon Norris was tasked with designing the table. Before it was completed, Gottlieb decided to repurpose the game with an &quot;American Gladiators&quot; theme. Licensing for this version ultimately fell through and the game was released as simply &quot;Gladiators&quot; in November 1993.

In 1998, Nintendo cancelled &quot;Ura Zelda&quot;, the &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; expansion disk for the 64DD due to poor sales figures for the 64DD peripheral. In 2002, Nintendo released a GameCube bonus disc called &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest&quot;. It contains emulated versions of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;Ocarina of Time Master Quest&quot;, which Aonuma and Miyamoto each confirmed is &quot;Ura Zelda&quot;.

In 2001, under license from Nintendo, Capcom cancelled the release of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Courage&quot; for Game Boy Color. Working with Capcom&#x27;s subsidiary Flagship, Yoshiki Okamoto was originally tasked with designing a series of three &quot;Zelda&quot; games for the Game Boy Color. Referred to as the &quot;Triforce Series&quot;, the games were known as &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Mysterious Acorn: Chapter of Power&quot;, &quot;Chapter of Wisdom&quot;, and &quot;Chapter of Courage&quot; in Japan and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Power&quot;, &quot;Mystical Seed of Wisdom&quot;, and &quot;Mystical Seed of Courage&quot; in the US. The games were to interact using a password system, but the limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team scaled back to two games at Miyamoto&#x27;s suggestion. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons&quot; was adapted from &quot;Mystical Seed of Power&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages&quot; was adapted from &quot;Mystical Seed of Wisdom&quot;, and &quot;Mystical Seed of Courage&quot; was cancelled.

Before its 2006 release, both Link and Samus from the &quot;Metroid&quot; series were planned to be playable characters for the Wii version of &quot;&quot;, but they did not make the final release because they were not Marvel characters.

In 2011, an unnamed &quot;Zelda&quot; 25th Anniversary Compilation was cancelled. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series, Nintendo of America originally had planned to release a compilation of games together for the Wii, similar to the collector&#x27;s edition disc released for the GameCube in 2003. Nintendo of Japan&#x27;s president Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto decided against releasing it, believing it would be too similar to the &quot;Super Mario&quot; 25th Anniversary collection released in 2010.

Retro Studios had two &quot;Zelda&quot; games in development. One was an untitled game starring a Sheikah in a story that explores the origins of the Master Sword. Another one was titled &quot;Heroes of Hyrule&quot; and it starred Goron, Zora, and Rito who set out to rescue Link.

=== Spin-off games ===
As the franchise has grown in popularity, several games have been released that are set within or star a minor character from the universe of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; but are not directly connected to the main &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. Both map versions of the game &quot;BS Zelda no Densetsu&quot; for the Satellaview (released in August and December 1995) could be considered spin-offs due to the fact that they star the &quot;Hero of Light&quot; (portrayed by either the Satellaview&#x27;s male or female avatar) as opposed to Link as the protagonist of Hyrule. A third Satellaview game released in March 1997, &quot;BS Zelda no Densetsu Inishie no Sekiban&quot; (&quot;BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets&quot;) could also be considered a spin-off for the same reason. Other spin-off games include &quot;Freshly-Picked Tingle&#x27;s Rosy Rupeeland&quot; for the Nintendo DS, an RPG released in September 2006 in Japan (Summer of 2007 in the UK) to star supporting character Tingle. A second Tingle game is &quot;Tingle&#x27;s Balloon Fight DS&quot; for the Nintendo DS. Here Tingle again stars in this spin-off arcade style platformer, released in April 2007 only in Japan and available solely to Platinum Club Nintendo members.

In addition to games in which Link does not star as the protagonist, games such as the shooter game, &quot;Link&#x27;s Crossbow Training&quot; (for the Wii), have been considered spin-offs due to the lack of a traditional &quot;Save Hyrule&quot; plot-line. Released in November 2007 as a bundle with the Wii Zapper, this game allows players to assume the identity of Link as he progresses through a series of tests to perfect his crossbow marksmanship. &quot;Color Changing Tingle&#x27;s Love Balloon Trip&quot; was released in Japan in 2009 as a sequel to &quot;Freshly-Picked Tingle&#x27;s Rosy Rupeeland&quot;.

&quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;, a crossover game combining the setting of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series and the gameplay of Tecmo Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series, was released in North America in September 2014 for Wii U. &quot;Hyrule Warriors Legends&quot;, a version for the Nintendo 3DS containing more content and gameplay modifications, was released in March 2016.

To commemorate the launch of the My Nintendo loyalty program in March 2016, Nintendo released &quot;My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;, a Picross puzzle game developed by Jupiter for download to the Nintendo 3DS.

&quot;Cadence of Hyrule&quot;, developed by Brace Yourself Games and released in June 2019, is an officially licensed crossover of &quot;Zelda&quot; with &quot;Crypt of the NecroDancer&quot;.

&quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;, developed by Koei Tecmo, shares the hack-and-slash style of the spin-off game &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;. &quot;Age of Calamity&quot; was released in November 2020.

A new Zelda-themed variant of &quot;Vermin&quot; was included on the limited edition &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot;: &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; unit, released in 2021. This special edition of the Game &amp; Watch also included &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot;, and &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series has received outstanding levels of acclaim from critics and the public. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; have each received a perfect 10/10 score by British &quot;Edge&quot; magazine. All four plus &quot;Wind Waker&quot; also received a 40/40 score (10/10 by four reviewers) by Japanese &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine, making &quot;Zelda&quot; one of the few series with multiple perfect scores. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was even listed by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the highest-rated video game in history, citing its Metacritic score of 99 out of 100. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; awarded &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; a score of 10/10. &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; has won Gold Award from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. In &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 countdown in 2004, &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; took first place, and seven other &quot;Zelda&quot; games placed in the top 40. &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; was named Game of the Year by &quot;X-Play&quot;, &quot;GameTrailers&quot;, &quot;1UP&quot;, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;Spacey Awards&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;GameSpy&quot;, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, and many other websites. The editors of review aggregator websites GameRankings, IGN and Metacritic have all given &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; their highest aggregate scores. &quot;Game Informer&quot; has awarded &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; and &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; with scores of 10/10. &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; was named DS Game of the Year by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot;. Airing in December 2011, Spike TV&#x27;s annual Video Game Awards gave the series the first ever &quot;Hall of Fame Award&quot;, which Miyamoto accepted in person. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and its use of melodic themes to identify different game regions has been called a reverse of Richard Wagner&#x27;s use of leitmotifs to identify characters and themes. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was so well received that sales increased for real ocarinas. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the music of &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; for its brilliance despite its heavy use of MIDI. It has been ranked the seventh-greatest game by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, whereas &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was ranked eighth. The series won &quot;GameFAQs Best Series Ever&quot; competition.

As of December 2024, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; franchise has sold over 158.27 million copies, with the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; being the fourth best-selling NES game of all time. The series was ranked as the 64th top game (collectively) by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996. In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the &quot;Zelda&quot; series as number 1 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;Zelda&quot; series had always more gameplay and innovations than most other titles in their series. According to British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot;, with &quot;the most vividly-realised world and the most varied game-play of any game on any console, &quot;Zelda&quot; is a solid bet for the best game series ever&quot;.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; franchise has garnered the most Game of the Year nominations in the history of the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; D.I.C.E. Awards with eight (&quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;); two of them, &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, would go on to win the top honor during their respective awards ceremonies.

== Legacy ==
Multiple members of the game industry have expressed how Zelda games have impacted them, including Rockstar Games founder and &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; director, Dan Houser, who said that &quot;Zelda&quot; and &quot;Mario&quot; games on Nintendo 64 greatly influenced them in developing &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, as well in other 3D games in general. Rockstar founder and &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; director Sam Houser also cited the influence of &quot;Zelda&quot;, describing &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; as &quot;Zelda meets Goodfellas&quot;. &quot;Ōkami&quot; director Hideki Kamiya (Capcom, PlatinumGames) said that he has been influenced by &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series in developing the game, citing &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; as his favorite game of all time. &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Uncharted&quot; director, Amy Hennig (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), cited &quot;Zelda&quot; as inspiration for the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; series, noting &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;″s influence on &quot;Blood Omen&quot; and &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;″s influence on &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;. &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Uncharted&quot; creator, Richard Lemarchand (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), also cited &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;″s approach to combining gameplay with storytelling as inspiration for &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;. &quot;Wing Commander&quot; and &quot;Star Citizen&quot; director, Chris Roberts (Origin Systems and Cloud Imperium Games), cited &quot;Zelda&quot; as an influence on his action role-playing game, &quot;Times of Lore&quot;.

&quot;Dark Souls&quot; series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki named &quot;A Link To The Past&quot; as one of his favorite role-playing video games. Miyazaki also described &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; as a sort of textbook for 3D action games. &quot;Ico&quot; director Fumito Ueda cited &quot;Zelda&quot; as an influence on &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;. Peter Molyneux (Lionhead Studios and Microsoft Studios) stated that the &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; is one of his favorite games and an influence for the &quot;Fable&quot; series. &quot;Darksiders&quot; director David Adams (Vigil Games) cited &quot;Zelda&quot; as an influence on his work. &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; director Raphael Lacoste cited &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; as an influence on &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot;. CD Projekt Red cited the &quot;Zelda&quot; series as an influence on &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;. &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; served as the primary influence on Alex Hall&#x27;s web series &quot;Ben Drowned&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;The 3rd Birthday&quot; director Hajime Tabata cited &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; as inspiration for the open world of &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;.

=== Cross-overs ===
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series has crossed over into other Nintendo and third-party video games, most prominently in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of fighting games published by Nintendo. Link appears as a fighter in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; for the Nintendo 64, the first entry in the series, and is part of the roster in all subsequent releases in the series as well. Zelda (who is able to transform into Sheik as well), Ganondorf, and Young Link (the child version of Link from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;) were added to the player roster for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, and appeared in all subsequent releases except for &quot;Young Link&quot; (who is later replaced by &quot;Toon Link&quot; from &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, in subsequent releases &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;). Both Young Link and Toon Link appear in the fifth installment, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Other elements from the series, such as locations and items, are also included throughout the &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; series. Outside of the series, Nintendo allowed for the use of Link as a playable character exclusively in the GameCube release of Namco&#x27;s fighting game &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;.

* Link, using a design based on &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, appears as a playable character in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; via downloadable content (DLC), along with a &quot;Hyrule Circuit&quot; racetrack themed on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series. The first pack is named after the series. In a post-launch update for &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, Link and his vehicle received alternate styles based on &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;.
* In the Wii U version of &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot;, a DLC stage based on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series was released in March 2014, named &quot;The Legend of Zelda Zone&quot;. It was built around the core gameplay mechanics of &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot;, with some elements from the &quot;Zelda&quot; series, including a heart-based vitality meter, rupee collection, and a miniature dungeon to explore.

=== In other media ===
==== TV series ====

A 13-episode American animated TV series, adapted by DiC and distributed by Viacom Enterprises, aired in 1989. The animated &quot;Zelda&quot; shorts were broadcast each Friday, instead of the usual &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; cartoon which was aired during the rest of the week. The series loosely follows the two NES &quot;Zelda&quot; games (the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot;), mixing settings and characters from those games with original creations. The show&#x27;s older incarnations of both Link and Zelda appeared in various episodes of &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; during its second season.

A live-action television series had been in development around 2015, as reported from an anonymous Netflix employee to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The program was a joint effort between Netflix and Nintendo, and was said to be aimed as a family-friendly version of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Further details of this series went sparse until 2021 when Adam Conover gave an interview regarding his &quot;College Humor&quot; period. There, the &quot;College Humor&quot; team had been planning a skit that would have combined &quot;Star Fox&quot; with &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; and had even had talked to Miyamoto on the project. Conover said that they were told about a month into the project that Nintendo had requested they stop all work on the project as a result of the leak related to the live-action &quot;Zelda&quot; show; Nintendo, already protective of its IP, had pulled many external projects including the live-action show.

==== Print media ====
Valiant Comics released a short series of comics featuring characters and settings from the &quot;Zelda&quot; cartoon as part of their &quot;Nintendo Comics System&quot; line. Manga adaptations of many entries in the series, including &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;, &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, &quot;The Minish Cap&quot;, &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, and &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; have been produced under license from Nintendo, primarily written and drawn by Japanese artist duo Akira Himekawa. These adaptations do not strictly follow the plot of the games from which they are based and may contain additional story elements.

A number of official books, novels, and gamebooks have been released based on the series as well. The earliest was &quot;Moblin&#x27;s Magic Spear&quot;, published in 1989 by Western Publishing under their Golden Books Family Entertainment division and written by Jack C. Harris. It took place sometime during the first game. Two gamebooks were published as part of the &quot;Nintendo Adventure Books&quot; series by Archway, both of which were written by Matt Wayne. The first was &quot;The Crystal Trap&quot; (which focuses more on Zelda) and the second was &quot;The Shadow Prince&quot;. Both were released in 1992. A novel based on &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was released in 1999, written by Jason R. Rich and published by Sybex Inc. under their &quot;Pathways to Adventure&quot; series. Another two gamebooks were released as part of the &quot;You Decide on the Adventure&quot; series published by Scholastic. The first book was based on &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot; and was released in 2001. The second, based on &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;, was released in 2002. Both were written by Craig Wessel. In 2006, Scholastic released a novel as part of their &quot;Nintendo Heroes&quot; series, &quot;Link and the Portal of Doom&quot;. It was written by Tracey West and was set shortly after the events of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;.

In 2011, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the series, an art book was published exclusively in Japan under the name &quot;Hyrule Historia&quot; by Shogakukan. It contains concept art from the series&#x27;s conception to the release of &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; in 2011 and multiple essays about the production of the games, as well as an overarching timeline of the series. It also includes a prequel manga to &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; by Akira Himekawa. The book received an international release by publisher Dark Horse Comics in January 2013; it took the number one spot on Amazon&#x27;s sales chart, taking the spot away from E. L. James&#x27;s &quot;50 Shades of Grey&quot; trilogy. Dark Horse released &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Art &amp; Artifacts&quot;, a follow-up art book to &quot;Hyrule Historia&quot; containing additional artwork and interviews, in North America and Europe in February 2017.

==== Music ====
Taking place in Cologne, Germany, on September 23, 2010, the video game music concert &quot;Symphonic Legends&quot; focused on music from Nintendo and, among others, featured games such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Following an intermission, the second half of the concert was entirely dedicated to an expansive symphonic poem dedicated to the series. The 35-minute epic tells the story of Link&#x27;s evolution from child to hero.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series in 2011, Nintendo commissioned an original symphony, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses&quot;. The show was originally performed in the fall of 2011 in Los Angeles and consists of live performances of much of the music from the series. It has since been scheduled for 18 shows so far throughout the United States and Canada. Nintendo released a CD, &quot;The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Special Orchestra CD&quot;. Featuring eight tracks from live performances of the symphony, the CD is included alongside the special edition of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot; for the Wii. Nintendo later celebrated &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; 30th anniversary with an album which was released in Japan in February 2017.

==== Merchandise ====
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;-themed &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game was released in the United States in September 2014. A &quot;Clue&quot; board game in the style of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series was released in June 2017. A &quot;UNO&quot;-styled &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; game was released in February 2018, exclusively at GameStop in North America. A limited edition &quot;Zelda&quot; 25th anniversary 3DS was released in December 2011, in Australia.

==== Film ====
In 2007, Imagi Animation Studios, which had provided the animation for &quot;TMNT&quot; and &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, created a pitch reel for a computer-animated &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; film. Nintendo did not accept the studio&#x27;s offer due to the memory of the failure of the 1993 live-action film adaptation of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; In 2013, Aonuma said that, if the development of a film began, the company would want to use the opportunity to embrace audience interaction in some capacity. In June 2023, it was said that Nintendo was close to closing a deal with Illumination and Universal Pictures to produce a film adaptation of the franchise following the success of their film, &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;, but Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri denied these reports later that month.

By November 2023, Nintendo was developing a live-action &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; film with Sony Pictures, which will co-finance and distribute the project worldwide. Wes Ball has been attached to direct the film, and Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad will be producing alongside Ball and his producing partner Joe Hartwick Jr. through their Oddball Entertainment company. Although the casting had not been announced, Patricia Summersett, who had previously done voice work for Princess Zelda, said that she would like to reprise her role for the character. Hunter Schafer has also expressed interest in playing Zelda.

<doc id="30038" wikidata="Q184366" url="?curid=30038" title="Thomas Henry Huxley">
<text>Thomas Henry Huxley (4 May 1825 – 29 June 1895) was an English biologist and anthropologist who specialized in comparative anatomy. He has become known as &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Bulldog&quot; for his advocacy of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution.

The stories regarding Huxley&#x27;s famous 1860 Oxford evolution debate with Samuel Wilberforce were a key moment in the wider acceptance of evolution and in his own career, although some historians think that the surviving story of the debate is a later fabrication. Huxley had been planning to leave Oxford on the previous day, but, after an encounter with Robert Chambers, the author of &quot;Vestiges&quot;, he changed his mind and decided to join the debate. Wilberforce was coached by Richard Owen, against whom Huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes.

Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin&#x27;s ideas, such as gradualism, and was undecided about natural selection, but despite this, he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. Instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain, he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition. Huxley coined the term &quot;agnosticism&quot; in 1869 and elaborated on it in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not.

Huxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self-taught. He became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the later 19th century. He worked on invertebrates, clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on vertebrates, especially on the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; with &quot;Compsognathus&quot;, he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, a view now held by modern biologists.

The tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution, and by his extensive public work on scientific education, both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere. Huxley&#x27;s 1893 Romanes Lecture, &quot;Evolution and Ethics&quot;, is exceedingly influential in China; the Chinese translation of Huxley&#x27;s lecture even transformed the Chinese translation of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;.

== Early life ==
Thomas Henry Huxley was born in Ealing, then a village in Middlesex. He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers. His parents were members of the Church of England, but he sympathized with nonconformists. Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as Alfred Russel Wallace, Huxley was brought up in a literate middle-class family which had fallen on hard times. His father was a mathematics teacher at Great Ealing School until it closed, putting the family into financial difficulties. As a result, Thomas left school at the age of 10, after only two years of formal schooling.

Despite this lack of formal schooling, Huxley was determined to educate himself. He became one of the great autodidacts of the nineteenth century. At first he read Thomas Carlyle, James Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Geology&quot;, and Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot;. In his teens, he taught himself German, eventually becoming fluent and used by Charles Darwin as a translator of scientific material in German. He learned Latin, and enough Greek to read Aristotle in the original.

Later on, as a young adult, he made himself an expert, first teaching himself about invertebrates, and later on vertebrates. He did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates. In his later debates and writing on science and religion, his grasp of theology was better than many of his clerical opponents.

He was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his brother-in-law John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments using mesmerism for medical purposes. Chandler&#x27;s practice was in London&#x27;s Rotherhithe amidst the squalor endured by the Dickensian poor. Afterward, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister&#x27;s husband. Now aged 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind University College Hospital), a cut-price anatomy school. All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading, which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling.

A year later, buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the Apothecaries&#x27; yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital, where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones, Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at University College London. Jones had been Robert Knox&#x27;s assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare. The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. In 1845, under Wharton Jones&#x27; guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley&#x27;s layer. Later in life, Huxley organised a pension for his old mentor.

At twenty he passed his First M.B. examination at the University of London, winning the gold medal for anatomy and physiology. However, he did not present himself for the final (Second M.B.) exams and consequently did not qualify for a university degree. His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy.

== Voyage of the &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; ==
Aged 20, Huxley was too young to apply to the Royal College of Surgeons for a licence to practise, yet he was &quot;deep in debt&quot;. So, at a friend&#x27;s suggestion, he applied for an appointment in the Royal Navy. He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy. William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a &quot;viva voce&quot;).

Finally, Huxley was made Assistant Surgeon (&#x27;surgeon&#x27;s mate&#x27;, but in practice marine naturalist) to HMS &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;, about to set sail on a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia. The &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; left England on 3 December 1846 and, once it arrived in the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates. He began to send details of his discoveries back to England, where publication was arranged by Edward Forbes FRS (who had also been a pupil of Knox). Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley.

Huxley&#x27;s paper &quot;On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae&quot; was published in 1849 by the Royal Society in its &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of &quot;Hydrozoa&quot;. The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers, enclosing a central cavity or stomach. This is characteristic of the phylum now called the &quot;Cnidaria&quot;. He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals. When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates, Huxley was able to summarise this work in &quot;The Oceanic Hydrozoa&quot;, published by the Ray Society in 1859.

The value of Huxley&#x27;s work was recognised and, on returning to England in 1850, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, at the age of twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council. He met Joseph Dalton Hooker and John Tyndall, who remained his lifelong friends. The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;. He solved the problem of &quot;Appendicularia&quot;, whose place in the animal kingdom Johannes Peter Müller had found himself wholly unable to assign. It and the Ascidians are both, as Huxley showed, tunicates, today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum &quot;Chordata&quot;. Other papers on the morphology of the cephalopods and on brachiopods and rotifers are also noteworthy.

Following a lecture at the Royal Institution on 30 April 1852 Huxley indicated that it remained difficult to earn a living as a scientist alone. This was demonstrated in a letter written on 3 May 1852, where he states &quot;Science in England does everything—but PAY. You may earn praise but not pudding&quot;. However, Huxley effectively resigned from the navy by refusing to return to active service, and in July 1854 he became professor of natural history at the Royal School of Mines and naturalist to the British Geological Survey in the following year. In addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution 1855–1858 and 1865–1867; Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons 1863–1869; president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1869–1870; president of the Quekett Microscopical Club 1878; president of the Royal Society 1883–1885; Inspector of Fisheries 1881–1885; and president of the Marine Biological Association 1884–1890. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1869.

The thirty-one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life. Huxley retired in 1885, after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884. He resigned the presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six months&#x27; leave. His pension was £1200 a year.
Huxley&#x27;s London home, in which he wrote many of his works, was at 4 Marlborough Place, St John&#x27;s Wood. The house was extended in the early 1870s to include a large drawing and dining room at which he held informal Sunday gatherings.

In 1890, he moved from London to Eastbourne, where he had purchased land in the Staveley Road upon which a house was built, &#x27;Hodeslea&#x27;, under the supervision of his son-in-law F. Waller. Here Huxley edited the nine volumes of his &quot;Collected Essays&quot;. In 1894 he heard of Eugene Dubois&#x27; discovery in Java of the remains of &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; (now known as &quot;Homo erectus&quot;).

He died of a heart attack (after contracting influenza and pneumonia) in 1895 in Eastbourne, and was buried in London at East Finchley Cemetery. No invitations were sent out but two hundred people turned up for the funeral; they included Joseph Dalton Hooker, William Henry Flower, Mulford B. Foster, Edwin Lankester, Joseph Lister, and apparently Henry James. The family plot had been purchased upon the death of his eldest son Noel, who died of scarlet fever in 1860; Huxley&#x27;s wife Henrietta Anne and son Noel are also buried there.
===Family===
Huxley and his wife had five daughters and three sons:

* Noel Huxley (1856–1860), died aged 3.
* Jessie Oriana Huxley (1856–1927), married architect Fred Waller in 1877.
* Marian Huxley (1859–1887), married artist John Collier in 1879.
* Leonard Huxley (1860–1933), married Julia Arnold.
* Rachel Huxley (1862–1934), married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884.
* Henrietta (Nettie) Huxley (1863–1940), married Harold Roller, travelled Europe as a singer.
* Henry Huxley (1865–1946), became a fashionable general practitioner in London.
* Ethel Huxley (1866–1941) married artist John Collier (widower of sister) in 1889.

=== Public duties and awards ===
From 1870 onwards, Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty. He served on eight Royal Commissions, from 1862 to 1884. From 1871 to 1880 he was a Secretary of the Royal Society and from 1883 to 1885 he was president. He was president of the Geological Society from 1868 to 1870. In 1870, he was president of the British Association at Liverpool and, in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted London School Board. He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1877 to 1879. He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities.

He was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science. The Royal Society, who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the Royal Medal the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award. He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition. Then later in life he received the Copley Medal in 1888 and the Darwin Medal in 1894; the Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston Medal in 1876; the Linnean Society awarded him the Linnean Medal in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards are listed in the &quot;Life and Letters&quot;. He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of University College, Oxford.

In 1873 the King of Sweden made Huxley, Hooker and Tyndall Knights of the Order of the Polar Star: they could wear the insignia but not use the title in Britain. Huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies, academic awards and honorary doctorates from Britain and Germany. He also became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1892. In 1916, a street in the Bronx, New York was named in his honor (Huxley Avenue).

As recognition of his many public services, he was appointed Privy Councillor in 1892.

Despite his many achievements, he was given no award by the British state until late in life. In this, he did better than Darwin, who got no award of any kind from the state. (Darwin&#x27;s proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisers, including Wilberforce.) Perhaps Huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours, or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment – he had vigorous debates in print with Benjamin Disraeli, William Ewart Gladstone, and Arthur Balfour, and his relationship with Lord Salisbury was less than tranquil.

Huxley was for about thirty years evolution&#x27;s most effective advocate, and for some Huxley was &quot;&quot;the&quot; premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century [for] the whole English-speaking world&quot;.

Though he had many admirers and disciples, his retirement and later death left British zoology somewhat bereft of leadership. He had, directly or indirectly, guided the careers and appointments of the next generation. Huxley thought he was &quot;the only man who can carry out my work&quot;: The deaths of Balfour and W.K. Clifford were &quot;the greatest losses to science in our time&quot;.

=== Vertebrate palaeontology ===

The first half of Huxley&#x27;s career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for &#x27;persistent types&#x27;, in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the Palaeozoic era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct.

Much paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea. Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin&#x27;s more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.

Huxley&#x27;s detailed anatomical work was, as always, first-rate and productive. His work on fossil fish shows his distinctive approach: Whereas pre-Darwinian naturalists collected, identified, and classified, Huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups.

The lobe-finned fish (such as coelacanths and lungfish) have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone, the humerus or femur. His interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of tetrapods, one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology.

The study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles, which he united under the title of &quot;Sauropsida&quot;. His papers on &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are.

Apart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate and had descended from the same stock as the apes, Huxley did little work on mammals, with one exception. On his tour of America Huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses, discovered by O. C. Marsh, in Yale&#x27;s Peabody Museum. An Easterner, Marsh was America&#x27;s first professor of palaeontology, but also one who had come west into hostile Indian territory in search of fossils, hunted buffalo, and met Red Cloud (in 1874). Funded by his uncle George Peabody, Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries: the huge Cretaceous aquatic bird &quot;Hesperornis&quot;, and the dinosaur footprints along the Connecticut River were worth the trip by themselves, but the horse fossils were really special. After a week with Marsh and his fossils, Huxley wrote excitedly, &quot;The collection of fossils is the most wonderful thing I ever saw.&quot;

The collection at that time went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling &quot;Orohippus&quot; from the Eocene through three-toed species such as &quot;Miohippus&quot; to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: The ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.

The horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual, and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia. If so, then something must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when Europeans arrived. The experience with Marsh was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin&#x27;s gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.

Marsh&#x27;s and Huxley&#x27;s conclusions were initially quite different. However, Marsh carefully showed Huxley his complete sequence of fossils. As Marsh put it, Huxley &quot;then informed me that all this was new to him and that my facts demonstrated the evolution of the horse beyond question, and for the first time indicated the direct line of descent of an existing animal. With the generosity of true greatness, he gave up his own opinions in the face of new truth, and took my conclusions as the basis of his famous New York lecture on the horse.&quot;

==Support of Darwin==

Huxley was originally not persuaded by &quot;development theory&quot;, as evolution was once called. This can be seen in his savage review of Robert Chambers&#x27; &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;, a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution. Huxley had also rejected Lamarck&#x27;s theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution, which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley&#x27;s mind. It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was by all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man.

Huxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about Darwin&#x27;s ideas before they were published (the group included Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell). The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection, which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the Linnean Society in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin&#x27;s notebook and a Darwin letter to Asa Gray. Huxley&#x27;s famous response to the idea of natural selection was &quot;How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!&quot; However, he never conclusively made up his mind about whether natural selection was the main method for evolution, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis.

Logically speaking, the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin&#x27;s way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book&#x27;s publication.

Huxley&#x27;s support started with his anonymous favourable review of the &quot;Origin&quot; in the &quot;Times&quot; for 26 December 1859, and continued with articles in several periodicals, and in a lecture at the Royal Institution in February 1860. At the same time, Richard Owen, whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the &quot;Origin&quot; in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, also primed Samuel Wilberforce who wrote one in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, running to 17,000 words. The authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until Wilberforce&#x27;s son wrote his biography. So it can be said that, just as Darwin groomed Huxley, so Owen groomed Wilberforce; and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves. Though we do not know the exact words of the Oxford debate, we do know what Huxley thought of the review in the &quot;Quarterly&quot;:

Since Lord Brougham assailed Dr Young, the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as a &quot;flighty&quot; person, who endeavours &quot;to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation,&quot; and whose &quot;mode of dealing with nature&quot; is reprobated as &quot;utterly dishonourable to Natural Science.&quot;

If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; article...

Since his death, Huxley has become known as &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Bulldog&quot;, taken to refer to his pluck and courage in debate, and to his perceived role in protecting the older man. The sobriquet appears to be Huxley&#x27;s own invention, although of unknown date, and it was not current in his lifetime.

While the second half of Darwin&#x27;s life was lived mainly within his family, the younger and combative Huxley operated mainly out in the world at large. A letter from Huxley to Ernst Haeckel (2 November 1871) states: &quot;The dogs have been snapping at [Darwin&#x27;s] heels too much of late.&quot;

===Debate with Wilberforce===
Famously, Huxley responded to Wilberforce in the debate at the British Association meeting, on Saturday 30 June 1860 at the Oxford University Museum. Huxley&#x27;s presence there had been encouraged on the previous evening when he met Robert Chambers, the Scottish publisher and author of &quot;Vestiges&quot;, who was walking the streets of Oxford in a dispirited state, and begged for assistance. The debate followed the presentation of a paper by John William Draper, and was chaired by Darwin&#x27;s former botany tutor John Stevens Henslow. Darwin&#x27;s theory was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, and those supporting Darwin included Huxley and their mutual friends Hooker and Lubbock. The platform featured Brodie and Professor Beale, and Robert FitzRoy, who had been captain of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; during Darwin&#x27;s voyage, spoke against Darwin.

Wilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers&#x27; &quot;Vestiges&quot;. For the more challenging task of opposing the &quot;Origin&quot;, and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by Richard OwenOwen stayed with him the night before the debate. On the day, Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother&#x27;s side or his father&#x27;s side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley&#x27;s reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debatethe exact wording is not certainwas widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.

The letters of Alfred Newton include one to his brother giving an eyewitness account of the debate, and written less than a month afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought &quot;he&quot; had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange, though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report, differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.

One effect of the debate was to hugely increase Huxley&#x27;s visibility amongst educated people, through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals. Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate: a lesson he never forgot. A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed: on the contrary, they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority. A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science, with its implied need for scientific education. A fifth consequence was indirect: as Wilberforce had feared, a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the Old Testament, especially the Book of Genesis. Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate; they were supporters, perhaps, of the controversial &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;. Thus, both on the side of science and on that of religion, the debate was important and its outcome significant. (see also below)

That Huxley and Wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate (and able to work together on projects such as the Metropolitan Board of Education) says something about both men, whereas Huxley and Owen were never reconciled.

===Man&#x27;s place in nature===
For nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes. This led him directly into a clash with Richard Owen, a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability. The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen. Huxley&#x27;s Croonian Lecture, delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on &quot;The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull&quot; was the start. In this, he rejected Owen&#x27;s theory that the bones of the skull and the spine were homologous, an opinion previously held by Goethe and Lorenz Oken.

From 1860 to 1863 Huxley developed his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, students and the general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December. Other lectures grew into Huxley&#x27;s most famous work &quot;Evidence as to Man&#x27;s place in Nature&quot; (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before Charles Darwin published his &quot;Descent of Man&quot; in 1871.

Although Darwin did not publish his &quot;Descent of Man&quot; until 1871, the general debate on this topic had started years before (there was even a precursor debate in the 18th century between Monboddo and Buffon). Darwin had dropped a hint when, in the conclusion to the &quot;Origin&quot;, he wrote: &quot;In the distant future... light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history&quot;. Not so distant, as it turned out. A key event had already occurred in 1857 when Richard Owen presented (to the Linnean Society) his theory that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus &quot;Homo&quot;. Having reached this opinion, Owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own. No other biologist held such an extreme view. Darwin reacted &quot;Man...as distinct from a chimpanzee [as] an ape from a platypus... I cannot swallow that!&quot; Neither could Huxley, who was able to demonstrate that Owen&#x27;s idea was completely wrong.
The subject was raised at the 1860 BA Oxford meeting, when Huxley flatly contradicted Owen, and promised a later demonstration of the facts. In fact, a number of demonstrations were held in London and the provinces. In 1862 at the Cambridge meeting of the B.A. Huxley&#x27;s friend William Flower gave a public dissection to show that the same structures (the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor) were indeed present in apes. The debate was widely publicised, and parodied as the &quot;Great Hippocampus Question&quot;. It was seen as one of Owen&#x27;s greatest blunders, revealing Huxley as not only dangerous in debate but also a better anatomist.

Owen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes, but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size.

Huxley&#x27;s ideas on this topic were summed up in January 1861 in the first issue (new series) of his own journal, the &quot;Natural History Review&quot;: &quot;the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed&quot;. This paper was reprinted in 1863 as chapter 2 of &quot;Man&#x27;s Place in Nature&quot;, with an addendum giving his account of the Owen/Huxley controversy about the ape brain. In his &quot;Collected Essays&quot; this addendum was removed.

The extended argument on the ape brain, partly in debate and partly in print, backed by dissections and demonstrations, was a landmark in Huxley&#x27;s career. It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy, and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with Wilberforce. It also marked the start of Owen&#x27;s decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists.

The following was written by Huxley to Rolleston before the BA meeting in 1861:
:&quot;My dear Rolleston... The obstinate reiteration of erroneous assertions can only be nullified by as persistent an appeal to facts; and I greatly regret that my engagements do not permit me to be present at the British Association in order to assist personally at what, I believe, will be &quot;the seventh public demonstration during the past twelve months&quot; of the untruth of the three assertions, that the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and the hippocampus minor, are peculiar to man and do not exist in the apes. I shall be obliged if you will read this letter to the Section&quot; Yours faithfully, Thos. H. Huxley.

During those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology. In 1862 he examined the Neanderthal skull-cap, which had been discovered in 1857. It was the first pre-&quot;sapiens&quot; discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large. Huxley also started to dabble in physical anthropology, and classified the human races into nine categories, along with placing them under four general categorisations as Australoid, Negroid, Xanthochroic and Mongoloid. Such classifications depended mainly on physical appearance and certain anatomical characteristics.

===Natural selection===
Huxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was a difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin&#x27;s views on science were different from Huxley&#x27;s views. For Darwin, natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things were not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.

Huxley&#x27;s reservations on natural selection were of the type &quot;until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other, natural selection cannot be proved&quot;. Huxley&#x27;s position on selection was agnostic; yet he gave no credence to any other theory. Despite this concern about evidence, Huxley saw that if evolution came about through variation, reproduction and selection then other things would also be subject to the same pressures. This included ideas because they are invented, imitated and selected by humans: ‘The struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.’ This is the same idea as meme theory put forward by Richard Dawkins in 1976.

Darwin&#x27;s part in the discussion came mostly in letters, as was his wont, along the lines: &quot;The empirical evidence you call for is both impossible in practical terms, and in any event unnecessary. It&#x27;s the same as asking to see every step in the transformation (or the splitting) of one species into another. My way so many issues are clarified and problems solved; no other theory does nearly so well&quot;.

Huxley&#x27;s reservation, as Helena Cronin has so aptly remarked, was contagious: &quot;it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of Darwinism&quot;. One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent, &quot;but not the question of mechanism&quot;.

===Pallbearer===
Huxley was a pallbearer at the funeral of Charles Darwin on 26 April 1882.

==The X Club==
In November 1864, Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club, the X Club, composed of like-minded people working to advance the cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends. There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more. The members were: Huxley, John Tyndall, J. D. Hooker, John Lubbock (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), Herbert Spencer (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), William Spottiswoode (mathematician and the Queen&#x27;s Printer), Thomas Hirst (Professor of Physics at University College London), Edward Frankland (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and George Busk, zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;). All except Spencer were Fellows of the Royal Society. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter&#x27;s trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in glaciology.

There were also some quite significant X-Club satellites such as William Flower and George Rolleston, (Huxley protegés), and liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster. Guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time.

They would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel, planning what to do; high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business. It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening. The first item for the Xs was to get the Copley Medal for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle.

The next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas. This was the weekly &quot;Reader&quot;, which they bought, revamped and redirected. Huxley had already become part-owner of the &quot;Natural History Review&quot; bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites). The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861. After a stream of good articles the &quot;NHR&quot; failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution. The &quot;Reader&quot; also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science. The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley&#x27;s time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors. This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not as astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him.

However, the experience gained with the &quot;Reader&quot; was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of &quot;Nature&quot; in 1869. This time no mistakes were made: above all, there was a permanent editor (though not full-time), Norman Lockyer, who served until 1919, a year before his death. In 1925, to celebrate his centenary, &quot;Nature&quot; issued a supplement devoted to Huxley.

The peak of the X Club&#x27;s influence was from 1873 to 1885 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were Presidents of the Royal Society in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science. After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now Lord Avebury) was the last surviving member.

Huxley was also an active member of the Metaphysical Society, which ran from 1869 to 1880. It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions. Tyndall and Huxley later joined The Club (founded by Dr. Johnson) when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up.

==Educational influence==
When Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day either were self-taught or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation.

===School of Mines and Zoology===
In the early 1870s, the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington; ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London. The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching, an idea suggested by practice in German universities. In the main, the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types, and depended on the dissection of anatomy, supplemented by microscopy, museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster.

The typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9 am, followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators. Huxley&#x27;s demonstrators were picked men—all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley&#x27;s ideas as well as their own. Michael Foster became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; Ray Lankester became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875–91), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891–98) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898–1907); S.H. Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; W.T. Thiselton-Dyer became Hooker&#x27;s successor at Kew (he was already Hooker&#x27;s son-in-law!); T. Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at University College, Cardiff; and William Rutherford became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh. William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH&#x27;s assistant in many dissections, became Sir William Flower, Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum. It&#x27;s a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all. Darwin said &quot;No one fact tells so strongly against Owen... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower&quot;.

Huxley&#x27;s courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: &quot;The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism&quot;; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said &quot;Darwin&#x27;s later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices&quot;. E.W MacBride said &quot;Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist. To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes.

This largely morphological program of comparative anatomy remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink. It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution (Darwin, Wallace, Fritz Müller, Henry Bates) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley&#x27;s program. Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount. Michael Ruse finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes.

Since Darwin, Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers (and Műller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley&#x27;s program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley&#x27;s courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Adrian Desmond suggests that &quot;[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function&quot;. That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man.

Huxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy, at which he was the greatest master of the day. He was not an all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life. Huxley chose, in his teaching (and to some extent in his research) to take a more straightforward course, concentrating on his personal strengths.

===Schools and the Bible===
Huxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools: in November 1870, he was elected to the London School Board in its first elections. In primary schooling, he advocated a wide range of disciplines, similar to what is taught today: reading, writing, arithmetic, art, science, music, etc. In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper-division work, focusing on a more specific area of study. A practical example of the latter is his famous 1868 lecture &quot;On a Piece of Chalk&quot; which was first published as an essay in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in London later that year. The piece reconstructs the geological history of Britain from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as &quot;organized common sense&quot;.

Huxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions, but he believed that the Bible&#x27;s significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life. &quot;I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches&quot;. However, what Huxley proposed was to create an &quot;edited version&quot; of the Bible, shorn of &quot;shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe&quot;. The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debates took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said &quot;I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools&quot;. The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught.

It may be right to see Huxley&#x27;s life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said &quot;It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems&quot;—and Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain. Some modern Christian apologists consider Huxley the father of antitheism, though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist. He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all organised religion throughout his life, especially the &quot;Roman Church ... carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature, in the intellectual freedom, and in the political freedom of mankind&quot;. In the same line of thought, in an article in &quot;Popular Science&quot;, Huxley used the expression &quot;the so-called Christianity of Catholicism&quot;, explaining: &quot;I say &#x27;so-called&#x27; not by way of offence, but as a protest against the monstrous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;

Originally coining the term in 1869, Huxley elaborated on &quot;agnosticism&quot; in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not. Huxley statesAgnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle... the fundamental axiom of modern science... In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration... In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable. Use of that term has continued to the present day (see Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism). Much of Huxley&#x27;s agnosticism is influenced by Kantian views on human perception and the ability to rely on rational evidence rather than belief systems.

In 1893, during preparation for the second Romanes Lecture, Huxley expressed his disappointment at the shortcomings of &#x27;liberal&#x27; theology, describing its doctrines as &#x27;popular illusions&#x27;, and the teachings they replaced &#x27;faulty as they are, appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth&#x27;.

Vladimir Lenin remarked that for Huxley &quot;agnosticism serves as a fig-leaf for materialism&quot;. (See also the Debate with Wilberforce above.)

===Adult education===

Huxley&#x27;s interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public. For most of his adult life, he wrote for periodicals—the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, the &quot;Reader&quot;, the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot;. Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.

In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men&#x27;s College in Blackfriars Road. The moving spirit was a portmanteau worker, Wm. Rossiter, who did most of the work; the funds were put up mainly by F.D. Maurice&#x27;s Christian Socialists. At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire.

The technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective. A good example was &quot;The Physical Basis of Life&quot;, a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme—that vital action is nothing more than &quot;the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it&quot;—shocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said &quot;No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation&quot;. The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; &quot;Punch&quot; added &#x27;Professor Protoplasm&#x27; to his other soubriquets.

The topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells, which is indeed a sensational sight. For these audiences, Huxley&#x27;s claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking. Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do, but little of that was known in the nineteenth century.

When the Archbishop of York thought this &#x27;new philosophy&#x27; was based on Auguste Comte&#x27;s positivism, Huxley corrected him: &quot;Comte&#x27;s philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity&quot; (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays &quot;Methods &amp; Results&quot; 156). A later version was &quot;[positivism is] sheer Popery with M. Comte in the chair of St Peter, and with the names of the saints changed&quot;. (lecture on &quot;The scientific aspects of positivism&quot; Huxley 1870 &quot;Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews&quot; p. 149). Huxley&#x27;s dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte&#x27;s ideas withered in Britain.

==Huxley and the humanities==

During his life, and especially in the last ten years after retirement, Huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities.

Perhaps the best known of these topics is &quot;Evolution and Ethics&quot;, which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy. Both Huxley and his grandson Julian Huxley gave Romanes Lectures on this theme. For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority. Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, human emotions, intellect, and tendency to prefer living in groups and spending resources on raising young are part and parcel of human evolution and therefore inherited.

Despite this, the &quot;details&quot; of human values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly determined by human culture, and partly chosen on an individual basis. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the &quot;struggle for existence&quot;: &quot;Of moral purpose I see not a trace in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture.&quot; It is therefore an individual&#x27;s responsibility to make ethical choices (see Ethics and Evolutionary ethics). This seems to put Huxley as a compatibilist in the Free Will vs Determinism debate. In this argument, Huxley is diametrically opposed to his long-time friend Herbert Spencer.

Huxley&#x27;s dissection of Rousseau&#x27;s views on man and society is another example of his later work. The essay undermines Rousseau&#x27;s ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property. Characteristic is: &quot;The doctrine that all men are, in any sense, or have been, at any time, free and equal, is an utterly baseless fiction.&quot;

Huxley&#x27;s method of argumentation (his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print) is itself much studied. His career included controversial debates with scientists, clerics and politicians; persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions and other public bodies; lectures and articles for the general public, and a mass of detailed letter-writing to friends and other correspondents. A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies.

==Royal and other commissions==
Huxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions (titles somewhat shortened here). The Royal Commission is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution. A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education; three involved medicine and three involved fisheries. Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues. All deal with possible changes to law and/or administrative practice.

===Royal Commissions===
* 1862: Trawling for herrings on the coast of Scotland.
* 1863–1865: Sea fisheries of the United Kingdom.
* 1870–1871: The Contagious Diseases Acts.
* 1870–1875: Scientific instruction and the advancement of science.
* 1876: The practice of subjugating live animals to scientific experiments (vivisection).
* 1876–1878: The universities of Scotland.
* 1881–1882: The Medical Acts. [i.e. the legal framework for medicine]
* 1884: Trawl, net and beam trawl fishing.

====Other commissions====
*1866: On the Royal College of Science for Ireland.
*1868: On science and art instruction in Ireland.

== Family ==

In 1855, he married Henrietta Anne Heathorn (1825–1914), an English émigrée whom he had met in Sydney, Australia. They kept correspondence until he was able to send for her. They had five daughters and three sons:

* Noel Huxley (1856–60), died of scarlet fever.
* Jessie Oriana Huxley (1858 −1927), married architect Fred Waller in 1877.
* Marian Huxley (1859–87), married artist John Collier in 1879.
* Leonard Huxley, (1860–1933) author, father of Julian, Aldous and Andrew Huxley.
* Rachel Huxley (1862–1934) married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884; he died in 1895. They were parents of the physicist Thomas Eckersley and the first BBC Chief Engineer Peter Eckersley.
* Henrietta (Nettie) Huxley (1863–1940), married Harold Roller, and travelled Europe as a singer.
* Henry Huxley (1865–1946), became a fashionable general practitioner in London.
* Ethel Huxley (1866–1941), married her sister&#x27;s widower John Collier in 1889.

Huxley&#x27;s relationships with his relatives and children were genial by the standards of the day—so long as they lived their lives in an honourable manner, which some did not. After his mother, his eldest sister Lizzie was the most important person in his life until his own marriage. He remained on good terms with his children, more than can be said of many Victorian fathers. This excerpt from a letter to Jessie, his eldest daughter is full of affection:
*&quot;Dearest Jess, You are a badly used young person—you are; and nothing short of that conviction would get a letter out of your still worse used Pater, the bête noir of whose existence is letter-writing. Catch me discussing the Afghan question with you, you little pepper-pot! No, not if I know it...&quot; [goes on nevertheless to give strong opinions of the Afghans, at that time causing plenty of trouble to the British Raj—see Second Anglo-Afghan War] &quot;There, you plague—ever your affec. Daddy, THH.&quot; (letter 7 December 1878, Huxley L 1900)

Huxley&#x27;s descendants include children of Leonard Huxley:

* Sir Julian Huxley FRS was the first Director of UNESCO and a notable evolutionary biologist and humanist.
* Aldous Huxley was a famous author (&quot;Brave New World&quot; 1932, &quot;Eyeless in Gaza&quot; 1936, &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; 1954).
* Sir Andrew Huxley OM PRS won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. He was the second Huxley to become President of the Royal Society.

Other significant descendants of Huxley, such as Sir Crispin Tickell, are treated in the Huxley family.

===Mental problems in the family===
Biographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the Huxley family. His father became &quot;sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind&quot;, and later died in Barming Asylum; brother George suffered from &quot;extreme mental anxiety&quot; and died in 1863 leaving serious debts. Brother James, a well-known psychiatrist and Superintendent of Kent County Asylum, was at 55 &quot;as near mad as any sane man can be&quot;. His favourite daughter, the artistically talented Mady (Marian), who became the first wife of artist John Collier, was troubled by mental illness for years. She died of pneumonia in her mid-twenties.

About Huxley himself, we have a more complete record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards, he sank into a &quot;deep lethargy&quot; and, though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Bibby and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the depression. Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill.

The next episode we know of in Huxley&#x27;s life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; in 1848. Huxley had further periods of depression at the end of 1871, and again in 1873. Finally, in 1884 he sank into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of 60. This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate bipolar disorder) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times.

The problems continued sporadically into the third generation. Two of Leonard&#x27;s sons suffered serious depression: Trevennen committed suicide in 1914 and Julian suffered a breakdown in 1913, and five more later in life.

== Satires ==
Darwin&#x27;s ideas and Huxley&#x27;s controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires. It was the debate about man&#x27;s place in nature that roused such widespread comment: cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count; Darwin&#x27;s head on a monkey&#x27;s body is one of the visual clichés of the age. The &quot;Great Hippocampus Question&quot; attracted particular attention:

* &quot;Monkeyana&quot; signed &#x27;Gorilla&#x27;. this turned out to be by Sir Philip Egerton MP, amateur naturalist, fossil fish collector, and Richard Owen&#x27;s patron. The last two stanzas include a reference to Huxley&#x27;s comment that &quot;Life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once.&quot;: Next HUXLEY repliesThat OWEN he liesAnd garbles his Latin quotation;That his facts are not new,His mistakes not a few,Detrimental to his reputation.To twice slay the slainBy dint of the Brain(Thus HUXLEY concludes his review)Is but labour in vain,unproductive of gain,And so I shall bid you &quot;Adieu&quot;!
* &quot;The Gorilla&#x27;s dilemma&quot;: First two lines: Say am I a man or a brother,Or only an anthropoid ape?
* &quot;Report of a sad case recently tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley&quot;. Lord Mayor asks whether either side is known to the police: Policeman X — Huxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones. People did say that the old man never got over it, and Owen worritted him to death; but I don&#x27;t think it was so bad as that. Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don&#x27;t think it will be a harmonic meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street.
Huxley&#x27;s low set included Hooker &quot;in the green and vegetable line&quot; and &quot;Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier&quot;; Owen&#x27;s &quot;crib in Bloomsbury&quot; was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. Jermyn Street is known for its shops of men&#x27;s clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a dandy.

* &quot;The Water Babies: A fairy tale for a land baby&quot; by Charles Kingsley (serialised in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; 1862–1863, published in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, having &quot;long since ... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species&quot;, and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin&#x27;s theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892, Huxley&#x27;s five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater — Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did you put it in a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day? — Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian — I could never make sure about that Water Baby ... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did — There are some people who see a great deal, and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.

== Racism debate ==
In October 2021, a history group reviewing colonial links told Imperial College London that, because Huxley &quot;might now be called racist&quot;, it should remove a bust of him and rename its Huxley Building. The group of 21 academics had been launched in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 to address Imperial&#x27;s &quot;links to the British Empire&quot; and build a &quot;fully inclusive organisation&quot;. It reported that Huxley&#x27;s paper &quot;Emancipation – Black and White&quot; &quot;espouses a racial hierarchy of intelligence&quot; that helped feed ideas around eugenics, which &quot;falls far short of Imperial&#x27;s modern values&quot;, and that his theories &quot;might now be called &#x27;racist&#x27; in as much as he used racial divisions and hierarchical categorisation in his attempt to understand their origins in his studies of human evolution&quot;. Imperial&#x27;s provost Ian Walmsley responded that Imperial would &quot;confront, not cover up, uncomfortable or awkward aspects of our past&quot; and this was &quot;very much not a &#x27;cancel culture&#x27; approach&quot;. Students would be consulted before management decided on any action to be taken.

A critical response by Nick Matzke said that Huxley was a public, longstanding abolitionist who wrote &quot;the most complete demonstration of the specific diversity of the types of mankind will nowise constrain science to spread her ægis over their [slaveholders&#x27;] atrocities&quot; and &quot;the North is justified in any expenditure of blood or of money, which shall eradicate a system hopelessly inconsistent with the moral elevation, the political freedom, or the economical progress of the American people&quot;; a major opponent of the racist position of polygenism, as well as the position that some human races were transitional (in 1867 Huxley said &quot;there was no shade of justification for the assertion that any existing modification of mankind now known was to be considered as an intermediate form between man and the animals next below him in the scale of the fauna of the world&quot;); a vehement opponent of the scientific racist James Hunt; and a political radical who believed in granting equal rights and the vote to both Black people and women.

<text>Triumph of the Will () is a 1935 German Nazi propaganda film directed, produced, edited and co-written by Leni Riefenstahl. Adolf Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters. The film contains excerpts of speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Its overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power with Hitler as its leader. The film was produced after the Night of the Long Knives, and many formerly prominent SA members are absent.

Following its release in March 1935, it became a major example of film used as propaganda and was well-received at home. Riefenstahl&#x27;s techniques—such as moving cameras, aerial photography, the use of long-focus lenses to create a distorted perspective, and the revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography—have earned &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; recognition as one of the greatest propaganda films in history. It won several awards in Germany, France and Italy.

During World War II, Frank Capra&#x27;s seven-film series &quot;Why We Fight&quot; was directly inspired by &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; and the United States&#x27; response to it. In present-day Germany, the film is not censored but the courts commonly classify it as Nazi propaganda, which requires an educational context for public screenings. The film continues to influence films, documentaries and commercials to this day.

==Synopsis==
The film begins with a prologue establishing the present-day as 5 September 1934 and the elapsed time since World War I, the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler&#x27;s appointment as chancellor, climaxing in his visit to Nuremberg on that day. It is the only commentary in the entire film.

Day 1: The film opens with shots of the clouds above the city, and then moves through the clouds to float above the assembling masses below, with the intention of portraying beauty and majesty of the scene. The cruciform shadow of Hitler&#x27;s plane is visible as it passes over the tiny figures marching below, accompanied by an orchestral arrangement of the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;. Upon arriving at the Nuremberg airport, Hitler and other Nazi leaders emerge from his plane to thunderous applause and a cheering crowd. He is then driven into Nuremberg, through equally enthusiastic people, to his hotel where a night rally is later held.

Day 2: The second day begins with images of Nuremberg at dawn, accompanied by an extract from the Act III Prelude (&quot;Wach Auf!&quot;) of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. Following this is a montage of the attendees preparing for the opening of the Reich Party Congress, and footage of the top Nazi officials arriving at the Luitpold Arena. The film then cuts to the opening ceremony, where Rudolf Hess announces the start of the Congress. The camera then introduces much of the Nazi hierarchy and covers their opening speeches, including Joseph Goebbels, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Fritz Todt, Robert Ley and Julius Streicher. Then the film cuts to an outdoor rally for the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (Labor Service), which is primarily a series of quasi-military drills by men carrying spades. This is also where Hitler gives his first speech on the merits of the Labour Service and praising them for their work in rebuilding Germany. The day then ends with a torchlight SA parade and fireworks display in which Viktor Lutze speaks to the crowds.

Day 3: The third day starts with a Hitler Youth rally on the parade ground. Again the camera covers the Nazi dignitaries arriving and the introduction of Hitler by Baldur von Schirach. Hitler then addresses the Youth, describing in militaristic terms how they must harden themselves and prepare for sacrifice. Everyone present, including General Werner von Blomberg, then assemble for a military pass and review, featuring Wehrmacht cavalry and various armored vehicles. That night Hitler delivers another speech to low-ranking party officials by torchlight, commemorating the first year since the Nazis took power and declaring that the party and state are one entity.

Day 4: The fourth day is the climax of the film, where the most memorable of the imagery is presented. Hitler, flanked by Heinrich Himmler and Viktor Lutze, walks through a long wide expanse with over 150,000 SA and SS troops standing at attention, to lay a wreath at a First World War memorial. Hitler then reviews the parading SA and SS men, following which Hitler and Lutze deliver a speech where they discuss the Night of the Long Knives purge of the SA several months prior. Lutze reaffirms the SA&#x27;s loyalty to the regime, and Hitler absolves the SA of any crimes committed by Ernst Röhm. New party flags are consecrated by letting them touch the &quot;Blutfahne&quot; (the same cloth flag said to have been carried by the fallen Nazis during the Beer Hall Putsch) and, following a final parade in front of the Nuremberg Frauenkirche, Hitler delivers his closing speech. In it he reaffirms the primacy of the Nazi Party in Germany, declaring, &quot;All loyal Germans will become National Socialists. Only the best National Socialists are party comrades!&quot; Hess then leads the assembled crowd in a final &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; salute for Hitler, marking the close of the party congress. The entire crowd sings the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot; as the camera focuses on the giant Swastika banner, which fades into a line of silhouetted men in Nazi party uniforms, marching in formation as the lyrics &quot;Comrades shot by the Red Front and the Reactionaries march in spirit together in our columns&quot; are sung.

==Production==
Riefenstahl, a popular German actress, had directed her first film called &quot;Das blaue Licht&quot; (&quot;The Blue Light&quot;) in 1932. Hitler was impressed with &quot;Das blaue Licht&quot;, and in 1933 asked her to direct a film about the Nazis&#x27; annual Nuremberg Rally, which became &quot;Der Sieg des Glaubens&quot; (&quot;The Victory of Faith&quot;). Hitler chose Riefenstahl as he wanted the film as &quot;artistically satisfying&quot; as possible to appeal to a non-political audience, but he also believed that propaganda must admit no element of doubt.

&quot;The Victory of Faith&quot; faced numerous technical problems, including a lack of preparation (Riefenstahl reported having just a few days) and Hitler&#x27;s apparent unease at being filmed. Though the film apparently did well at the box office, it later became a serious embarrassment to the Nazis after SA Leader Ernst Röhm, who had a prominent role in the film, was executed during the Night of the Long Knives. All references to Röhm were ordered to be erased from German history, which included the destruction of all copies of &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot;. It was considered a lost film until a copy turned up in the 1980s in the German Democratic Republic&#x27;s film archives.

In April 1934, Riefenstahl was commissioned by Hitler to create a successor film to &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot;. Riefenstahl however, remained focused on production of her own film &quot;Tiefland&quot; (which was released only in 1954), while fellow director Walter Ruttmann worked on the party film. Ruttmann&#x27;s ideals departed significantly from &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot; and sought to reorient the focus of the film onto the history of the Nazi movement rather than Hitler himself. Hitler visited the studio on 6 December 1934 and permanently removed Ruttmann from the project, leaving Riefenstahl in sole control of what would become &quot;Triumph des Willens&quot; (&quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;). Riefenstahl claimed that she attempted to avoid doing the film by committing to &quot;Tiefland&quot; and having Ruttmann doing it instead.

===Filming===
The film follows a similar design to &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot;, with the city of Nuremberg scenes, even to the shot of a cat, included in the city driving sequence in both films. Herbert Windt reused much of his musical score from Victory of Faith, in , which he also scored.

Riefenstahl staff had sixteen cameramen, who all had an assistant of their own, using thirty cameras and four complete sound-equipment trucks. 120 assistants worked on the film. Riefenstahl shot an estimated 61 hours of footage to create the two hour film.

Riefenstahl shot &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; on a nominal budget of roughly 280,000 RM (approximately US$110,000 in 1934, $1.54 m in 2015). However Hans Saupert, chief of staff for Franz Xaver Schwarz, claimed that the actual cost of the film was 1 million RM. Riefenstahl claimed that the film was financed by her own efforts and a distribution agreement with Ufa, but received a large amount of financial support from the Nazis directly and indirectly through construction projects for the rally. She admitted to having a Reich Party Account while being interrogated after World War II and she was reimbursed by the Nazis for all expenditures.

Extensive preparations were facilitated by the cooperation of party members, the military, and high-ranking Nazis like Goebbels. In 1975, Susan Sontag claimed that &quot;The Rally was planned not only as a spectacular mass meeting, but as a spectacular propaganda film.&quot; Goebbels wanted film propaganda to be done using subtle methods, but &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, which was the opposite of this belief, was produced against Goebbels&#x27; wishes.

Albert Speer, Hitler&#x27;s personal architect, designed the set in Nuremberg and did most of the coordination for the event. Pits were dug in front of the speakers&#x27; platform so Riefenstahl could get the camera angles she wanted, and tracks were laid so that her cameramen could get traveling shots of the crowd. When the audio from rough cuts was not up to par, major party leaders and high-ranking public officials reenacted their speeches in a studio for her.

===Editing===
Riefenstahl was visited by high-ranking Nazis during the editing process. Hitler suggested the title &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; in September 1934. Goebbels came on 5 December, Hitler and Julius Schaub on 6 December, and Hess on 7 December. She started with 130,000 metres of film and reduced it to 3,000 metres by March 1935. The final product was almost twice as long as &quot;Victory of Faith&quot;.

Walter von Reichenau visited Riefenstahl in December 1934 to see the footage she shot of the military. He was disappointed that Riefenstahl was not going to include the footage in the final film due to the poor quality caused by bad weather during the military exercises. She later produced &quot;Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces&quot; which focused on the military at the 1935 Nuremberg Rally.

==Reception==
&quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; was approved by the censors on 26 March 1935, and premiered on 28 March at the Berlin Ufa Palace Theater. Within two months the film had earned 815,000 Reichsmark (equivalent to million euros), and Ufa considered it one of the three most profitable films of that year. Hitler praised the film as being an &quot;incomparable glorification of the power and beauty of our Movement.&quot; For her efforts, Riefenstahl was rewarded with the German Film Prize (&quot;Deutscher Filmpreis&quot;), a gold medal at the 1935 Venice Biennale, and the Grand Prix at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris. However, there were few claims that the film would result in a mass influx of &quot;converts&quot; to fascism and the Nazis apparently did not make a serious effort to promote the film outside of Germany. Film historian Richard Taylor also said that &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; was not generally used for propaganda purposes inside Nazi Germany. &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote in 2003: &quot;&quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; seduced many wise men and women, persuaded them to admire rather than to despise, and undoubtedly won the Nazis friends and allies all over the world.&quot;

The reception in other countries was not always as enthusiastic. British documentarian Paul Rotha called it tedious, while others were repelled by its pro-Nazi sentiments. During World War II, Frank Capra helped to create a direct response, through the film series called &quot;Why We Fight&quot;, a series of newsreels commissioned by the United States government that spliced in footage from &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, but recontextualized it so that it promoted the cause of the Allies instead. Capra later remarked that &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; &quot;fired no gun, dropped no bombs. But as a psychological weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist, it was just as lethal.&quot; Clips from &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; were also used in an Allied propaganda short called &quot;General Adolph Takes Over&quot;, set to the British dance tune &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;. The legions of marching soldiers, as well as Hitler giving his Nazi salute, were made to look like wind-up dolls, dancing to the music. The Danish resistance used to take over cinemas and force the projectionist to show &quot;Swinging the Lambeth Walk&quot; (as it was also known); Erik Barrow has said: &quot;The extraordinary risks were apparently felt justified by a moment of savage anti-Hitler ridicule.&quot; Also during World War II, the poet Dylan Thomas wrote a screenplay for and narrated &quot;These Are The Men&quot;, a propaganda piece using &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; footage to discredit Nazi leadership.

One of the best ways to gauge the response to &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; was the instant and lasting international fame it gave Riefenstahl. &quot;The Economist&quot; said it &quot;sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century.&quot; For a director who made eight films, only two of which received significant coverage outside of Germany, Riefenstahl had unusually high name recognition for the remainder of her life, most of it stemming from &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. However, her career was also permanently damaged by this association. After the war, Riefenstahl was imprisoned by the Allies for four years for allegedly being a Nazi sympathizer and was permanently blacklisted by the film industry. When she died in 2003—sixty-eight years after the film&#x27;s premiere—her obituary received significant coverage in many major publications, including the Associated Press, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, most of which reaffirmed the importance of &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;.

==Accolades==
==Ethical controversy==
Like American filmmaker D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; has been criticized as a use of spectacular filmmaking to promote a profoundly unethical system. In her defense, Riefenstahl claimed that she was naïve about the Nazis when she made it and had no knowledge of Hitler&#x27;s genocidal or antisemitic policies. She also pointed out that &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; contains &quot;not one single anti-semitic word&quot;, although it does contain a veiled comment by Julius Streicher that &quot;a people that does not protect its racial purity will perish&quot;.

However, Roger Ebert has observed that for some, &quot;the very absence of anti-semitism in &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; looks like a calculation; excluding the central motif of almost all of Hitler&#x27;s public speeches must have been a deliberate decision to make the film more efficient as propaganda.&quot;

Riefenstahl said in 1964:

However, Riefenstahl was an active participant in the rally, though in later years she downplayed her influence significantly, claiming, &quot;I just observed and tried to film it well. The idea that I helped to plan it is downright absurd.&quot; Ebert states that &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; is &quot;by general consent [one] of the best documentaries ever made&quot;, but added that because it reflects the ideology of a movement regarded by many as evil, it poses &quot;a classic question of the contest between art and morality: Is there such a thing as pure art, or does all art make a political statement?&quot; When reviewing the film for his &quot;Great Movies&quot; collection, Ebert reversed his opinion, characterizing his earlier conclusion as &quot;the received opinion that the film is great but evil&quot; and calling it &quot;a terrible film, paralyzingly dull, simpleminded, overlong and not even &#x27;manipulative&#x27;, because it is too clumsy to manipulate anyone but a true believer&quot;.

Writing in 1975, Susan Sontag considers &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; the &quot;most successful, most purely propagandistic film ever made, whose very conception negates the possibility of the filmmaker&#x27;s having an aesthetic or visual conception independent of propaganda.&quot; Sontag points to Riefenstahl&#x27;s involvement in the planning and design of the Nuremberg ceremonies as evidence that Riefenstahl was working as a propagandist, rather than as an artist in any sense of the word. With some 30 cameras and a crew of 150, the marches, parades, speeches, and processions were orchestrated like a movie set for Riefenstahl&#x27;s film. Further, this was not the first political film made by Riefenstahl for the Nazis (there was &quot;Victory of Faith&quot;, 1933), nor was it the last (&quot;Day of Freedom&quot;, 1935, and &quot;Olympia&quot;, 1938). &quot;Anyone who defends Riefenstahl&#x27;s films as documentary&quot;, Sontag states, &quot;if documentary is to be distinguished from propaganda, is being disingenuous. In &quot;Triumph of Will&quot;, the document (the image) is no longer simply the record of reality; &#x27;reality&#x27; has been constructed to serve the image.&quot; This is considerably different from the position she takes ten years earlier in a 1965 essay entitled &quot;On Style&quot;, where she opposes the idea that Riefenstahl&#x27;s propaganda films are purely propaganda, and writes: &quot;To call Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;The Triumph of the Will&quot; and &quot;The Olympiad&quot; masterpieces is not to gloss over Nazi propaganda with aesthetic lenience. The Nazi propaganda is there. But something else is there, too, which we reject at our loss. Because they project the complex movements of intelligence and grace and sensuousness, these two films of Riefenstahl (unique among works of Nazi artists) transcend the categories of propaganda or even reportage. And we find ourselves—to be sure, rather uncomfortably—seeing &#x27;Hitler&#x27; and not Hitler, the &#x27;1936 Olympics&#x27; and not the 1936 Olympics. Through Riefenstahl&#x27;s genius as a film-maker, the &#x27;content&#x27; has—let us even assume, against her intentions—come to play a purely formal role.&quot;

==Influences and legacy==

&quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; remains well known for its striking visuals. As one historian notes, &quot;many of the most enduring images of the [Nazi] regime and its leader derive from Riefenstahl&#x27;s film.&quot;

Extensive excerpts of the film were used in Erwin Leiser&#x27;s documentary &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, produced in Sweden in 1960. Riefenstahl unsuccessfully sued the Swedish production company Minerva-Film for copyright violation, although she did receive forty thousand marks in compensation from German and Austrian distributors of the film.
In 1942, Charles A. Ridley of the British Ministry of Information made a short propaganda film called among other names &quot;Schichlegruber - Doing the Lambeth Walk&quot; and &quot;Lambeth Walk – Nazi Style&quot;, which edited footage of Hitler and German soldiers from the film to make it appear they were marching and dancing to the song &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;. The targeted-at-Nazis film was a parody of &quot;The Lambeth Walk,&quot; a British dance that had been popular in swing clubs in Germany and was denounced by the Nazis as &quot;Jewish mischief and animalistic hopping.&quot; The propaganda film was distributed uncredited to newsreel companies, who would supply their own narration.

Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s satire &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940) was inspired in large part by &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. Frank Capra used significant footage, with a mocking narration in the first installment of the propagandistic film produced by the United States Army &quot;Why We Fight&quot; as an exposure of Nazi militarism and totalitarianism to American soldiers and sailors.

==Copyright==
&quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; remains in copyright. However, the film is commonly mistaken as belonging to the public domain, and it receives frequent unauthorized home video releases as a result.

===Germany===
Riefenstahl initially stated that the Nazi Party held the copyright for the film. She stated that she held the copyright as it was her own creation despite funding from the party after meeting with her lawyer Eugen Krämer in August 1949.

Riefenstahl filed lawsuits against two postwar documentaries which had incorporated footage of &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. The first lawsuit occurred in 1954 against Wolfgang Hartwig, producer of &quot;Bis fünf nach zwölf&quot;. Hartwig argued that the rights belonged to the state, but reportedly eventually paid compensation to Riefenstahl, who donated it to a charity dedicated to returning prisoners of war. Her second lawsuit against Swedish producer Erwin Leiser&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in 1960 was enveloped in greater public debate about the copyright and morality of works produced during the Nazi regime. The case was settled against her in 1969.

In a judgement by the Federal Court of Justice on 29 December 1966, the copyright to the film was transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany as the legal successor of Nazi Germany. These rights are administered by the federally owned Transit-Film GmbH based in Munich, although it was contractually regulated in 1974 that any public screening until 2004 had to be approved by Riefenstahl and that she received 70% of all revenues.

===United States===
In 1996, the copyrights of the film were restored to Riefenstahl under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, although some aspect of the US copyrights are uncertain.
