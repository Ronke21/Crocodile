<text>In Christian theology, Sabellianism is the belief that there is only one Person (&#x27;hypostasis&#x27; in the Greek language of the fourth century Arian Controversy) in the Godhead. For example, Hanson defines Sabellianism as the &quot;refusal to acknowledge the distinct existence of the Persons&quot; and &quot;Eustathius was condemned for Sabellianism. His insistence that there is only one distinct reality &quot;(hypostasis)&quot; in the Godhead, and his confusion about distinguishing Father, Son and Holy Spirit laid him open to such a charge.&quot; Condemned as heresy, Sabellianism has been rejected by the majority of Christian churches.

== Monarchianism ==
Sabellianism appeared for the first time in the second century in the form of Monarchianism. While &quot;this movement called themselves &#x27;Monarchians&#x27;, the Greek Fathers called them &#x27;Sabellians&#x27;, as Sabellius was the person who has put this doctrine in its philosophical form.&quot; 

Monarchianism opposed the Logos-theology. As from the late second century, non-Jewish Christianity was dominated by Logos-theology which taught a two-stage existence for the Logos: He always existed inside God but became a separate Being - a distinct Reality - when God decided to create. Monarchians claimed &quot;that the theology of the Apologists involves a division in the being and unity of God that is unacceptable&quot; and that Logos-theology teaches two creators and two Gods (bi-theism), &quot;inconsistent with monotheism&quot;.

In Monarchianism, &quot;the Father and Son were different expressions of the same being, without any personal distinctions between them. In other words, the Father is himself the Son, and therefore experiences the Son’s human frailties.&quot; &quot;In the words of Noetus: … the Father … Himself became His own Son.&quot; &quot;It was therefore God who was born from a virgin and who confessed himself to humankind as the Son of God. At the cross, God commended his spirit to himself, as he acted to be dead, but he was not dead in reality, although he raised himself on the 3rd day.&quot; 

Tertullian was one of the Logos theologians and strongly opposed Monarchianism. &quot;The treatise &quot;Against Praxeas&quot; is widely recognized as Tertullian&#x27;s greatest work on the Trinity. The view apparently taught by Praxeas has come to be called &quot;, thanks to that designation appearing in Adolf von Harnack&#x27;s History of Dogma (1897). Tertullian simply calls his opponent a &quot;.&quot; 

&quot;Adolph Von Harnack coined the term &quot; for this 2nd-century doctrine, which referred to the Trinity as consisting of &#x27;three modes or aspects of one divine existence&#x27;.&quot;

Following Tertullian, &quot;The Latin Fathers ... called them &quot; because they have identified the Father and the Son to such an extent that they believed that it was the Father who suffered and died on the cross.&quot;

== Sabellius ==
Sabellianism is named after Sabellius (fl. c. 215), who taught a form of it in Rome in the 3rd century. None of his writings have survived, and all that is known about him comes from his opponents, which is not the most reliable source.

Monarchianism had come to Sabellius via the teachings of Noetus and Praxeas. Noetus was excommunicated from the Church after being examined by council, and Praxeas is said to have recanted his modalistic views in writing, teaching again his former faith. Sabellius likewise was excommunicated by council in Alexandria, and after complaint of this was made to Rome, a second council then assembled in Rome and also ruled against Sabellianism.

Johann Lorenz von Mosheim, German Lutheran theologian who founded the pragmatic school of church historians, argued that Sabellius described God as three in one sense but one in another. &quot;Sabellius held to the simple unity of the person and nature of God.&quot; However, the form of Sabellianism taught by Sabellius is not the same as Monarchianism. He did not believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are simply three names for the same Reality. He &quot;believed the distinction of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, described in the Scriptures, to be a real distinction, and not a mere appellative or nominal one.&quot; He maintained that, just like a man is one person, but has a body, a soul, and a spirit, so God is one Person, yet in that Person, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit can be discriminated.

Hippolytus of Rome knew Sabellius personally, writing how he and others had admonished Sabellius in &quot;Refutation of All Heresies&quot;. He knew Sabellius opposed Trinitarian theology, yet he called Modal Monarchism the heresy of Noetus, not that of Sabellius.

== Jesus Christ ==
In (Modalistic) Monarchianism, Jesus Christ is God. In Dynamic Monarchianism, Jesus Christ is a mere man.

== Homoousios ==
It has been reported that Sabellius used the Greek term &quot;homoousian&quot; (, &#x27;same substance&#x27;, &#x27;consubstantial&#x27;), which is also used by the Nicene Creed. The term describes the relationship between Father and Son. Many who held with Athanasius were uneasy about the term. Their objection was that it was considered to be un-scriptural, suspicious, and &quot;of a Sabellian tendency.&quot; For Sabellius, this term means that the Father and Son were one essential person, operating as different manifestations or modes.

== Other Competing Views ==
Simonetti sees Arianism &quot;as an extreme reaction against a Sabellianism which was at the time rife in the East.&quot; Arianism advocated three hypostases. The Trinitarian view also presents three distinct persons within the Godhead, but while Arianism taught three distinct substances, the Trinity doctrine asserts that the three Persons exist in one substance.

==History and development==

Sabellianism was embraced by Christians in Cyrenaica, to whom Dionysius, Patriarch of Alexandria (who was instrumental in the excommunication of Sabellius in Alexandria), wrote letters arguing against this belief. Hippolytus wrote:

Some others are secretly introducing another doctrine, who have become disciples of one Noetus, who was a native of Smyrna, (and) lived not very long ago. ... This person introduced a heresy from the tenets of Heraclitus. Now a certain man called Epigonus becomes his minister and pupil, and this person during his sojourn at Rome disseminated his godless opinion. But Cleomenes, who had become his disciple, an alien both in way of life and habits from the Church, was wont to corroborate the (Noetian) doctrine. | But in like manner, also, Noetus, being by birth a native of Smyrna ... introduced (among us) this heresy which originated from one Epigonus. It reached Rome, and was adopted by Cleomenes, and so has continued to this day among his successors. 

Tertullian also perceived modalism as entering into the Church from without as a new idea, and opposing the doctrine which had been received through succession. After setting forth his understanding of the manner of faith which had been received by the Church, he then describes how the &quot;simple&quot; who always constitute the majority of believers are often startled at the idea that the One God exists in three and were opposed to his understanding of &quot;the rule of faith.&quot; Proponents of Tertullian argue that he described the &quot;simple&quot; as the majority, rather than those who opposed him as the majority. This is contended from Tertullian&#x27;s argument that they were putting forth ideas of their own which had not been taught to them by their elders:

We, however, as we indeed always have done (and more especially since we have been better instructed by the Paraclete, who leads men indeed into all truth), believe that there is one only God, but under the following dispensation, or οἰκονομία, as it is called, that this one only God has also a Son, His Word, who proceeded from Himself, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made. Him we believe to have been sent by the Father into the Virgin, and to have been born of her—being both Man and God, the Son of Man and the Son of God, and to have been called by the name of Jesus Christ; we believe Him to have suffered, died, and been buried, according to the Scriptures, and, after He had been raised again by the Father and taken back to heaven, to be sitting at the right hand of the Father, and that He will come to judge the quick and the dead; who sent also from heaven from the Father, according to His own promise, the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, the sanctifier of the faith of those who believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost. That this rule of faith has come down to us from the beginning of the gospel, even before any of the older heretics, much more before Praxeas, a pretender of yesterday, will be apparent both from the lateness of date which marks all heresies, and also from the absolutely novel character of our new-fangled Praxeas. In this principle also we must henceforth find a presumption of equal force against all heresies whatsoever—that whatever is first is true, whereas that is spurious which is later in date.

The simple, indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) who always constitute the majority of believers, are startled at the dispensation (of the Three in One), on the ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world’s plurality of gods to the one only true God; not understanding that, although He is the one only God, He must yet be believed in with His own οἰκονομία . The numerical order and distribution of the Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which derives the Trinity out of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that it is actually supported by it. They are constantly throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three gods, while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the One God; just as if the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce heresy, and the Trinity rationally considered constitute the truth.

According to modalism and Sabellianism, God is said to be only one person who reveals himself in different ways called &quot;modes&quot;, &quot;faces&quot;, &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;roles&quot; or &quot;masks&quot; (Greek πρόσωπα &quot;prosopa&quot;; Latin &quot;personae&quot;) of the One God, as perceived by &quot;the believer&quot;, rather than &quot;three co-eternal persons&quot; within &quot;the Godhead&quot;, or a &quot;co-equal Trinity&quot;. Modalists note that the only number expressly and repeatedly ascribed to God in the Old Testament is &quot;One,&quot; do not accept interpreting this number as denoting union (i.e. Gen 2:24) when it is applied to God, and dispute the meaning or validity of related New Testament passages cited by Trinitarians. 

The Comma Johanneum, which is generally regarded as a spurious text in First John (1 John 5:7) known primarily from the King James Version and some versions of the Textus Receptus, but not included in modern critical texts, is an instance (the only one expressly stated) of the word &quot;Three&quot; describing God. Many modalists point out the lack of the word &quot;Trinity&quot; in any canonical scripture.

Passages such as Deut 6:4-5; Deut 32:12; 2Kings 19:15-19; Job 6:10; Job 31:13-15; Psalm 71:22; Psalm 83:16,18; Is 42:8; Is 45:5-7; Is 48:2,9,11-13; Mal 2:8,10; Matt 19:17; Romans 3:30; 2Cor 11:2-3; Gal 3:20; and Jude 1:25 are referenced by modalists as affirming that the Being of the One God is solidly single, and although known in several modes, precludes any concept of divine co-existence. Hippolytus described similar reasoning by Noetus and his followers saying: Now they seek to exhibit the foundation for their dogma by citing the word in the law, &quot;I am the God of your fathers: ye shall have no other gods beside me;&quot; and again in another passage, &quot;I am the first,&quot; He saith, &quot;and the last; and beside me there is none other.&quot; Thus they say they prove that God is one... And we cannot express ourselves otherwise, he says; for the apostle also acknowledges one God, when he says, &quot;Whose are the fathers, (and) of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.&quot;

Oneness Pentecostals, an identifier used by some modern modalists, claim that Colossians 1:12-20 refers to Christ&#x27;s relationship with the Father in the sense of different roles of God:
giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities; all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.

Oneness Pentecostals also cite Christ&#x27;s response to Philip&#x27;s query on who the Father was in John 14:10 to support this assertion:
 Jesus answered: &quot;Don&#x27;t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, &#x27;Show us the Father&#x27;?

Trinitarian Christians hold that verses such as Colossians 1:12-20 remove all reasonable doubt that scripture teaches the Son, Who IS the Word of God (i.e. John 1:1-3), is literally &quot;living,&quot; and literally Creator of everything together with God the Father and the Spirit of God. In the Trinitarian view, the above usage not only takes John 14:10 out of its immediate context, but is also resolutely contrary to the congruence of the Gospel of John as a whole, and strongly suspected of begging the question in interpretation. Trinitarians understand John 14:10 as informed by parallel verses such as John 1:14 and John 1:18, and as affirming the eternal union of the Son with His Father:
 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth ... No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.

Many doctrinal exchanges between modalists and Trinitarians are similar to the above. Passages such as Gen 1:26-27; Gen 16:11-13; Gen 32:24,30; Judg 6:11-16; Is 48:16; Zech 2:8-9; Matt 3:16-17; Mark 13:32; Luke 12:10; John 5:18-27; John 14:26-28; John 15:26; John 16:13-16; John 17:5,20-24; Acts 1:6-9; and Heb 1:1-3,8-10 are referenced by Trinitarians as affirming that the Being of the One God is an eternal, personal, and mutually indwelling communion of Father [God], Son [the Word of God], and Holy Spirit [the Spirit of God]. 

Addressing the fact that the word &quot;Trinity&quot; does not occur in scripture, Trinitarians attest that extra-biblical doctrinal language often summarizes our understanding scripture in a clear and concise manner—other examples being even the words &quot;modalism&quot;, &quot;mode&quot;, and &quot;role&quot;—and that use of such language does not of itself demonstrate accuracy or inaccuracy. The accusative implication that the word &quot;Trinity&quot; gained common use apart from careful and pious fidelity to scripture may be associated with ad hominem argumentation. Hippolytus described his own response to Noetus&#x27; doctrine, claiming the truth to be more evident than either of the two mutually opposed views of Arianism and Sabellianism : In this way, then, they choose to set forth these things, and they make use only of one class of passages; just in the same one-sided manner that Theodotus employed when he sought to prove that Christ was a mere man. But neither has the one party nor the other understood the matter rightly, as the Scriptures themselves confute their senselessness, and attest the truth. See, brethren, what a rash and audacious dogma they have introduced... For who will not say that there is one God? Yet he will not on that account deny the economy [i.e., the number and disposition of persons in the Trinity]. The proper way, therefore, to deal with the question is first of all to refute the interpretation put upon these passages by these men, and then to explain their real meaning.

Tertullian said of Praxeas&#x27; followers:For, confuted on all sides on the distinction between the Father and the Son, which we maintain without destroying their inseparable union ... they endeavour to interpret this distinction in a way which shall nevertheless tally with their own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish two, Father and Son, understanding the Son to be flesh, that is man, that is Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is God, that is Christ. Thus they, while contending that the Father and the Son are one and the same, do in fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them.”
A comparison of the above statement by Tertullian with the following example statement made by Oneness Pentecostals today is striking: &quot;Jesus is the Son of God according to the flesh ... and the very God Himself according to the Spirit ...&quot;

The form of the Lord&#x27;s Name appearing in verse nineteen of the Great Commission, Matthew 28:16-20, has also historically been spoken during Christian baptism, Trinitarian Christians believing the three distinct, albeit co-inherent, persons of the Holy Trinity received witness by Jesus&#x27; baptism. Many modalists do not use this form as the Lord&#x27;s Name. It is also suggested by some modern Oneness Pentecostal critics, that Matthew 28:19 is not part of the original text, because Eusebius of Caesarea quoted it by saying &quot;In my name&quot;, and in that source there was no mention of baptism in the verse. Eusebius quoted the &quot;trinitarian&quot; formula in his later writings. (Conybeare (&quot;Hibbert Journal&quot; i (1902-3), page 102). 

Matthew 28:19 is quoted also in the Didache (Didache 7:1), which dates to the late 1st Century or early 2nd Century) and in the Diatesseron (Diatesseron 55:5-7), which dates to the mid 2nd Century harmony of the Synoptic Gospels. The &quot;Shem-Tob&#x27;s Hebrew Gospel of Matthew&quot; (George Howard), written during the 14th century, also has no reference of baptism or a &quot;trinitarian&quot; formula in Matthew 28:19. 

However, it is also true that no Greek manuscript of the Gospel of Matthew has ever been found which does not contain Matthew 28:19. The earliest extant copies of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel date to the 3rd Century, and they contain Matthew 28:19. Therefore, scholars generally agree that Matthew 28:19 is likely part of the original Gospel of Matthew, though a minority disputes this.

In passages of scripture such as Matthew 3:16-17 where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are separated in the text and witness, modalists view this phenomenon as confirming God&#x27;s omnipresence, and His ability to manifest himself as he pleases. Oneness Pentecostals and Modalists attempt to dispute the traditional doctrine of eternal co-existent union, while affirming the Christian doctrine of God taking on flesh as Jesus Christ. Like Trinitarians, Oneness adherents attest that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man. However, Trinitarians believe that the &quot;Word of God,&quot; the eternal second Person of the Trinity, was manifest as the Son of God by taking humanity to Himself and by glorifying that Humanity to equality with God through His resurrection, in eternal union with His own Divinity. 

In contrast, Oneness adherents hold that the One and Only true God—Who manifests Himself in any way He chooses, including as Father, Son and Holy Spirit (though not choosing to do so in an eternally simultaneous manner)—became man in the temporary role of Son. Many Oneness Pentecostals have also placed a strongly Nestorian distinction between Jesus&#x27; humanity and Divinity as in the example compared with Tertullian&#x27;s statement above.

Oneness Pentecostals and other modalists are regarded by Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and most other mainstream Christians as heretical for denying the literal existence of God&#x27;s Beloved Son from Heaven, including His eternal Being; rejecting the direct succession of apostolic gifts and authority through the ordination of the Christian bishops; rejecting the identity of mainstream Christians as the God-begotten Body and Church which Christ founded; and rejecting the affirmations of the ecumenical councils such as the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople, including the Holy Trinity. 

While many Unitarians are Arians, modalists differentiate themselves from Arian or Semi-Arian Unitarians by affirming Christ&#x27;s full Godhead, whereas both the Arian and Semi-Arian views assert Christ as not of one substance (Greek: οὐσία) with, and therefore also not equal with, God the Father. Dionysius, bishop of Rome, set forth the understanding of traditional Christianity concerning both Arianism and Sabellianism in &quot;Against the Sabellians&quot;, ca. AD 262. He, in similarity to Hippolytus, explained that the two errors are at opposite extremes in seeking to understand the Son of God, Arianism misusing that the Son is distinct respecting the Father, and Sabellianism misusing that the Son is equal respecting the Father. He also repudiated the idea of three Gods as error. 

While Arianism and Sabellianism may appear to be diametrically opposed, the former claiming Christ to be created and the latter claiming Christ is God, both in common deny the Trinitarian belief that Christ is God Eternal in His Humanity, and that this is the very basis of man&#x27;s hope of salvation. &quot;One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the manhood into God.&quot;

Hippolytus&#x27; account of the excommunication of Noetus is as follows: When the blessed presbyters heard this, they summoned him before the Church, and examined him. But he denied at first that he held such opinions. Afterwards, however, taking shelter among some, and having gathered round him some others who had embraced the same error, he wished thereafter to uphold his dogma openly as correct. And the blessed presbyters called him again before them, and examined him. But he stood out against them, saying, &quot;What evil, then, am I doing in glorifying Christ?&quot; And the presbyters replied to him, &quot;We too know in truth one God; we know Christ; we know that the Son suffered even as He suffered, and died even as He died, and rose again on the third day, and is at the right hand of the Father, and cometh to judge the living and the dead. And these things which we have learned we allege.&quot; Then, after examining him, they expelled him from the Church. And he was carried to such a pitch of pride, that he established a school.

Today&#x27;s Oneness Pentecostal organisations left their original organization when a council of Pentecostal leaders officially adopted Trinitarianism, and have since established schools.

Epiphanius (Haeres 62) about 375 notes that the adherents of Sabellius were still to be found in great numbers, both in Mesopotamia and at Rome. The First Council of Constantinople in 381 in canon VII and the Third Council of Constantinople in 680 in canon XCV declared the baptism of Sabellius to be invalid, which indicates that Sabellianism was still extant.

==Patripassianism==
The chief critics of Sabellianism were Tertullian and Hippolytus. In his work &quot;Adversus Praxeas&quot;, Chapter I, Tertullian wrote &quot;By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father.&quot; Likewise Hippolytus wrote,
Do you see, he says, how the Scriptures proclaim one God? And as this is clearly exhibited, and these passages are testimonies to it, I am under necessity, he says, since one is acknowledged, to make this One the subject of suffering. For Christ was God, and suffered on account of us, being Himself the Father, that He might be able also to save us... See, brethren, what a rash and audacious dogma they have introduced, when they say without shame, the Father is Himself Christ, Himself the Son, Himself was born, Himself suffered, Himself raised Himself. But it is not so.
From these notions came the pejorative term &quot;Patripassianism&quot; for the movement, from the Latin words &quot;pater&quot; for &quot;father&quot;, and &quot;passus&quot; from the verb &quot;to suffer&quot; because it implied that the Father suffered on the Cross.

It is important to note that our only sources extant for our understanding of Sabellianism are from their detractors. Scholars today are not in agreement as to what exactly Sabellius or Praxeas taught. It is easy to suppose that Tertullian and Hippolytus at least at times misrepresented the opinions of their opponents.

==Eastern Orthodox view==
The Greek Orthodox teach that God is not of a substance that is comprehensible since God the Father has no origin and is eternal and infinite. Thus it is improper to speak of things as &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;metaphysical&quot;; rather it is correct to speak of things as &quot;created&quot; and &quot;uncreated.&quot; God the Father is the origin and source of the Trinity of Whom the Son is begotten and the Spirit proceeding, all Three being Uncreated. 

Therefore, the consciousness of God is not obtainable to created beings either in this life or the next (see apophatism). Through co-operation with the Holy Spirit (called theosis), Mankind can become good (God-like), not becoming uncreated, but partaker of His divine energies (). From such a perspective Mankind can be reconciled from the Knowledge of Good and the Knowledge of Evil he obtained in the Garden of Eden (see the Fall of Man), his created substance thus partaking of Uncreated God through the indwelling Presence of the eternally incarnate () Son of God and His Father by the Spirit (, ).

==Current adherents==
At the Arroyo Seco World Wide Camp Meeting, near Los Angeles, in 1913, Canadian evangelist R.E. McAlister stated at a baptismal service that the apostles had baptized in the name of Jesus only and not in the triune Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Later that night, John G. Schaeppe, a German immigrant, had a vision of Jesus and woke up the camp shouting that the name of Jesus needed to be glorified. From that point, Frank J. Ewart began requiring that anyone baptized using the Trinitarian formula needed to be rebaptized in the name of Jesus &quot;only&quot;. Support for this position began to spread, along with a belief in one Person in the Godhead, acting in different modes or offices.
The General Council of the Assemblies of God convened in St. Louis, Missouri in October 1916, to confirm their belief in Trinitarian orthodoxy. The Oneness camp was faced by a majority who required acceptance of the Trinitarian baptismal formula and the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity or remove themselves from the denomination. In the end, about a quarter of the ministers withdrew.

Oneness Pentecostalism teaches that God is one Person, and that the Father (a spirit) is united with Jesus (a man) as the Son of God. However, Oneness Pentecostalism differs somewhat by rejecting sequential modalism, and by the full acceptance of the begotten humanity of the Son, not eternally begotten, who was the man Jesus and was born, crucified, and risen, and not the deity. This directly opposes the pre-existence of the Son as a pre-existent mode, which Sabellianism generally does not oppose.

Oneness Pentecostals believe that Jesus was &quot;Son&quot; only when he became flesh on earth, but was the Father before being made man. They refer to the Father as the &quot;Spirit&quot; and the Son as the &quot;Flesh&quot;, but they believe that Jesus and the Father are one essential Person, though operating as different &quot;manifestations&quot; or &quot;modes&quot;. Oneness Pentecostals reject the Trinity doctrine, viewing it as pagan and nonscriptural, and hold to the Jesus&#x27; Name doctrine with respect to baptisms. They are often referred to as &quot;Modalists&quot; or &quot;Jesus Only&quot;. Oneness Pentecostalism can be compared to Sabellianism, or can be described as holding to a form of Sabellianism, as both are nontrinitarian, and as both believe that Jesus was &quot;Almighty God in the Flesh&quot;, but they do not totally identify each other.

It cannot be certain whether Sabellius taught Modalism completely as it is taught today as Oneness doctrine, since only a few fragments of his writings are extant and, therefore, all we have of his teachings comes through the writing of his detractors.

The following excerpts which demonstrate some of the known doctrinal characteristics of ancient Sabellians may be seen to compare with the doctrines in the modern Oneness movement:

* Cyprian wrote - &quot;...how, when God the Father is not known, nay, is even blasphemed, can they who among the heretics are said to be baptized in the name of Christ, be judged to have obtained the remission of sins?&quot;
* Hippolytus (A.D. 170–236) referred to them - &quot;And some of these assent to the heresy of the Noetians, and affirm that the Father himself is the Son...&quot;
* Pope Dionysius, Bishop of Rome from A.D. 259–269 wrote - &quot;Sabellius...blasphemes in saying that the Son Himself is the Father and vice versa.&quot;
* Tertullian states - &quot;He commands them to baptize into the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, not into a unipersonal God. And indeed it is not once only, but three times, that we are immersed into three persons, at each several mention of their names.&quot;

==Current opposition==
While Oneness Pentecostals seek to differentiate themselves from ancient Sabellianism, modern theologians such as James R. White and Robert Morey see no significant difference between the ancient heresy of Sabellianism and current Oneness doctrine. This is based on the denial by Oneness Pentecostals of the Trinity, believing that there is no distinction between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Sabellianism, Patripassianism, Modalistic Monarchianism, functionalism, Jesus Only, Father Only, and Oneness Pentecostalism are viewed by these theologians as being derived from a Platonic doctrine that God was an indivisible Monad and could not be differentiated as distinct Persons.

<text>The Sino–Indian War, also known as the China–India War or the Indo–China War, was an armed conflict between China and India that took place from October to November 1962. It was a military escalation of the Sino–Indian border dispute. Fighting occurred along India&#x27;s border with China, in India&#x27;s North-East Frontier Agency east of Bhutan, and in Aksai Chin west of Nepal.

There had been a series of border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. Chinese military action grew increasingly aggressive after India rejected proposed Chinese diplomatic settlements throughout 1960–1962, with China resuming previously banned &quot;forward patrols&quot; in Ladakh after 30 April 1962. Amidst the Cuban Missile Crisis, China abandoned all attempts towards a peaceful resolution on 20 October 1962, invading disputed territory along the border in Ladakh and across the McMahon Line in the northeastern frontier. Chinese troops pushed Indian forces back in both theatres, capturing all of their claimed territory in the western theatre and the Tawang Tract in the eastern theatre. The conflict ended when China unilaterally declared a ceasefire on 20 November 1962, and simultaneously announced its withdrawal to its pre-war position, the effective China–India border (also known as the Line of Actual Control).

Much of the fighting comprised mountain warfare, entailing large-scale combat at altitudes of over . Notably, the war took place entirely on land, without the use of naval or air assets by either side.

As the Sino-Soviet split deepened, the Soviet Union made a major effort to support India, especially with the sale of advanced MiG fighter aircraft. Simultaneously, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to sell advanced weaponry to India, further compelling it to turn to the Soviets for military aid.

== Location ==

China and India shared a long border, sectioned into three stretches by Nepal, Sikkim (then an Indian protectorate), and Bhutan, which follows the Himalayas between Burma and what was then West Pakistan. A number of disputed regions lie along this border. At its western end is the Aksai Chin region, an area the size of Switzerland, that sits between the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang and Tibet, which China declared as an autonomous region in 1965. The eastern border, between Burma and Bhutan, comprises the present Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, formerly the North-East Frontier Agency. Both of these regions were overrun by China in the 1962 conflict.

Most combat took place at high elevations. The Aksai Chin region is a desert of salt flats around above sea level, and Arunachal Pradesh is mountainous with a number of peaks exceeding . The Chinese Army had possession of one of the highest ridges in the region. The high altitude and freezing conditions caused logistical and welfare difficulties. In past similar conflicts, such as the Italian Campaign of World War I, harsh conditions have caused more casualties than have enemy actions. The Sino-Indian War was no different, with many troops on both sides succumbing to the freezing cold temperatures.

== Background ==
The main cause of the war was a dispute over the sovereignty of the widely separated Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to Ladakh and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China&#x27;s construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.

=== Aksai Chin ===

The western portion of the Sino-Indian boundary originated in 1834, with the conquest of Ladakh by the armies of Raja Gulab Singh (Dogra) under the suzerainty of the Sikh Empire. Following an unsuccessful campaign into Tibet, Gulab Singh and the Tibetans signed a treaty in 1842 agreeing to stick to the &quot;old, established frontiers&quot;, which were left unspecified. The British defeat of the Sikhs in 1846 resulted in the transfer of the Jammu and Kashmir region including Ladakh to the British, who then installed Gulab Singh as the Maharaja under their suzerainty. British commissioners contacted Chinese officials to negotiate the border, who did not show any interest. The British boundary commissioners fixed the southern end of the boundary at Pangong Lake, but regarded the area north of it till the Karakoram Pass as &quot;terra incognita&quot;.

The Maharaja of Kashmir and his officials were keenly aware of the trade routes from Ladakh. Starting from Leh, there were two main routes into Central Asia: one passed through the Karakoram Pass to Shahidulla at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains and went on to Yarkand through the Kilian and Sanju passes; the other went east via the Chang Chenmo Valley, passed the Lingzi Tang Plains in the Aksai Chin region, and followed the course of the Karakash River to join the first route at Shahidulla. The Maharaja regarded Shahidulla as his northern outpost, in effect treating the Kunlun mountains as the boundary of his domains. His British suzerains were sceptical of such an extended boundary because Shahidulla was away from the Karakoram Pass and the intervening area was uninhabited. Nevertheless, the Maharaja was allowed to treat Shahidulla as his outpost for more than 20 years.

Chinese Turkestan regarded the &quot;northern branch&quot; of the Kunlun range with the Kilian and Sanju passes as its southern boundary. Thus the Maharaja&#x27;s claim was uncontested. After the 1862 Dungan Revolt, which saw the expulsion of the Chinese from Turkestan, the Maharaja of Kashmir constructed a small fort at Shahidulla in 1864. The fort was most likely supplied from Khotan, whose ruler was now independent and on friendly terms with Kashmir. When the Khotanese ruler was deposed by the Kashgaria strongman Yakub Beg, the Maharaja was forced to abandon his post in 1867. It was then occupied by Yakub Beg&#x27;s forces until the end of the Dungan Revolt.

In the intervening period, W. H. Johnson of Survey of India was commissioned to survey the Aksai Chin region. While in the course of his work, he was &quot;invited&quot; by the Khotanese ruler to visit his capital. After returning, Johnson noted that Khotan&#x27;s border was at Brinjga, in the Kunlun mountains, and the entire Karakash Valley was within the territory of Kashmir. The boundary of Kashmir that he drew, stretching from Sanju Pass to the eastern edge of Chang Chenmo Valley along the Kunlun mountains, is referred to as the &quot;Johnson Line&quot; (or &quot;Ardagh-Johnson Line&quot;).

After the Chinese reconquered Turkestan in 1878, renaming it Xinjiang, they again reverted to their traditional boundary. By now, the Russian Empire was entrenched in Central Asia, and the British were anxious to avoid a common border with the Russians. After creating the Wakhan corridor as the buffer in the northwest of Kashmir, they wanted the Chinese to fill out the &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; between the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. Under British (and possibly Russian) encouragement, the Chinese occupied the area up to the Yarkand River valley (called Raskam), including Shahidulla, by 1890. They also erected a boundary pillar at the Karakoram pass by about 1892. These efforts appear half-hearted. A map provided by Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at St. Petersburgh, in 1893 showed the boundary of Xinjiang up to Raskam. In the east, it was similar to the Johnson line, placing Aksai Chin in Kashmir territory.

By 1892, the British settled on the policy that their preferred boundary for Kashmir was the &quot;Indus watershed&quot;, i.e., the water-parting from which waters flow into the Indus river system on one side and into the Tarim basin on the other. In the north, this water-parting was along the Karakoram range. In the east, it was more complicated because the Chip Chap River, Galwan River and the Chang Chenmo River flow into the Indus whereas the Karakash River flows into the Tarim basin. A boundary alignment along this water-parting was defined by the Viceroy Lord Elgin and communicated to London. The British government in due course proposed it to China via its envoy Sir Claude MacDonald in 1899. This boundary, which came to be called the Macartney–MacDonald Line, ceded to China the Aksai Chin plains in the northeast, and the Trans-Karakoram Tract in the north. In return, the British wanted China to cede its &#x27;shadowy suzerainty&#x27; on Hunza.

Following the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 which resulted in power shifts in China, the fall of Tzarist Russia in 1917 and the end of World War I in 1918, the British officially used the Johnson Line but had lost the urgency to enforce this boundary. They took no steps to establish outposts or assert control on the ground. According to Neville Maxwell, the British had used as many as 11 different boundary lines in the region, as their claims shifted with the political situation. From 1917 to 1933, the &quot;Postal Atlas of China&quot;, published by the Government of China in Peking had shown the boundary in Aksai Chin as per the Johnson line, which runs along the Kunlun Mountains. The &quot;Peking University Atlas&quot;, published in 1925, also put the Aksai Chin in India.

The use of Johnson line or Macartney-MacDonald line was neglected by the colonial administrators and by 1947, when India gained independence, the British left the government of India with high ambiguity about the settled border to the North. The Indian government choose to lay claim to Aksai Chin after 1947. On 1 July 1954, India&#x27;s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru definitively stated the Indian position, claiming that Aksai Chin had been part of the Indian Ladakh region for centuries, and that the border (as defined by the Johnson Line) was non-negotiable. According to George N. Patterson, when the Indian government finally produced a report detailing the alleged proof of India&#x27;s claims to the disputed area, &quot;the quality of the Indian evidence was very poor, including some very dubious sources indeed&quot;.

In 1956–57, China constructed a road through Aksai Chin, connecting Xinjiang and Tibet, which ran south of the Johnson Line in many places. Aksai Chin was easily accessible to the Chinese, but access from India, which meant negotiating the Karakoram mountains, was much more difficult. The road came on Chinese maps published in 1958.

=== The McMahon Line ===

In 1826, British India gained a common border with Tibet after the British wrested control of Manipur and Assam from the Burmese, following the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824–1826. In 1847, Major J. Jenkins, agent for the North East Frontier, reported that the Tawang was part of Tibet. In 1872, four monastic officials from Tibet arrived in Tawang and supervised a boundary settlement with Major R. Graham, NEFA official, which included the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet. In 1873, the British drew an &quot;Inner Line&quot; as an administrative line to inhibit their subjects from encroaching into the tribal territory within its control. The British boundary, also called the &quot;Outer Line&quot;, was defined to mark the limits of British jurisdiction. But it was not significantly different from the Inner Line in this region.

By 1873, it was clear that the British treated the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet. This boundary was confirmed in a 1 June 1912 note from the British General Staff in India.

In 1904, in order to skew Tibet away from Russian influence, an Anglo-Tibetan treaty was written called the Convention of Lhasa. This treaty alarmed the Chinese which started displaying power by crushing rebellions and erecting flags and boundary stones in the Lohit Valley which were mostly removed by the British by 1910. Such aggression from the Chinese conveyed to the Colonial administration that the Tawang tract could serve as a route of invasion in the future.

After the 1911 Revolution, UK sat a weakened China along with Tibet in the Simla Convention to settle the borders between Tibet, China and British India. The foreign secretary of the British Indian government, Henry McMahon was the driving force in this conference. After carrying out surveys, the conference drew the McMahon Line. Whilst all three representatives initialed the agreement, Beijing later objected to the proposed boundary and did not ratify it. McMahon decided to bypass the Chinese (although instructed not to by his superiors) and settle the border bilaterally by negotiating directly with Tibet.

According to later Indian claims, this border was intended to run through the highest ridges of the Himalayas, as the areas south of the Himalayas were traditionally Indian. The McMahon Line lay south of the boundary India claims. India&#x27;s government held the view that the Himalayas were the ancient boundaries of the Indian subcontinent, and thus should be the modern boundaries of India, while it is the position of the Chinese government that the disputed area in the Himalayas have been geographically and culturally part of Tibet since ancient times.

The British-run Government of India initially rejected the Simla Agreement as incompatible with the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, which stipulated that neither party was to negotiate with Tibet &quot;except through the intermediary of the Chinese government&quot;. The British and Russians cancelled the 1907 agreement by joint consent in 1921. It was not until the late 1930s that the British started to use the McMahon Line on official maps of the region.

China took the position that the Tibetan government should not have been allowed to make such a treaty, rejecting Tibet&#x27;s claims of independent rule. For its part, Tibet did not object to any section of the McMahon Line excepting the demarcation of the trading town of Tawang, which the Line placed under British-Indian jurisdiction. Up until World War II, Tibetan officials were allowed to administer Tawang with complete authority. Due to the increased threat of Japanese and Chinese expansion during this period, British Indian troops secured the town as part of the defence of India&#x27;s eastern border.

In the 1950s, India began patrolling the region. It found that, at multiple locations, the highest ridges actually fell north of the McMahon Line. Given India&#x27;s historic position that the original intent of the line was to separate the two nations by the highest mountains in the world, in these locations India extended its forward posts northward to the ridges, regarding this move as compliant with the original border proposal, although the Simla Convention did not explicitly state this intention.

== Events leading up to war ==
=== Border dispute after Partition of India and formation of the PRC ===
British India was partitioned in 1947 and split into India and Pakistan while the Chinese Civil War resulted in the formation of People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. One of the most basic policies for the new Indian government was that of maintaining cordial relations with China, reviving its ancient friendly ties. India was among the first nations to grant diplomatic recognition to the newly created PRC.

In 1950, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) invaded Tibet, which the Chinese governments regarded as still part of China. Later the Chinese extended their influence by building a road in 1956–67 and placing border posts in Aksai Chin. India protested against these moves and decided to look for a diplomatic solution to ensure a stable Sino-Indian border. To resolve any doubts about the Indian position, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared in parliament that India regarded the McMahon Line as its official border. The Chinese expressed no concern at this statement.

At the time, Chinese officials issued no condemnation of Nehru&#x27;s claims or made any opposition to Nehru&#x27;s open declarations of control over Aksai Chin. In 1956, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai stated that he had no claims over Indian-controlled territory. He later argued that Aksai Chin was already under Chinese jurisdiction and that the McCartney-MacDonald Line was the line China could accept. Zhou later argued that as the boundary was undemarcated and had never been defined by treaty between any Chinese or Indian government, the Indian government could not unilaterally define Aksai Chin&#x27;s borders.

In 1954, Nehru wrote a memo calling for India&#x27;s borders to be clearly defined and demarcated; in line with previous Indian philosophy, Indian maps showed a border that, in some places, lay north of the McMahon Line. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, in November 1956, assured India that China had no claims on Indian territory, although official Chinese maps showed of territory claimed by India as Chinese. They also allege that Zhou purposefully told Nehru that there were no border issues with India.

In 1954, China and India negotiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, by which the two nations agreed to abide in settling their disputes. India presented a frontier map which was accepted by China, and the slogan &quot;Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai&quot; (Indians and Chinese are brothers) was popularised. Nehru in 1958 had privately told G. Parthasarathi, the Indian envoy to China not to trust the Chinese at all and send all communications directly to him, bypassing the Defence Minister VK Krishna Menon since his communist background clouded his thinking about China. According to , Nehru&#x27;s policy on Tibet was to create a strong Sino-Indian partnership which would be catalysed through agreement and compromise on Tibet. Garver believes that Nehru&#x27;s previous actions had given him confidence that China would be ready to form an &quot;Asian Axis&quot; with India.

This apparent progress in relations suffered a major setback when, in 1959, Nehru accommodated the Tibetan religious leader at the time, the 14th Dalai Lama, who fled Lhasa after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. The Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong, was enraged and asked the Xinhua News Agency to produce reports on Indian expansionists operating in Tibet.

Armed clashes increased over summer 1959. On 25 August 1959, a group of Indian soldiers crossed into the Longju area, north of the McMahon Line. The PLA took an Indian prisoner.

On 2 October, Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev defended Nehru in a meeting with Mao. This action reinforced China&#x27;s impression that the Soviet Union, the United States and India all had expansionist designs on China. The PLA went so far as to prepare a self-defence counterattack plan. Negotiations were restarted between the nations, but no progress was made.

On 21 October, there was a small scale clash at Kongka Pass. The Chinese and Indian sides each claimed that the other side shot first. Zhou Enlai proposed a mutual withdrawal to 12.4 miles behind the McMahon Line. The Indian government did not respond.

As a consequence of their non-recognition of the McMahon Line, China&#x27;s maps showed both the North East Frontier Area (NEFA) and Aksai Chin to be Chinese territory. In 1960, Zhou Enlai unofficially suggested that India drop its claims to Aksai Chin in return for a Chinese withdrawal of claims over NEFA. Adhering to his stated position, Nehru believed that China did not have a legitimate claim over either of these territories, and thus was not ready to concede them. This adamant stance was perceived in China as Indian opposition to Chinese rule in Tibet. Nehru declined to conduct any negotiations on the boundary until Chinese troops withdrew from Aksai Chin, a position supported by the international community.

India produced numerous reports on the negotiations, and translated Chinese reports into English to help inform the international debate. China believed that India was simply securing its claim lines in order to continue its &quot;grand plans in Tibet&quot;. India&#x27;s stance that China withdraw from Aksai Chin caused continual deterioration of the diplomatic situation to the point that internal forces were pressuring Nehru to take a military stance against China.

=== 1960 meetings to resolve the boundary question ===
In 1960, based on an agreement between Nehru and Zhou Enlai, officials from India and China held discussions in order to settle the boundary dispute. China and India disagreed on the major watershed that defined the boundary in the western sector. The Chinese statements with respect to their border claims often misrepresented the cited sources. The failure of these negotiations was compounded by successful Chinese border agreements with Nepal (Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship) and Burma in the same year.

=== Forward policy ===

In the summer of 1961, China began patrolling along the McMahon Line. They entered parts of Indian administered regions and much angered the Indians in doing so. The Chinese, however, did not believe they were intruding upon Indian territory. In response the Indians launched a policy of creating outposts behind the Chinese troops so as to cut off their supplies and force their return to China.

On 5 December 1961 orders went to the Eastern and Western commands:This has been referred to as the &quot;forward policy&quot;. There were eventually 60 such outposts, including 43 along the Chinese-claimed frontier in Aksai Chin.

Indian leaders believed, based on previous diplomacy, that the Chinese would not react with force. According to the Indian Official History, Indian posts and Chinese posts were separated by a narrow stretch of land. China had been steadily spreading into those lands and India reacted with the forward policy to demonstrate that those lands were not unoccupied. Neville Maxwell traces this confidence to the Intelligence Bureau chief Mullik.

The initial reaction of the Chinese forces was to withdraw when Indian outposts advanced towards them. However, this appeared to encourage the Indian forces to accelerate their forward policy even further. In response, the Central Military Commission adopted a policy of &quot;armed coexistence&quot;. In response to Indian outposts encircling Chinese positions, Chinese forces would build more outposts to counter-encircle these Indian positions. This pattern of encirclement and counter-encirclement resulted in an interlocking, chessboard-like deployment of Chinese and Indian forces. Despite the leapfrogging encirclements by both sides, no hostile fire occurred from either side as troops from both sides were under orders to fire only in defense. On the situation, Mao commented, The attacks by China beginning on 20 October 1962 were retaliation for the forward policy. That year, the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission instructed the PLA to mobilize frontier troops for a counteroffensive campaign.

=== Early incidents ===
Various border conflicts and &quot;military incidents&quot; between India and China flared up throughout the summer and autumn of 1962. In May, the Indian Air Force was told not to plan for close air support, although it was assessed as being a feasible way to counter the unfavourable ratio of Chinese to Indian troops. In June, a skirmish caused the deaths of dozens of Chinese troops. The Indian Intelligence Bureau received information about a Chinese buildup along the border which could be a precursor to war.

During June–July 1962, Indian military planners began advocating &quot;probing actions&quot; against the Chinese, and accordingly, moved mountain troops forward to cut off Chinese supply lines. According to Patterson, the Indian motives were threefold:
# Test Chinese resolve and intentions regarding India.
# Test whether India would enjoy Soviet backing in the event of a Sino-Indian war.
# Create sympathy for India within the U.S., with whom relations had deteriorated after the Indian annexation of Goa.

On 10 July 1962, 350 Chinese troops surrounded an Indian post in Chushul (north of the McMahon Line) but withdrew after a heated argument via loudspeaker. On 22 July, the forward policy was extended to allow Indian troops to push back Chinese troops already established in disputed territory. Whereas Indian troops were previously ordered to fire only in self-defence, all post commanders were now given discretion to open fire upon Chinese forces if threatened. In August, the Chinese military improved its combat readiness along the McMahon Line and began stockpiling ammunition, weapons and fuel.

Given his foreknowledge of the coming Cuban Missile Crisis, Mao was able to persuade Khrushchev to reverse the Russian policy of backing India, at least temporarily. In mid-October, the Communist organ &quot;Pravda&quot; encouraged peace between India and China. When the Cuban Missile Crisis ended and Mao&#x27;s rhetoric changed, Russia reversed course.

== Confrontation at Thagla Ridge ==

In June 1962, Indian forces established an outpost called the Dhola Post on the northern slopes of Tsangdhar Range, in the right-side of Namka Chu valley, facing the southern slopes of Thagla Ridge. Clearly, the Dhola Post lay north of the map-marked McMahon Line which straight across Tsangdhar Range but south of Thagla Ridge along which India interpreted the McMahon Line to run. In August, China issued diplomatic protests and began occupying positions at the top of Thagla Ridge.

On 8 September, a 60-strong PLA unit descended to the south side of the ridge and occupied positions that dominated one of the Indian posts at Namka Chu. Fire was not exchanged, but Nehru told the media that the Indian Army had instructions to &quot;free our territory&quot; and the troops had been given discretion to use force. On 11 September, it was decided that &quot;all forward posts and patrols were given permission to fire on any armed Chinese who entered Indian territory&quot;.

The operation to occupy Thagla Ridge was flawed in that Nehru&#x27;s directives were unclear, delaying it. In addition, each man had to carry over the long trek, greatly slowing the reaction. By the time the Indian battalion reached the point of conflict, Chinese units controlled both banks of the Namka Chu River. On 20 September, Chinese troops threw grenades at Indian troops and a firefight developed, triggering a long series of skirmishes for the rest of September.

Some Indian troops, including Brigadier Dalvi who commanded the forces at Thagla Ridge, were also concerned that the territory they were fighting for was not strictly territory that &quot;we should have been convinced was ours&quot;. According to Neville Maxwell, even members of the Indian defence ministry were categorically concerned with the validity of the fighting in Thagla Ridge.

On 4 October, Brij Mohan Kaul, commanding IV Corps, assigned some troops to secure regions south of the Thagla Ridge. Kaul decided to first secure Yumtso La, a strategically important position, before re-entering the lost Dhola Post. Kaul had then realised that the attack would be desperate and the Indian government tried to stop an escalation into all-out war. Indian troops marching to Thagla Ridge had suffered in the previously unexperienced conditions; two Gurkha soldiers died of pulmonary edema.

On 10 October, an Indian Rajput patrol of 50 troops to Yumtso La were met by an emplaced Chinese position of some 1,000 soldiers. Indian troops were in no position for battle, as Yumtso La was above sea level and Kaul did not plan on having artillery support for the troops. The Chinese troops opened fire on the Indians, thinking they were north of the McMahon Line. The Indians were surrounded by Chinese positions, which used mortar fire. They managed to hold off the first Chinese assault, inflicting heavy casualties.

At this point, the Indian troops were in a position to push the Chinese back with mortar and machine gun fire. Brigadier Dalvi opted not to fire, as it would mean decimating the Rajput who were still in the area of the Chinese regrouping. They helplessly watched the Chinese ready themselves for a second assault. In the second Chinese assault, the Indians began their retreat, realising the situation was hopeless. The Indian patrol suffered 25 casualties and the Chinese 33. The Chinese troops held their fire as the Indians retreated, and then buried the Indian dead with military honours, as witnessed by the retreating soldiers. This was the first occurrence of heavy fighting in the war.

This attack had grave implications for India and Nehru tried to solve the issue, but by 18 October, it was clear that the Chinese were preparing for an attack, with a massive troop buildup. A long line of mules and porters had also been observed supporting the buildup and reinforcement of positions south of the Thagla Ridge.

== Chinese preparations ==

=== Chinese motives ===
Two of the major factors leading up to China&#x27;s eventual conflicts with Indian troops were India&#x27;s stance on the disputed borders and perceived Indian subversion in Tibet. There was &quot;a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet, Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre-1949 status quo ante of Tibet&quot;. The other was &quot;a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border&quot;. John W. Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based on the state of the Indian military and polity in the 1960s. It was, nevertheless a major reason for China&#x27;s going to war. He argues that while the Chinese perception of Indian border actions were &quot;substantially accurate&quot;, Chinese perceptions of the supposed Indian policy towards Tibet were &quot;substantially inaccurate&quot;.

The CIA&#x27;s declassified POLO documents reveal contemporary American analysis of Chinese motives during the war. According to this document, &quot;Chinese apparently were motivated to attack by one primary consideration — their determination to retain the ground on which PLA forces stood in 1962 and to punish the Indians for trying to take that ground&quot;. In general terms, they tried to show the Indians once and for all that China would not acquiesce in a military &quot;reoccupation&quot; policy. Secondary reasons for the attack were to damage Nehru&#x27;s prestige by exposing Indian weakness and to expose as traitorous Khrushchev&#x27;s policy of supporting Nehru against a Communist country.

Another factor which might have affected China&#x27;s decision for war with India was a perceived need to stop a Soviet-U.S.-India encirclement and isolation of China. India&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union and United States were both strong at this time, but the Soviets (and Americans) were preoccupied by the Cuban Missile Crisis and would not interfere with the Sino-Indian War. P. B. Sinha suggests that China waited until October to attack because the timing of the war was exactly in parallel with American actions so as to avoid any chance of American or Soviet involvement. Although American buildup of forces around Cuba occurred on the same day as the first major clash at Dhola Post, and China&#x27;s buildup between 10 and 20 October appeared to coincide exactly with the United States establishment of a blockade against Cuba which began 20 October, the Chinese probably prepared for this before they could anticipate what would happen in Cuba.

In May to June 1962, the KMT government of Republic of China on Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s leadership was propagating the policy of &#x27;Reclaim the mainland China&#x27;, causing fear of invasion from Taiwan among Chinese Communist leadership and the shift of concern to the Southeast. Reluctant to divert resources to the hostitlies in the Himalayas, Chinese leadership thought a two-front war undesirable. From July on, after receiving American assurances that KMT government would not invade, China began to focus on the Indian border.

Garver argues that the Chinese correctly assessed Indian border policies, particularly the forward policy, as attempts for incremental seizure of Chinese-controlled territory. On Tibet, Garver argues that one of the major factors leading to China&#x27;s decision for war with India was a common tendency of humans &quot;to attribute others&#x27; behavior to interior motivations, while attributing their own behavior to situational factors&quot;. Studies from China published in the 1990s confirmed that the root cause for China going to war with India was the perceived Indian aggression in Tibet, with the forward policy simply catalysing the Chinese reaction.

Neville Maxwell and Allen Whiting argue that the Chinese leadership believed they were defending territory that was legitimately Chinese, and which was already under de facto Chinese occupation prior to Indian advances, and regarded the forward policy as an Indian attempt at creeping annexation. Mao Zedong himself compared the forward policy to a strategic advance in Chinese chess:

Chinese policy toward India, therefore, operated on two seemingly contradictory assumptions in the first half of 1961. On the one hand, the Chinese leaders continued to entertain a hope, although a shrinking one, that some opening for talks would appear. On the other hand, they read Indian statements and actions as clear signs that Nehru wanted to talk only about a Chinese withdrawal. Regarding the hope, they were willing to negotiate and tried to prod Nehru into a similar attitude. Regarding Indian intentions, they began to act politically and to build a rationale based on the assumption that Nehru already had become a lackey of imperialism; for this reason he opposed border talks.

Krishna Menon is reported to have said that when he arrived in Geneva on 6 June 1961 for an international conference in Laos, Chinese officials in Chen Yi&#x27;s delegation indicated that Chen might be interested in discussing the border dispute with him. At several private meetings with Menon, Chen avoided any discussion of the dispute and Menon surmised that the Chinese wanted him to broach the matter first. He did not, as he was under instructions from Nehru to avoid taking the initiative, leaving the Chinese with the impression that Nehru was unwilling to show any flexibility.

In September, the Chinese took a step toward criticising Nehru openly in their commentary. After citing Indonesian and Burmese press criticism of Nehru by name, the Chinese critiqued his moderate remarks on colonialism (People&#x27;s Daily Editorial, 9 September): &quot;Somebody at the Non-Aligned Nations Conference advanced the argument that the era of classical colonialism is gone and dead...contrary to facts.&quot; This was a distortion of Nehru&#x27;s remarks but appeared close enough to be credible. On the same day, Chen Yi referred to Nehru by implication at the Bulgarian embassy reception: &quot;Those who attempted to deny history, ignore reality, and distort the truth and who attempted to divert the Conference from its important object have failed to gain support and were isolated.&quot; On 10 September, they dropped all circumlocutions and criticised him by name in a China Youth article and NCNA report—the first time in almost two years that they had commented extensively on the Prime Minister.

By early 1962, the Chinese leadership began to believe that India&#x27;s intentions were to launch a massive attack against Chinese troops, and that the Indian leadership wanted a war. In 1961, the Indian Army had been sent into Goa, a small region without any other international borders apart from the Indian one, after Portugal refused to surrender the exclave colony to the Indian Union. Although this action met little to no international protest or opposition, China saw it as an example of India&#x27;s expansionist nature, especially in light of heated rhetoric from Indian politicians. India&#x27;s Home Minister declared, &quot;If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by it, India will have to repeat what it did in Goa. India will certainly drive out the Chinese forces&quot;, while another member of the Indian Congress Party pronounced, &quot;India will take steps to end [Chinese] aggression on Indian soil just as it ended Portuguese aggression in Goa&quot;.

By mid-1962, it was apparent to the Chinese leadership that negotiations had failed to make any progress, and the forward policy was increasingly perceived as a grave threat as Delhi increasingly sent probes deeper into border areas and cut off Chinese supply lines. Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi commented at one high-level meeting, &quot;Nehru&#x27;s forward policy is a knife. He wants to put it in our heart. We cannot close our eyes and await death.&quot; The Chinese leadership believed that their restraint on the issue was being perceived by India as weakness, leading to continued provocations, and that a major counterblow was needed to stop perceived Indian aggression.

Xu Yan, prominent Chinese military historian and professor at the PLA&#x27;s National Defense University, gives an account of the Chinese leadership&#x27;s decision to go to war. By late September 1962, the Chinese leadership had begun to reconsider their policy of &quot;armed coexistence&quot;, which had failed to address their concerns with the forward policy and Tibet, and consider a large, decisive strike. On 22 September 1962, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; published an article which claimed that &quot;the Chinese people were burning with &#x27;great indignation&#x27; over the Indian actions on the border and that New Delhi could not &#x27;now say that warning was not served in advance&#x27;.&quot;

=== Military planning ===
The Indian side was confident war would not be triggered and made little preparations. India had only two divisions of troops in the region of the conflict. In August 1962, Brigadier D. K. Palit claimed that a war with China in the near future could be ruled out. Even in September 1962, when Indian troops were ordered to &quot;expel the Chinese&quot; from Thagla Ridge, Maj. General J. S. Dhillon expressed the opinion that &quot;experience in Ladakh had shown that a few rounds fired at the Chinese would cause them to run away.&quot; Because of this, the Indian Army was completely unprepared when the attack at Yumtso La occurred.

Declassified CIA documents which were compiled at the time reveal that India&#x27;s estimates of Chinese capabilities made them neglect their military in favour of economic growth. It is claimed that if a more military-minded man had been in place instead of Nehru, India would have been more likely to have been ready for the threat of a counter-attack from China.

On 6 October 1962, the Chinese leadership convened. Defence minister, Lin Biao, reported that PLA intelligence units had determined that Indian units might assault Chinese positions at Thagla Ridge on 10 October (Operation Leghorn). The Chinese leadership and the Central Military Council decided upon war to launch a large-scale attack to punish perceived military aggression from India. In Beijing, a larger meeting of Chinese military was convened in order to plan for the coming conflict.

Mao and the Chinese leadership issued a directive laying out the objectives for the war. A main assault would be launched in the eastern sector, which would be coordinated with a smaller assault in the western sector. All Indian troops within China&#x27;s claimed territories in the eastern sector would be expelled, and the war would be ended with a unilateral Chinese ceasefire and withdrawal, followed by a return to the negotiating table. India led the Non-Aligned Movement, Nehru enjoyed international prestige, and China, with a larger military, would be portrayed as an aggressor. He said that a well-fought war &quot;will guarantee at least thirty years of peace&quot; with India, and determined the benefits to offset the costs.

China also reportedly bought a significant amount of Indian rupee currency from Hong Kong, supposedly to distribute amongst its soldiers in preparation for the war.

On 8 October, additional veteran and elite divisions were ordered to prepare to move into Tibet from the Chengdu and Lanzhou military regions.

On 14 October, an editorial on &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; issued China&#x27;s final warning to India: &quot;So it seems that Mr. Nehru has made up his mind to attack the Chinese frontier guards on an even bigger scale. ... It is high time to shout to Mr. Nehru that the heroic Chinese troops, with the glorious tradition of resisting foreign aggression, can never be cleared by anyone from their own territory ... If there are still some maniacs who are reckless enough to ignore our well-intentioned advice and insist on having another try, well, let them do so. History will pronounce its inexorable verdict ... At this critical moment ... we still want to appeal once more to Mr. Nehru: better rein in at the edge of the precipice and do not use the lives of Indian troops as stakes in your gamble.&quot;

Marshal Liu Bocheng headed a group to determine the strategy for the war. He concluded that the opposing Indian troops were among India&#x27;s best, and to achieve victory would require deploying crack troops and relying on force concentration to achieve decisive victory. On 16 October, this war plan was approved, and on the 18th, the final approval was given by the Politburo for a &quot;self-defensive counter-attack&quot;, scheduled for 20 October.

== Chinese offensive ==
On 20 October 1962, the PLA launched two attacks, apart. In the western theatre, the PLA sought to expel Indian forces from the Chip Chap valley in Aksai Chin while in the eastern theatre, the PLA sought to capture both banks of the Namka Chu river. Gurkha rifles travelling north were targeted by Chinese artillery fire. After four days of fierce fighting, the three regiments of Chinese troops succeeded in securing a substantial portion of the disputed territory.

=== Eastern theatre ===
Chinese troops launched an attack on the southern banks of the Namka Chu River on 20 October. The Indian forces were undermanned, with only an understrength battalion to support them, while the Chinese troops had three regiments positioned on the north side of the river. The Indians expected Chinese forces to cross via one of five bridges over the river and defended those crossings. The PLA bypassed the defenders by fording the river, which was shallow at that time of year, instead. They formed up into battalions on the Indian-held south side of the river under cover of darkness, with each battalion assigned against a separate group of Rajputs.

At 5:14 am, Chinese mortar fire began attacking the Indian positions. Simultaneously, the Chinese cut the Indian telephone lines, preventing the defenders from making contact with their headquarters. At about 6:30 am, the Chinese infantry launched a surprise attack from the rear and forced the Indians to leave their trenches. The Chinese overwhelmed the Indian troops in a series of flanking manoeuvres south of the McMahon Line and prompted their withdrawal from Namka Chu. Fearful of continued losses, Indian troops retreated into Bhutan. Chinese forces respected the border and did not pursue. Chinese forces now held all of the territory that was under dispute at the time of the Thagla Ridge confrontation, but they continued to advance into the rest of NEFA.

On 22 October, at 12:15 am, PLA mortars fired on Walong, on the McMahon line. Flares launched by Indian troops the next day revealed numerous Chinese milling around the valley. The Indians tried to use their mortars against the Chinese but the PLA responded by lighting a bush fire, causing confusion among the Indians. Some 400 PLA troops attacked the Indian position. The initial Chinese assault was halted by accurate Indian mortar fire. The Chinese were then reinforced and launched a second assault. The Indians managed to hold them back for four hours, but the Chinese used weight of numbers to break through. Most Indian forces were withdrawn to established positions in Walong, while a company supported by mortars and medium machine guns remained to cover the retreat.

Elsewhere, Chinese troops launched a three-pronged attack on Tawang, which the Indians evacuated without any resistance.

Over the following days, there were clashes between Indian and Chinese patrols at Walong as the Chinese rushed in reinforcements. On 25 October, the Chinese made a probe, which was met with resistance from the 4th Sikhs. The following day, a patrol from the 4th Sikhs was encircled, and after being unable to break the encirclement, an Indian unit was able to flank the Chinese, allowing the Sikhs to break free.

=== Western theatre ===

On the Aksai Chin front, China already controlled most of the disputed territory. Chinese forces quickly swept the region of any remaining Indian troops. Late on 19 October, Chinese troops launched a number of attacks throughout the western theatre. By 22 October, all posts north of Chushul had been cleared.

On 20 October, the Chinese easily took the Chip Chap Valley and Pangong Lake. Many outposts and garrisons along the Western front were unable to defend against the surrounding Chinese troops. Most Indian troops positioned in these posts offered resistance but were either killed or taken prisoner. Indian support for these outposts was not forthcoming, as evidenced by the Galwan post, which had been surrounded by enemy forces in August, but no attempt made to relieve the besieged garrison. Following the 20 October attack, nothing was heard from Galwan.

On 24 October, Indian forces fought hard to hold the Rezang La Ridge, in order to prevent a nearby airstrip from falling.

After realising the magnitude of the attack, the Indian Western Command withdrew many of the isolated outposts to the south-east. Daulet Beg Oldi was also evacuated, but it was south of the Chinese claim line and was not approached by Chinese forces. Indian troops were withdrawn in order to consolidate and regroup in the event that China probed south of their claim line.

== Lull in the fighting ==
By 24 October, the PLA had entered territory previously administered by India to give the PRC a diplomatically strong position over India. The majority of Chinese forces had advanced south of the control line prior to the conflict. Four days of fighting were followed by a three-week lull. Zhou ordered the troops to stop advancing as he attempted to negotiate with Nehru. The Indian forces had retreated into more heavily fortified positions around Se La and Bomdi La which would be difficult to assault. Zhou sent Nehru a letter, proposing
# A negotiated settlement of the boundary
# That both sides disengage and withdraw from present lines of actual control
# A Chinese withdrawal north in NEFA
# That China and India not cross lines of present control in Aksai Chin.

Nehru&#x27;s 27 October reply expressed interest in the restoration of peace and friendly relations and suggested a return to the &quot;boundary prior to 8 September 1962&quot;. He was categorically concerned about a mutual withdrawal after &quot;40 or 60 kilometres (25 or 40 miles) of blatant military aggression&quot;. He wanted the creation of a larger immediate buffer zone and thus resist the possibility of a repeat offensive. Zhou&#x27;s 4 November reply repeated his 1959 offer to return to the McMahon Line in NEFA and the Chinese traditionally claimed MacDonald Line in Aksai Chin.

Facing Chinese forces maintaining themselves on Indian soil and trying to avoid political pressure, the Indian parliament announced a national emergency and passed a resolution which stated their intent to &quot;drive out the aggressors from the sacred soil of India&quot;. The United States and the United Kingdom supported India&#x27;s response. The Soviet Union was preoccupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis and did not offer the support it had provided in previous years. With the backing of other great powers, a 14 November letter by Nehru to Zhou once again rejected his proposal.

Neither side declared war, used their air force, or fully broke off diplomatic relations, but the conflict is commonly referred to as a war. This war coincided with the Cuban Missile Crisis and was viewed by the western nations at the time as another act of aggression by the Communist bloc. According to Calvin, the Chinese side evidently wanted a diplomatic resolution and discontinuation of the conflict.

== Continuation of war ==
After Zhou received Nehru&#x27;s letter (rejecting Zhou&#x27;s proposal), the fighting resumed on the eastern theatre on 14 November (Nehru&#x27;s birthday), with an Indian attack on Walong, claimed by China, launched from the defensive position of Se La and inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. The Chinese resumed military activity on Aksai Chin and NEFA hours after the Walong battle.

=== Continuation of Eastern theatre ===
In the eastern theatre, the PLA attacked Indian forces near Se La and Bomdi La on 17 November. These positions were defended by the Indian 4th Infantry Division. Instead of attacking by road as expected, PLA forces approached via a mountain trail, and their attack cut off a main road and isolated 10,000 Indian troops.

Se La occupied high ground, and rather than assault this commanding position, the Chinese captured Thembang, which was a supply route to Se La.

The PLA penetrated close to the outskirts of Tezpur, Assam, a major frontier town nearly from the Assam-North-East Frontier Agency border. The local government ordered the evacuation of the civilians in Tezpur to the south of the Brahmaputra River, all prisons were thrown open, and government officials who stayed behind destroyed Tezpur&#x27;s currency reserves in anticipation of a Chinese advance.

=== Continuation of Western theatre ===

On the western theatre, PLA forces launched a heavy infantry attack on 18 November near Chushul. Their attack started at 4:35 am, despite a mist surrounding most of the areas in the region. At 5:45 the Chinese troops advanced to attack two platoons of Indian troops at Gurung Hill.

The Indians did not know what was happening, as communications were dead. As a patrol was sent, China attacked with greater numbers. Indian artillery could not hold off the superior Chinese forces. By 9:00 am, Chinese forces attacked Gurung Hill directly and Indian commanders withdrew from the area and also from the connecting Spangur Gap.

The Chinese had been simultaneously attacking Rezang La which was held by 123 Indian troops. At 5:05 am, Chinese troops launched their attack audaciously. Chinese medium machine gun fire pierced through the Indian tactical defences.

At 6:55 am the sun rose and the Chinese attack on the 8th platoon began in waves. Fighting continued for the next hour, until the Chinese signaled that they had destroyed the 7th platoon. Indians tried to use light machine guns on the medium machine guns from the Chinese but after 10 minutes the battle was over. Logistical inadequacy once again hurt the Indian troops. The Chinese gave the Indian troops a respectful military funeral. The battles also saw the death of Major Shaitan Singh of the Kumaon Regiment, who had been instrumental in the first battle of Rezang La. The Indian troops were forced to withdraw to high mountain positions. Indian sources believed that their troops were just coming to grips with the mountain combat and finally called for more troops. The Chinese declared a ceasefire, ending the bloodshed.

Indian forces suffered heavy casualties, with dead Indian troops&#x27; bodies being found in the ice, frozen with weapons in hand. The Chinese forces also suffered heavy casualties, especially at Rezang La. This signalled the end of the war in Aksai Chin as China had reached their claim line – many Indian troops were ordered to withdraw from the area. China claimed that the Indian troops wanted to fight on until the bitter end. The war ended with their withdrawal, so as to limit the number of casualties.

== Ceasefire ==
China had reached its claim lines so the PLA did not advance farther, and on 19 November, it declared a unilateral cease-fire. Zhou Enlai declared a unilateral ceasefire to start on midnight, 21 November. Zhou&#x27;s ceasefire declaration stated,

Zhou had first given the ceasefire announcement to Indian chargé d&#x27;affaires on 19 November (before India&#x27;s request for United States air support), but New Delhi did not receive it until 24 hours later. The aircraft carrier was ordered back after the ceasefire, and thus, American intervention on India&#x27;s side in the war was avoided. Retreating Indian troops, who hadn&#x27;t come into contact with anyone knowing of the ceasefire, and Chinese troops in NEFA and Aksai Chin, were involved in some minor battles, but for the most part, the ceasefire signalled an end to the fighting. The United States Air Force flew in supplies to India in November 1962, but neither side wished to continue hostilities.

After 1 December, Chinese forces began leaving Indian territories and returning to the old boundary.

Toward the end of the war India increased its support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries, some of them having settled in India, as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region. The Nehru administration ordered the raising of an elite Indian-trained &quot;Tibetan Armed Force&quot; composed of Tibetan refugees.
== International reactions ==
According to James Calvin, western nations at the time viewed China as an aggressor during the China–India border war, and saw the war as part of a monolithic communist objective for a world dictatorship of the proletariat. This was further triggered by Mao&#x27;s statement that: &quot;the way to world conquest lies through Havana, Accra and Calcutta&quot;. The United States was unequivocal in its recognition of the Indian boundary claims in the eastern sector, while not supporting the claims of either side in the western sector. Britain, on the other hand, agreed with the Indian position completely, with the foreign secretary stating, &#x27;we have taken the view of the government of India on the present frontiers and the disputed territories belong to India.&#x27;
The Chinese military action has been viewed by the United States as part of the PRC&#x27;s policy of making use of aggressive wars to settle its border disputes and to distract both its own population and international opinion from its internal issues. The Kennedy administration was disturbed by what they considered &quot;blatant Chinese communist aggression against India&quot;. In a May 1963 National Security Council meeting, contingency planning on the part of the United States in the event of another Chinese attack on India was discussed and nuclear options were considered. After listening to advisers, Kennedy stated &quot;We should defend India, and therefore we will defend India.&quot; By 1964, China had developed its own nuclear weapon which would have likely caused any American nuclear policy in defense of India to be reviewed.

The non-aligned nations remained mostly uninvolved, and only Egypt (officially the United Arab Republic) openly supported India. Of the non-aligned nations, six, Egypt, Burma, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Ghana and Indonesia, met in Colombo on 10 December 1962. The proposals stipulated a Chinese withdrawal of from the customary lines without any reciprocal withdrawal on India&#x27;s behalf. The failure of these six nations to unequivocally condemn China deeply disappointed India.

Pakistan also shared a disputed boundary with China, and had proposed to India that the two countries adopt a common defence against &quot;northern&quot; enemies (i.e. China), which was rejected by India, citing nonalignment. In 1962, Pakistani president Muhammad Ayub Khan made clear to India that Indian troops could safely be transferred from the Pakistan frontier to the Himalayas. But, after the war, Pakistan improved its relations with China. It began border negotiations on 13 October 1962, concluding them in December. In 1963, the China-Pakistan Border Treaty was signed, as well as trade, commercial, and barter treaties. Pakistan conceded its northern claim line in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir to China in favour of a more southerly boundary along the Karakoram Range. The border treaty largely set the border along the MacCartney-Macdonald Line. India&#x27;s military failure against China would embolden Pakistan to initiate the Second Kashmir War with India in 1965.

== Foreign involvement ==
During the conflict, Nehru wrote two letters on 19 November 1962 to U.S. President Kennedy, asking for 12 squadrons of fighter jets and a modern radar system. These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective. Bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action. Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration, which was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis during most of the Sino-Indian War. The U.S. nonetheless provided non-combat assistance to Indian forces and planned to send the carrier to the Bay of Bengal to support India in case of an air war.

As the Sino-Soviet split had already emerged, Moscow, while remaining formally neutral, made a major effort to render military assistance to India, especially with the sale of advanced MiG warplanes. The U.S. and Britain refused to sell these advanced weapons so India turned to the USSR. India and the USSR reached an agreement in August 1962 (before the Cuban Missile Crisis) for the immediate purchase of twelve MiG-21s as well as for Soviet technical assistance in the manufacture of these aircraft in India. According to P.R. Chari, &quot;The intended Indian production of these relatively sophisticated aircraft could only have incensed Peking so soon after the withdrawal of Soviet technicians from China.&quot; In 1964, further Indian requests for American jets were rejected. However, Moscow offered loans, low prices and technical help in upgrading India&#x27;s armaments industry. By 1964, India was a major purchaser of Soviet arms.

According to Indian diplomat G. Parthasarathy, &quot;only after we got nothing from the US did arms supplies from the Soviet Union to India commence.&quot; India&#x27;s favored relationship with Moscow continued into the 1980s, but ended after the collapse of Soviet Communism in 1991. In his memoirs, the then Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, says: &quot;I think Mao created the Sino-Indian conflict precisely in order to draw the Soviet Union into it. He wanted to put us in the position of having to no choice but to support him. He wanted to be the one who decided what we should do. But Mao made a mistake in thinking we would agree to sacrifice our independence in foreign policy.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
=== China ===
According to China&#x27;s official military history, the war achieved China&#x27;s policy objectives of securing borders in its western sector, as China continued its de facto control of the Aksai Chin.

According to James Calvin, even though China won a military victory it lost in terms of its international image. China&#x27;s first nuclear weapon test in October 1964 and its support of Pakistan in the 1965 India-Pakistan War tended to confirm the American view of communist world objectives, including Chinese influence over Pakistan.

Lora Saalman opined in a 2011 study of Chinese military publications, that while the war led to much blame, debates and acted as catalyst for the military modernisation of India, the war is now treated as basic reportage of facts with relatively diminished interest by Chinese analysts.

This changed during the 2017 Doklam crisis, when the Chinese official media made reference to the 1962 war in the context of renewed border tensions with India.

=== India ===

The aftermath of the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the future, and placed pressure on Nehru, who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese attack on India. Indians reacted with a surge in patriotism and memorials were erected for many of the Indian troops who died in the war. Arguably, the main lesson India learned from the war was the need to strengthen its own defences and a shift from Nehru&#x27;s foreign policy with China based on his stated concept of &quot;brotherhood&quot;. Because of India&#x27;s inability to anticipate Chinese aggression, Nehru faced harsh criticism from government officials, for having promoted pacifist relations with China. Indian President Radhakrishnan said that Nehru&#x27;s government was naive and negligent about preparations, and Nehru admitted &quot;We had been living in a world of our own making&quot;. According to Inder Malhotra, a former editor of &quot;The Times of India&quot; and a commentator for &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, Indian politicians invested more effort in removing Defence Minister Krishna Menon than in actually waging war. Menon&#x27;s favouritism weakened the Indian Army, and national morale dimmed. The public saw the war as a political and military debacle. Though the demand to deploy air force was raised, American envoy John Kenneth Galbraith and Indian intelligence officer B. N. Mullick had advised against the use of air force believing that the Chinese would bomb Indian cities in retaliation. India ultimately refrained from using the Indian Air Force as it lacked the defence equipments to counter Chinese retaliation. Indians in general became highly sceptical of China and its military. Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India&#x27;s attempts at establishing a long-standing peace with China and started to question the once popular &quot;Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai&quot; (meaning &quot;Indians and Chinese are brothers&quot;). The war also put an end to Nehru&#x27;s earlier hopes that India and China would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the increasing influence of the Cold War bloc superpowers.

The unpreparedness of the army was blamed on Defence Minister Menon, who resigned his government post to allow for someone who might modernise India&#x27;s military. India&#x27;s policy of weaponisation via indigenous sources and self-sufficiency was thus cemented. Sensing a weakened army, Pakistan, a close ally of China, began a policy of provocation against India by infiltrating Jammu and Kashmir and ultimately triggering the Second Kashmir War with India in 1965 and Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. The attack of 1965 was successfully stopped and ceasefire was negotiated under international pressure. In the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 India won a clear victory, resulting in liberation of Bangladesh (formerly East-Pakistan).

As a result of the war, the Indian government commissioned an investigation, resulting in the classified Henderson Brooks–Bhagat Report on the causes of the war and the reasons for failure. India&#x27;s performance in high-altitude combat in 1962 led to an overhaul of the Indian Army in terms of doctrine, training, organisation and equipment. Neville Maxwell claimed that the Indian role in international affairs after the border war was also greatly reduced after the war and India&#x27;s standing in the non-aligned movement suffered. The Indian government has attempted to keep the Hendersen-Brooks-Bhagat Report secret for decades, although portions of it have recently been leaked by Neville Maxwell.

According to James Calvin, India gained many benefits from the 1962 conflict. This war united the country as never before. India got 32,000 square miles (8.3 million hectares, 83,000 km2) of disputed territory even if it felt that NEFA was hers all along. The new Indian republic had avoided international alignments; by asking for help during the war, India demonstrated its willingness to accept military aid from several sectors. And, finally, India recognised the serious weaknesses in its army. It would more than double its military manpower in the next two years and it would work hard to resolve the military&#x27;s training and logistic problems to later become the second-largest army in the world. India&#x27;s efforts to improve its military posture significantly enhanced its army&#x27;s capabilities and preparedness.

=== Internment and deportation of Chinese Indians ===

Soon after the end of the war, the Indian government passed the Defence of India Act in December 1962, permitting the &quot;apprehension and detention in custody of any person [suspected] of being of hostile origin.&quot; The broad language of the act allowed for the arrest of any person simply for having a Chinese surname, Chinese ancestry or a Chinese spouse. The Indian government incarcerated thousands of Chinese-Indians in an internment camp in Deoli, Rajasthan, where they were held for years without trial. The last internees were not released until 1967. Thousands more Chinese-Indians were forcibly deported or coerced to leave India. Nearly all internees had their properties sold off or looted. Even after their release, the Chinese Indians faced many restrictions in their freedom. They could not travel freely until the mid-1990s.

=== Subsequent conflicts between India and China ===

India has also had some military conflicts with China after the 1962 war. In late 1967, there were two conflicts in which both countries clashed in Sikkim. These conflicts were dubbed the &quot;Nathu La&quot; and &quot;Cho La&quot; clashes respectively, in which advancing Chinese forces were forced to withdraw from Sikkim, then a protectorate of India and later a state of India after its annexation in 1975. In the 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish, both sides showed military restraint and it was a bloodless conflict. In 2017 the two countries once again were involved in a military standoff, in which several troops were injured. In 2020, soldiers were killed in skirmishes for the first time since the war ended. In 2022, dozens of Chinese and Indian soldiers were injured after a clash in Yangtse between both countries.

=== Impacts in Pakistan ===

After the Sino-Indian border war, Pakistan established close military and strategic relations with China and signed the Sino-Pakistan Agreement to delineate the Sino-Pakistan border.

In the aftermath of India&#x27;s defeat the United States shipped arms to India, which prompted a cooling off in Pakistan-United States relations. The United States did not provide advance notice to Pakistan of the arms&#x27; shipment and ignored Pakistan&#x27;s concerns that these arms might be used by India against Pakistan. Additionally, Ayub Khan was disappointed that Pakistan&#x27;s decision not to take advantage of Indian vulnerabilities during its war with China was not rewarded with serious United States efforts in negotiations to settle the Kashmir dispute. Convinced that diplomatic solutions would not favor Pakistan, Pakistan launched &quot;Operation Gibraltar&quot; against India, which escalated to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, with results favoring India.

== Diplomatic process ==
In 1993 and 1996, the two sides signed the Sino-Indian Bilateral Peace and Tranquility Accords, agreements to maintain peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual Control. Ten meetings of a Sino-Indian Joint Working Group (SIJWG) and five of an expert group have taken place to determine where the LoAC lies, but little progress has occurred.

On 20 November 2006, Indian politicians from Arunachal Pradesh expressed their concern over Chinese military modernization and appealed to parliament to take a harder stance on the PRC following a military buildup on the border similar to that in 1962. Additionally, China&#x27;s military aid to Pakistan as well is a matter of concern to the Indian public, as the two sides have engaged in various wars.

On 6 July 2006, the historic Silk Road passing through this territory via the Nathu La pass was reopened. Both sides have agreed to resolve the issues by peaceful means.

In October 2011, it was stated that India and China will formulate a border mechanism to handle different perceptions as to the Line of Actual Control and resume the bilateral army exercises between the Indian and Chinese army from early 2012.

== Military awards ==

== In popular culture ==

Pearl S. Buck&#x27;s &quot;Mandala&quot; has an account of the war and the predicament of the Indian government and the army in the face of the better-equipped and organised Chinese forces. The central character in the novel, a Maharana of Mewar, has his son fighting the Chinese in the war and dies in the battle of Chushul. Australian author Jon Cleary wrote a novel set during the conflict, &quot;The Pulse of Danger&quot; (1966).

In 1963, against the backdrop of the Sino-Indian War, Lata Mangeshkar sang the patriotic song &quot;Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo (literally, &quot;Oh, the People of My Country&quot;) in the presence of Nehru. The song, composed by C. Ramchandra and written by Pradeep, is said to have brought the Prime Minister to tears.

Depictions of the 1962 war in Indian cinema include: &quot;Haqeeqat&quot; (1964), &quot;Ratha Thilagam&quot; (1963), &quot;1962: My Country Land&quot; (2016), &quot;Tubelight&quot; (2017), &quot;72 Hours: Martyr Who Never Died&quot; (2019) based on the life of Jaswant Singh Rawat, &quot;Subedar Joginder Singh&quot; (2017) about soldier Joginder Singh. &quot;Paltan&quot; (2018) is based on the later 1967 Nathu La and Cho La clashes along the Sikkim border and is set just after 1962 war.

&quot;1962: The War in the Hills&quot; is a 2021 Indian web series based on the Battle of Rezang La during the war. It released on Hotstar, with its release being advanced due to the 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in ring theory, the simple modules over a ring &quot;R&quot; are the (left or right) modules over &quot;R&quot; that are non-zero and have no non-zero proper submodules. Equivalently, a module &quot;M&quot; is simple if and only if every cyclic submodule generated by a element of &quot;M&quot; equals &quot;M&quot;. Simple modules form building blocks for the modules of finite length, and they are analogous to the simple groups in group theory.

In this article, all modules will be assumed to be right unital modules over a ring &quot;R&quot;.

== Examples ==
Z-modules are the same as abelian groups, so a simple Z-module is an abelian group which has no non-zero proper subgroups. These are the cyclic groups of prime order.

If &quot;I&quot; is a right ideal of &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;I&quot; is simple as a right module if and only if &quot;I&quot; is a minimal non-zero right ideal: If &quot;M&quot; is a non-zero proper submodule of &quot;I&quot;, then it is also a right ideal, so &quot;I&quot; is not minimal. Conversely, if &quot;I&quot; is not minimal, then there is a non-zero right ideal &quot;J&quot; properly contained in &quot;I&quot;. &quot;J&quot; is a right submodule of &quot;I&quot;, so &quot;I&quot; is not simple.

If &quot;I&quot; is a right ideal of &quot;R&quot;, then the quotient module &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is simple if and only if &quot;I&quot; is a maximal right ideal: If &quot;M&quot; is a non-zero proper submodule of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;, then the preimage of &quot;M&quot; under the quotient map is a right ideal which is not equal to &quot;R&quot; and which properly contains &quot;I&quot;. Therefore, &quot;I&quot; is not maximal. Conversely, if &quot;I&quot; is not maximal, then there is a right ideal &quot;J&quot; properly containing &quot;I&quot;. The quotient map has a non-zero kernel which is not equal to , and therefore is not simple.

Every simple &quot;R&quot;-module is isomorphic to a quotient &quot;R&quot;/&quot;m&quot; where &quot;m&quot; is a maximal right ideal of &quot;R&quot;. By the above paragraph, any quotient &quot;R&quot;/&quot;m&quot; is a simple module. Conversely, suppose that &quot;M&quot; is a simple &quot;R&quot;-module. Then, for any non-zero element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;M&quot;, the cyclic submodule &quot;xR&quot; must equal &quot;M&quot;. Fix such an &quot;x&quot;. The statement that &quot;xR&quot; = &quot;M&quot; is equivalent to the surjectivity of the homomorphism that sends &quot;r&quot; to &quot;xr&quot;. The kernel of this homomorphism is a right ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, and a standard theorem states that &quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;. By the above paragraph, we find that &quot;I&quot; is a maximal right ideal. Therefore, &quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to a quotient of &quot;R&quot; by a maximal right ideal.

If &quot;k&quot; is a field and &quot;G&quot; is a group, then a group representation of &quot;G&quot; is a left module over the group ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] (for details, see the main page on this relationship). The simple &quot;k&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-modules are also known as irreducible representations. A major aim of representation theory is to understand the irreducible representations of groups.

== Basic properties of simple modules ==
The simple modules are precisely the modules of length 1; this is a reformulation of the definition.

Every simple module is indecomposable, but the converse is in general not true.

Every simple module is cyclic, that is it is generated by one element.

Not every module has a simple submodule; consider for instance the Z-module Z in light of the first example above.

Let &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; be (left or right) modules over the same ring, and let be a module homomorphism. If &quot;M&quot; is simple, then &quot;f&quot; is either the zero homomorphism or injective because the kernel of &quot;f&quot; is a submodule of &quot;M&quot;. If &quot;N&quot; is simple, then &quot;f&quot; is either the zero homomorphism or surjective because the image of &quot;f&quot; is a submodule of &quot;N&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; = &quot;N&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; is an endomorphism of &quot;M&quot;, and if &quot;M&quot; is simple, then the prior two statements imply that &quot;f&quot; is either the zero homomorphism or an isomorphism. Consequently, the endomorphism ring of any simple module is a division ring. This result is known as Schur&#x27;s lemma.

The converse of Schur&#x27;s lemma is not true in general. For example, the Z-module Q is not simple, but its endomorphism ring is isomorphic to the field Q.

== Simple modules and composition series ==

If &quot;M&quot; is a module which has a non-zero proper submodule &quot;N&quot;, then there is a short exact sequence
:formula_1
A common approach to proving a fact about &quot;M&quot; is to show that the fact is true for the center term of a short exact sequence when it is true for the left and right terms, then to prove the fact for &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot;/&quot;N&quot;. If &quot;N&quot; has a non-zero proper submodule, then this process can be repeated. This produces a chain of submodules
:formula_2
In order to prove the fact this way, one needs conditions on this sequence and on the modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; /&quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; +&amp;hairsp;1. One particularly useful condition is that the length of the sequence is finite and each quotient module &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; /&quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; +&amp;hairsp;1 is simple. In this case the sequence is called a composition series for &quot;M&quot;. In order to prove a statement inductively using composition series, the statement is first proved for simple modules, which form the base case of the induction, and then the statement is proved to remain true under an extension of a module by a simple module. For example, the Fitting lemma shows that the endomorphism ring of a finite length indecomposable module is a local ring, so that the strong Krull–Schmidt theorem holds and the category of finite length modules is a Krull-Schmidt category.

The Jordan–Hölder theorem and the Schreier refinement theorem describe the relationships amongst all composition series of a single module. The Grothendieck group ignores the order in a composition series and views every finite length module as a formal sum of simple modules. Over semisimple rings, this is no loss as every module is a semisimple module and so a direct sum of simple modules. Ordinary character theory provides better arithmetic control, and uses simple C&quot;G&quot; modules to understand the structure of finite groups &quot;G&quot;. Modular representation theory uses Brauer characters to view modules as formal sums of simple modules, but is also interested in how those simple modules are joined together within composition series. This is formalized by studying the Ext functor and describing the module category in various ways including quivers (whose nodes are the simple modules and whose edges are composition series of non-semisimple modules of length 2) and Auslander–Reiten theory where the associated graph has a vertex for every indecomposable module.

== The Jacobson density theorem ==

An important advance in the theory of simple modules was the Jacobson density theorem. The Jacobson density theorem states:
:Let &quot;U&quot; be a simple right &quot;R&quot;-module and let &quot;D&quot; = End&quot;R&quot;(&quot;U&quot;). Let &quot;A&quot; be any &quot;D&quot;-linear operator on &quot;U&quot; and let &quot;X&quot; be a finite &quot;D&quot;-linearly independent subset of &quot;U&quot;. Then there exists an element &quot;r&quot; of &quot;R&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;⋅&quot;A&quot; = &quot;x&quot;⋅&quot;r&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.
In particular, any primitive ring may be viewed as (that is, isomorphic to) a ring of &quot;D&quot;-linear operators on some &quot;D&quot;-space.

A consequence of the Jacobson density theorem is Wedderburn&#x27;s theorem; namely that any right Artinian simple ring is isomorphic to a full matrix ring of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices over a division ring for some &quot;n&quot;. This can also be established as a corollary of the Artin–Wedderburn theorem.

<text>Sonar (sound navigation and ranging or sonic navigation and ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, measure distances (ranging), communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.

&quot;Sonar&quot; can refer to one of two types of technology: &quot;passive&quot; sonar means listening for the sound made by vessels; &quot;active&quot; sonar means emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of &quot;targets&quot; in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used for robot navigation, and sodar (an upward-looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term &quot;sonar&quot; is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.

The first recorded use of the technique was in 1490 by Leonardo da Vinci, who used a tube inserted into the water to detect vessels by ear. It was developed during World War I to counter the growing threat of submarine warfare, with an operational passive sonar system in use by 1918. Modern active sonar systems use an acoustic transducer to generate a sound wave which is reflected from target objects.

== History ==
Although some animals (dolphins, bats, some shrews, and others) have used sound for communication and object detection for millions of years, use by humans in the water was initially recorded by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490: a tube inserted into the water was said to be used to detect vessels by placing an ear to the tube.

In the late 19th century, an underwater bell was used as an ancillary to lighthouses or lightships to provide warning of hazards.

The use of sound to &quot;echo-locate&quot; underwater in the same way as bats use sound for aerial navigation seems to have been prompted by the disaster of 1912. The world&#x27;s first patent for an underwater echo-ranging device was filed at the British Patent Office by English meteorologist Lewis Fry Richardson a month after the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot;, and a German physicist Alexander Behm obtained a patent for an echo sounder in 1913.

The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden, while working for the Submarine Signal Company in Boston, Massachusetts, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue Cutter &quot;Miami&quot; on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. In that test, Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding, underwater communications (Morse code) and echo ranging (detecting an iceberg at a range). The &quot;Fessenden oscillator&quot;, operated at about 500 Hz frequency, was unable to determine the bearing of the iceberg due to the 3-metre wavelength and the small dimension of the transducer&#x27;s radiating face (less than wavelength in diameter). The ten Montreal-built British H-class submarines launched in 1915 were equipped with Fessenden oscillators.

During World War I the need to detect submarines prompted more research into the use of sound. The British made early use of underwater listening devices called hydrophones, while the French physicist Paul Langevin, working with a Russian immigrant electrical engineer Constantin Chilowsky, worked on the development of active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915. Although piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used, this work influenced future designs. Lightweight sound-sensitive plastic film and fibre optics have been used for hydrophones, while Terfenol-D and lead magnesium niobate (PMN) have been developed for projectors.

=== ASDIC ===

In 1916, under the British Board of Invention and Research, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle took on the active sound detection project with A. B. Wood, producing a prototype for testing in mid-1917. This work for the Anti-Submarine Division of the British Naval Staff was undertaken in utmost secrecy, and used quartz piezoelectric crystals to produce the world&#x27;s first practical underwater active sound detection apparatus. To maintain secrecy, no mention of sound experimentation or quartz was made – the word used to describe the early work (&quot;supersonics&quot;) was changed to &quot;ASD&quot;ics, and the quartz material to : &quot;ASD&quot; for &quot;Anti-Submarine Division&quot;, hence the British acronym &quot;ASDIC&quot;. In 1939, in response to a question from the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the Admiralty made up the story that it stood for &quot;Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee&quot;, and this is still widely believed, though no committee bearing this name has been found in the Admiralty archives.

By 1918, Britain and France had built prototype active systems. The British tested their ASDIC on in 1920 and started production in 1922. The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC-equipped vessels in 1923. An anti-submarine school HMS &quot;Osprey&quot; and a training flotilla of four vessels were established on Portland in 1924.

By the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines, incorporated into a complete anti-submarine system. The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hampered by the use of the depth charge as an anti-submarine weapon. This required an attacking vessel to pass over a submerged contact before dropping charges over the stern, resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack. The hunter was effectively firing blind, during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action. This situation was remedied with new tactics and new weapons.

The tactical improvements developed by Frederic John Walker included the creeping attack. Two anti-submarine ships were needed for this (usually sloops or corvettes). The &quot;directing ship&quot; tracked the target submarine on ASDIC from a position about 1500 to 2000 yards behind the submarine. The second ship, with her ASDIC turned off and running at 5 knots, started an attack from a position between the directing ship and the target. This attack was controlled by radio telephone from the directing ship, based on their ASDIC and the range (by rangefinder) and bearing of the attacking ship. As soon as the depth charges had been released, the attacking ship left the immediate area at full speed. The directing ship then entered the target area and also released a pattern of depth charges. The low speed of the approach meant the submarine could not predict when depth charges were going to be released. Any evasive action was detected by the directing ship and steering orders to the attacking ship given accordingly. The low speed of the attack had the advantage that the German acoustic torpedo was not effective against a warship travelling so slowly. A variation of the creeping attack was the &quot;plaster&quot; attack, in which three attacking ships working in a close line abreast were directed over the target by the directing ship.

The new weapons to deal with the ASDIC blind spot were &quot;ahead-throwing weapons&quot;, such as Hedgehogs and later Squids, which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and still in ASDIC contact. These allowed a single escort to make better aimed attacks on submarines. Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets that used several different shapes of beam, continuously covering blind spots. Later, acoustic torpedoes were used.

Early in World War II (September 1940), British ASDIC technology was transferred for free to the United States. Research on ASDIC and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US. Many new types of military sound detection were developed. These included sonobuoys, first developed by the British in 1944 under the codename &quot;High Tea&quot;, dipping/dunking sonar and mine-detection sonar. This work formed the basis for post-war developments related to countering the nuclear submarine.

=== SONAR ===
During the 1930s American engineers developed their own underwater sound-detection technology, and important discoveries were made, such as the existence of thermoclines and their effects on sound waves. Americans began to use the term &quot;SONAR&quot; for their systems, coined by Frederick Hunt to be the equivalent of RADAR.

=== US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory ===
In 1917, the US Navy acquired J. Warren Horton&#x27;s services for the first time. On leave from Bell Labs, he served the government as a technical expert, first at the experimental station at Nahant, Massachusetts, and later at US Naval Headquarters, in London, England. At Nahant he applied the newly developed vacuum tube, then associated with the formative stages of the field of applied science now known as electronics, to the detection of underwater signals. As a result, the carbon button microphone, which had been used in earlier detection equipment, was replaced by the precursor of the modern hydrophone. Also during this period, he experimented with methods for towing detection. This was due to the increased sensitivity of his device. The principles are still used in modern towed sonar systems.

To meet the defense needs of Great Britain, he was sent to England to install in the Irish Sea bottom-mounted hydrophones connected to a shore listening post by submarine cable. While this equipment was being loaded on the cable-laying vessel, World War I ended and Horton returned home.

During World War II, he continued to develop sonar systems that could detect submarines, mines, and torpedoes. He published &quot;Fundamentals of Sonar&quot; in 1957 as chief research consultant at the US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory. He held this position until 1959 when he became technical director, a position he held until mandatory retirement in 1963.

=== Materials and designs in the US and Japan ===
There was little progress in US sonar from 1915 to 1940. In 1940, US sonars typically consisted of a magnetostrictive transducer and an array of nickel tubes connected to a 1-foot-diameter steel plate attached back-to-back to a Rochelle salt crystal in a spherical housing. This assembly penetrated the ship hull and was manually rotated to the desired angle. The piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystal had better parameters, but the magnetostrictive unit was much more reliable. High losses to US merchant supply shipping early in World War II led to large scale high priority US research in the field, pursuing both improvements in magnetostrictive transducer parameters and Rochelle salt reliability. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP), a superior alternative, was found as a replacement for Rochelle salt; the first application was a replacement of the 24 kHz Rochelle-salt transducers. Within nine months, Rochelle salt was obsolete. The ADP manufacturing facility grew from few dozen personnel in early 1940 to several thousands in 1942.

One of the earliest application of ADP crystals were hydrophones for acoustic mines; the crystals were specified for low-frequency cutoff at 5 Hz, withstanding mechanical shock for deployment from aircraft from , and ability to survive neighbouring mine explosions. One of key features of ADP reliability is its zero aging characteristics; the crystal keeps its parameters even over prolonged storage.

Another application was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were mounted on the torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar – a transducer was added to the torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.

Passive sonar arrays for submarines were developed from ADP crystals. Several crystal assemblies were arranged in a steel tube, vacuum-filled with castor oil, and sealed. The tubes then were mounted in parallel arrays.

The standard US Navy scanning sonar at the end of World War II operated at 18 kHz, using an array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5 kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array&#x27;s performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and &quot;expendable modular design&quot;, sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.

The Imperial Japanese Navy at the onset of World War II used projectors based on quartz. These were big and heavy, especially if designed for lower frequencies; the one for Type 91 set, operating at 9 kHz, had a diameter of and was driven by an oscillator with 5 kW power and 7 kV of output amplitude. The Type 93 projectors consisted of solid sandwiches of quartz, assembled into spherical cast iron bodies. The Type 93 sonars were later replaced with Type 3, which followed German design and used magnetostrictive projectors; the projectors consisted of two rectangular identical independent units in a cast-iron rectangular body about . The exposed area was half the wavelength wide and three wavelengths high. The magnetostrictive cores were made from 4 mm stampings of nickel, and later of an iron-aluminium alloy with aluminium content between 12.7% and 12.9%. The power was provided from a 2 kW at 3.8 kV, with polarization from a 20 V, 8 A DC source.

The passive hydrophones of the Imperial Japanese Navy were based on moving-coil design, Rochelle salt piezo transducers, and carbon microphones.

=== Later developments in transducers ===
Magnetostrictive transducers were pursued after World War II as an alternative to piezoelectric ones. Nickel scroll-wound ring transducers were used for high-power low-frequency operations, with size up to in diameter, probably the largest individual sonar transducers ever. The advantage of metals is their high tensile strength and low input electrical impedance, but they have electrical losses and lower coupling coefficient than PZT, whose tensile strength can be increased by prestressing. Other materials were also tried; nonmetallic ferrites were promising for their low electrical conductivity resulting in low eddy current losses, Metglas offered high coupling coefficient, but they were inferior to PZT overall. In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent of these improved magnetostrictive materials is Galfenol.

Other types of transducers include variable-reluctance (or moving-armature, or electromagnetic) transducers, where magnetic force acts on the surfaces of gaps, and moving coil (or electrodynamic) transducers, similar to conventional speakers; the latter are used in underwater sound calibration, due to their very low resonance frequencies and flat broadband characteristics above them.

== Active sonar ==


Active sonar uses a sound transmitter (or projector) and a receiver. When the two are in the same place it is monostatic operation. When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation. When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation. Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically.

Active sonar creates a pulse of sound, often called a &quot;ping&quot;, and then listens for reflections (echo) of the pulse. This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector consisting of a signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer/array. A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals (&quot;pings&quot;). A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the electro-acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system. Occasionally, the acoustic pulse may be created by other means, e.g. chemically using explosives, airguns or plasma sound sources.

To measure the distance to an object, the time from transmission of a pulse to reception is measured and converted into a range using the known speed of sound. To measure the bearing, several hydrophones are used, and the set measures the relative arrival time to each, or with an array of hydrophones, by measuring the relative amplitude in beams formed through a process called beamforming. Use of an array reduces the spatial response so that to provide wide cover multibeam systems are used. The target signal (if present) together with noise is then passed through various forms of signal processing, which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement. It is then presented to some form of decision device that calls the output either the required signal or noise. This decision device may be an operator with headphones or a display, or in more sophisticated sonars this function may be carried out by software. Further processes may be carried out to classify the target and localise it, as well as measuring its velocity.

The pulse may be at constant frequency or a chirp of changing frequency (to allow pulse compression on reception). Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement, while more complex ones generally include the latter technique. Since digital processing became available pulse compression has usually been implemented using digital correlation techniques. Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all-round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc, although the beam may be rotated, relatively slowly, by mechanical scanning.

Particularly when single frequency transmissions are used, the Doppler effect can be used to measure the radial speed of a target. The difference in frequency between the transmitted and received signal is measured and converted into a velocity. Since Doppler shifts can be introduced by either receiver or target motion, allowance has to be made for the radial speed of the searching platform.

One useful small sonar is similar in appearance to a waterproof flashlight. The head is pointed into the water, a button is pressed, and the device displays the distance to the target. Another variant is a &quot;fishfinder&quot; that shows a small display with shoals of fish. Some civilian sonars (which are not designed for stealth) approach active military sonars in capability, with three-dimensional displays of the area near the boat.

When active sonar is used to measure the distance from the transducer to the bottom, it is known as echo sounding. Similar methods may be used looking upward for wave measurement.

Active sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.

In combat situations, an active pulse can be detected by an enemy and will reveal a submarine&#x27;s position at twice the maximum distance that the submarine can itself detect a contact and give clues as to the submarine&#x27;s identity based on the characteristics of the outgoing ping. For these reasons, active sonar is not frequently used by military submarines.

A very directional, but low-efficiency, type of sonar (used by fisheries, military, and for port security) makes use of a complex nonlinear feature of water known as non-linear sonar, the virtual transducer being known as a &quot;parametric array&quot;.

=== Project Artemis ===
Project Artemis was an experimental research and development project in the late 1950s to mid 1960s to examine acoustic propagation and signal processing for a low-frequency active sonar system that might be used for ocean surveillance. A secondary objective was examination of engineering problems of fixed active bottom systems. The receiving array was located on the slope of Plantagnet Bank off Bermuda. The active source array was deployed from the converted World War II tanker . Elements of Artemis were used experimentally after the main experiment was terminated.

=== Transponder ===
This is an active sonar device that receives a specific stimulus and immediately (or with a delay) retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one. Transponders can be used to remotely activate or recover subsea equipment.

=== Performance prediction ===
A sonar target is small relative to the sphere, centred around the emitter, on which it is located. Therefore, the power of the reflected signal is very low, several orders of magnitude less than the original signal. Even if the reflected signal was of the same power, the following example (using hypothetical values) shows the problem: Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10,000 W/m2 signal at 1 m, and detecting a 0.001 W/m2 signal. At 100 m the signal will be 1 W/m2 (due to the inverse-square law). If the entire signal is reflected from a 10 m2 target, it will be at 0.001 W/m2 when it reaches the emitter, i.e. just detectable. However, the original signal will remain above 0.001 W/m2 until 3000 m. Any 10 m2 target between 100 and 3000 m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse, but would not be detected by the emitter. The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes. Since the original signal is much more powerful, it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar (as in the example).

Active sonar have two performance limitations: due to noise and reverberation. In general, one or other of these will dominate, so that the two effects can be initially considered separately.

In noise-limited conditions at initial detection:
:SL − 2PL + TS − (NL − AG) = DT,
where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss (sometimes referred to as transmission loss), TS is the target strength, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain of the receiving array (sometimes approximated by its directivity index) and DT is the detection threshold.

In reverberation-limited conditions at initial detection (neglecting array gain):
:SL − 2PL + TS = RL + DT,
where RL is the reverberation level, and the other factors are as before.

=== Hand-held sonar for use by a diver ===
*The LIMIS (limpet mine imaging sonar) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar for use by a diver. Its name is because it was designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.
*The LUIS (lensing underwater imaging system) is another imaging sonar for use by a diver. 
*There is or was a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers, that merely displays range.
*For the INSS (integrated navigation sonar system)

=== Upward looking sonar ===
An upward looking sonar (ULS) is a sonar device pointed upwards looking towards the surface of the sea. It is used for similar purposes as downward looking sonar, but has some unique applications such as measuring sea ice thickness, roughness and concentration, or measuring air entrainment from bubble plumes during rough seas. Often it is moored on the bottom of the ocean or floats on a taut line mooring at a constant depth of perhaps 100 m. They may also be used by submarines, AUVs, and floats such as the Argo float.

==Passive sonar==

Passive sonar listens without transmitting. It is often employed in military settings, although it is also used in science applications, &quot;e.g.&quot;, detecting fish for presence/absence studies in various aquatic environments – see also passive acoustics and passive radar. In the very broadest usage, this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound, though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment.

===Identifying sound sources===
Passive sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying the source of a detected sound. For example, U.S. vessels usually operate 60 Hertz (Hz) alternating current power systems. If transformers or generators are mounted without proper vibration insulation from the hull or become flooded, the 60 Hz sound from the windings can be emitted from the submarine or ship. This can help to identify its nationality, as all European submarines and nearly every other nation&#x27;s submarine have 50 Hz power systems. Intermittent sound sources (such as a wrench being dropped), called &quot;transients,&quot; may also be detectable to passive sonar. Until fairly recently, an experienced, trained operator identified signals, but now computers may do this.

Passive sonar systems may have large sonic databases, but the sonar operator usually finally classifies the signals manually. A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships, actions (i.e. the speed of a ship, or the type of weapon released and the most effective countermeasures to employ), and even particular ships.

===Noise limitations===
Passive sonar on vehicles is usually severely limited because of noise generated by the vehicle. For this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles&#x27; propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound.

The sonar hydrophones may be towed behind the ship or submarine in order to reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself. Towed units also combat the thermocline, as the unit may be towed above or below the thermocline.

The display of most passive sonars used to be a two-dimensional waterfall display. The horizontal direction of the display is bearing. The vertical is frequency, or sometimes time. Another display technique is to color-code frequency-time information for bearing. More recent displays are generated by the computers, and mimic radar-type plan position indicator displays.

===Performance prediction===
Unlike active sonar, only one-way propagation is involved. Because of the different signal processing used, the minimal detectable signal-to-noise ratio will be different. The equation for determining the performance of a passive sonar is
:SL − PL = NL − AG + DT,
where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain and DT is the detection threshold. The figure of merit of a passive sonar is
:FOM = SL + AG − (NL + DT).

== Performance factors ==
The detection, classification and localisation performance of a sonar depends on the environment and the receiving equipment, as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a passive sonar.

=== Sound propagation ===
Sonar operation is affected by variations in sound speed, particularly in the vertical plane. Sound travels more slowly in fresh water than in sea water, though the difference is small. The speed is determined by the water&#x27;s bulk modulus and mass density. The bulk modulus is affected by temperature, dissolved impurities (usually salinity), and pressure. The density effect is small. The speed of sound (in feet per second) is approximately:

:4388 + (11.25 × temperature (in °F)) + (0.0182 × depth (in feet)) + salinity (in parts-per-thousand ).

This empirically derived approximation equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths. Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make up the rest of the ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, through the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell&#x27;s law.

If the sound source is deep and the conditions are right, propagation may occur in the &#x27;deep sound channel&#x27;. This provides extremely low propagation loss to a receiver in the channel. This is because of sound trapping in the channel with no losses at the boundaries. Similar propagation can occur in the &#x27;surface duct&#x27; under suitable conditions. However, in this case there are reflection losses at the surface.

In shallow water propagation is generally by repeated reflection at the surface and bottom, where considerable losses can occur.

Sound propagation is affected by absorption in the water itself as well as at the surface and bottom. This absorption depends upon frequency, with several different mechanisms in sea water. Long-range sonar uses low frequencies to minimise absorption effects.

The sea contains many sources of noise that interfere with the desired target echo or signature. The main noise sources are waves and shipping. The motion of the receiver through the water can also cause speed-dependent low frequency noise.

===Scattering===

When active sonar is used, scattering occurs from small objects in the sea as well as from the bottom and surface. This can be a major source of interference. This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car&#x27;s headlights in fog: a high-intensity pencil beam will penetrate the fog to some extent, but broader-beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions, much of which is scattered back to the observer, overwhelming that reflected from the target (&quot;white-out&quot;). For analogous reasons active sonar needs to transmit in a narrow beam to minimize scattering.
The scattering of sonar from objects (mines, pipelines, zooplankton, geological features, fish etc.) is how active sonar detects them, but this ability can be masked by strong scattering from false targets, or &#x27;clutter&#x27;. Where they occur (under breaking waves; in ship wakes; in gas emitted from seabed seeps and leaks etc.), gas bubbles are powerful sources of clutter, and can readily hide targets. TWIPS (Twin Inverted Pulse Sonar) is currently the only sonar that can overcome this clutter problem. This is important as many recent conflicts have occurred in coastal waters, and the inability to detect whether mines are present or not present hazards and delays to military vessels, and also to aid convoys and merchant shipping trying to support the region long after the conflict has ceased.

===Target characteristics===
The sound &quot;reflection&quot; characteristics of the target of an active sonar, such as a submarine, are known as its target strength. A complication is that echoes are also obtained from other objects in the sea such as whales, wakes, schools of fish and rocks.

Passive sonar detects the target&#x27;s &quot;radiated&quot; noise characteristics. The radiated spectrum comprises a continuous spectrum of noise with peaks at certain frequencies which can be used for classification.

===Countermeasures===
&quot;Active&quot; (powered) countermeasures may be launched by a vessel under attack to raise the noise level, provide a large false target, and obscure the signature of the vessel itself.

&quot;Passive&quot; (i.e., non-powered) countermeasures include:
* Mounting noise-generating devices on isolating devices.
* Sound-absorbent coatings on the hulls of submarines, for example anechoic tiles.

== Military applications ==
Modern naval warfare makes extensive use of both passive and active sonar from water-borne vessels, aircraft and fixed installations. Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect.

The use of active sonar by a submarine to determine bearing is extremely rare and will not necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates that it is more important to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave&#x27;s energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.

Since active sonar reveals the presence and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods to minimize the risk of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft&#x27;s patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.

Passive sonar has several advantages, most importantly that it is silent. If the target radiated noise level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending on the level of noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar &quot;sees&quot; around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270°, centered on the ship&#x27;s alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160° on each side, and the towed array of a full 360°. The invisible areas are due to the ship&#x27;s own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as &quot;acoustic intelligence&quot; or ACINT.

Another use of passive sonar is to determine the target&#x27;s trajectory. This process is called target motion analysis (TMA), and the resultant &quot;solution&quot; is the target&#x27;s range, course, and speed. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator&#x27;s own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases.

Passive sonar is stealthy and very useful. However, it requires high-tech electronic components and is costly. It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance detection. Surface ships use it to good effect; it is even better used by submarines, and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters, mostly to a &quot;surprise effect&quot;, since submarines can hide under thermal layers. If a submarine&#x27;s commander believes he is alone, he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect, or go deeper and faster, and thus make more sound.

Examples of sonar applications in military use are given below. Many of the civil uses given in the following section may also be applicable to naval use.

=== Anti-submarine warfare ===

Until recently, ship sonars were usually made with hull mounted arrays, either amidships or at the bow. It was soon found after their initial use that a means of reducing flow noise was required. The first were made of canvas on a framework, then steel ones were used. Now domes are usually made of reinforced plastic or pressurized rubber. Such sonars are primarily active in operation. An example of a conventional hull mounted sonar is the SQS-56.

Because of the problems of ship noise, towed sonars are also used. These have the advantage of being able to be placed deeper in the water, but have limitations on their use in shallow water. These are called towed arrays (linear) or variable depth sonars (VDS) with 2/3D arrays. A problem is that the winches required to deploy/recover them are large and expensive. VDS sets are primarily active in operation, while towed arrays are passive.

An example of a modern active-passive ship towed sonar is Sonar 2087 made by Thales Underwater Systems.

=== Torpedoes ===
Modern torpedoes are generally fitted with an active/passive sonar. This may be used to home directly on the target, but wake homing torpedoes are also used. An early example of an acoustic homer was the Mark 37 torpedo.

Torpedo countermeasures can be towed or free. An early example was the German &quot;Sieglinde&quot; device while the &quot;Bold&quot; was a chemical device. A widely used US device was the towed AN/SLQ-25 Nixie while the mobile submarine simulator (MOSS) was a free device. A modern alternative to the Nixie system is the UK Royal Navy S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence system.

=== Mines ===
Mines may be fitted with a sonar to detect, localize and recognize the required target. An example is the CAPTOR mine.

=== Mine countermeasures ===
Mine countermeasure (MCM) sonar, sometimes called &quot;mine and obstacle avoidance sonar (MOAS)&quot;, is a specialized type of sonar used for detecting small objects. Most MCM sonars are hull mounted but a few types are VDS design. An example of a hull mounted MCM sonar is the Type 2193 while the SQQ-32 mine-hunting sonar and Type 2093 systems are VDS designs.

=== Submarine navigation ===

Submarines rely on sonar to a greater extent than surface ships as they cannot use radar in water. The sonar arrays may be hull mounted or towed. Information fitted on typical fits is given in and .

=== Aircraft ===
Helicopters can be used for antisubmarine warfare by deploying fields of active-passive sonobuoys or can operate dipping sonar, such as the AQS-13. Fixed wing aircraft can also deploy sonobuoys and have greater endurance and capacity to deploy them. Processing from the sonobuoys or dipping sonar can be on the aircraft or on ship. Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions. Helicopters have also been used for mine countermeasure missions using towed sonars such as the AQS-20A.

===Underwater communications===
Dedicated sonars can be fitted to ships and submarines for underwater communication.

===Ocean surveillance===
The United States began a system of passive, fixed ocean surveillance systems in 1950 with the classified name Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) with American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), with its Bell Laboratories research and Western Electric manufacturing entities being contracted for development and installation. The systems exploited the SOFAR channel, also known as the deep sound channel, where a sound speed minimum creates a waveguide in which low frequency sound travels thousands of miles. Analysis was based on an AT&amp;T sound spectrograph, which converted sound into a visual spectrogram representing a time–frequency analysis of sound that was developed for speech analysis and modified to analyze low-frequency underwater sounds. That process was Low Frequency Analysis and Recording and the equipment was termed the Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder, both with the acronym LOFAR. LOFAR research was termed &quot;Jezebel&quot; and led to usage in air and surface systems, particularly sonobuoys using the process and sometimes using &quot;Jezebel&quot; in their name. The proposed system offered such promise of long-range submarine detection that the Navy ordered immediate moves for implementation.
Between installation of a test array followed by a full scale, forty element, prototype operational array in 1951 and 1958 systems were installed in the Atlantic and then the Pacific under the unclassified name &quot;Project Caesar&quot;. The original systems were terminated at classified shore stations designated Naval Facility (NAVFAC) explained as engaging in &quot;ocean research&quot; to cover their classified mission. The system was upgraded multiple times with more advanced cable allowing the arrays to be installed in ocean basins and upgraded processing. The shore stations were eliminated in a process of consolidation and rerouting the arrays to central processing centers into the 1990s. In 1985, with new mobile arrays and other systems becoming operational the collective system name was changed to Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). In 1991 the mission of the system was declassified. The year before IUSS insignia were authorized for wear. Access was granted to some systems for scientific research.

A similar system is believed to have been operated by the Soviet Union.

===Underwater security===

Sonar can be used to detect frogmen and other scuba divers. This can be applicable around ships or at entrances to ports. Active sonar can also be used as a deterrent and/or disablement mechanism. One such device is the Cerberus system.

=== Hand-held sonar ===
Limpet mine imaging sonar (LIMIS) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.

The LUIS is another imaging sonar for use by a diver.

Integrated navigation sonar system (INSS) is a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers that displays range.

=== Intercept sonar ===
This is a sonar designed to detect and locate the transmissions from hostile active sonars. An example of this is the Type 2082 fitted on the British s.

== Civilian applications ==
=== Fisheries ===

Fishing is an important industry that is seeing growing demand, but world catch tonnage is falling as a result of serious resource problems. The industry faces a future of continuing worldwide consolidation until a point of sustainability can be reached. However, the consolidation of the fishing fleets are driving increased demands for sophisticated fish finding electronics such as sensors, sounders and sonars. Historically, fishermen have used many different techniques to find and harvest fish. However, acoustic technology has been one of the most important driving forces behind the development of the modern commercial fisheries.

Sound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish&#x27;s air-filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition.
Companies such as eSonar, Raymarine, Marport Canada, Wesmar, Furuno, Krupp, and Simrad make a variety of sonar and acoustic instruments for the deep sea commercial fishing industry. For example, net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel. Each sensor is equipped with one or more acoustic transducers depending on its specific function. Data is transmitted from the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone. The analog signals are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for graphical display on a high resolution monitor.

===Echo sounding===

Echo sounding is a process used to determine the depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water (averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.

The value of underwater acoustics to the fishing industry has led to the development of other acoustic instruments that operate in a similar fashion to echo-sounders but, because their function is slightly different from the initial model of the echo-sounder, have been given different terms.

=== Net location ===
The net sounder is an echo sounder with a transducer mounted on the headline of the net rather than on the bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case, there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable-less net-sounder – such as Marport&#x27;s Trawl Explorer – in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver-hydrophone on the vessel. In this case, no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.

The display on a net sounder shows the distance of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder&#x27;s hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.

Modern versions of the net sounder, using multiple element transducers, function more like a sonar than an echo sounder and show slices of the area in front of the net and not merely the vertical view that the initial net sounders used.

The sonar is an echo-sounder with a directional capability that can show fish or other objects around the vessel.

=== ROV and UUV ===
Small sonars have been fitted to remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) to allow their operation in murky conditions. These sonars are used for looking ahead of the vehicle. The Long-Term Mine Reconnaissance System is a UUV for MCM purposes.

=== Vehicle location ===
Sonars which act as beacons are fitted to aircraft to allow their location in the event of a crash in the sea. Short and long baseline sonars may be used for caring out the location, such as LBL.

=== Prosthesis for the visually impaired ===
In 2013 an inventor in the United States unveiled a &quot;spider-sense&quot; bodysuit, equipped with ultrasonic sensors and haptic feedback systems, which alerts the wearer of incoming threats; allowing them to respond to attackers even when blindfolded.

== Scientific applications ==
=== Biomass estimation ===

Detection of fish, and other marine and aquatic life, and estimation their individual sizes or total biomass using active sonar techniques. Sound pulses reflect off any object that has a different density than the surrounding medium. This includes fish, or more specifically, the air-filled swim bladder on fish. These echoes provide information on fish size, location, abundance and behavior. This is especially effective for fish swim bladders (e.g. herring, cod, and pollock), and less useful for fish without them (e.g. sharks, mackerel, and flounder). Data from the watercolumn is usually processed differently than seafloor or object detection data, this data type can be processed with specialized software.

=== Wave measurement ===
An upward looking echo sounder mounted on the bottom or on a platform may be used to make measurements of wave height and period. From this statistics of the surface conditions at a location can be derived.

=== Water velocity measurement ===
Special short range sonars have been developed to allow measurements of water velocity.

=== Bottom type assessment ===
Sonars have been developed that can be used to characterise the sea bottom into, for example, mud, sand, and gravel. Relatively simple sonars such as echo sounders can be promoted to seafloor classification systems via add-on modules, converting echo parameters into sediment type. Different algorithms exist, but they are all based on changes in the energy or shape of the reflected sounder pings. Advanced substrate classification analysis can be achieved using calibrated (scientific) echosounders and parametric or fuzzy-logic analysis of the acoustic data.

=== Bathymetric mapping ===
Side-scan sonars can be used to derive maps of seafloor topography (bathymetry) by moving the sonar across it just above the bottom. Low frequency sonars such as GLORIA have been used for continental shelf wide surveys while high frequency sonars are used for more detailed surveys of smaller areas.

Hull-mounted multibeam echosounders on large surface vessels produce swathes of bathymetric data in near real time. One example, the General Instrument &quot;Seabeam&quot; system, uses a projector array along the keel to ensonify the bottom with a fan beam. Signals from a hydrophone array mounted athwartships are processed to synthesize multiple virtual fan beams crossing the projector beam at right angles.

===Sonar imaging===
Creating two and three-dimensional images using sonar data.
=== Sub-bottom profiling ===
Powerful low frequency echo-sounders have been developed for providing profiles of the upper layers of the ocean bottom. One of the most recent devices is Innomar&#x27;s SES-2000 quattro multi-transducer parametric SBP, used for example in the Puck Bay for underwater archaeological purposes.

=== Gas leak detection from the seabed ===
Gas bubbles can leak from the seabed, or close to it, from multiple sources. These can be detected by both passive and active sonar (shown in schematic figure by yellow and red systems respectively).
 Natural seeps of methane and carbon dioxide occur. Gas pipelines can leak, and it is important to be able to detect whether leakage occurs from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities (CCSFs; e.g. depleted oil wells into which extracted atmospheric carbon is stored). Quantification of the amount of gas leaking is difficult, and although estimates can be made use active and passive sonar, it is important to question their accuracy because of the assumptions inherent in making such estimations from sonar data.

=== Synthetic aperture sonar ===
Various synthetic aperture sonars have been built in the laboratory and some have entered use in mine-hunting and search systems. An explanation of their operation is given in synthetic aperture sonar.

=== Parametric sonar ===
Parametric sources use the non-linearity of water to generate the difference frequency between two high frequencies. A virtual end-fire array is formed. Such a projector has advantages of broad bandwidth, narrow beamwidth, and when fully developed and carefully measured it has no obvious sidelobes: see Parametric array. Its major disadvantage is very low efficiency of only a few percent. P.J. Westervelt summarizes the trends involved.

=== Sonar in extraterrestrial contexts ===
The use of both active and passive sonar has been proposed for various extraterrestrial environments. One example is Titan, where active sonar could be used to determine the depth of its hydrocarbon seas, and passive sonar could be used to detect methanefalls.

Proposals that do not take proper account of the difference between terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments could lead to erroneous measurements.

== Ecological impact ==

=== Effect on marine mammals ===
Research has shown that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings of marine mammals. Beaked whales, the most common casualty of the strandings, have been shown to be highly sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar. Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee from the source of the sonar, while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins. The US Navy, which part-funded some of the studies, said that the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm, but they &quot;will evaluate the effectiveness of [their] marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings&quot;. A 2008 US Supreme Court ruling on the use of sonar by the US Navy noted that there had been no cases where sonar had been conclusively shown to have harmed or killed a marine mammal.

Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation systems, sometimes called &quot;biosonar&quot; to locate predators and prey. Research on the effects of sonar on blue whales in the Southern California Bight shows that mid-frequency sonar use disrupts the whales&#x27; feeding behavior. This indicates that sonar-induced disruption of feeding and displacement from high-quality prey patches could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on baleen whale foraging ecology, individual fitness and population health.

A review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used was published in 2019. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations. The review suggested the strength of response of individual animals may depend on whether they had prior exposure to sonar, and that symptoms of decompression sickness have been found in stranded whales that may be a result of such response to sonar. It noted that in the Canary Islands where multiple strandings had been previously reported, no more mass strandings had occurred once naval exercises during which sonar was used were banned in the area, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur.

===Effect on fish ===
Low frequency sonar can create a small temporary shift in the hearing threshold of some fish.

== Frequencies and resolutions ==
The frequencies of sonars range from infrasonic to above a megahertz. Generally, the lower frequencies have longer range, while the higher frequencies offer better resolution, and smaller size for a given directionality.

To achieve reasonable directionality, frequencies below 1 kHz generally require large size, usually achieved as towed arrays.

Low frequency sonars are loosely defined as 1–5 kHz, albeit some navies regard 5–7 kHz also as low frequency. Medium frequency is defined as 5–15 kHz. Another style of division considers low frequency to be under 1 kHz, and medium frequency at between 1–10 kHz.

American World War II era sonars operated at a relatively high frequency of 20–30 kHz, to achieve directionality with reasonably small transducers, with typical maximum operational range of 2500 yd. Postwar sonars used lower frequencies to achieve longer range; e.g. SQS-4 operated at 10 kHz with range up to 5000 yd. SQS-26 and SQS-53 operated at 3 kHz with range up to 20,000 yd; their domes had size of approx. a 60-ft personnel boat, an upper size limit for conventional hull sonars. Achieving larger sizes by conformal sonar array spread over the hull has not been effective so far, for lower frequencies linear or towed arrays are therefore used.

Japanese WW2 sonars operated at a range of frequencies. The Type 91, with 30 inch quartz projector, worked at 9 kHz. The Type 93, with smaller quartz projectors, operated at 17.5 kHz (model 5 at 16 or 19 kHz magnetostrictive) at powers between 1.7 and 2.5 kilowatts, with range of up to 6 km. The later Type 3, with German-design magnetostrictive transducers, operated at 13, 14.5, 16, or 20 kHz (by model), using twin transducers (except model 1 which had three single ones), at 0.2 to 2.5 kilowatts. The simple type used 14.5 kHz magnetostrictive transducers at 0.25 kW, driven by capacitive discharge instead of oscillators, with range up to 2.5 km.

The sonar&#x27;s resolution is angular; objects further apart are imaged with lower resolutions than nearby ones.

Another source lists ranges and resolutions vs frequencies for sidescan sonars. 30 kHz provides low resolution with range of 1000–6000 m, 100 kHz gives medium resolution at 500–1000 m, 300 kHz gives high resolution at 150–500 m, and 600 kHz gives high resolution at 75–150 m. Longer range sonars are more adversely affected by nonhomogenities of water. Some environments, typically shallow waters near the coasts, have complicated terrain with many features; higher frequencies become necessary there.

<doc id="29440" wikidata="Q40477" url="?curid=29440" title="Slavs">
<text>The Slavs or Slavic people are groups of people who speak Slavic languages. Slavs are geographically distributed throughout the northern parts of Eurasia; they predominantly inhabit Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Northern Asia, though there is a large Slavic minority scattered across the Baltic states and Central Asia, and a substantial Slavic diaspora in the Americas, Western Europe, and Northern Europe.

Early Slavs lived during the Migration Period and the Early Middle Ages (approximately from the 5th to the 10th century AD), and came to control large parts of Central, Eastern, and Southeast Europe between the sixth and seventh centuries. Beginning in the 7th century, they were gradually Christianized. By the 12th century, they formed the core population of a number of medieval Christian states: East Slavs in the Kievan Rus&#x27;, South Slavs in the Bulgarian Empire, the Principality of Serbia, the Duchy of Croatia and the Banate of Bosnia, and West Slavs in the Principality of Nitra, Great Moravia, the Duchy of Bohemia, and the Kingdom of Poland.

Beginning in the mid-19th century, a pan-Slavic movement has emphasized the common heritage and unity of all the Slavic peoples. The main focus of the movement was in the Balkans, whereas the Russian Empire was opposed to it.

The Slavic languages belong to the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. Present-day Slavs are classified into three groups:
* West Slavs (Czechs, Kashubians, Poles, Silesians, Slovaks, and Sorbs);
* East Slavs (Belarusians, Russians, Rusyns, and Ukrainians);
* South Slavs (Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Croats, Gorani, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Serbs, and Slovenes).

Though the majority of Slavs are Christians, some groups, such as the Bosniaks, mostly identify as Muslims. Modern Slavic nations and ethnic groups are considerably diverse, both genetically and culturally, and relations between them may range from &quot;ethnic solidarity to mutual feelings of hostility&quot; — even within the individual groups.

==Ethnonym==

The oldest mention of the Slavic ethnonym is from the 6th century AD, when Procopius, writing in Byzantine Greek, used various forms such as &quot;Sklaboi&quot; (), &quot;Sklabēnoi&quot; (), &quot;Sklauenoi&quot; (), &quot;Sthlabenoi&quot; (), or &quot;Sklabinoi&quot; (), and his contemporary Jordanes refers to the in Latin. The oldest documents written in Old Church Slavonic, dating from the 9th century, attest the autonym as &quot;Slověne&quot; (). Those forms point back to a Slavic autonym, which can be reconstructed in Proto-Slavic as , plural &quot;Slověne&quot;.

The reconstructed autonym is usually considered a derivation from (&quot;word&quot;), originally denoting &quot;people who speak (the same language)&quot;, meaning &quot;people who understand one another&quot;, in contrast to the Slavic word denoting &quot;German people&quot;, namely , meaning &quot;silent, mute people&quot; (from Slavic &quot;mute, mumbling&quot;). The word &quot;slovo&quot; (&quot;word&quot;) and the related &quot;slava&quot; (&quot;glory, fame&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;hearing&quot;) originate from the Proto-Indo-European root (&quot;be spoken of, glory&quot;), cognate with Ancient Greek ( &quot;fame&quot;), as in the name Pericles, Latin (&quot;be called&quot;), and English .

In medieval and early modern sources written in Latin, Slavs are most commonly referred to as &quot;Sclaveni&quot; or the shortened version &quot;Sclavi&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
====First mentions====


Ancient Roman sources refer to the Early Slavic peoples as &quot;Veneti&quot;, who dwelt in a region of central Europe east of the Germanic tribe of Suebi and west of the Iranian Sarmatians in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, between the upper Vistula and Dnieper rivers. Slavs - called &quot;Antes&quot; and &quot;Sclaveni&quot; - first appear in Byzantine records in the early 6th century AD. Byzantine historiographers of the era of the emperor Justinian I (), such as Procopius of Caesarea, Jordanes and Theophylact Simocatta, describe tribes of these names emerging from the area of the Carpathian Mountains, the lower Danube and the Black Sea to invade the Danubian provinces of the Eastern Empire.

Jordanes, in his work &quot;Getica&quot; (written in 551 AD), describes the Veneti as a &quot;populous nation&quot; whose dwellings begin at the sources of the Vistula and occupy &quot;a great expanse of land&quot;. He also describes the Veneti as the ancestors of Antes and Slaveni, two early Slavic tribes, who appeared on the Byzantine frontier in the early-6th century.

Procopius wrote in 545 that &quot;the Sclaveni and the Antae actually had a single name in the remote past; for they were both called &quot;Sporoi&quot; in olden times&quot;. The name &quot;Sporoi&quot; derives from Greek σπείρω (&quot;to sow&quot;). He described them as barbarians, who lived under democracy and believed in one god, &quot;the maker of lightning&quot; (Perun), to whom they made sacrifice. They lived in scattered housing and constantly changed settlement. In war, they were mainly foot soldiers with shields, spears, bows, and little armour, which was reserved mainly for chiefs and their inner circle of warriors. Their language is &quot;barbarous&quot; (that is, not Greek), and the two tribes are alike in appearance, being tall and robust, &quot;while their bodies and hair are neither very fair or blond, nor indeed do they incline entirely to the dark type, but they are all slightly ruddy in color. And they live a hard life, giving no heed to bodily comforts...&quot;

Jordanes describes the Sclaveni as having swamps and forests for their cities. Another 6th-century source refers to them living among nearly-impenetrable forests, rivers, lakes, and marshes.

Menander Protector mentions Daurentius () who slew an Avar envoy of Khagan Bayan I for asking the Slavs to accept the suzerainty of the Avars; Daurentius declined and is reported as saying: &quot;Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs – so it shall always be for us as long as there are wars and weapons&quot;.

====Migrations====
According to eastern homeland theory, prior to becoming known to the Roman world, Slavic-speaking tribes formed part of successive multi-ethnic confederacies of Eurasia – such as the Sarmatian, Hun and Gothic empires. The Slavs emerged from obscurity when the westward movement of Germanic tribes in the 5th and 6th centuries AD (thought to be in conjunction with the movement of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe: Huns, and later Avars and Bulgars) started the great migration of the Slavs, who settled the lands abandoned by Germanic tribes who had fled from the Huns and their allies. Slavs, according to this account, moved westward into the country between the Oder and the Elbe-Saale line; southward into Bohemia, Moravia, much of present-day Austria, the Pannonian plain and the Balkans; and northward along the upper Dnieper river. It has also been suggested that some Slavs migrated with the Vandals to the Iberian Peninsula and even to North Africa.

Around the 6th century, Slavs appeared on Byzantine borders in large numbers. Byzantine records note that Slav numbers were so great, that grass would not regrow where the Slavs had marched through. Military movements resulted in even the Peloponnese and Asia Minor being reported to have Slavic settlements. This southern movement has traditionally been seen as an invasive expansion. By the end of the 6th century, Slavs had settled the Eastern Alps regions.

Pope Gregory I in 600 AD wrote to Maximus, the bishop of Salona (in Dalmatia), expressing concern about the arrival of the Slavs,

===Middle Ages===
When Slav migrations ended, their first state organizations appeared, each headed by a prince with a treasury and a defense force. In the 7th century, the Frankish merchant Samo supported the Slavs against their Avar rulers and became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe, Samo&#x27;s Empire. This early Slavic polity probably did not outlive its founder and ruler, but it was the foundation for later West Slavic states on its territory.

The oldest of them was Carantania; others are the Principality of Nitra, the Moravian principality (see under Great Moravia) and the Balaton Principality. The First Bulgarian Empire was founded in 681 as an alliance between the ruling Bulgars and the numerous Slavs in the area, and their South Slavic language, the Old Church Slavonic, became the main and official language of the empire in 864 AD. Bulgaria was instrumental in the spread of Slavic literacy and Christianity to the rest of the Slavic world. Duchy of Croatia was founded in 7th century and later became Kingdom of Croatia. Principality of Serbia was founded in 8th, Duchy of Bohemia and Kievan Rus&#x27; both in the 9th century.

The expansion of the Magyars into the Carpathian Basin and the Germanization of Austria gradually separated the South Slavs from the West and East Slavs. Later Slavic states, which formed in the following centuries included the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Poland, Banate of Bosnia, Duklja and Kingdom of Serbia which later grew into Serbian Empire.

=== Modern era ===

Pan-Slavism, a movement which came into prominence in the mid-19th century, emphasized the common heritage and unity of all the Slavic peoples. The main focus was in the Balkans where the South Slavs had been ruled for centuries by other empires: the Byzantine Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Venice. Austro-Hungary envisioned its own political concept of Austro-Slavism, in opposition of Pan-Slavism that was predominantly led by the Russian Empire. 

As of 1878, there were only three majority Slavic states in the world: the Russian Empire, Principality of Serbia and Principality of Montenegro. Bulgaria was effectively independent but was &quot;de jure&quot; vassal to the Ottoman Empire until official independence was declared in 1908. The Slavic peoples who were, for the most part, denied a voice in the affairs of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were calling for national self-determination. 

During World War I, representatives of the Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes set up organizations in the Allied countries to gain sympathy and recognition. In 1918, after World War I ended, the Slavs established such independent states as Czechoslovakia, the Second Polish Republic, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

The first half of the 20th century in Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of wars, famines and other disasters, each accompanied by large-scale population losses. The two major famines were in 1921 to 1922 and 1932 to 1933, which caused millions of deaths mostly around the Volga region, Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus. The latter resulted from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s collectivization of agriculture in Ukraine. 

During the war, Nazi Germany used hundreds of thousands of people for slave labor in their concentration camps, the majority of whom were Jewish or Slavic. Both groups were a part of what Germans claimed to be a &quot;vast racially subhuman surplus population&quot; that they &quot;intended to eliminate in time from their new empire&quot;, their term for &quot;racial subhumans&quot; being &quot;Untermensch&quot;. Thus, one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s ambitions at the start of World War II was to exterminate, expel, or enslave most or all West and East Slavs from their native lands, so as to make &quot;living space&quot; for German settlers.

In early 1941, Germany began planning Generalplan Ost, the genocide of Slavs in Eastern Europe which was supposed to start after a major expansion of German concentration camps in occupied Poland and the fall of Stalin&#x27;s regime. This plan was to be carried out gradually over 25 to 30 years. After an approximate 30 million Slavs would be killed through starvation and their major cities depopulated, the Germans were supposed to repopulate Eastern Europe. In June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, Hitler paused the plan to focus on the extermination of the Jews. However, some of the plan was nonetheless implemented. Millions of Slavs were murdered in Eastern Europe; this includes victims of the Hunger Plan, Germany&#x27;s intentional starvation of the region, as well as the murders of 3.3. million Soviet prisoners of war. Germany&#x27;s Heinrich Himmler also ordered his subordinate Ludolf-Hermann von Alvensleben to start repopulating Crimea, and hundreds of ethnic Germans were forcibly moved to cities and villages there. The Soviet Red Army took back their land from the Germans in 1944. Stephen J. Lee estimates that, by the end of World War II in 1945, the Russian population was about 90 million fewer than it could have been otherwise. 

The ultra-nationalist, fascist Ustaše committed genocide against Serbs during World War II. The Serbian nationalist Chetniks committed genocide against Croats and Bosniaks. Also during World War II, fascist Italy sent tens of thousands of Slavs to concentration camps in mainland Italy, Libya, and the Balkans.

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, and many former Soviet republics became independent countries. Currently, former Soviet states in Central Asia such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have very large minority Slavic populations, with most being Russians. Kazakhstan has the largest Slavic minority population.

==Languages==


Proto-Slavic, the supposed ancestor language of all Slavic languages, is a descendant of common Proto-Indo-European, via a Balto-Slavic stage in which it developed numerous lexical and morphophonological isoglosses with the Baltic languages. In the framework of the Kurgan hypothesis, &quot;the Indo-Europeans who remained after the migrations [from the steppe] became speakers of Balto-Slavic&quot;.

Proto-Slavic is defined as the last stage of the language preceding the geographical split of the historical Slavic languages. That language was uniform, and on the basis of borrowings from foreign languages and Slavic borrowings into other languages, it cannot be said to have any recognizable dialects, which suggests that there was, at one time, a relatively-small Proto-Slavic homeland.

Slavic linguistic unity was to some extent visible as late as Old Church Slavonic (or Old Bulgarian) manuscripts which, though based on local Slavic speech of Thessaloniki, could still serve the purpose of the first common Slavic literary language.

Standardised Slavic languages that have official status in at least one country are: Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, and Ukrainian. Russian is the most spoken Slavic language, and is the most spoken native language in Europe.

The alphabets used for Slavic languages are usually connected to the dominant religion among the respective ethnic groups. Orthodox Christians use the Cyrillic alphabet while Catholics use the Latin alphabet; the Bosniaks, who are Muslim, also use the Latin alphabet and Cyrillic alphabet in Serbia. Additionally, some Eastern Catholics and Western Catholics use the Cyrillic alphabet. Serbian and Montenegrin use both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. There is also a Latin script to write in Belarusian, called Łacinka and in Ukrainian, called Latynka.

==Ethno-cultural subdivisions==
West Slavs originate from early Slavic tribes which settled in Central Europe after the East Germanic tribes had left this area during the migration period. They are noted as having mixed with Germanics, Hungarians, Celts (particularly the Boii), Old Prussians, and the Pannonian Avars. The West Slavs came under the influence of the Western Roman Empire (Latin) and of the Catholic Church.

East Slavs have origins in early Slavic tribes who mixed and contacted with Finns, Balts and with the remnants of the people of the Goths. Their early Slavic component, Antes, mixed or absorbed Iranians, and later received influence from the Khazars and Vikings. The East Slavs trace their national origins to the tribal unions of Kievan Rus&#x27; and Rus&#x27; Khaganate, beginning in the 10th century. They came particularly under the influence of the Byzantine Empire and of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

South Slavs from most of the region have origins in early Slavic tribes who mixed with the local Proto-Balkanic tribes (Illyrian, Dacian, Thracian, Paeonian, Hellenic tribes), and Celtic tribes (particularly the Scordisci), as well as with Romans (and the Romanized remnants of the former groups), and also with remnants of temporarily settled invading East Germanic, Asiatic or Caucasian tribes such as Gepids, Huns, Avars, Goths and Bulgars. The original inhabitants of present-day Slovenia and continental Croatia have origins in early Slavic tribes who mixed with Romans and romanized Celtic and Illyrian people as well as with Avars and Germanic peoples (Lombards and East Goths). The South Slavs (except the Slovenes and Croats) came under the cultural sphere of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), of the Ottoman Empire and of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Islam, while the Slovenes and the Croats were influenced by the Western Roman Empire (Latin) and thus by the Catholic Church in a similar fashion to that of the West Slavs.

==Genetics==
Consistent with the proximity of their languages, analyses of Y chromosomes, mDNA, and autosomal marker CCR5de132 shows that East Slavs and West Slavs are genetically very similar, but demonstrating significant differences from neighboring Finno-Ugric, Turkic, and North Caucasian peoples. Such genetic homogeneity is somewhat unusual, given such a wide dispersal of Slavic populations. Together they form the basis of the &quot;&quot;East European&quot; gene cluster, which also includes non-Slavic Hungarians and Aromanians.

Only Northern Russians among East and West Slavs belong to a different, &quot;Northern European&quot;&quot; genetic cluster, along with Balts, Germanic and Baltic Finnic peoples (Northern Russian populations are very similar to Balts).

The 2006 Y-DNA study results &quot;suggest that the Slavic expansion started from the territory of present-day Ukraine, thus supporting the hypothesis placing the earliest known homeland of Slavs in the basin of the middle Dnieper&quot;. According to genetic studies until 2020, the distribution, variance and frequency of the Y-DNA haplogroups R1a and I2 and their subclades R-M558, R-M458 and I-CTS10228 among South Slavs correlate with the spread of Slavic languages during the medieval Slavic expansion from Eastern Europe, most probably from the territory of present-day Ukraine and Southeastern Poland.

According to a 2017 study, Slavic speakers like Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians have similar genetic components. Ukrainians and Belarusians have near-equal amounts of two &quot;European components&quot;, which are commonly found in North Europe and Caucasus respectively. There is also no evidence of Asian admixture. However, samples of Novosibirsk residents and Old Believers in Siberia have 5-10% Central Siberian ancestry despite being genetically close to European Slavs.

==Religion==
The pagan Slavic populations were Christianized between the 7th and 12th centuries. Orthodox Christianity is predominant among East and South Slavs, while Catholicism is predominant among West Slavs and some western South Slavs. The religious borders are largely comparable to the East–West Schism which began in the 11th century. Islam first arrived in the 7th century during the early Muslim conquests, and was gradually adopted by a number of Slavic ethnic groups through the centuries in the Balkans.

Among Slavic populations who profess a religion, the majority of contemporary Christian Slavs are Orthodox, followed by Catholic. The majority of Muslim Slavs follow the Hanafi school of the Sunni branch of Islam. Religious delineations by nationality can be very sharp; usually in the Slavic ethnic groups, the vast majority of religious people share the same religion.

Mainly Eastern Orthodoxy:
* Russians
* Ukrainians
* Serbs
* Bulgarians
* Belarusians
* Macedonians
* Montenegrins

Mainly Catholicism:
* Poles
* Silesians
* Kashubians
* Gorals
* Czechs (largely irreligious)
* Slovaks

* Sorbs
* Rusyns
* Banat Bulgarians

Mainly Islam:
* Bosniaks
* Pomaks
* Gorani
* Torbeši
* Ethnic Muslims
==Relations with non-Slavic people==
Throughout their history, Slavs came into contact with non-Slavic groups. In the postulated homeland region (present-day Ukraine), they had contacts with the Iranian Sarmatians and the Germanic Goths. After their subsequent spread, the Slavs began assimilating non-Slavic peoples. For example, in the Northern Black Sea region, the Slavs assimilated the remnants of the Goths. In the Balkans, there were Paleo-Balkan peoples, such as Romanized and Hellenized (Jireček Line) Illyrians, Thracians and Dacians, as well as Greeks and Celtic Scordisci and Serdi. Because Slavs were so numerous, most indigenous populations of the Balkans were Slavicized. Thracians and Illyrians mixed as ethnic groups in this period. 

A notable exception is Greece, where Slavs were Hellenized because Greeks were more numerous, especially with more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the influence of the church and administration, however, Slavicized regions within Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia Inferior also had a larger portion of locals compared to migrating Slavs. Other notable exceptions are the territory of present-day Romania and Hungary, where Slavs settled en route to present-day Greece, North Macedonia, Bulgaria and East Thrace but assimilated, and the modern Albanian nation which claims descent from Illyrians and other Balkan tribes.

The status of the Bulgars as a ruling class and their control of the land nominally left their legacy in the Bulgarian country and people, but Bulgars were gradually also Slavicized into the present-day South Slavic ethnic group known as Bulgarians. The Romance speakers within the fortified Dalmatian cities retained their culture and language for a long time. Dalmatian Romance was spoken until the high Middle Ages, but, they too were eventually assimilated into the body of Slavs.

In the Western Balkans, South Slavs and Germanic Gepids intermarried with invaders, eventually producing a Slavicized population. In Central Europe, the West Slavs intermixed with Germanic, Hungarian, and Celtic peoples, while in Eastern Europe the East Slavs had encountered Finnic and Scandinavian peoples. Scandinavians (Varangians) and Finnic peoples were involved in the early formation of the Rus&#x27; state but were completely Slavicized after a century. Some Finno-Ugric tribes in the north were also absorbed into the expanding Rus population. In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Kipchak and the Pecheneg, caused a massive migration of East Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north. In the Middle Ages, groups of Saxon ore miners settled in medieval Bosnia, Serbia and Bulgaria, where they were Slavicized.

&quot;Saqaliba&quot; refers to the Slavic mercenaries and slaves in the medieval Arab world in North Africa, Sicily and Al-Andalus. Saqaliba served as caliph&#x27;s guards. In the 12th century, Slavic piracy in the Baltics increased. The Wendish Crusade was started against the Polabian Slavs in 1147, as a part of the Northern Crusades. The pagan chief of the Slavic Obodrite tribes, Niklot, began his open resistance when Lothar III, Holy Roman Emperor, invaded Slavic lands. In August 1160, Niklot was killed, and German colonization (&quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;) of the Elbe-Oder region began. In Hanoverian Wendland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Lusatia, invaders started germanization. Early forms of germanization were described by German monks: Helmold in the manuscript &quot;Chronicon Slavorum&quot; and Adam of Bremen in &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum.&quot; The Polabian language survived until the beginning of the 19th century in what is now the German state of Lower Saxony. In Eastern Germany, around 20% of Germans have historic Slavic paternal ancestry, as revealed in Y-DNA testing. Similarly, in Germany, around 20% of the foreign surnames are of Slavic origin.

Cossacks, although Slavic and practicing Orthodox Christianity, came from a mix of ethnic backgrounds, including Tatars and other peoples. The Gorals of southern Poland and northern Slovakia are partially descended from the originally Balkan Romance speaking Vlachs, who migrated into the region from the 14th to 17th centuries and were quickly absorbed into the local population, especially since the majority of Vlachs were already slavicized and the term became synonymous with Ruthenians. The populations of Moravian Wallachia, Carpathian Ruthenia and parts of northern Slovakia are also descended partially from the Vlachs. Conversely, some Slavs were assimilated into other populations. Although the majority continued towards Southeast Europe, attracted by the riches of the area that became the state of Bulgaria, a few remained in the Carpathian Basin in Central Europe and were assimilated into the Magyar people. Numerous rivers and places in Romania have a name with Slavic origins.

==Population==

&quot;Winkler Prins&quot; (2002) estimated the number of Slavs worldwide to be around 260 million at the time. Currently it is estimated that there are 300 million Slavic inhabitants in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe.

<text>Skylab was the United States&#x27; first space station, launched by NASA, occupied for about 24 weeks between May 1973 and February 1974. It was operated by three trios of astronaut crews: Skylab 2, Skylab 3, and Skylab 4. Operations included an orbital workshop, a solar observatory, Earth observation and hundreds of experiments. Skylab&#x27;s orbit eventually decayed and it disintegrated in the atmosphere on July 11, 1979, scattering debris across the Indian Ocean and Western Australia.

== Overview ==
 Skylab was the only space station operated exclusively by the United States. A permanent station was planned starting in 1988, but its funding was canceled and U.S. participation shifted to the International Space Station in 1993.

Skylab had a mass of with a Apollo command and service module (CSM) attached and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and several hundred life science and physical science experiments. It was launched uncrewed into low Earth orbit by a Saturn V rocket modified to be similar to the Saturn INT-21, with the S-IVB third stage not available for propulsion because the orbital workshop was built out of it. This was the final flight for the rocket more commonly known for carrying the crewed Apollo Moon landing missions. Three subsequent missions delivered three-astronaut crews in the Apollo CSM launched by the smaller Saturn IB rocket.

=== Configuration ===
Skylab included the Apollo Telescope Mount (a multi-spectral solar observatory), a multiple docking adapter with two docking ports, an airlock module with extravehicular activity (EVA) hatches, and the orbital workshop, the main habitable space inside Skylab. Electrical power came from solar arrays and fuel cells in the docked Apollo CSM. The rear of the station included a large waste tank, propellant tanks for maneuvering jets, and a heat radiator. Astronauts conducted numerous experiments aboard Skylab during its operational life.

=== Operations ===
For the final two crewed missions to Skylab, NASA assembled a backup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB in case an in-orbit rescue mission was needed, but this vehicle was never flown. The station was damaged during launch when the micrometeoroid shield tore away from the workshop, taking one of the main solar panel arrays with it and jamming the other main array. This deprived Skylab of most of its electrical power and also removed protection from intense solar heating, threatening to make it unusable. The first crew deployed a replacement heat shade and freed the jammed solar panels to save Skylab. This was the first time that a repair of this magnitude was performed in space.

The Apollo Telescope significantly advanced solar science, and observation of the Sun was unprecedented. Astronauts took thousands of photographs of Earth, and the Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP) viewed Earth with sensors that recorded data in the visible, infrared, and microwave spectral regions. The record for human time spent in orbit was extended beyond the 23 days set by the Soyuz 11 crew aboard Salyut 1 to 84 days by the Skylab 4 crew.

Later plans to reuse Skylab were stymied by delays in the development of the Space Shuttle, and Skylab&#x27;s decaying orbit could not be stopped. Skylab&#x27;s atmospheric reentry began on July 11, 1979, amid worldwide media attention. Before re-entry, NASA ground controllers tried to adjust Skylab&#x27;s orbit to minimize the risk of debris landing in populated areas, targeting the south Indian Ocean, which was partially successful. Debris showered Western Australia, and recovered pieces indicated that the station had disintegrated lower than expected. As the Skylab program drew to a close, NASA&#x27;s focus had shifted to the development of the Space Shuttle. NASA space station and laboratory projects included Spacelab, Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot;, and Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;, which was merged into the International Space Station.

== Background ==
Rocket engineer Wernher von Braun, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, and other early advocates of crewed space travel, expected until the 1960s that a space station would be an important early step in space exploration. Von Braun participated in the publishing of a series of influential articles in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine from 1952 to 1954, titled &quot;Man Will Conquer Space Soon!&quot;. He envisioned a large, circular station in diameter that would rotate to generate artificial gravity and require a fleet of space shuttles for construction in orbit. The 80 men aboard the station would include astronomers operating a telescope, meteorologists to forecast the weather, and soldiers to conduct surveillance. Von Braun expected that future expeditions to the Moon and Mars would leave from the station.

The development of the transistor, the solar cell, and telemetry, led in the 1950s and early 1960s to uncrewed satellites that could take photographs of weather patterns or enemy nuclear weapons and send them to Earth. A large station was no longer necessary for such purposes, and the United States Apollo program to send men to the Moon chose a mission mode that would not need in-orbit assembly. A smaller station that a single rocket could launch retained value, however, for scientific purposes.

=== Early studies ===
In 1959, von Braun, head of the Development Operations Division at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, submitted his final Project Horizon plans to the U.S. Army. The overall goal of Horizon was to place men on the Moon, a mission that would soon be taken over by the rapidly forming NASA. Although concentrating on the Moon missions, von Braun also detailed an orbiting laboratory built out of a Horizon upper stage, an idea used for Skylab. A number of NASA centers studied various space station designs in the early 1960s. Studies generally looked at platforms launched by the Saturn V, followed up by crews launched on Saturn IB using an Apollo command and service module, or a Gemini capsule on a Titan II-C, the latter being much less expensive in the case where cargo was not needed. Proposals ranged from an Apollo-based station with two to three men, or a small &quot;canister&quot; for four men with Gemini capsules resupplying it, to a large, rotating station with 24 men and an operating lifetime of about five years. A proposal to study the use of a Saturn S-IVB as a crewed space laboratory was documented in 1962 by the Douglas Aircraft Company.

=== Air Force plans ===
The Department of Defense (DoD) and NASA cooperated closely in many areas of space. In September 1963, NASA and the DoD agreed to cooperate in building a space station. The DoD wanted its own crewed facility, however, and in December 1963 it announced Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL), a small space station primarily intended for photo reconnaissance using large telescopes directed by a two-person crew. The station was the same diameter as a Titan II upper stage, and would be launched with the crew riding atop in a modified Gemini capsule with a hatch cut into the heat shield on the bottom of the capsule. MOL competed for funding with a NASA station for the next five years and politicians and other officials often suggested that NASA participate in MOL or use the DoD design. The military project led to changes to the NASA plans so that they would resemble MOL less.

== Development ==

=== Apollo Applications Program ===
NASA management was concerned about losing the 400,000 workers involved in Apollo after landing on the Moon in 1969. A reason von Braun, head of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center during the 1960s, advocated a smaller station after his large one was not built was that he wished to provide his employees with work beyond developing the Saturn rockets, which would be completed relatively early during Project Apollo. NASA set up the Apollo Logistic Support System Office, originally intended to study various ways to modify the Apollo hardware for scientific missions. The office initially proposed a number of projects for direct scientific study, including an extended-stay lunar mission which required two Saturn V launchers, a &quot;lunar truck&quot; based on the Lunar Module (LM), a large, crewed solar telescope using an LM as its crew quarters, and small space stations using a variety of LM or CSM-based hardware. Although it did not look at the space station specifically, over the next two years the office became increasingly dedicated to this role. In August 1965, the office was renamed, becoming the Apollo Applications Program (AAP).

As part of their general work, in August 1964 the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) presented studies on an expendable lab known as &quot;Apollo X&quot;, short for &quot;Apollo Extension System&quot;. &quot;Apollo X&quot; would have replaced the LM carried on the top of the S-IVB stage with a small space station slightly larger than the CSM&#x27;s service area, containing supplies and experiments for missions between 15 and 45 days&#x27; duration. Using this study as a baseline, several mission profiles were looked at over the next six months.

=== Wet workshop ===

In November 1964, von Braun proposed a more ambitious plan to build a much larger station built from the S-II second stage of a Saturn V. His design replaced the S-IVB third stage with an aeroshell, primarily as an adapter for the CSM on top. Inside the shell was a cylindrical equipment section. On reaching orbit, the S-II second stage would be vented to remove any remaining hydrogen fuel, then the equipment section would be slid into it via a large inspection hatch. This became known as a &quot;wet workshop&quot; concept, because of the conversion of an active fuel tank. The station filled the entire interior of the S-II stage&#x27;s hydrogen tank, with the equipment section forming a &quot;spine&quot; and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster. This would have resulted in a very large living area. Power was to be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the S-II stage.

One problem with this proposal was that it required a dedicated Saturn V launch to fly the station. At the time the design was being proposed, it was not known how many of the then-contracted Saturn Vs would be required to achieve a successful Moon landing. However, several planned Earth-orbit test missions for the LM and CSM had been canceled, leaving some Saturn IBs free for use. Further work led to the idea of building a smaller &quot;wet workshop&quot; based on the S-IVB, launched as the second stage of a Saturn IB.

A number of S-IVB-based stations were studied at MSC from mid-1965, which had much in common with the Skylab design that eventually flew. An airlock would be attached to the hydrogen tank, in the area designed to hold the LM, and a minimum amount of equipment would be installed in the tank in order to avoid taking up too much fuel volume. Floors of the station would be made from an open metal framework that allowed the fuel to flow through it. After launch, a follow-up mission launched by a Saturn IB would launch additional equipment, including solar panels, an equipment section and docking adapter, and various experiments. Douglas Aircraft Company, builder of the S-IVB stage, was asked to prepare proposals along these lines. The company had for several years been proposing stations based on the S-IV stage, before it was replaced by the S-IVB.

On April 1, 1966, MSC sent out contracts to Douglas, Grumman, and McDonnell for the conversion of an S-IVB spent stage, under the name Saturn S-IVB spent-stage experiment support module (SSESM). In May 1966, astronauts voiced concerns over the purging of the stage&#x27;s hydrogen tank in space. Nevertheless, in late July 1966, it was announced that the Orbital Workshop would be launched as a part of Apollo mission AS-209, originally one of the Earth-orbit CSM test launches, followed by two Saturn I/CSM crew launches, AAP-1 and AAP-2.

The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) remained AAP&#x27;s chief competitor for funds, although the two programs cooperated on technology. NASA considered flying experiments on MOL or using its Titan IIIC booster instead of the much more expensive Saturn IB. The agency decided that the Air Force station was not large enough and that converting Apollo hardware for use with Titan would be too slow and too expensive. The DoD canceled MOL in June 1969.

=== Dry workshop ===
Design work continued over the next two years, in an era of shrinking budgets. (NASA sought US$450 million for Apollo Applications in fiscal year 1967, for example, but received US$42 million.) In August 1967, the agency announced that the lunar mapping and base construction missions examined by the AAP were being canceled. Only the Earth-orbiting missions remained, namely the Orbital Workshop and Apollo Telescope Mount solar observatory. The success of Apollo 8 in December 1968, launched on the third flight of a Saturn V, made it likely that one would be available to launch a dry workshop. Later, several Moon missions were canceled as well, originally to be Apollo missions 18 through 20. The cancellation of these missions freed up three Saturn V boosters for the AAP program. Although this would have allowed them to develop von Braun&#x27;s original S-II-based mission, by this time so much work had been done on the S-IV-based design that work continued on this baseline. With the extra power available, the wet workshop was no longer needed; the S-IC and S-II lower stages could launch a &quot;dry workshop&quot;, with its interior already prepared, directly into orbit.

=== Habitability ===
A dry workshop simplified plans for the interior of the station. Industrial design firm Raymond Loewy/William Snaith recommended emphasizing habitability and comfort for the astronauts by providing a wardroom for meals and relaxation and a window to view Earth and space, although astronauts were dubious about the designers&#x27; focus on details such as color schemes. Habitability had not previously been an area of concern when building spacecraft due to their small size and brief mission durations, but the Skylab missions would last for months. NASA sent a scientist on Jacques Piccard&#x27;s &quot;Ben Franklin&quot; submarine in the Gulf Stream in July and August 1969 to learn how six people would live in an enclosed space for four weeks.

Astronauts were uninterested in watching movies on a proposed entertainment center or in playing games, but they did want books and individual music choices. Food was also important; early Apollo crews complained about its quality, and a NASA volunteer found it intolerable to live on the Apollo food for four days on Earth. Its taste and composition were unpleasant, in the form of cubes and squeeze tubes. Skylab food significantly improved on its predecessors by prioritizing palatability over scientific needs.

For sleeping in space, each astronaut had a private area the size of a small walk-in closet, with a curtain, sleeping bag, and locker. Designers also added a shower and a toilet for comfort and to obtain precise urine and feces samples for examination on Earth. The waste samples were so important that they would have been priorities in any rescue mission.

Skylab did not have recycling systems such as the conversion of urine to drinking water; it also did not dispose of waste by dumping it into space. The S-IVB&#x27;s liquid oxygen tank below the Orbital Work Shop was used to store trash and wastewater, passed through an airlock.

== Operational history ==
=== Completion and launch ===
On August 8, 1969, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation received a contract for the conversion of two existing S-IVB stages to the Orbital Workshop configuration. One of the S-IV test stages was shipped to McDonnell Douglas for the construction of a mock-up in January 1970. The Orbital Workshop was renamed &quot;Skylab&quot; in February 1970 as a result of a NASA contest. The actual stage that flew was the upper stage of the AS-212 rocket (the S-IVB stage, S-IVB 212). The mission computer used aboard Skylab was the IBM System/4Pi TC-1, a relative of the AP-101 Space Shuttle computers. The Saturn V with serial number SA-513, originally produced for the Apollo program – before the cancellation of Apollo 18, 19, and 20 – was repurposed and redesigned to launch Skylab. The Saturn V&#x27;s third stage was removed and replaced with Skylab, but with the controlling instrument unit remaining in its standard position.

Skylab was launched on May 14, 1973, by the modified Saturn V. The launch is sometimes referred to as Skylab 1. Severe damage was sustained during launch and deployment, including the loss of the station&#x27;s micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels. Debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield became tangled in the remaining solar panel, preventing its full deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit.

Immediately following Skylab&#x27;s launch, Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center was deactivated, and construction proceeded to modify it for the Space Shuttle program, originally targeting a maiden launch in March 1979. The crewed missions to Skylab would occur using a Saturn IB rocket from Launch Pad 39B.

Skylab 1 was the last uncrewed launch from LC-39A until February 19, 2017, when SpaceX CRS-10 was launched from there.

=== Crewed missions ===

Three crewed missions, designated Skylab 2, Skylab 3, and Skylab 4, were made to Skylab in Apollo command and service modules. The first crewed mission, Skylab 2, was launched on May 25, 1973, by a Saturn IB and involved extensive repairs to the station. The crew deployed a parasol-like sunshade through a small instrument port from the inside of the station, bringing station temperatures down to acceptable levels and preventing overheating that would have melted the plastic insulation inside the station and released poisonous gases. This solution was designed by Jack Kinzler, who won the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts. The crew conducted further repairs via two spacewalks (extravehicular activity or EVA). The crew stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed, with the launch dates of July 28, 1973, (Skylab 3) and November 16, 1973, (Skylab 4), and mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. The last Skylab crew returned to Earth on February 8, 1974.

In addition to the three crewed missions, there was a rescue mission on standby that had a crew of two, but could take five back down.
* Skylab 2: launched May 25, 1973
* Skylab 3: launched July 28, 1973
* Skylab 4: launched November 16, 1973
* Skylab 5: cancelled
* Skylab Rescue on standby

Also of note was the three-man crew of Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT), who spent 56 days in 1972 at low-pressure on Earth to evaluate medical experiment equipment. This was a spaceflight analog test in full gravity, but Skylab hardware was tested and medical knowledge was gained.

=== Orbital operations ===

Originally intended to be visited by one 28–day and two 56–day missions for a total of 140 days, Skylab was ultimately occupied for 171 days and 13 hours during its three crewed expeditions, orbiting the Earth 2,476 times. Each of these extended the human record of 23 days for amount of time spent in space set by the Soviet Soyuz 11 crew aboard the space station Salyut 1 on June 30, 1971. Skylab 2 lasted 28 days, Skylab 3 56 days, and Skylab 4 84 days. Astronauts performed ten spacewalks, totaling 42 hours and 16 minutes. Skylab logged about 2,000 hours of scientific and medical experiments, 127,000 frames of film of the Sun and 46,000 of Earth. Solar experiments included photographs of eight solar flares and produced valuable results that scientists stated would have been impossible to obtain with uncrewed spacecraft. The existence of the Sun&#x27;s coronal holes was confirmed because of these efforts. Many of the experiments conducted investigated the astronauts&#x27; adaptation to extended periods of microgravity.

A typical day began at 6 a.m. Central Time Zone. Although the toilet was small and noisy, both veteran astronauts who had endured earlier missions&#x27; rudimentary waste-collection systems and rookies complimented it. The first crew enjoyed taking a shower once a week, but found drying themselves in weightlessness and vacuuming excess water difficult; later crews usually cleaned themselves daily with wet washcloths instead of using the shower. Astronauts also found that bending over in weightlessness to put on socks or tie shoelaces strained their abdominal muscles.

Breakfast began at 7 a.m. Astronauts usually stood to eat, as sitting in microgravity also strained their abdominal muscles. They reported that their food although greatly improved from Apollo was bland and repetitive, and weightlessness caused utensils, food containers, and bits of food to float away; also, gas in their drinking water contributed to flatulence. After breakfast and preparation for lunch, experiments, tests and repairs of spacecraft systems and, if possible, 90 minutes of physical exercise followed; the station had a bicycle and other equipment, and astronauts could jog around the water tank. After dinner, which was scheduled for 6 p.m., crews performed household chores and prepared for the next day&#x27;s experiments. Following lengthy daily instructions (some of which were up to 15 meters long) sent via teleprinter, the crews were often busy enough to postpone sleep. The station offered what a later study called &quot;a highly satisfactory living and working environment for crews&quot;, with enough room for personal privacy. Although it had a dart set, playing cards, and other recreational equipment in addition to books and music players, the window with its view of Earth became the most popular way to relax in orbit.

== Experiments ==
Prior to departure about 80 experiments were named, although they are also described as &quot;almost 300 separate investigations&quot;.

Experiments were divided into six broad categories:
* Life science – human physiology, biomedical research; circadian rhythms (mice, gnats)
* Solar physics and astronomy – sun observations (eight telescopes and separate instrumentation); Comet Kohoutek (Skylab 4); stellar observations; space physics
* Earth resources – mineral resources; geology; hurricanes; land and vegetation patterns
* Material science – welding, brazing, metal melting; crystal growth; water / fluid dynamics
* Student research – 19 different student proposals. Several experiments were commended by the crew, including a dexterity experiment and a test of web-spinning by spiders in low gravity.
* Other – human adaptability, ability to work, dexterity; habitat design/operations.

Because the solar scientific airlock – one of two research airlocks – was unexpectedly occupied by the &quot;parasol&quot; that replaced the missing meteorite shield, a few experiments were instead installed outside with the telescopes during spacewalks or shifted to the Earth-facing scientific airlock.

Skylab 2 spent less time than planned on most experiments due to station repairs. On the other hand, Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 far exceeded the initial experiment plans, once the crews adjusted to the environment and established comfortable working relationships with ground control.

The figure (below) lists an overview of most major experiments. Skylab 4 carried out several more experiments, such as to observe Comet Kohoutek.


=== Astronaut maneuvering equipment ===
As a technology demonstration, the crew practiced flying the Automatically Stabilized Maneuvering Unit (ASMU) inside the spacious dome of the Orbital Workshop. Designed to enable astronauts to perform untethered movements in microgravity. The ASMU tests established key piloting characteristics and capability base for the MMU systems used on the Space Shuttle missions.

=== Nobel Prize ===
Riccardo Giacconi shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for his study of X-ray astronomy, including the study of emissions from the Sun onboard Skylab, contributing to the birth of X-ray astronomy.

== Film vaults and window radiation shield ==
Skylab had certain features to protect vulnerable technology from radiation. The window was vulnerable to darkening, and this darkening could affect experiment S190. As a result, a light shield that could be open or shut was designed and installed on Skylab. To protect a wide variety of films, used for a variety of experiments and for astronaut photography, there were five film vaults. There were four smaller film vaults in the Multiple Docking Adapter, mainly because the structure could not carry enough weight for a single larger film vault. The orbital workshop could handle a single larger safe, which is also more efficient for shielding. A later example of a radiation vault is the Juno Radiation Vault for the Juno Jupiter orbiter, launched in 2011, which was designed to protect much of the uncrewed spacecraft&#x27;s electronics, using 1 cm thick walls of titanium.

The large vault in the orbital workshop had an empty mass of . The four smaller vaults had combined mass of . The primary construction material of all five safes was aluminum. When Skylab re-entered there was one chunk of aluminum found that was thought to be a door to one of the film vaults. The large film vault was one of the heaviest single pieces of Skylab to re-enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

The Skylab film vault was used for storing film from various sources including the Apollo Telescope Mount solar instruments. Six ATM experiments used film to record data, and over the course of the missions over 150,000 successful exposures were recorded. The film canister had to be manually retrieved on crewed spacewalks to the instruments during the missions. The film canisters were returned to Earth aboard the Apollo capsules when each mission ended, and were among the heaviest items that had to be returned at the end of each mission. The heaviest canisters weighed 40 kg and could hold up to 16,000 frames of film.

== Gyroscopes ==
There were two types of gyroscopes on Skylab. Control-moment gyroscopes (CMG) could physically move the station, and rate gyroscopes measured the rate of rotation to find its orientation. The CMG helped provide the fine pointing needed by the Apollo Telescope Mount, and to resist various forces that can change the station&#x27;s orientation.

Some of the forces acting on Skylab that the pointing system needed to resist:
* Gravity gradient
* Aerodynamic disturbance
* Internal movements of crew.

Skylab was the first large spacecraft to use big gyroscopes, capable of controlling its attitude. The control could also be used to help point the instruments. The gyroscopes took about ten hours to get spun up if they were turned off. There was also a thruster system to control Skylab&#x27;s attitude. There were 9 rate-gyroscope sensors, 3 for each axis. These were sensors that fed their output to the Skylab digital computer. Two of three were active and their input was averaged, while the third was a backup. From NASA SP-400 &quot;Skylab, Our First Space Station&quot;, &quot;each Skylab control-moment gyroscope consisted of a motor-driven rotor, electronics assembly, and power inverter assembly. The rotor weighed and rotated at approximately 8950 revolutions per minute&quot;.

There were three control moment gyroscopes on Skylab, but only two were required to maintain pointing. The control and sensor gyroscopes were part of a system that help detect and control the orientation of the station in space. Other sensors that helped with this were a Sun tracker and a star tracker. The sensors fed data to the main computer, which could then use the control gyroscopes and or the thruster system to keep Skylab pointed as desired.

== Shower ==


Skylab had a zero-gravity shower system in the work and experiment section of the Orbital Workshop designed and built at the Manned Spaceflight Center. It had a cylindrical curtain that went from floor to ceiling and a vacuum system to suck away water. The floor of the shower had foot restraints.

To bathe, the user coupled a pressurized bottle of warmed water to the shower&#x27;s plumbing, then stepped inside and secured the curtain. A push-button shower nozzle was connected by a stiff hose to the top of the shower. The system was designed for about 6 pints (2.8 liters) of water per shower, the water being drawn from the personal hygiene water tank. The use of both the liquid soap and water was carefully planned out, with enough soap and warm water for one shower per week per person.

The first astronaut to use the space shower was Paul J. Weitz on Skylab 2, the first crewed mission. He said, &quot;It took a fair amount longer to use than you might expect, but you come out smelling good&quot;. A Skylab shower took about two and a half hours, including the time to set up the shower and dissipate used water. The procedure for operating the shower was as follows:
# Fill up the pressurized water bottle with hot water and attach it to the ceiling
# Connect the hose and pull up the shower curtain
# Spray down with water
# Apply liquid soap and spray more water to rinse
# Vacuum up all the fluids and stow items.

One of the big concerns with bathing in space was control of droplets of water so that they did not cause an electrical short by floating into the wrong area. The vacuum water system was thus integral to the shower. The vacuum fed to a centrifugal separator, filter, and collection bag to allow the system to vacuum up the fluids. Waste water was injected into a disposal bag which was in turn put in the waste tank. The material for the shower enclosure was fire-proof beta cloth wrapped around hoops of diameter; the top hoop was connected to the ceiling. The shower could be collapsed to the floor when not in use. Skylab also supplied astronauts with rayon terrycloth towels which had a color-coded stitching for each crew-member. There were 420 towels on board Skylab initially.

A simulated Skylab shower was also used during the 56-day SMEAT simulation; the crew used the shower after exercise and found it a positive experience.

== Cameras and film ==

There was a variety of hand-held and fixed experiments that used various types of film. In addition to the instruments in the ATM solar observatory, 35 and 70 mm film cameras were carried on board. An analog TV camera was carried that recorded video electronically. These electronic signals could be recorded to magnetic tape or be transmitted to Earth by radio signal.

It was determined that film would fog up to due to radiation over the course of the mission. To prevent this, film was stored in vaults.

Personal (hand-held) camera equipment:
* Television camera
** Westinghouse color
** 25–150 mm zoom
* 16 mm film camera (Maurer), called the 16 mm Data Acquisition Camera. The DAC was capable of very low frame rates, such as for engineering data films, and it had independent shutter speeds. It could be powered from a battery or from Skylab itself. It used interchangeable lenses, and various lens and also film types were used during the missions.
** There were different options for frame rates: 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 frames per second
** Lenses available: 5, 10, 18, 25, 75, and 100 mm
** Films used:
*** Ektachrome film
*** SO-368 film
*** SO-168 film

Film for the DAC was contained in DAC film magazines, which contained up to 140 feet (42.7 m) of film. At 24 frames per second this was enough for 4 minutes of filming, with progressively longer film times with lower frame rates such as 16 minutes at 6 frames per second. The film had to be loaded or unloaded from the DAC in a photographic dark room.
* 35 mm film cameras (Nikon)
** There were 5 Nikon 35 mm film cameras on board, with 55 mm and 300 mm lenses.
** They were specially modified Nikon F cameras
** The cameras were capable of interchangeable lenses.
** 35mm films included:
*** Ektachrome
*** SO-368
*** SO-168
*** 2485 type film
*** 2443 type film
* 70 mm film camera (Hasselblad)
** This had an electric data camera system with Reseau plate
** Films included
*** 70 mm Ektachrome
*** SO-368 film
** Lenses: 70 mm lens, 100 mm lens.

Experiment S190B was the Actron Earth Terrain Camera.

The S190A was the &quot;Multispectral Photographic Camera&quot;:
* This consisted of six Itek 70 mm boresighted cameras
* Lenses were f/2.8 with a 21.2° field of view.

There was also a Polaroid SX-70 instant camera, and a pair of Leitz Trinovid 10 × 40 binoculars modified for use in space to aid in Earth observations.

The SX-70 was used to take pictures of the Extreme Ultraviolet monitor by Dr. Garriot, as the monitor provided a live video feed of the solar corona in ultraviolet light as observed by Skylab solar observatory instruments located in the Apollo Telescope Mount.

== Computers ==
Skylab was controlled in part by a digital computer system, and one of its main jobs was to control the pointing of the station; pointing was especially important for its solar power collection and observatory functions. The computer consisted of two actual computers, a primary and a secondary. The system ran several thousand words of code, which was also backed up on the Memory Load Unit (MLU). The two computers were linked to each other and various input and output items by the workshop computer interface. Operations could be switched from the primary to the backup, which were the same design, either automatically if errors were detected, by the Skylab crew, or from the ground.

The Skylab computer was a space-hardened and customized version of the TC-1 computer, a version of the IBM System/4 Pi, itself based on the System 360 computer. The TC-1 had a 16,000-word memory based on ferrite memory cores, while the MLU was a read-only tape drive that contained a backup of the main computer programs. The tape drive would take 11 seconds to upload the backup of the software program to a main computer. The TC-1 used 16-bit words and the central processor came from the 4Pi computer. There was a 16k and an 8k version of the software program.

The computer had a mass of 100 pounds (45.4 kg), and consumed about ten percent of the station&#x27;s electrical power.
* Apollo Telescope Mount Digital Computer
* Attitude and Pointing Control System (APCS)
* Memory Load Unit (MLU).

After launch the computer is what the controllers on the ground communicated with to control the station&#x27;s orientation. When the sun-shield was torn off the ground staff had to balance solar heating with electrical production. On March 6, 1978, the computer system was re-activated by NASA to control the re-entry.

The system had a user interface that consisted of a display, ten buttons, and a three-position switch. Because the numbers were in octal (base-8), it only had numbers zero to seven (8 keys), and the other two keys were enter and clear. The display could show minutes and seconds which would count down to orbital benchmarks, or it could display keystrokes when using the interface. The interface could be used to change the software program. The user interface was called the Digital Address System (DAS) and could send commands to the computer&#x27;s command system. The command system could also get commands from the ground.

For personal computing needs Skylab crews were equipped with models of the then new hand-held electronic scientific calculator, which was used in place of slide-rules used on prior space missions as the primary personal computer. The model used was the Hewlett Packard HP 35. Some slide rules continued in use aboard Skylab, and a circular slide rule was at the workstation.

== Plans for re-use after the last mission ==

After nearly 172 days, Skylab considerably exceeded its planned 140 day habitation. The station had held up relatively well, but its onboard supplies were low and its systems were beginning to degrade. One of the three control-moment gyroscopes (CMGs) failed 8 days into Skylab 4, and by the end of the mission another was showing signs of impending failure. With just a single CMG Skylab would be unable to control its attitude, and it was not possible to repair or replace one of the broken gyroscopes on-orbit. Virtually all of the prepackaged food launched with the station had been consumed, Skylab 4&#x27;s mission extension from 56 to 84 days required the crew take an extra 28 days worth of food with them, but there was still enough water to support three men for 60 days, and enough oxygen/nitrogen to support the same for 140 days.

A fourth crewed mission using an Apollo CSM was considered, which would have used the launch vehicle kept on standby for the Skylab Rescue mission. This would have been a 20-day mission to boost Skylab to a higher altitude and do more scientific experiments. Another plan was to use a Teleoperator Retrieval System (TRS) launched aboard the Space Shuttle (then under development), to robotically re-boost the orbit. When Skylab 5 was cancelled, it was expected Skylab would stay in orbit until the 1980s, which was enough time to overlap with the beginning of Shuttle launches. Other options for launching TRS included the Titan III and Atlas-Agena. No option received the level of effort and funding needed for execution before Skylab&#x27;s sooner-than-expected re-entry.

The Skylab 4 crew left a bag filled with supplies to welcome visitors, and left the hatch unlocked. Skylab&#x27;s internal systems were evaluated and tested from the ground, and effort was put into plans for re-using it, as late as 1978. NASA discouraged any discussion of additional visits due to the station&#x27;s age, but in 1977 and 1978, when the agency still believed the Space Shuttle would be ready by 1979, it completed two studies on reusing the station. By September 1978, the agency believed Skylab was safe for crews, with all major systems intact and operational. It still had 180 man-days of water and 420-man-days of oxygen, and astronauts could refill both; the station could hold up to about 600 to 700 man-days of drinkable water and 420 man-days of food. Before Skylab 4 left they did one more boost, running the Skylab thrusters for 3 minutes which added 11 km in height to its orbit. Skylab was left in a 433 by 455 km orbit on departure. At this time, the NASA-accepted estimate for its re-entry was nine years.

The studies cited several benefits from reusing Skylab, which one called a resource worth &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; with &quot;unique habitability provisions for long duration space flight&quot;. Because no more operational Saturn V rockets were available after the Apollo program, four to five shuttle flights and extensive space architecture would have been needed to build another station as large as Skylab&#x27;s volume. Its ample size – much greater than that of the shuttle alone, or even the shuttle plus Spacelab – was enough, with some modifications, for up to seven astronauts of both sexes, and experiments needing a long duration in space; even a movie projector for recreation was possible.

Proponents of Skylab&#x27;s reuse also said repairing and upgrading Skylab would provide information on the results of long-duration exposure to space for future stations. The most serious issue for reactivation was attitude control, as one of the station&#x27;s gyroscopes had failed and the attitude control system needed refueling; these issues would need EVA to fix or replace. The station had not been designed for extensive resupply. However, although it was originally planned that Skylab crews would only perform limited maintenance, they successfully made major repairs during EVA, such as the Skylab 2 crew&#x27;s deployment of the solar panel and the Skylab 4 crew&#x27;s repair of the primary coolant loop. The Skylab 2 crew fixed one item during EVA by, reportedly, &quot;hit[ting] it with [a] hammer&quot;.

Some studies also said, beyond the opportunity for space construction and maintenance experience, reactivating the station would free up shuttle flights for other uses, and reduce the need to modify the shuttle for long-duration missions. Even if the station were not crewed again, went one argument, it might serve as an experimental platform.

=== Shuttle mission plans ===
The reactivation would likely have occurred in four phases: 
# An early Space Shuttle flight would have boosted Skylab to a higher orbit, adding five years of operational life. The shuttle might have pushed or towed the station, but attaching a space tug – the Teleoperator Retrieval System (TRS) – to the station would have been more likely, based on astronauts&#x27; training for the task. Martin Marietta won the contract for US$26 million to design the apparatus. TRS would contain about three tons of propellant. The remote-controlled booster had TV cameras and was designed for duties such as space construction and servicing and retrieving satellites the shuttle could not reach. After rescuing Skylab, the TRS would have remained in orbit for future use. Alternatively, it could have been used to de-orbit Skylab for a safe, controlled re-entry and destruction.
# In two shuttle flights, Skylab would have been refurbished. In January 1982, the first mission would have attached a docking adapter and conducted repairs. In August 1983, a second crew would have replaced several system components.
# In March 1984, shuttle crews would have attached a solar-powered Power Expansion Package, refurbished scientific equipment, and conducted 30- to 90-day missions using the Apollo Telescope Mount and the Earth resources experiments.
# Over five years, Skylab would have been expanded to accommodate six to eight astronauts, with a new large docking/interface module, additional logistics modules, Spacelab modules and pallets, and an orbital vehicle space dock using the shuttle&#x27;s external tank.

The first three phases would have required about US$60 million in 1980s dollars, not including launch costs. Other options for launching TRS were Titan III or Atlas-Agena.

== After departure ==

After a boost of by Skylab 4&#x27;s Apollo CSM before its departure in 1974, Skylab was left in a parking orbit of by that was expected to last until at least the early 1980s, based on estimates of the 11-year sunspot cycle that began in 1976. In 1962, NASA first considered the potential risks of a space station reentry, but decided not to incorporate a retrorocket system in Skylab due to cost and acceptable risk.

The spent 49-ton Saturn V S-II stage which had launched Skylab in 1973 remained in orbit for almost two years, and made a controlled reentry on January 11, 1975. The re-entry was mistimed however and deorbited slightly earlier in the orbit than planned.

=== Solar activity ===

British mathematician Desmond King-Hele of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) predicted in 1973 that Skylab would de-orbit and crash to Earth in 1979, sooner than NASA&#x27;s forecast, because of increased solar activity. Greater-than-expected solar activity heated the outer layers of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and increased drag on Skylab. By late 1977, NORAD also forecast a reentry in mid-1979; a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist criticized NASA for using an inaccurate model for the second most-intense sunspot cycle in a century, and for ignoring NOAA predictions published in 1976.

The reentry of the USSR&#x27;s nuclear powered Cosmos 954 in January 1978, and the resulting radioactive debris fall in northern Canada, drew more attention to Skylab&#x27;s orbit. Although Skylab did not contain radioactive materials, the State Department warned NASA about the potential diplomatic repercussions of station debris. Battelle Memorial Institute forecast that up to 25 tons of metal debris could land in 500 pieces over an area long and wide. The lead-lined film vault, for example, might land intact at .

Ground controllers re-established contact with Skylab in March 1978 and recharged its batteries. Although NASA worked on plans to reboost Skylab with the Space Shuttle through 1978 and the TRS was almost complete, the agency gave up in December 1978 when it became clear that the shuttle would not be ready in time; its first flight, STS-1, did not occur until April 1981. Also rejected were proposals to launch the TRS using one or two uncrewed rockets or to attempt to destroy the station with missiles.

=== Re-entry and debris ===


Skylab&#x27;s impending demise in 1979 was an international media event, with T-shirts and hats with bullseyes and &quot;Skylab Repellent&quot; with a money-back guarantee, wagering on the time and place of re-entry, and nightly news reports. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; offered a US$10,000 prize (equivalent to $ today) for the first piece of Skylab delivered to its offices; the rival &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; offered US$200,000 ($ today) if a subscriber suffered personal or property damage. A Nebraska neighborhood painted a target so that the station would have &quot;something to aim for&quot;, a resident said.

The &quot;Examiner&quot; created the prize to compete with the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and its popular columnist Herb Caen. Publisher Reg Murphy was reluctant to pay the money, Jeff Jarvis recalled, but NASA assured Jarvis—Caen&#x27;s counterpart at the &quot;Examiner&quot;—that the station would not hit land. A report commissioned by NASA calculated that the odds were 1 in 152 of debris hitting any human, and odds of 1 in 7 of debris hitting a city of 100,000 people or more. Special teams were readied to head to any country hit by debris. The event caused so much panic in the Philippines that President Ferdinand Marcos appeared on national television to reassure the public.

A week before re-entry, NASA forecast that it would occur between July 10 and 14, with the 12th the most likely date, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) predicted the 14th. In the hours before the event, ground controllers adjusted Skylab&#x27;s orientation to minimize the risk of re-entry on a populated area. They aimed the station at a spot south-southeast of Cape Town, South Africa, and re-entry began at approximately 16:37 UTC, July 11, 1979. The station did not burn up as fast as NASA expected. Debris landed about east of Perth, Western Australia due to a four-percent calculation error, and was found between Esperance, Western Australia and Rawlinna, from 31° to 34° S and 122° to 126° E, about 130–150 km (81–93 miles) radius around Balladonia, Western Australia. Residents and an airline pilot saw dozens of colorful flares as large pieces broke up in the atmosphere; the debris landed in an almost unpopulated area, but the sightings still caused NASA to fear human injury or property damage. Don Lind, in a 2005 interview, reports no human injuries or deaths.

Stan Thornton found 24 pieces of Skylab at his home in Esperance. After obtaining his first passport, Thornton flew to San Francisco. After waiting one week for Marshall Space Flight Center to authenticate the wreckage, he collected the &quot;Examiner&quot; prize and another US$1,000 from a Philadelphia businessman who had flown Thornton&#x27;s family and girlfriend there. Analysis of the debris showed that the station had disintegrated above the Earth, much lower than expected.

The Shire of Esperance light-heartedly fined NASA A$400 for littering, and while the fine was indeed written off three months later, it was nonetheless eventually paid on behalf of NASA in April 2009, after Scott Barley of Highway Radio raised the funds from his morning show listeners.

After the demise of Skylab, NASA focused on the reusable Spacelab module, an orbital workshop that could be deployed with the Space Shuttle and returned to Earth. The next American major space station project was Space Station Freedom, which was merged into the International Space Station in 1993 and launched starting in 1998. Shuttle-Mir was another project and led to the US funding Spektr, Priroda, and the Mir Docking Module in the 1990s.

== Launchers, rescue, and cancelled missions ==
=== Launchers ===
Launch vehicles:
* SA-513 (Skylab)
* SA-206 (Skylab 2)
* SA-207 (Skylab 3)
* SA-208 (Skylab 4)
* SA-209 (Skylab Rescue and Skylab 5, not launched)

=== Skylab Revisit ===
In 1971, before Skylab launched, NASA studied the potential of adding another mission to the three already planned. Called Skylab Revisit, two options were examined. First was an open ended mission that would launch within 30 days after Skylab 4, aiming to last 56 days. The second would visit the station a year after the last crew had left to determine the health and habitability of the station after two years in space.

Neither option was rated highly. The first option&#x27;s chance of mission success was considered uncertain at best, and the second&#x27;s even worse given the expected dearth of food, water, and oxygen supplies and the degraded condition of Skylab&#x27;s system after two years in orbit.

=== Skylab Rescue ===

There was a Skylab Rescue mission assembled for the second crewed mission to Skylab, but it was not needed. Another rescue mission was assembled for the last Skylab and was also on standby for ASTP. These missions used a backup Saturn IB rocket (SA-209) and CSM module (CSM-119).

=== Skylab 5 ===
Skylab 5 would have been a short 20-day mission in April 1974 to conduct more scientific experiments and use the Apollo&#x27;s Service Propulsion System engine to boost Skylab into a higher orbit, supporting later station use by the Space Shuttle. 

Vance Brand (commander), William B. Lenoir (science pilot), and Don Lind (pilot) would have been the crew for this mission, with Brand and Lind being the prime crew for the Skylab Rescue flights. Brand and Lind also trained for a mission that would have aimed Skylab for a controlled deorbit.

Skylab 5 would have used the SA-209 rocket and CMS-119 on standby for Skylab Rescue. Upon its cancellation the rocket was put on display at NASA Kennedy Space Center.

=== Skylab B ===
In addition to the flown Skylab space station, a second flight-quality backup Skylab space station had been built during the program. NASA considered using it for a second station in May 1973 or later, to be called Skylab B (S-IVB 515), but decided against it. Launching another Skylab with another Saturn V rocket would have been very costly, and it was decided to spend this money on the development of the Space Shuttle instead.

NASA transferred Skylab B to the National Air and Space Museum in 1975. On display in the museum&#x27;s Space Hall since 1976, the orbital workshop has been slightly modified to permit viewers to walk through the living quarters.

== Engineering mock-ups ==
A full-size 1G training mock-up once used for astronaut training is located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center visitor center in Houston, Texas.

Another training mockup, originally used at the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS), is at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Originally displayed indoors, it was subsequently stored outdoors for several years to make room for other exhibits. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Skylab program, the Orbital Workshop portion of the trainer was restored and moved into the Davidson Center in 2013.

== Mission designations ==
The numerical identification of the crewed Skylab missions was the cause of some confusion. Originally, the uncrewed launch of Skylab and the three crewed missions to the station were numbered &quot;SL-1&quot; through &quot;SL-4&quot;. During the preparations for the crewed missions, some documentation was created with a different scheme – &quot;SLM-1&quot; through &quot;SLM-3&quot; – for those missions only. William Pogue credits Pete Conrad with asking the Skylab program director which scheme should be used for the mission patches, and the astronauts were told to use 1–2–3, not 2–3–4. By the time NASA administrators tried to reverse this decision, it was too late, as all the in-flight clothing had already been manufactured and shipped with the 1–2–3 mission patches.

L.B. James of NASA Marshall predicted in 1970 that an astronomer, medical doctor, and third scientist might compose each Skylab crew. NASA Astronaut Group 4 and NASA Astronaut Group 6 were scientists recruited as astronauts. They and the scientific community hoped to have two on each Skylab mission, but Deke Slayton, director of flight crew operations, insisted that two trained pilots fly on each. Although the scientists were qualified jet pilots, NASA headquarters made the final decision of one scientist in each Skylab crew on 6 July 1971, after the deaths of three cosmonauts on Soyuz 11.

Kerwin was the first Skylab scientist-astronaut. NASA chose a medical doctor to better understand the effect of spaceflight on the human body on a long-duration mission. Astronauts trained for minor medical procedures at a Houston hospital emergency department.

=== SMEAT ===

The &quot;Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test&quot; or SMEAT was a 56-day (8-week) Earth analog Skylab test. The test had a low-pressure high oxygen-percentage atmosphere but it operated under full gravity, as SMEAT was not in orbit. The test had a three-astronaut crew with Commander Robert Crippen, Pilot Karol J. Bobko, and Science Pilot William E. Thornton; there was a focus on medical studies and Thornton was an M.D. The crew lived and worked in the pressure chamber, converted to be like Skylab, from July 26 to September 20, 1972.

== Program cost ==
From 1966 to 1974, the Skylab program cost a total of US$2.2 billion, (equivalent to $ billion in ). As its three three-person crews spent 510 total man-days in space, each man-day cost approximately US$20 million, compared to US$7.5 million for the International Space Station.

== Depictions in film ==
A minor storyline of the 1986 film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; is an attempt by characters of the Melbourne household to fabricate pieces of Skylab and win a radio station&#x27;s competition to locate debris from the space station as it fell to earth in Australia.

The documentary &quot;Searching for Skylab&quot; was released online in March 2019. It was written and directed by Dwight Steven-Boniecki and was partly crowdfunded.

The alternate history Apple TV+ original series &quot;For All Mankind&quot; (2019) depicts the use of the space station in the first episode of the second season, surviving to the 1980s and coexisting with the Space Shuttle program in the alternate timeline.

In the 2011 film &quot;Skylab&quot;, a family gathers in France and waits for the station to fall out of orbit. It was directed by Julie Delpy.

The 2021 Indian film &quot;Skylab&quot; depicts fictitious incidents in a Telangana village preceding the disintegration of the space station.

The 2024 series &quot;Last Days of the Space Age&quot; is set in 1979 Western Australia, during Skylab&#x27;s reentry near Perth.

<doc id="29445" wikidata="Q296778" url="?curid=29445" title="StrongARM">
<text>The StrongARM is a family of computer microprocessors developed by Digital Equipment Corporation and manufactured in the late 1990s which implemented the ARM v4 instruction set architecture. It was later acquired by Intel in 1997 from DEC&#x27;s own Digital Semiconductor division as part of a settlement of a lawsuit between the two companies over patent infringement. Intel then continued to manufacture it before replacing it with the StrongARM-derived ARM-based follow-up architecture called XScale in the early 2000s.

==History==
According to Allen Baum, the StrongARM traces its history to attempts to make a low-power version of the DEC Alpha, which DEC&#x27;s engineers quickly concluded was not possible. They then became interested in designs dedicated to low-power applications which led them to the ARM family. One of the only major users of the ARM for performance-related products at that time was Apple, whose Newton device was based on the ARM platform. DEC approached Apple wondering if they might be interested in a high-performance ARM, to which the Apple engineers replied &quot;Phhht, yeah. You can&#x27;t do it, but, yeah, if you could we&#x27;d use it.&quot;

The StrongARM was a collaborative project between DEC and Advanced RISC Machines to create a faster ARM microprocessor. The StrongARM was designed to address the upper end of the low-power embedded market, where users needed more performance than the ARM could deliver while being able to accept more external support. Targets were devices such as newer personal digital assistants and set-top boxes.

Traditionally, the semiconductor division of DEC was located in Massachusetts. In order to gain access to the design talent in Silicon Valley, DEC opened a design center in Palo Alto, California. This design center was led by Dan Dobberpuhl and was the main design site for the StrongARM project. Another design site that worked on the project was in Austin, Texas that was created by some ex-DEC designers returning from Apple Computer and Motorola. The project was set up in 1995, and quickly delivered their first design, the SA-110.

DEC agreed to sell StrongARM to Intel as part of a lawsuit settlement in 1997. Intel used the StrongARM to replace their ailing line of RISC processors, the i860 and i960.

When the semiconductor division of DEC was sold to Intel, many engineers from the Palo Alto design group moved to SiByte, a start-up company designing MIPS system-on-a-chip (SoC) products for the networking market. The Austin design group spun off to become Alchemy Semiconductor, another start-up company designing MIPS SoCs for the hand-held market. A new StrongARM core was developed by Intel and introduced in 2000 as the XScale.

==SA-110==
The SA-110 was the first microprocessor in the StrongARM family. The first versions, operating at 100, 160, and 200 MHz, were announced on 5 February 1996. When announced, samples of these versions were available, with volume production slated for mid-1996. Faster 166 and 233 MHz versions were announced on 12 September 1996. Samples of these versions were available at announcement, with volume production slated for December 1996. Throughout 1996, the SA-110 was the highest performing microprocessor for portable devices. Towards the end of 1996 it was a leading CPU for internet/intranet appliances and thin client systems. The SA-110&#x27;s first design win was the Apple MessagePad 2000. It was also used in a number of products including the Acorn Computers Risc PC and Eidos Optima video editing system. The SA-110&#x27;s lead designers were Daniel W. Dobberpuhl, Gregory W. Hoeppner, Liam Madden, and Richard T. Witek.

===Description===

The SA-110 had a simple microarchitecture. It was a scalar design that executed instructions in-order with a five-stage classic RISC pipeline. The microprocessor was partitioned into several blocks, the IBOX, EBOX, IMMU, DMMU, BIU, WB and PLL. The IBOX contained hardware that operated in the first two stages of the pipeline such as the program counter. It fetched, decoded and issued instructions. Instruction fetch occurs during the first stage, decode and issue during the second. The IBOX decodes the more complex instructions in the ARM instruction set by translating them into sequences of simpler instructions. The IBOX also handled branch instructions. The SA-110 did not have branch prediction hardware, but had mechanisms for their speedy processing.

Execution starts at stage three. The hardware that operates during this stage is contained in the EBOX, which comprises the register file, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), barrel shifter, multiplier and condition code logic. The register file had three read ports and two write ports. The ALU and barrel shifter executed instructions in a single cycle. The multiplier is not pipelined and has a latency of multiple cycles.

The IMMU and DMMU are memory management units for instructions and data, respectively. Each MMU contained a 32-entry fully associative translation lookaside buffer (TLB) that can map 4 KB, 64 KB or 1 MB pages. The write buffer (WB) has eight 16-byte entries. It enables the pipelining of stores. The bus interface unit (BIU) provided the SA-110 with an external interface.

The PLL generates the internal clock signal from an external 3.68 MHz clock signal. It was not designed by DEC, but was contracted to the Centre Suisse d&#x27;Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM) located in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.

The instruction cache and data cache each have a capacity of 16 KB and are 32-way set-associative and virtually addressed. The SA-110 was designed to be used with slow (and therefore low-cost) memory and therefore the high set associativity allows a higher hit rate than competing designs, and the use of virtual addresses allows memory to be simultaneously cached and uncached. The caches are responsible for most of the transistor count and they take up half the die area.

The SA-110 contained 2.5 million transistors and is 7.8 mm by 6.4 mm large (49.92 mm2). It was fabricated by DEC in its proprietary CMOS-6 process at its Fab 6 fab in Hudson, Massachusetts. CMOS-6 was DEC&#x27;s sixth-generation complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process. CMOS-6 has a 0.35 μm feature size, a 0.25 μm effective channel length but for use with the SA-110, only three levels of aluminium interconnect. It used a power supply with a variable voltage of 1.2 to 2.2 volts (V) to enable designs to find a balance between power consumption and performance (higher voltages enable higher clock rates). The SA-110 was packaged in a 144-pin thin quad flat pack (TQFP).

==SA-1100==
The SA-1100 was a derivative of the SA-110 developed by DEC. Announced in 1997, the SA-1100 was targeted for portable applications such as PDAs and differs from the SA-110 by providing a number of features that are desirable for such applications. To accommodate these features, the data cache was reduced in size to 8 KB.

The extra features are integrated memory, PCMCIA, and color LCD controllers connected to an on-die system bus, and five serial I/O channels that are connected to a peripheral bus attached to the system bus. The memory controller supported FPM and EDO DRAM, SRAM, flash, and ROM. The PCMCIA controller supports two slots. The memory address and data bus is shared with the PCMCIA interface. Glue logic is required. The serial I/O channels implement a slave USB interface, a SDLC, two UARTs, an IrDA interface, a MCP, and a synchronous serial port.

The SA-1100 had a companion chip, the SA-1101. It was introduced by Intel on 7 October 1998. The SA-1101 provided additional peripherals to complement those integrated on the SA-1100 such as a video output port, two PS/2 ports, a USB controller and a PCMCIA controller that replaces that on the SA-1100. Design of the device started by DEC, but was only partially complete when acquired by Intel, who had to finish the design. It was fabricated at DEC&#x27;s former Hudson, Massachusetts fabrication plant, which was also sold to Intel.

The SA-1100 contained 2.5 million transistors and measured 8.24 mm by 9.12 mm (75.15 mm2). It was fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS process with three levels of aluminium interconnect and was packaged in a 208-pin TQFP.

One of the early recipients of this processor was-ill-fated Psion netBook and its more consumer oriented sibling Psion Series 7.

==SA-1110==
The SA-1110 was a derivative of the SA-110 developed by Intel. It was announced on 31 March 1999, positioned as an alternative to the SA-1100. At announcement, samples were set for June 1999 and volume later that year. Intel discontinued the SA-1110 in early 2003. The SA-1110 was available in 133 or 206 MHz versions. It differed from the SA-1100 by featuring support for 66 MHz (133 MHz version only) or 103 MHz (206 MHz version only) SDRAM. Its companion chip, which provided additional support for peripherals, was the SA-1111. The SA-1110 was packaged in a 256-pin micro ball grid array. It was used in mobile phones, personal data assistants (PDAs) such as the Compaq (later HP) iPAQ and HP Jornada, the Sharp SL-5x00 Linux Based Platforms and the Simputer. It was also used to run the Intel Web Tablet, a tablet device that is considered potentially the first to introduce large screen, portable web browsing. Intel dropped the product just prior to launch in 2001.

==SA-1500==
The SA-1500 was a derivative of the SA-110 developed by DEC initially targeted for set-top boxes. It was designed and manufactured in low volumes by DEC but was never put into production by Intel. The SA-1500 was available at 200 to 300 MHz. The SA-1500 featured an enhanced SA-110 core, an on-chip coprocessor called the &quot;Attached Media Processor&quot; (AMP), and an on-chip SDRAM and I/O bus controller. The SDRAM controller supported 100 MHz SDRAM, and the I/O controller implemented a 32-bit I/O bus that may run at frequencies up to 50 MHz for connecting to peripherals and the SA-1501 companion chip.

The AMP implemented a long-instruction-word instruction set containing instructions designed for multimedia, such as integer and floating-point multiply–accumulate operations and SIMD arithmetic. Each long-instruction word is 64 bits wide and specifies an arithmetic operation and a branch or a load/store. Instructions operate on operands from a 64-entry 36-bit register file, and on a set of control registers. The AMP communicates with the SA-110 core via an on-chip bus and it shares the data cache with the SA-110. The AMP contained an ALU with a shifter, a branch unit, a load/store unit, a multiply–accumulate unit, and a single-precision floating-point unit. The AMP supported user-defined instructions via a 512-entry writable control store.

The SA-1501 companion chip provided additional video and audio processing capabilities and various I/O functions such as PS/2 ports, a parallel port, and interfaces for various peripherals.

The SA-1500 contains 3.3 million transistors and measures 60 mm2. It was fabricated in a 0.28 μm CMOS process. It used a 1.5 to 2.0 V internal power supply and 3.3 V I/O, consuming less than 0.5 W at 100 MHz and 2.5 W at 300 MHz. It was packaged in a 240-pin metal quad flat package or a 256-ball plastic ball grid array.

==StrongARM latch==
The StrongARM latch is an electronic latch circuit topology first proposed by Toshiba engineers Tsuguo Kobayashi &quot;et al.&quot; and got significant attention after being used in StrongARM microprocessors. It is widely used as a sense amplifier, a comparator, or just a robust latch with high sensitivity.

<text>Shaul Mofaz (; 4 November 1948) is a retired Israeli military officer and politician. He joined the Israel Defense Forces in 1966 and served in the Paratroopers Brigade. He fought in the Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War, and Operation Entebbe with the paratroopers and Sayeret Matkal, an elite special forces unit. In 1998 he became the IDF&#x27;s sixteenth Chief of staff, serving until 2002. He is of Iranian Jewish ancestry.

After leaving the army, he entered politics. He was appointed Minister of Defense in 2002, holding the position until 2006, when he was elected to the Knesset on the Kadima list. He then served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transportation and Road Safety until 2009. After becoming Kadima leader in March 2012, he became Leader of the Opposition, before returning to the cabinet during a 70-day spell in which he served as Acting Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister and Minister without Portfolio. Kadima was reduced to just two seats in the 2013 elections, and Mofaz retired from politics shortly before the 2015 elections.

==Early life==
Shaul Mofaz was born Shahrām Mofazzazkār () on 4 November 1948 in Tehran, Iran, to Persian Jewish parents from Isfahan, and lived in Tehran until his family moved to Israel. His father was the principal of the ORT school in Tehran. Mofaz immigrated to Israel with his family in 1957 when he was nine years old. The family settled in Eilat, where Mofaz grew up. His father&#x27;s attempt to open a small factory in Eilat failed, and he had to support the family by working as a menial laborer. His family lived in a one-and-a-half-room apartment and his parents struggled to put food on the table. At age 10 he had to work in construction to help support his family. Mofaz attended a religious elementary school in Eilat. At age 14, his father sent him to an agricultural boarding school in Nahalal in the Jezreel Valley, where studies were combined with agricultural work. Mofaz recalled the boarding school as his first real exposure to wider Israeli society and struggling to fit in and be seen as a &quot;real Israeli&quot;, recalling that &quot;you&#x27;re in a class with children from Nahalal who are Israelis with real roots in the country, children of the valley nobility. These princes who live in the big houses on the big farms of Nahalal, and where do you come from? From nowhere, from Tehran, from Eilat, from a tiny apartment in a housing project.&quot; He became determined to become a paratrooper in the army, seeing it as a way to become fully Israeli.

== Military service ==
Upon graduating from high school in 1966, he was conscripted into Israel Defense Forces and served in the Paratroopers Brigade. He fought in the Six-Day War as a paratrooper on the southern front against the Egyptian Army. After his mandatory service, Mofaz remained in the IDF as a career officer. He became an officer in 1969, commanded a paratrooper platoon in the 890th Battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade, then commanded a company of the 890th Battalion in 1971. He took part in the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. During the Yom Kippur War, he participated in Operation Gown and Operation Davidka, two raids deep in Syrian territory. Mofaz became Deputy Commander of the 890th Battalion in 1974. He was appointed Deputy Commander of Sayeret Matkal, an elite commando unit, in 1975 and took part in Operation Entebbe the following year. After taking a sabbatical to study at Bar-Ilan University in 1976, he returned to active service in 1978. He was appointed commander of the 202nd Battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade, and became Deputy Commander of the Paratroopers Brigade in 1980. He commanded the 769th Territorial Brigade in 1981.

Mofaz was an infantry brigade commander during the 1982 Lebanon War. Afterward, he attended the US Marine Corps Command and Staff College in Quantico, Virginia, United States. On his return, he was briefly appointed IDF Command and Staff College commander before returning to active service. He was appointed Commander of the Paratroopers Brigade in 1986, and led its forces in counterinsurgency operations in the South Lebanon security zone. He played a major role in Operation Law and Order.

Mofaz served in a series of senior military posts and was promoted to Brigadier General in 1988. In 1993 he was made commander of the IDF forces in the West Bank. In 1994, he was promoted to Major General, commanding the Southern Command, during which the IDF battled Hamas and Islamic Jihad networks in the Gaza Strip. In 1996, he served as head of the Planning Directorate of the IDF General Staff. His rapid rise continued; in 1997, Mofaz was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff and Commander of the Operations Directorate. In 1998, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff.

His term as Chief of Staff was noted for financial and structural reforms of the IDF. His tenure also saw continued operations in the South Lebanon security zone and the withdrawal from the security zone in 2000. But the most significant event in his tenure was the Second Intifada eruption in September 2000. The tough tactics undertaken by Mofaz drew widespread concern from the international community but were broadly supported by the Israeli public. Controversy erupted over Israeli actions during the Battle of Jenin, intermittent raids in the Gaza Strip, and the continued isolation of Yasser Arafat.

Mofaz had foreseen the wave of violence as early as 1999 and prepared the IDF for intense guerrilla warfare in the territories. He fortified posts in the Gaza Strip and kept Israeli military casualties low. While he was known for claiming, &quot;Israel has the most moral army in the world,&quot; he drew criticism from both Israeli and international human rights monitoring groups because of the methods he had undertaken, including using armored bulldozers to demolish 2,500 Palestinian civilian homes, displacing thousands, to create a security &quot;buffer zone&quot; along the Rafah border.

==Political career==
Following a government crisis in 2002, Shaul Mofaz was appointed Defense Minister by Ariel Sharon. Although he supported an agreement with the Palestinians, he was willing to make no compromise in the war against militant groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Tanzim, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.

The fact that he had only recently left his position as IDF Chief of Staff prevented him from participating in the 2003 election (by which time Mofaz had joined Sharon&#x27;s Likud). Nevertheless, Sharon reappointed him as Defense Minister in the new government.

On 21 November 2005, Mofaz rejected Sharon&#x27;s invitation to join his new party, Kadima, and instead announced his candidacy for the leadership of Likud. But, on 11 December 2005, one day after he promised he would never leave the Likud, he withdrew from both the leadership race and the Likud to join Kadima.

Following the elections in late March 2006, Mofaz was moved from the position of Defense Minister and received the Transport ministry in the new Cabinet installed on 4 May 2006.

In 2008, with Israel&#x27;s then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, being pressured to resign due to corruption charges, Mofaz announced that he would run for the leadership of the Kadima party.

On 5 August 2008, Mofaz officially entered the race to be the leader of Kadima. That same day he received a blessing from Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. On 17 September 2008, he lost the Kadima party election, losing to Tzipi Livni for the spot of Kadima&#x27;s Prime Minister and leader. Livni&#x27;s narrow margin of 431 votes was 43.1% to Shaul Mofaz&#x27;s 42.0%, a huge difference from the 10 to 12-point exit polls margins. She said the &quot;national responsibility (bestowed) by the public brings me to approach this job with great reverence&quot;. Mofaz accepted the Kadima primary&#x27;s result, despite his lawyer, Yehuda Weinstein&#x27;s appeal advice, and telephoned Livni congratulating her. Livni got 16,936 votes, with 16,505 votes, for Mofaz. Public Security Minister Avi Dichter and Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit had 6.5% and 8.5%, respectively.

Placed second on the Kadima list, Mofaz retained his seat in the 2009 elections, but lost his cabinet position after Likud formed the government.

On 27 March 2012, Shaul Mofaz won the Kadima party leadership primaries by a landslide, defeating party chairwoman Tzipi Livni. Mofaz became Vice Prime Minister as part of a deal reached for a government of national unity with Binyamin Netanyahu. Mofaz said during the Kadima primaries that he would not join a government led by Netanyahu.

Mofaz had Kadima withdraw from the government coalition over Netanyahu&#x27;s indecision over a draft reform law and warned that the prime minister was trying to patch together a majority for a vote to plunge the region into war.

In 2013 Kadima, only four years after having been the ruling party, received a mere 2% of the votes, barely passing meeting the electoral threshold of the Knesset.

In the buildup to the 2015 elections Kadima was not expected to pass the threshold, as it was raised to 3.25%. Mofaz negotiated with the Zionist Union alliance to bring Kadima onto their slate, but ended negotiations when it became clear he would not be their candidate for Defense Minister. Immediately after Mofaz announced he was not joining the Zionist Union slate, it was announced the former Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel) head Amos Yadlin was appointed to the Zionist Union slate and would be their candidate for Defense Minister. Within a week of his announcement that he was not running with the Zionist Union, Mofaz announced his retirement from politics.

==Personal life==
Mofaz is married to Orit with four children. His son Yonatan, named for Yonatan Netanyahu, also became an IDF officer and attained the rank of Colonel. He lives in Kochav Yair.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalized version of Mofaz appeared in the 2008 drama film &quot;Lemon Tree&quot;.

<text>The Ministry for State Security (, ; abbreviated MfS), commonly known as the  (, an abbreviation of ), was the state security service and secret police of East Germany from 1950 to 1990. 

The function of the Stasi in East Germany (the GDR) resembled that of the KGB in the Soviet Union,⁠ in that it served to maintain state authority and the position of the ruling party, in this case the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). This was accomplished primarily through the use of a network of civilian informants who contributed to the arrest of approximately 250,000 people in East Germany. It also had a large elite paramilitary force, the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, that served as its armed wing. Known as &quot;the shield and the sword of the party&quot;, the Stasi locked up opponents of the regime. Officers tortured prisoners by isolating them, depriving them of sleep and using psychological tricks such as threatening to arrest relatives.

The Stasi also conducted espionage and other clandestine operations outside the GDR through its subordinate foreign-intelligence service, the Office of Reconnaissance, or Head Office A ( or HVA). Its operatives also maintained contacts in West Germany and throughout the western world; and are alleged to have occasionally cooperated with West German far-right terrorist groups, such as the Hepp-Kexel-Group.

The Stasi had its headquarters in East Berlin, with an extensive complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city. Erich Mielke, the Stasi&#x27;s longest-serving chief, controlled the organisation from 1957 to 1989 32 of the 40 years of the GDR&#x27;s existence. The HVA, under the leadership of Markus Wolf from 1952 to 1986, gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War.

After the German reunification of 1989–1991, some former Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes,
and the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were declassified so that all citizens could inspect their personal files on request. The Stasi Records Agency maintained the files until June 2021, when they became part of the German Federal Archives.

==Creation==
The Stasi was founded on 8 February 1950. Wilhelm Zaisser was the first Minister of State Security of the GDR, and Erich Mielke was his deputy. Zaisser tried to depose SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht after the June 1953 uprising, but was instead removed by Ulbricht and replaced with Ernst Wollweber thereafter. Following the June 1953 uprising, the Politbüro decided to downgrade the apparatus to a State Secretariat and incorporate it under the Ministry of the Interior under the leadership of Willi Stoph. The Minister of State Security simultaneously became a State Secretary of State Security. The Stasi held this status until November 1955, when it was restored to a ministry. Wollweber resigned in 1957 after clashes with Ulbricht and Erich Honecker, and was succeeded by his deputy, Erich Mielke.

In 1957, Markus Wolf became head of the Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung (HVA) (Main Reconnaissance Administration), the foreign-intelligence section of the Stasi. As intelligence chief, Wolf achieved great success in penetrating the government, political and business circles of West Germany with spies. The most influential case was that of Günter Guillaume, which led to the downfall of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in May 1974. In 1986, Wolf retired and was succeeded by Werner Grossmann.

==Relationship with Soviet Intelligence Services==

Although Mielke&#x27;s Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957, the KGB continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates at the Stasi headquarters and in each of the fifteen district headquarters around the GDR. The Stasi had also been invited by the KGB to establish operational bases in Moscow and Leningrad to monitor visiting East German tourists. Due to their close ties with Soviet intelligence services, Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as &quot;Chekists&quot;. The KGB used &#x27;low-visibility harassment&#x27; in order to control the population, and repress politically incorrect people and dissidents. This could involve causing unemployment, social isolation, and inducing mental and emotional health problems. Such methods formed the basis of the Stasi&#x27;s use of &quot;Zersetzung&quot; (trans. decomposition) which has been considered to be a perfected version. 
In 1978, Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers that they enjoyed in the Soviet Union. The British Broadcasting Corporation noted that KGB officer (and future Russian President) Vladimir Putin worked in Dresden, from 1985 to 1989, as a liaison officer to the Stasi from the KGB. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded to the reports by stating that &#x27;The KGB and the Stasi were partner intelligence agencies&#x27;.

==Operations==

===Personnel and recruitment===

Between 1950 and 1989, the Stasi employed a total of 274,000 people in an effort to root out the class enemy. In 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 people full-time, including 2,000 fully employed unofficial collaborators, 13,073 soldiers and 2,232 officers of the GDR army, along with 173,081 unofficial informants inside the GDR and 1,553 informants in West Germany.

Regular commissioned Stasi officers were recruited from conscripts who had been honourably discharged from their 18 months&#x27; compulsory military service, had been members of the SED, had had a high level of participation in the Party&#x27;s youth wing&#x27;s activities and had been Stasi informers during their service in the Military. The candidates would then have to be recommended by their military unit political officers and Stasi agents, the local chiefs of the District (Bezirk) Stasi and Volkspolizei office, of the district in which they were permanently resident, and the District Secretary of the SED. These candidates were then made to sit through several tests and exams, which identified their intellectual capacity to be an officer, and their political reliability. University graduates who had completed their military service did not need to take these tests and exams. They then attended a two-year officer training programme at the Stasi college (&quot;Hochschule&quot;) in Potsdam. Less mentally and academically endowed candidates were made ordinary technicians and attended a one-year technology-intensive course for non-commissioned officers.

By 1995, some 174,000 &quot;inoffizielle Mitarbeiter&quot; (IMs) Stasi informants had been identified, almost 2.5% of East Germany&#x27;s population between the ages of 18 and 60. 10,000 IMs were under 18 years of age. According to an interview with Joachim Gauck, there could have been as many as 500,000 informers. A former Stasi Colonel who served in the counterintelligence directorate estimated that the figure could be as high as 2 million if occasional informants were included. There is significant debate about how many IMs were actually employed.

===Infiltration===

Full-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants (the extent of any surveillance largely depended on how valuable a product was to the economy) and one tenant in every apartment building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the Volkspolizei (Vopo). Spies reported every relative or friend who stayed the night at another&#x27;s apartment. Tiny holes were drilled in apartment and hotel room walls through which Stasi agents filmed citizens with special video cameras. Schools, universities, and hospitals were extensively infiltrated, as were organizations, such as computer clubs where teenagers exchanged Western video games.

The Stasi had formal categorizations of each type of informant, and had official guidelines on how to extract information from, and control, those with whom they came into contact. The roles of informants ranged from those already in some way involved in state security (such as the police and the armed services) to those in the dissident movements (such as in the arts and the Protestant Church). Information gathered about the latter groups was frequently used to divide or discredit members. Informants were made to feel important, given material or social incentives, and were imbued with a sense of adventure, and only around 7.7%, according to official figures, were coerced into cooperating. A significant proportion of those informing were members of the SED. Use of some form of blackmail was not uncommon. A large number of Stasi informants were tram conductors, janitors, doctors, nurses and teachers. Mielke believed that the best informants were those whose jobs entailed frequent contact with the public.

The Stasi&#x27;s ranks swelled considerably after Eastern Bloc countries signed the 1975 Helsinki accords, which GDR leader Erich Honecker viewed as a grave threat to his regime because they contained language binding signatories to respect &quot;human and basic rights, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and conviction&quot;. The number of IMs peaked at around 180,000 in that year, having slowly risen from 20,000 to 30,000 in the early 1950s, and reaching 100,000 for the first time in 1968, in response to &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; and protests worldwide. The Stasi also acted as a proxy for the KGB to conduct activities in other Eastern Bloc countries, such as Poland, where the Soviets were despised.

The Stasi infiltrated almost every aspect of GDR life. In the mid-1980s, a network of IMs began growing in both German states. By the time that East Germany collapsed in 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 employees and 173,081 informants. About one out of every 63 East Germans collaborated with the Stasi. By at least one estimate, the Stasi maintained greater surveillance over its own people than any secret police force in history. The Stasi employed one secret policeman for every 166 East Germans. By comparison, the Gestapo deployed one secret policeman per 2,000 people. As ubiquitous as this was, the ratios swelled when informers were factored in: counting part-time informers, the Stasi had one agent per 6.5 people. This comparison led Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal to call the Stasi even more oppressive than the Gestapo. Stasi agents infiltrated and undermined West Germany&#x27;s government and spy agencies.

In some cases, spouses even spied on each other. A high-profile example of this was peace activist Vera Lengsfeld, whose husband, Knud Wollenberger, was a Stasi informant.

===&quot;Zersetzung&quot; (Decomposition)===

The Stasi perfected the technique of psychological harassment of perceived enemies known as &quot;Zersetzung&quot; () – a term borrowed from chemistry which literally means &quot;decomposition&quot;.

By the 1970s, the Stasi had decided that the methods of overt persecution that had been employed up to that time, such as arrest and torture, were too crude and obvious. Such forms of oppression were drawing significant international condemnation. It was realised that psychological harassment was far less likely to be recognised for what it was, so its victims, and their supporters, were less likely to be provoked into active resistance, given that they would often not be aware of the source of their problems, or even their exact nature. International condemnation could also be avoided. &quot;Zersetzung&quot; was designed to side-track and &quot;switch off&quot; perceived enemies so that they would lose the will to continue any &quot;inappropriate&quot; activities. Anyone who was judged to display politically, culturally, or religiously incorrect attitudes could be viewed as a &quot;hostile-negative&quot; force and targeted with &quot;Zersetzung&quot; methods. For this reason members of the Church, writers, artists, and members of youth sub-cultures were often the victims. Zersetzung methods were applied and further developed in a &quot;creative and differentiated&quot; manner based upon the specific person being targeted i.e. they were tailored based upon the target&#x27;s psychology and life situation.

Tactics employed under &quot;Zersetzung&quot; usually involved the disruption of the victim&#x27;s private or family life. This often included psychological attacks, such as breaking into their home and subtly manipulating the contents, in a form of gaslighting i.e. moving furniture around, altering the timing of an alarm, removing pictures from walls, or replacing one variety of tea with another etc. Other practices included property damage, sabotage of cars, travel bans, career sabotage, administering purposely incorrect medical treatment, smear campaigns which could include sending falsified, compromising photos or documents to the victim&#x27;s family, denunciation, provocation, psychological warfare, psychological subversion, wiretapping, bugging, mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries, even including sending a vibrator to a target&#x27;s wife. Increasing degrees of unemployment and social isolation could and frequently did occur due to the negative psychological, physical, and social ramifications of being targeted. Usually, victims had no idea that the Stasi were responsible. Many thought that they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide were sometimes the result. Direct physical attacks were not part of the process, even covertly. In 2000, the research group &quot;Projektgruppe Strahlen&quot; disputed claims that the Stasi had used X-ray projection against victims. The claims persisted, however, and in 2001 the Gauck Commission, a modern government agency investigating the activities of the Stasi, claimed that &#x27;unusual non-medical X-ray machines&#x27; found in political prisons could have been weapons and used to irradiate inmates. It was suspected that such exposure resulted in the deaths from cancer of a number of prominent dissidents.

One great advantage of the harassment perpetrated under &quot;Zersetzung&quot; was that its relatively subtle nature meant that it was able to be plausibly denied, including in diplomatic circles. This was important given that the GDR was trying to improve its international standing during the 1970s and 1980s, especially in conjunction with the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt massively improving relations between the two German states. For these political and operational reasons &quot;Zersetzung&quot; became the primary method of repression in the GDR.

== Structure ==
By the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Stasi had more than 100,000 employees, 11,000 of which were in the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, and the rest in the agency&#x27;s various departments. The MfS was organized into more than 40 different departments and branches, known as &quot;Hauptabteilungen&quot; (Main Departments), each covering a different aspect of its work:

==International operations==

After German reunification, revelations of the Stasi&#x27;s international activities were publicized, such as its military training of the West German Red Army Faction.

Given the close relationship between the KGB and the Stasi, their Third World operations featured a clear cut division in responsibilities. The Soviets supplied military hardware, money and military advisors, and the East Germans organized and trained secret police forces and intelligence departments. Cuba was the first main test run of setting up a new secret police and first-rate intelligence service. This operation helped to strengthen Cuban-East German relations, as well as open up the Stasi to intelligence collected by Cubans in the United States. The reputation of the Stasi was quite international, with the newly independent nation of Zanzibar making an immediate request for establishing a state security service, and East Germany being the first to recognize the country. Around the same time, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana also made a request, saying it was critical to his Pan-African movement. The Politburo decided to help African liberation movements with military and security assistance, under the de facto supervision of Honecker. The Derg regime was given assistance to build a state security apparatus, however there were several problems with the 100 Ethiopians sent to East German institutions. As Koehler puts it, &quot;For one thing, many of the Ethiopians lacked even an elementary education.&quot; Additionally the Stasi began training liberation movement members in Rhodesia, Mozambique, Nambia and Zimbabwe, as well as members of the ANC. The ANC operations were financed via counterfeit currencies under the auspices of Colonel Kurt Lewinsky. The Stasi was also operational in South Yemen, to keep control of the port of Aden in a friendly camp, so that it could keep weapons flowing to the PLO.
===Other examples===
* Stasi officers helped in initial training and indoctrination of Egyptian State Security organizations under the Nasser government from 1957 to 58 onwards. This was discontinued by Anwar Sadat in 1976.
* The Stasi organized and extensively trained the Ba&#x27;athist Syrian &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; (secret police) under the government of Hafez al-Assad and Ba&#x27;ath Party from 1966 onwards and especially from 1973.
* The Stasi sent agents to the West as sleeper agents. For instance, sleeper agent Günter Guillaume became a senior aide to social democratic chancellor Willy Brandt, and reported about his politics and private life.
* The Stasi operated at least one brothel. Agents were used against both men and women working in Western governments. &quot;Entrapment&quot; was used against married men and homosexuals.
* Martin Schlaff – According to the German parliament&#x27;s investigations, the Austrian billionaire&#x27;s Stasi codename was &quot;Landgraf&quot; and registration number &quot;3886-86&quot;. He made money by supplying embargoed goods to East Germany.
* Sokratis Kokkalis – Stasi documents suggest that the Greek businessman was a Stasi agent, whose operations included delivering Western technological secrets and bribing Greek officials to buy outdated East German telecom equipment.
* Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof Group) – The terrorist organization which killed dozens of West Germans and others received financial and logistical support from the Stasi, as well as shelter and new identities.
* The Stasi ordered a campaign in which cemeteries and other Jewish sites in West Germany were smeared with swastikas and other Nazi symbols. Funds were channelled to a small West German group for it to defend Adolf Eichmann. 
* The Stasi channelled large amounts of money to Neo-Nazi groups in West, with the purpose of discrediting the West. 
*The Stasi allowed the wanted West German Neo-Nazi Odfried Hepp to hide in East Germany and then provided him with a new identity so that he could live in the Middle East.
* The Stasi worked in a campaign to create extensive material and propaganda against Israel.
* Murder of Benno Ohnesorg – A Stasi informant in the West Berlin police, Karl-Heinz Kurras, fatally shot an unarmed demonstrator, which stirred a whole movement of Marxist radicalism, protest, and terrorist violence. &quot;The Economist&quot; describes it as &quot;the gunshot that hoaxed a generation&quot;. The surviving Stasi Records contain no evidence that Kurras was acting under their orders when he shot Ohnesorg.
* Operation Infektion—The Stasi helped the KGB to spread HIV/AIDS disinformation that the United States had created the disease. Millions of people around the world still believe these claims.
* Sandoz chemical spill—A German television documentary reported that the KGB ordered the Stasi to sabotage the chemical factory to distract attention from the Chernobyl disaster six months earlier in Ukraine.
* Investigators have found evidence of a death squad that carried out a number of assassinations (including assassination of Swedish journalist Cats Falck) on orders from the East German government from 1976 to 1987. Attempts to prosecute members failed.
* The Stasi attempted to assassinate Wolfgang Welsch, a famous critic of the East German government. Stasi collaborator Peter Haack (Stasi codename &quot;Alfons&quot;) befriended Welsch and then fed him hamburgers poisoned with thallium. It took weeks for doctors to find out why Welsch had suddenly lost his hair.
* Documents in the Stasi archives state that the KGB ordered Bulgarian agents to assassinate Pope John Paul II, who was known for his criticism of human rights in the Eastern Bloc, and the Stasi was asked to help with covering up traces.
* According to the National Review, a special unit of the Stasi assisted Romanian intelligence in kidnapping Romanian dissident Oliviu Beldeanu from West Germany.
* The Stasi in 1972 made plans to assist the Ministry of Public Security (Vietnam) in improving its intelligence work during the Vietnam War.
* In 1975, the Stasi recorded a conversation between senior West German CDU politicians Helmut Kohl and Kurt Biedenkopf. It was then &quot;leaked&quot; to &quot;Stern&quot; magazine as a transcript recorded by American intelligence. The magazine then claimed that Americans were wiretapping West Germans and the public believed the story.

==Fall of the Soviet Union==
Recruitment of informants became increasingly difficult towards unification, and after 1986 there was a negative turnover rate of IMs. This had a significant impact on the Stasi&#x27;s ability to survey the populace in a period of growing unrest, and knowledge of the Stasi&#x27;s activities became more widespread. Stasi had been tasked during this period with preventing the country&#x27;s economic difficulties becoming a political problem, through suppression of the very worst problems the state faced, but it failed to do so.

On 7 November 1989, in response to the rapidly changing political and social situation in the GDR in late 1989, Erich Mielke resigned. On 17 November 1989, the Council of Ministers &quot;(Ministerrat der DDR)&quot; renamed the Stasi the Office for National Security &quot;(Amt für Nationale Sicherheit&quot; – AfNS), which was headed by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Wolfgang Schwanitz. On 8 December 1989, GDR Prime Minister Hans Modrow directed the dissolution of the AfNS, which was confirmed by a decision of the &quot;Ministerrat&quot; on 14 December 1989.

As part of this decision, the &quot;Ministerrat&quot; originally called for the evolution of the AfNS into two separate organizations: a new foreign intelligence service &quot;(Nachrichtendienst der DDR)&quot; and an &quot;Office for the Protection of the Constitution of the GDR&quot; &quot;(Verfassungsschutz der DDR)&quot;, along the lines of the West German &quot;Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz&quot;. However, the public reaction was extremely negative, and under pressure from the &quot;Round Table&quot; &quot;(Runder Tisch)&quot;, the government dropped the creation of the &quot;Verfassungsschutz der DDR&quot; and directed the immediate dissolution of the AfNS on 13 January 1990. Certain functions of the AfNS reasonably related to law enforcement were handed over to the GDR Ministry of Internal Affairs. The same ministry also took guardianship of remaining AfNS facilities.

When the parliament of Germany investigated public funds that disappeared after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, it found out that East Germany had transferred large amounts of money to Martin Schlaff through accounts in Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, in return for goods &quot;under Western embargo&quot;.

Moreover, high-ranking Stasi officers continued their post-GDR careers in management positions in Schlaff&#x27;s group of companies. For example, in 1990, Herbert Kohler, Stasi commander in Dresden, transferred 170 million marks to Schlaff for &quot;harddisks&quot; and months later went to work for him.
The investigations concluded that &quot;Schlaff&#x27;s empire of companies played a crucial role&quot; in the Stasi attempts to secure the financial future of Stasi agents and keep the intelligence network alive.

==Recovery of Stasi files==
During the Peaceful Revolution of 1989, Stasi offices and prisons throughout the country were occupied by citizens, but not before the Stasi destroyed a number of documents (approximately 5%) consisting of, by one calculation, 1 billion sheets of paper.

===Storming the Stasi headquarters===

With the fall of the GDR, the Stasi was dissolved. Stasi employees began to destroy the extensive files and documents they held, either by hand or by using incineration or shredders. When these activities became known, a protest began in front of the Stasi headquarters. On the evening of 15 January 1990 a large crowd formed outside the gates and called for a stop to the destruction of sensitive files. The building contained vast records of personal files, many of which would supply important evidence in convicting those who had committed crimes for the Stasi. The protesters continued to grow in number until they were able to overcome the police and gain entry into the complex. Once inside, specific targets of the protesters&#x27; anger were portraits of Erich Honecker and Erich Mielke, which were torn down, trampled upon or burnt. Some Stasi employees were thrown out of upper floor windows and beaten after falling to the streets below, but there were no deaths or serious injuries. Among the protesters were former Stasi collaborators seeking to destroy incriminating documents.

===Stasi file controversy===
With German reunification on 3 October 1990, a new government agency was founded, called the Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic (), officially abbreviated &quot;BStU&quot;. There was a debate about what should happen to the files, whether they should be opened to the people or kept sealed.

Some of those who opposed opening the files cited privacy as a reason. They felt that the information in the files would lead to negative feelings about former Stasi members, and, in turn, cause violence. Pastor Rainer Eppelmann, who became Minister of Defense and Disarmament after March 1990, felt that new political freedoms for former Stasi members would be jeopardized by acts of revenge. Prime Minister Lothar de Maizière even went so far as to predict murder. They also argued against the use of the files to capture former Stasi members and prosecute them, arguing that not all former members were criminals and should not be punished solely for being a member. There were also some who believed that everyone was guilty of something. Peter-Michael Diestel, the Minister of Interior, opined that these files could not be used to determine innocence and guilt, claiming that &quot;there were only two types of individuals who were truly innocent in this system, the newborn and the alcoholic&quot;. Others, such as West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, believed in putting the Stasi past behind them and working on German reunification.

Those on the other side of the debate argued that everyone should have the right to see their own file, and that the files should be opened to investigate former Stasi members and prosecute them, as well as prevent them from holding office. Opening the files would also help clear up some of the rumors circulating at the time. Some believed that politicians involved with the Stasi should be investigated.

The fate of the files was finally decided under the Unification Treaty between the GDR and West Germany. This treaty took the Volkskammer law further and allowed more access and greater use of the files. Along with the decision to keep the files in a central location in the East, they also decided who could see and use the files, allowing people to see their own files.

In 1992, following a declassification ruling by the German government, the Stasi files were opened, allowing individuals to gain access to their files. Timothy Garton Ash, an English historian, after reading his file, wrote &quot;The File: A Personal History&quot;.

Between 1991 and 2011, around 2.75 million individuals, mostly GDR citizens, requested to see their own files. The ruling also gave people the ability to make duplicates of their documents. Another significant question was how the media could use and benefit from the documents. It was decided that the media could obtain files as long as they were depersonalized and did not contain information about individuals under the age of 18 or former Stasi members. This ruling not only granted file access to the media, but also to schools.

===Tracking down former Stasi informers with recovered files===
Some groups within the former Stasi community used threats of violence to scare off Stasi hunters, who were actively tracking down ex-members. Though these hunters succeeded in identifying many ex-Stasi, charges could not be brought against anyone merely for being a registered Stasi member. The person in question had to have participated in an illegal act. Among the high-profile individuals arrested and tried were Erich Mielke, Third Minister of State Security of the GDR, and Erich Honecker, GDR head of state. Mielke was sentenced to six years&#x27; prison for the 1931 murder of two policemen. Honecker was charged with authorizing the killing of would-be escapees along the east–west border and Berlin Wall. During his trial, he underwent cancer treatment. Nearing death, Honecker was allowed to spend his final years a free man. He died in Chile in May 1994.

===Reassembling destroyed files===
Reassembling the destroyed files has been relatively easy due to the number of archives and the failure of shredding machines (in some cases, &quot;shredding&quot; meant tearing pages in two by hand, making the documents easily recoverable). In 1995, the BStU began reassembling the shredded documents; 13 years later, the three dozen archivists commissioned to the projects had reassembled only 327 bags. Computer-assisted data recovery is now being used to reassemble the remaining 16,000 bagsrepresenting approximately 45 million pages. It is estimated that the task may require 30 million dollars to complete.

The CIA acquired some Stasi records during the looting of the Stasi&#x27;s archives. Germany asked for their return and received some in April 2000. See also Rosenholz files.

==Museums==

There are a number of memorial sites and museums relating to the Stasi in former Stasi prisons and administration buildings. In addition, offices of the Stasi Records Agency in Berlin, Dresden, Erfurt, Frankfurt-an-der-Oder and Halle (Saale) all have permanent and changing exhibitions relating to the activities of the Stasi in their region.

===Berlin===
* Stasi Museum (Berlin) - This is located at Ruschestraße 103, in &quot;Haus 1&quot; on the former Stasi headquarters compound. The office of Erich Mielke, the head of the Stasi, was in this building and it has been preserved along with a number of other rooms. The building was occupied by protesters on 15 January 1990. On 7 November 1990, a Research Centre and Memorial was opened, which now called the Stasi Museum.
* Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial - A memorial to repression during both the Soviet occupation and GDR era in a former prison that was used by both regimes. The building was a Soviet prison from 1946, and from 1951 until 1989 it was a Stasi remand centre. It officially closed on 3 October 1990, the day of German reunification. The museum and memorial site opened in 1994. It is in Alt-Hohenschönhausen, in Lichtenberg in north-east Berlin.

===Erfurt===

Memorial and Education Centre Andreasstraße - a museum in Erfurt which is housed in a former Stasi remand prison. From 1952 until 1989, over 5000 political prisoners were held on remand and interrogated in the Andreasstrasse prison, which was one of 17 Stasi remand prisons in the GDR. On 4 December 1989, local citizens occupied the prison and the neighbouring Stasi district headquarters to stop the mass destruction of Stasi files. It was the first time East Germans had undertaken such resistance against the Stasi and it instigated the take over of Stasi buildings throughout the country.

===Dresden===

 (The Bautzner Strasse Memorial in Dresden) - A Stasi remand prison and the Stasi&#x27;s regional head office in Dresden. It was used as a prison by the Soviet occupying forces from 1945 to 1953, and from 1953 to 1989 by the Stasi. The Stasi held and interrogated between 12,000 and 15,000 people during the time they used the prison. The building was originally a 19th-century paper mill. It was converted into a block of flats in 1933 before being confiscated by the Soviet army in 1945. The Stasi prison and offices were occupied by local citizens on 5 December 1989, during a wave of such takeovers across the country. The museum and memorial site was opened to the public in 1994.

===Frankfurt-an-der-Oder===
 - A memorial and museum at Collegienstraße 10 in Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, in a building that was used as a detention centre by the Gestapo, the Soviet occupying forces and the Stasi. The building was the Stasi district offices and a remand prison from 1950 until 1969, after which the Volkspolizei used the prison. From 1950 to 1952 it was an execution site where 12 people sentenced to death were executed. The prison closed in 1990. It has been a cultural centre and a memorial to the victims of political tyranny since June 1994, managed by the Museum Viadrina.

===Gera===
, a memorial and &#x27;centre of encounter&#x27; in Gera in a former remand prison, originally opened in 1874, that was used by the Gestapo from 1933 to 1945, the Soviet occupying forces from 1945 to 1949, and from 1952 to 1989 by the Stasi. The building was also the district offices of the Stasi administration. Between 1952 and 1989 over 2,800 people were held in the prison on political grounds. The memorial site opened with the official name &quot;Die Gedenk- und Begegnungsstätte im Torhaus der politischen Haftanstalt von 1933 bis 1945 und 1945 bis 1989&quot; in November 2005.

===Halle (Saale)===
The Roter Ochse (Red Ox) is a museum and memorial site at the prison at Am Kirchtor 20, Halle (Saale). Part of the prison, built 1842, was used by the Stasi from 1950 until 1989, during with time over 9,000 political prisoners were held in the prison. From 1954 it was mainly used for women prisoners. The name &quot;Roter Ochse&quot; is the informal name of the prison, possibly originating in the 19th century from the colour of the external walls. It still operates as a prison for young people. Since 1996, the building which was used as an interrogation centre by the Stasi and an execution site by the Nazis has been a museum and memorial centre for victims of political persecution.

===Leipzig===

* (Memorial Museum in the &quot;Round Corner&quot;) - The former Stasi district headquarters on &quot;am Dittrichring&quot; is now a museum focusing on the history and activities of the organisation. It is named after the curved shape of the front of the building. The Stasi used the building from 1950 until 1989. On the evening of 4 December 1989, it was occupied by protesters in order to stop the destruction of Stasi files. There has been a permanent exhibition on the site since 1990. The building also houses the Leipzig branch of the Stasi Records Agency, which holds about 10 km of files on its shelves.
* Lübschützer Teiche Stasi Bunker - The Stasi Bunker Museum is in Machern, a village about 30 km from Leipzig. It is managed by the Runde Ecke Museum administration. The bunker was built from 1968 to 1972, as a fallout shelter for the staff of the Stasi&#x27;s Leipzig administration in case of a nuclear attack. It could accommodate about 120 people. The bunker, which was disguised as a holiday resort on 5.2 hectares of land, was only discovered in December in 1989. &quot;The emergency command centre was a secretly-created complex, designed to maintain the Stasi leadership&#x27;s hold on power, even in exceptional circumstances.&quot; The whole grounds are classified as a historic monument and are open to the public on the last weekend of every month, and for pre-arranged group tours at other times.
* GDR Execution site - The execution site at Alfred-Kästner-Straße in south Leipzig, was the central site in East Germany where the death penalty was carried out from 1960 until 1981. It remains in its original condition. The management of the &quot;Runde Ecke&quot; Museum opens the site once a year on &quot;Museum night&quot; and on special state-wide days when historic buildings and sites that are not normally accessible to the public are opened.

===Magdeburg===
 - The memorial site at Moritzplatz in Magdeburg is a museum on the site of a former prison, built from 1873 to 1876, that was used by the Soviet administration from 1945 to 1949 and the Stasi from 1958 until 1989 to hold political prisoners. Between 1950 and 1958 the Stasi shared another prison with the civil police. The prison at Moritzplatz was used by the Volkspolizei from 1952 until 1958. Between 1945 and 1989, more than 10,000 political prisoners were held in the prison. The memorial site and museum was founded in December 1990.

===Potsdam===

* The memorial site and museum at Lindenstraße 54/55 in Potsdam, examines political persecution in the Nazi, Soviet occupation and GDR eras. The original building was built 1733–1737 as a baroque palace; it became a court and prison in 1820. From 1933, the Nazi regime held political prisoners there, many of whom were arrested for racial reasons, for example Jews who refused to wear the yellow star on their clothing.

The Soviet administration took over the prison in 1945, also using it as a prison for holding political prisoners on remand. The Stasi then used it as a remand prison, mainly for political prisoners from 1952 until 1989. Over 6,000 people were held in the prison by the Stasi during that time. On 27 October 1989, the prison freed all political prisoners due to a nationwide amnesty. On 5 December 1989, the Stasi Headquarters in Potsdam and the Lindenstrasse Prison were occupied by protesters. From January 1990 the building was used as offices for various citizens initiatives and new political groups, such as the Neue Forum. The building was opened to the public from 20 January 1990 and people were taken on tours of the site. It officially became a Memorial site in 1995.

===Rostock===
* - The memorial site is in a former Stasi remand prison at Hermanstrasse 34b. It is on what was part of a Stasi compound in Rostock, where its district headquarters were also located. Most of the site is now used by the Rostock county court and the University of Rostock. The complex was built 1958–1960. The remand prison was used by the Stasi from 1960 until 1989. About 4,900 people were held in the prison during that time, most of them were political prisoners. Most of prisoners were released after an amnesty issued on 27 October 1989. The Stasi prison in the Rostock compound was occupied by protesters on 4 December 1989 following a wave of such occupation across East Germany starting in Erfurt on the same day.

The prison closed in the early 1990s. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern took ownership of it in 1998, and the memorial site and museum were established in 1999. An extensive restoration of the site began in December 2018.

==Stasi officers after the reunification==

===Recruitment by Russian companies===
Former Stasi agent Matthias Warnig (codename &quot;Arthur&quot;) is currently the head of Nord Stream. Investigations have revealed that some key Gazprom Germania managers are former Stasi agents.

===Lobbying===

Former Stasi officers continue to be politically active via the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanitären Unterstützung&quot; (GRH, Society for Legal and Humanitarian Support). Former high-ranking officers and employees of the Stasi, including the last Stasi director, Wolfgang Schwanitz, make up the majority of the organization&#x27;s members, and it receives support from the German Communist Party, among others.

The impetus for the establishment of the GRH was provided by the criminal charges filed against the Stasi in the early 1990s. The GRH, decrying the charges as &quot;victor&#x27;s justice&quot;, called for them to be dropped. Today the group provides an alternative if a somewhat utopian voice in the public debate on the GDR&#x27;s legacy. It calls for the closure of the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial and can be a vocal presence at memorial services and public events. In March 2006 in Berlin, GRH members disrupted a museum event; a political scandal ensued when the Berlin Senator (Minister) of Culture refused to confront them.

Behind the scenes, the GRH also lobbies people and institutions promoting opposing viewpoints. For example, in March 2006, the Berlin Senator for Education received a letter from a GRH member and former Stasi officer attacking the Museum for promoting &quot;falsehoods, anti-communist agitation and psychological terror against minors&quot;. Similar letters have also been received by schools organizing field trips to the museum.

<text>Sandra Annette Bullock (; born July 26, 1964) is an American actress and film producer. The highest-paid actress of 2010 and 2014, Bullock&#x27;s filmography spans both comedy and drama, and her accolades include an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. She was named one of &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in the world in 2010.

After making her acting debut with a minor role in the thriller &quot;Hangmen&quot; (1987), Bullock received early attention for her supporting role in the action film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (1993). Her breakthrough in the action thriller &quot;Speed&quot; (1994) led to leading roles in the romantic comedy &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; (1995), and the dramas &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996) and &quot;Hope Floats&quot; (1998). She achieved further success in the following decades with the comedies &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000), &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002), &quot;The Proposal&quot; (2009), &quot;The Heat&quot; (2013), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Lost City&quot; (2022); the dramas &quot;Crash&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Unforgivable&quot; (2021); and the thrillers &quot;Premonition&quot; (2007) and &quot;Bird Box&quot; (2018). For her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy in the biographical drama &quot;The Blind Side&quot; (2009), Bullock won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was nominated for the same award for playing an astronaut stranded in space in the science fiction thriller &quot;Gravity&quot; (2013), which is her highest-grossing live-action film.

In addition to acting, Bullock is the founder of the production company Fortis Films. She has produced some of the films in which she has starred, including &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot; (2005) and &quot;All About Steve&quot; (2009), and served as an executive producer on the ABC sitcom &quot;George Lopez&quot; (2002–2007), on which she made numerous appearances. Dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s sweetheart&quot; by the media, Bullock was also named the Most Beautiful Woman by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 2015.

==Early life and education==
Bullock was born on July 26, 1964, in Arlington County, Virginia, the daughter of Helga Mathilde (née Meyer; 1942–2000), an opera singer and voice teacher from Germany, and John Wilson Bullock (1925–2018), an Army employee and part-time voice coach from Birmingham, Alabama. Her father, who was in charge of the Army&#x27;s Military Postal Service in Europe, was stationed in Nuremberg when he met her mother. Her parents married in Germany. Bullock&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a German rocket scientist from Nuremberg. The family returned to Arlington, where her father worked with the Army Materiel Command before becoming a contractor for The Pentagon. Bullock has a younger sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, who served as president of Bullock&#x27;s production company Fortis Films.

For 12 years, Bullock lived in Nuremberg, West Germany, and Vienna and Salzburg, Austria, and grew up speaking German. She had a Waldorf education in Nuremberg. As a child, while her mother went on European opera tours, Bullock usually stayed with her aunt Christl and cousin Susanne, the latter of whom later married politician Peter Ramsauer. Bullock studied ballet and vocal arts as a child and frequently accompanied her mother, taking small parts in her opera productions. In Nuremberg, she sang in the opera&#x27;s children&#x27;s choir. Bullock has a scar above her left eye which was caused by a fall into a creek when she was a child. While she maintains her American citizenship, she applied for German citizenship in 2009.

Bullock attended Washington-Lee High School, where she was a cheerleader and performed in school theater productions. After graduating in 1982, she attended East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, where she received a BFA in Drama in 1987. While at East Carolina, she performed in theater productions, including &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. She then moved to Manhattan, New York, where she supported herself as a bartender, cocktail waitress, and coat checker while auditioning for roles.

==Career==

While in New York, Bullock took acting classes with Sanford Meisner. She appeared in several student films and later landed a role in an Off-Broadway play &quot;No Time Flat&quot;. Director Alan J. Levi was impressed by Bullock&#x27;s performance and offered her a part in the made-for-television film &quot;Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman&quot; (1989). This led to her being cast in a series of small roles in several independent films, and in the lead role of the short-lived NBC television version of the film &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1990). She went on to appear in several films, such as &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot; (1992), &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot; (1993) and &quot;Fire on the Amazon&quot; (1993), before her supporting role in the sci-fi action film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (1993).

In 1994, she played Annie Porter, a passenger eventually driving a bus that was rigged by a terrorist, in the smash-hit blockbuster &quot;Speed&quot; alongside Keanu Reeves. She was required to read for &quot;Speed&quot; to ensure that there was the right chemistry between her and Reeves. She recalls they had to do &quot;all these really physical scenes together, rolling around on the floor and stuff.&quot; &quot;Speed&quot; received critical acclaim, with Rotten Tomatoes calling it a &quot;terrific popcorn thriller [with] outstanding performances from Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and Sandra Bullock&quot;, grossed $350 million worldwide, and helped establish Bullock as a Hollywood actress. She won Best Actress at the 21st Saturn Awards and Best Female Performance and Most Desirable Female at the 1995 MTV Movie Awards.

Bullock headlined the romantic comedy &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; (1995) as a lonely Chicago Transit Authority token collector who saves the life of a man. The film had a positive reception from critics, who felt that it was &quot;assembled with such skill—and with such a charming performance from Sandra Bullock—that it gives formula a good name.&quot; She received her first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. The thriller &quot;The Net&quot; (also 1995), starred Bullock as a computer programmer who stumbles upon a conspiracy that puts her life and the lives of those around her in great danger. Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, complimented her performance, saying, &quot;Bullock pulls you into the movie. Her overripe smile and clear, imploring eyes are sometimes evocative of Julia Roberts&quot;. &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; and &quot;The Net&quot; made $182 million and $110.6 million, respectively.

=== Worldwide recognition (1996–2007) ===
In &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996), a legal drama based on John Grisham&#x27;s 1989 novel of the same name, Bullock portrayed a member of the defense team in the trial for the murder of two men who raped a young girl, opposite Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey and Kevin Spacey. She received an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Female Performance. She subsequently received $11 million for &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot; (1997), which she agreed to star in for financial backing for her next project, &quot;Hope Floats&quot; (1998). Unlike the original film, &quot;Speed 2&quot; was a critical and commercial flop that she later disparaged. In &quot;Hope Floats&quot;, she starred as an unassuming housewife whose life is disrupted when her husband (played by Michael Paré) reveals his infidelity to her on a talk show. Critic James Berardinelli remarked that her &quot;undisputed strength lies in a blend of light drama and comedy&quot;. That film was a commercial success, grossing $81.4 million worldwide.

Bullock starred in the comedy &quot;Practical Magic&quot; (1998) alongside Nicole Kidman as two witch sisters who face a curse which threatens to prevent them ever finding lasting love. While the film opened atop the chart on its North American opening weekend, it flopped at the box office. That year, she voiced Miriam in the DreamWorks Animation film &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; and wrote, produced, and directed the short film &quot;Making Sandwiches&quot;. She next played a free-spirited drifter who begins to talk to a writer (Ben Affleck) in the romantic comedy &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; (1999), on which &quot;Boxoffice Magazine&quot; remarked: &quot;The combination of Affleck&#x27;s deadpan by-the-book persona with the spontaneity of Bullock&#x27;s character sparks with convincing chemistry.&quot; &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; made $93 million worldwide. Bullock took on the role of an FBI agent who must go undercover as a beauty pageant contestant in the comedy &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000), which became another financial success, with a global gross of $212 million. It earned her a second nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. In &quot;28 Days&quot; (also 2000), a dramedy directed by Betty Thomas, Bullock starred as a newspaper columnist obliged to enter a rehabilitation program for alcoholism.

Bullock starred in the psychological thriller &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; (2002) as a seasoned homicide detective. Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of a possible four, stating: &quot;Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability, creating a character you&#x27;d like to like, and could like, if she weren&#x27;t so sad, strange and turned in upon herself.&quot; She teamed up with Hugh Grant for the romantic comedy &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (also 2002), in which she starred as a lawyer who walks out on her boss. Liz Braun, of &quot;Jam! Movies&quot;, found Bullock and Grant to be &quot;perfectly paired&quot;, stating: &quot;The script allows the two actors to be at their comedic best, even though the film as a whole is amateurish in many ways&quot;. &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; made $199 million globally. That year, she was presented with the Raul Julia Award for Excellence for helping expand career openings for Hispanic talent in the media and entertainment industry as the executive producer of the sitcom &quot;George Lopez&quot; (2002–2007). She also made several appearances on the show as Accident Amy, an accident-prone employee at the factory Lopez&#x27;s character manages.

As part of a large ensemble cast, Bullock played the wife of a district attorney in the drama &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. She received positive reviews for her performance, with some critics suggesting that it was the best performance of her career to that point. For &quot;Crash&quot;, she received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture along with the rest of the cast. She next received a $17.5 million salary for &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot;, which Roger Ebert called a &quot;doubly unnecessary&quot; sequel. She was a co-recipient of the 2005 Women in Film Crystal Award. In 2006, Bullock reunited with Keanu Reeves for the romantic drama &quot;The Lake House&quot;, although their characters were separated throughout the film and they were only on set together for two weeks during filming, and played Harper Lee in &quot;Infamous&quot;, a drama based on George Plimpton&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Truman Capote&quot;, alongside Toby Jones and Daniel Craig. &quot;The Lake House&quot; was a financial success, while &quot;Infamous&quot; received generally positive reviews. Bullock headlined the supernatural thriller &quot;Premonition&quot; (2007) as a housewife who experiences the days surrounding her husband&#x27;s death in non-chronological order. Despite negative reviews, the film grossed $84.1 million worldwide.

=== Established career (2008–2014)===
In 2009, Bullock starred as a pushy editor-in-chief in the romantic comedy &quot;The Proposal&quot;, opposite Ryan Reynolds, which grossed $317 million at the worldwide box office, making it her fourth-most successful picture to date. She received her third nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. That same year, the drama &quot;The Blind Side&quot; opened at number two behind &quot;New Moon&quot; with $34.2 million, making it Bullock&#x27;s second-highest opening weekend ever; it went on to gross over $309 million, making it her highest-grossing domestic film, her fourth-highest-grossing film worldwide, and the first one in history to pass the $200 million mark with only one top-billed female star. Bullock portrayed Leigh Anne Tuohy, the adoptive mother of Michael Oher, a role she had initially turned down three times due to discomfort in portraying a devout Christian. She was awarded the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. &quot;The Blind Side&quot; also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Winning the Oscar also gave Bullock another unique distinction: the prior night, she won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress for her performance as an eccentric crossword puzzle writer in &quot;All About Steve&quot; (2009), becoming the only actor in history to win both awards for the same year.

By 2010, Bullock was said to be &quot;courted for virtually every female starring role Hollywood has to offer&quot;, according to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Ben Affleck, her co-star in the romantic comedy &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; (1999), stated: &quot;Every movie you hear about and every script I see, they say, &#x27;We&#x27;re going after Sandra Bullock for the woman&#x27;.&quot; She decided to eschew &quot;the torrent of offers&quot; in favour of &quot;quietly [putting] acting on hold&quot; to focus on her personal life. She also became &quot;more selective&quot; with the projects that she accepted, on which she said: &quot;As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I say &#x27;No&#x27; a lot more. I&#x27;ve become a better fighter for my work. I didn&#x27;t have the guts to do that before&quot;. In 2010, she was the world&#x27;s highest-paid actress. She would next star alongside Tom Hanks as a widow of the September 11 attacks in the drama &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot; (2011), a film adaptation based on the novel of the same name. Despite mixed reviews, the film was nominated for numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Picture. Bullock was nominated for Favorite Actress Drama by Teen Choice Awards.

In 2013, Bullock starred alongside Melissa McCarthy in the comedy &quot;The Heat&quot; as an FBI Special Agent who, along with a city detective, must take down a mobster in Boston. It received positive reviews from critics, and took in $230 million at the worldwide box office. Bullock subsequently played an astronaut stranded in space in the sci-fi thriller &quot;Gravity&quot;, opposite George Clooney, which premiered at the 70th Venice Film Festival and was released on October 4, 2013, to coincide with the beginning of World Space Week. &quot;Gravity&quot; received universal critical acclaim and a standing ovation in Venice. The film was called &quot;the most realistic and beautifully choreographed film ever set in space&quot; and certain critics considered Bullock&#x27;s performance to be the best of her career. &quot;Gravity&quot; grossed $716 million worldwide to become Bullock&#x27;s second-most successful film. For her role as Dr. Ryan Stone, Bullock was nominated for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. On her performance, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: Bullock inhabits the role with grave dignity and hints at Stone&#x27;s past scars with sensitivity and tact, and she holds the screen effortlessly once &quot;Gravity&quot; becomes a veritable one-woman show [...] the actress remains fully present emotionally, projecting a very appealing combo of vulnerability, intelligence and determination that not only wins us over immediately, but sustains attention all the way through the cathartic closing reels. In 2014, she was Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actress.

===Success with limited work (2015–present)===
Bullock provided her voice for Scarlet Overkill, the villainous character, in the animated film &quot;Minions&quot; (2015), which became her highest-grossing film to date with a worldwide gross of over $1.1 billion. In 2015, she served as an executive producer and starred, as a political consultant hired to help win a Bolivian presidential election, in the drama &quot;Our Brand Is Crisis&quot;, based on the 2005 documentary film of the same name by Rachel Boynton. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; found Bullock&#x27;s portrayal to be &quot;easily one of the best female roles of the last 10 years&quot;, but film had the worst wide release opening of her career. 

In &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; (2018), an all-female spin-off of the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; franchise directed by Gary Ross, Bullock played Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who helps plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala in New York City. Writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Josh Spieger called the film a &quot;welcome return to the big screen for Bullock&quot; and observed: &quot;She has reached a point in her career where she chooses her roles with care; before &quot;Gravity&quot;, she&#x27;d only co-starred in a handful of films over the previous five years, including her Oscar-winning turn in &quot;The Blind Side&quot;. &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; is Bullock&#x27;s first true franchise film in decades [...] and it suggests that her decision to be more selective in which projects she picks can pay off in dividends&quot;. &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; had the best debut for the franchise, and ultimately made $297 million globally.

Her next role was that of Malorie, a woman who must find a way to guide herself and her children to safety despite the potential threat from an unseen adversary, in the Netflix post-apocalyptic horror film &quot;Bird Box&quot; (2018), based on the novel of the same name. She received acclaim for her performance, with &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The Wrap&quot; describing it as &quot;wonderfully self-reliant&quot;, and &quot;fascinating and terrifying to watch,&quot; respectively. &quot;Bird Box&quot; was the most-watched film on Netflix within 28 days of its release until 2021. In another production for Netflix, Nora Fingscheidt&#x27;s drama &quot;The Unforgivable&quot; (2021), Bullock played a woman who is released from prison after serving a sentence for a violent crime. It became the fifth most-streamed-film on the platform at the time of its release.

She took on the role of a successful yet depressed best-selling romance novelist in Paramount Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Lost City&quot; (2022), a &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;-style romantic comedy–adventure film, directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, opposite Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe. The film was favorably received by critics, who praised the chemistry between Bullock and Tatum, and grossed $190.8 million globally, which made Bullock &quot;the first actress to have $100 million earners in live-action star vehicles over four different decades&quot;, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. She also featured in the Brad Pitt-starring action thriller &quot;Bullet Train&quot; (2022), in a mostly vocal performance.

== Other endeavours ==
===Business ventures===
Bullock owns the production company Fortis Films, through which she has served as a producer for several of her star vehicles, including &quot;Hope Floats&quot; (1998), &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000), &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002) and &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot; (2005), as well as for the sitcom &quot;George Lopez&quot; (2002–2007). Her father, John Bullock, was the company&#x27;s CEO and her sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, is the former president. The company is headquartered in Austin, Texas and West Hollywood, California.

In November 2006, Bullock founded an Austin, Texas, restaurant named Bess Bistro which was located on West 6th Street. She later opened another business, Walton&#x27;s Fancy and Staple, across the street in a building she extensively renovated. Walton&#x27;s is a bakery, upscale restaurant, and floral shop that also offers services including event planning. After almost nine years in business, Bess Bistro closed on September 20, 2015.

===Philanthropy===
Bullock has been a public supporter of the American Red Cross and has donated $1 million to the organization at least five times. Her first public donation of that amount was to the Liberty Disaster Relief Fund. Three years later, she sent money in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis. In 2010, she donated $1 million to relief efforts in Haiti following the Haiti earthquake and again donated the same amount following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. She donated $1 million in 2017 to support relief efforts for Hurricane Harvey in Texas.

In 2010, along with other public figures, Bullock made a public service announcement urging people to sign a petition for clean-up efforts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Bullock was inducted into the Warren Easton Hall of Fame in 2012, for her donations to charities, and was honored with the Favorite Humanitarian Award at the 39th People&#x27;s Choice Awards, for her contributions to New Orleans&#x27; Warren Easton High School, which was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina.

In 2014, Bullock designed a space-themed Paddington Bear statue, dubbed &quot;Gravity Bear&quot; (a reference to her 2013 film &quot;Gravity&quot;), which was located at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich (one of 50 placed around London), which was auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

==Public image==

Bullock has been dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s sweetheart&quot; by the media in reference to her &quot;friendly and direct and so unpretentious&quot; nature. She was selected as one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People in the world in 1996, 1999, and 2011. The publication named her as its Woman of the Year in 2010 as well as the Most Beautiful Woman in 2015.

In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Bullock in its annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 as one of the most influential people in the world, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named her The Most Powerful Actress in Hollywood. In she joined other Hollywood legends at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard in making imprints of her hands and feet in cement of the theater&#x27;s forecourt. That year, she was named among The Most Powerful Women in Entertainment by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and Entertainer of the Year, due to her success with &quot;The Heat&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;, by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Bullock ranked #2 on the 2014 &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of most powerful actresses and was honored with the Decade of Hotness Award by Spike Guys&#x27; Choice Awards.

==Personal life==
Bullock owns properties in Los Angeles, Austin and New Orleans.

On December 20, 2000, she was in a private jet crash on a runway from which she and the two crew escaped uninjured. Pilot error and blizzard conditions were responsible. The crew were unable to activate the runway lights during a night landing at Jackson Hole Airport.

Bullock won a multimillion-dollar judgment against Benny Daneshjou, the builder of her Lake Austin, Texas, home in October 2004. The jury ruled that the house was uninhabitable. It has since been torn down and rebuilt. Daneshjou and his insurer later settled with Bullock for roughly half the awarded verdict.

While Bullock was in Massachusetts on April 18, 2008, shooting &quot;The Proposal&quot;, she and her then-husband Jesse James were in a vehicle that was hit head-on by a drunk driver. They were uninjured.

===Relationships and family===

Bullock was once engaged to actor Tate Donovan, whom she met while filming &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot;. Their relationship lasted three years. She dated football player Troy Aikman and actors Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Gosling.

Bullock married motorcycle builder and &quot;Monster Garage &quot;host Jesse James on July 16, 2005. They first met when Bullock arranged for her ten-year-old godson to meet James as a Christmas present. In November 2009, Bullock and James entered into a custody battle with James&#x27; second ex-wife, former adult film actress Janine Lindemulder, with whom James had a child. Bullock and James subsequently won full legal custody of James&#x27; five-year-old daughter.

A scandal arose in March 2010 when several women claimed to have had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock. Bullock canceled European promotional appearances for &quot;The Blind Side&quot; citing &quot;unforeseen personal reasons&quot;. On March 18, 2010, James responded to the rumors of infidelity by issuing a public apology to Bullock. He stated, &quot;The vast majority of the allegations reported are untrue and unfounded [...] beyond that, I will not dignify these private matters with any further public comment.&quot; James declared, &quot;There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me.&quot; He asked that Bullock and their children one day &quot;find it in their hearts to forgive me&quot; for their &quot;pain and embarrassment&quot;. James&#x27; publicist subsequently announced on March 30, 2010, that James had checked into a rehabilitation facility to &quot;deal with personal issues&quot; and save his relationship to Bullock. On April 23, 2010, Bullock filed for divorce in Austin, Texas. Their divorce was finalized on June 28, 2010, with &quot;conflict of personalities&quot; cited as the reason.

Bullock announced in 2010 that she had proceeded with plans to adopt a son born in January 2010 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Bullock and James had begun an initial adoption process four months earlier. Bullock&#x27;s son began living with them in January 2010 but they chose to keep the news private until after the Oscars ceremony that March. Given the pair&#x27;s split and subsequent divorce, Bullock continued the adoption of her son as a single parent. Bullock announced in December 2015 that she had adopted a second child and appeared on the cover of &quot;People&quot; magazine with her then three-year-old new daughter.

Bullock was in a relationship with photographer Bryan Randall from mid-2015 until Randall&#x27;s death due to ALS on August 5, 2023. 

===Stalking incidents===
Beginning in 2002 Bullock was stalked across several states by a man named Thomas James Weldon. Bullock obtained a restraining order against him in 2003, which was renewed in 2006. After the restraining order expired and Weldon was released from a mental institution, he again traveled through several states to find Bullock; she then obtained another restraining order.

On April 22, 2007, a woman named Marcia Diana Valentine was found lying outside James and Bullock&#x27;s home in Orange County, California. When James confronted the woman, she ran to her car, got behind the wheel and tried to run him over. She was said to be an obsessed fan of Bullock. Valentine was charged with one felony count each of aggravated assault and stalking. Bullock obtained a restraining order to bar Valentine from &quot;contacting or coming near her home, family or work for three years&quot;. Valentine pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and stalking. She was subsequently convicted of stalking and sentenced to three years&#x27; probation.

Joshua James Corbett broke into Bullock&#x27;s Los Angeles home in June 2014. Bullock locked herself in a room and dialed 911. Corbett pleaded no contest in 2017 and was sentenced to five years&#x27; probation for stalking Bullock and breaking into her residence. He was then subject to a ten-year protective order that required him to stay away from Bullock. After Corbett missed a court date the previous month, police officers went to his parents&#x27; residence on May 2, 2018, where he lived in a guest house, to arrest him. He refused to leave and threatened to shoot officers. A SWAT team was called and, after a five-hour standoff, they deployed gas canisters and entered the house where they found Corbett had committed suicide. Corbett&#x27;s death was the result of &quot;multiple incised wounds&quot; according to the Los Angeles County coroner.

<text>Smallfilms is a British television production company that made animated TV programmes for children from 1959 until the 1980s. In 2014 the company began operating again, producing a new series of its most famous show, &quot;The Clangers&quot;, but it became dormant again in 2017, after production of the show was slightly changed. It was originally a partnership between Oliver Postgate (who wrote the scripts, animated the characters, and voiced many of the characters) and Peter Firmin (who made the models of the characters and drew the artwork). Several popular series of short films were made using stop-motion animation, including &quot;Clangers&quot;, &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot; and &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;. Another Smallfilms production, &quot;Bagpuss&quot;, came top of a BBC poll to find the favourite British children&#x27;s programme of the 20th century.

==Background==
In 1957, Postgate was appointed a stage manager with Associated-Rediffusion, the company that then held the commercial weekday television franchise for London. Attached to the children&#x27;s programming section, he thought he could do better with the relatively low budgets of the then black and white television productions.

He wrote &quot;Alexander the Mouse&quot;, a story about a mouse born to be king. Using an Irish-produced magnetic system - on which animated characters were magnetically attached to a painted background, then filmed using a 45 degree mirror - he persuaded Peter Firmin, who was then teaching at the Central School of Art, to create the painted backgrounds. Postgate later recalled that they broadcast around 26 of these programmes live-to-air, a task made harder by the production problems encountered by the use and restrictions of using magnets.

After the relative success of &quot;Alexander the Mouse&quot;, Postgate agreed a deal to make his next series on film, for a budget of £175 per programme (a minuscule amount even at that time). Making a stop motion animation table in his bedroom, he wrote the Chinese serial &quot;The Journey of Master Ho&quot;: a formal Chinese epic, about a small boy and a water-buffalo. This was intended for deaf children, a distinct advantage in that the production required no soundtrack, which reduced production costs. He engaged a painter to produce the backgrounds, but as the painter was classically Chinese-trained he produced them in three-quarter view, rather than in the conventional Egyptian full-view manner needed for flat animation under a camera. This resulted in Firmin&#x27;s characters looking as if they were short in one leg, but the success of the production provided the foundation for Postgate and Firmin to start up their own company, solely producing animated children&#x27;s television programmes, initially for ITV, but soon afterward with the BBC.

Postgate&#x27;s initial BBC career was not solely concerned with Smallfilms. To gain experience, he accepted a contract as a television director in the BBC Children&#x27;s Department in 1960, on a show entitled &quot;Little Laura&quot;, another animated series made on film, written and drawn by V. H. Drummond. The series continued in production until 1962, with Postgate credited also as animator on the 1962 series. He also wrote serials for long-running BBC children&#x27;s programmes &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and stories for &quot;Vision On&quot;.

==History of Smallfilms==

Setting up the business in a disused cowshed at Firmin&#x27;s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, Postgate and Firmin made children&#x27;s animation programmes, based on concepts that mostly originated from Postgate. Firmin did the artwork and built the models, whilst Postgate wrote the scripts, did the stop motion filming, and voiced many of the characters. &quot;Smallfilms&quot; was able to produce two minutes of TV-ready film per day, twelve times as much as a conventional stop motion animation studio, with Postgate moving the (originally cardboard) characters himself, and working his 16mm camera frame-by-frame with a home-made clicker. As Postgate voiced so many of the productions, including the WereBear story tapes, his distinctive voice became familiar to generations of children.

They began in 1959 with &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, a series for ITV about a Welsh steam locomotive who wanted to sing in a choir, based on Postgate&#x27;s wartime encounter with Welshman Denzyl Ellis, who was once a fireman on the Royal Scot. It was remade in colour for the BBC in the 1970s. This was followed, also in 1959, by &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot;, their first production for the BBC, which established Smallfilms as a safe and reliable pair of hands to produce children&#x27;s entertainment, in the days when the number of UK television channels was restricted to two.

&quot;Noggin the Nog&quot; was also remade in colour in 1982. However, only six episodes were produced, due to the BBC believing that Smallfilms’ work was “old-fashioned”.

In 2000, Postgate and his friend Loaf set up a small publishing company called The Dragons Friendly Society, to look after &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot;, &quot;Pogles&#x27; Wood&quot; and &quot;Pingwings&quot;.

After Postgate&#x27;s death in December 2008, Smallfilms was inherited by his son Daniel. Universal took the distribution rights to the works of Smallfilms. Any such agreement does not include the materials published through The Dragons Friendly Society.

In 2014, Daniel collaborated with Firmin on the production of a new series of &quot;Clangers&quot;, with Daniel writing many of the episodes.

==Series development and philosophy==
Postgate and Firmin recognised that their product was not sold to children, but to commissioning television executives. Postgate described in a later interview the then &quot;gentlemanly and rather innocent&quot; business of programme commissioning thus: &quot;We would go to the BBC once a year, show them the films we&#x27;d made, and they would say: &#x27;Yes, lovely, now what are you going to do next?&#x27; We would tell them, and they would say: &#x27;That sounds fine, we&#x27;ll mark it in for eighteen months from now&#x27;, and we would be given praise and encouragement and some money in advance, and we&#x27;d just go away and do it&quot;. The only occasion that this informal arrangement caused any real difficulty emerged in the 1965 series &quot;The Pogles&quot;, which BBC management felt was too frightening for the intended audience, and led to their asking for a change of direction: resulting in a revised show, and a change of name to &quot;Pogles&#x27; Wood&quot;.

Postgate had strict views regarding storylines, which perhaps limited the possibilities for series development. When asked if the &quot;Clangers&quot; adventures were quite surreal sometimes, Postgate replied: &quot;They&#x27;re surreal but logical. I have a strong prejudice against fantasy for its own sake. Once one gets to a point beyond where cause-and-effect mean anything at all, then science fiction becomes science nonsense. Everything that happened was strictly logical, according to the laws of physics which happened to apply in that part of the world&quot;.

In June 2015, the BBC&#x27;s Mark Savage reported: &quot;Firmin said the &quot;Clangers&quot;″ surrealism had led to accusations that Postgate was taking hallucinogenic drugs&quot;. Firmin told Savage: &quot;People used to say, &#x27;Ooh, what&#x27;s Oliver on, with all of these weird ideas?&#x27; And we used to say, &#x27;He&#x27;s on cups of tea and biscuits&#x27;&quot;.

The Smallfilms system was reliant on the company&#x27;s two key employees, Postgate and Firmin, and was devoid of modern considerations and essentials, as Postgate pointed out: &quot;[We were] excused the interference of educationalists, sociologists and other pseudo-scientists, which produces eventually a confection of formulae which have no integrity. No, the mainspring of what we did was because it was fun&quot;.

Recognising their commissioning audience, Smallfilms purposefully developed storylines that would engage both adults and children. While the storylines and production were remembered by children, the adult jokes, like those about the Welsh in &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, or the fact that the Clangers swore occasionally, gave the films an instant parental engagement, and a later nostalgic revival amongst former children re-watching their favourite programmes.

==Coolabi==
From October 2008 until 2013, production company Coolabi held the merchandising and distribution rights to a number of the Smallfilms productions. Coolabi hoped to introduce &quot;Bagpuss&quot; to a new generation, saying that there was &quot;significant potential to build on the affection in which this classic brand is held&quot;.

However, in the event it was Smallfilms itself that returned the classic shows to production, agreeing a deal with the BBC in 2014 to produce a new series of &quot;The Clangers&quot; for broadcasting in 2015 on CBeebies, which the company also pre-sold in the United States.

<doc id="29462" wikidata="Q193518" url="?curid=29462" title="Sabotage">
<text>Sabotage is a deliberate action aimed at weakening a polity, government, effort, or organization through subversion, obstruction, demoralization, destabilization, division, disruption, or destruction. One who engages in sabotage is a &quot;saboteur&quot;. Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions and to avoid invoking legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage.

== Etymology ==
The English word derives from the French word , meaning to &quot;bungle, botch, wreck or sabotage&quot;; it was originally used to refer to labour disputes, in which workers wearing wooden shoes called interrupted production through different means. A popular but incorrect account of the origin of the term&#x27;s present meaning is the story that poor workers in the Belgian city of Liège would throw a wooden into the machines to disrupt production.

One of the first appearances of and in French literature is in the of d&#x27;Hautel, edited in 1808. In it the literal definition is to &#x27;make noise with sabots&#x27; as well as &#x27;bungle, jostle, hustle, haste&#x27;. The word appears only later.

The word is found in 1873–1874 in the of Émile Littré. Here it is defined mainly as &#x27;making sabots, sabot maker&#x27;. It is at the end of the 19th century that it really began to be used with the meaning of &#x27;deliberately and maliciously destroying property&#x27; or &#x27;working slower&#x27;. In 1897, Émile Pouget, a famous syndicalist and anarchist wrote &quot;&quot; (&#x27;action of sabotaging or bungling a work&#x27;) in and in 1911 he also wrote a book entitled .

== As industrial action ==

At the inception of the Industrial Revolution, skilled workers such as the Luddites (1811–1812) used sabotage as a means of negotiation in labor disputes.

Labor unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) have advocated sabotage as a means of self-defense and direct action against unfair working conditions.

The IWW was shaped in part by the industrial unionism philosophy of Big Bill Haywood, and in 1910 Haywood was exposed to sabotage while touring Europe:

The experience that had the most lasting impact on Haywood was witnessing a general strike on the French railroads. Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic – the French called it &quot;sabotage&quot; – won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.
For the IWW, sabotage&#x27;s meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: any withdrawal of efficiency, including the slowdown, the strike, working to rule, or creative bungling of job assignments. 

One of the most severe examples was at the construction site of the Robert-Bourassa Generating Station in 1974, in Québec, Canada, when workers used bulldozers to topple electric generators, damaged fuel tanks, and set buildings on fire. The project was delayed a year, and the direct cost of the damage estimated at $2 million CAD. The causes were not clear, but three possible factors have been cited: inter-union rivalry, poor working conditions, and the perceived arrogance of American executives of the contractor, Bechtel Corporation.

== As environmental action ==

Certain groups turn to the destruction of property to stop environmental destruction or to make visible arguments against forms of modern technology they consider detrimental to the environment. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term eco-terrorist when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the monkey wrench thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by Edward Abbey in the novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; and has been adopted by eco-activists to describe the destruction of earth damaging machinery.

From 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as Earth Liberation Front (ELF) engaged in a near-constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wildlands and extractive industries such as logging and even an arson attack against a ski resort in Vail, Colorado. ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wildlands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.

== As war tactic ==
In war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign agent or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or logistic routes. Prime examples of such sabotage are the events of Black Tom and the Kingsland Explosion. Like spies, saboteurs who conduct a military operation in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms behind enemy lines are subject to prosecution and criminal penalties instead of detention as prisoners of war. It is common for a government in power during war or supporters of the war policy to use the term loosely against opponents of the war. Similarly, German nationalists spoke of a stab in the back having cost them the loss of World War I.

A modern form of sabotage is the distribution of software intended to damage specific industrial systems. For example, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is alleged to have sabotaged a Siberian pipeline during the Cold War, using information from the Farewell Dossier. A more recent case may be the Stuxnet computer worm, which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment. Based on the equipment targeted and the location of infected machines, security experts believe it was an attack on the Iranian nuclear program by the United States or Israel.

Sabotage, done well, is inherently difficult to detect and difficult to trace to its origin. During World War II, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated 19,649 cases of sabotage and concluded the enemy had not caused any of them.

Sabotage in warfare, according to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) manual, varies from highly technical &quot;coup de main&quot; acts that require detailed planning and specially trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts that ordinary citizen-saboteurs can perform. Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. There are two main methods of sabotage: physical destruction and the &quot;human element&quot;. While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The &quot;human element&quot; is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.

There are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title &quot;General Interference with Organizations and Production&quot;:

* When possible, refer all matters to committees for &quot;further study and consideration&quot;. Attempt to make the committees as large as possible—never fewer than five
* Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
* Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.
* In making work assignments, always sign out unimportant jobs first, assign important jobs to inefficient workers with poor machines.
* Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those with the least flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.
* To lower morale, and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.
* Hold meetings when there is more critical work to be done.
* Multiply procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, paychecks, and so on. See that multiple people must approve everything where one would do.
* Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside information.

From the section entitled, &quot;General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion&quot; comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: &quot;Act stupid.&quot;

=== Value of simple sabotage in wartime ===
The United States Office of Strategic Services, later renamed the CIA, noted the specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: &quot;... slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.&quot; To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, &quot;Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police.&quot; The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; &quot;the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.&quot;

=== In World War I ===
On 30 July 1916, the Black Tom explosion occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in Jersey City, New Jersey that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the Allies in their fight.

On 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, set fire to his workbench at an ammunition assembly plant near Lyndhurst, New Jersey, causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages. Wozniak&#x27;s involvement was not discovered until 1927.

On 12 February 1917, Bedouins allied with the British destroyed a Turkish railroad near the port of Wajh, derailing a Turkish locomotive. The Bedouins traveled by camel and used explosives to demolish a portion of track.

=== Post World War I ===
In Ireland, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) used sabotage against the British following the Easter 1916 uprising. The IRA compromised communication lines and lines of transportation and fuel supplies. The IRA also employed passive sabotage, with dock and railroad workers refusing to work on ships and rail cars used by the government. In 1920, agents of the IRA committed arson against at least fifteen British warehouses in Liverpool. The following year, the IRA set fire to numerous British targets again, including the Dublin Customs House, this time sabotaging most of Liverpool&#x27;s firetrucks in the firehouses before lighting the matches.

=== In World War II ===

Lieutenant Colonel George T. Rheam was a British soldier, who ran Brickendonbury Manor from October 1941 to June 1945 during World War II, which was Station XVII of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which trained specialists for the SOE. Rheam innovated many sabotage techniques and is considered by M. R. D. Foot the &quot;founder of modern industrial sabotage.&quot;
Sabotage training for the Allies consisted of teaching would-be saboteurs&#x27; key components of working machinery to destroy.
&quot;Saboteurs learned hundreds of small tricks to cause the Germans big trouble. The cables in a telephone junction box ... could be jumbled to make the wrong connections when numbers were dialed. A few ounces of plastique, properly placed, could bring down a bridge, cave in a mine shaft, or collapse the roof of a railroad tunnel.&quot;

The Polish Home Army Armia Krajowa, which commanded the majority of resistance organizations in Poland (even the National Forces, except the Military Organization Lizard Union; the Home Army also included the Polish Socialist Party – Freedom, Equality, Independence) and coordinated and aided the Jewish Military Union as well as more reluctantly helping the Jewish Combat Organization, was responsible for the greatest number of acts of sabotage in German-occupied Europe. The Home Army&#x27;s sabotage operations Operation Garland and Operation Ribbon are just two examples. In all, the Home Army damaged 6,930 locomotives, set 443 rail transports on fire, damaged over 19,000 rail cars, and blew up 38 rail bridges, not to mention the attacks against the railroads. The Home Army was also responsible for 4,710 built-in flaws in parts for aircraft engines and 92,000 built-in flaws in artillery projectiles, among other examples of significant sabotage. In addition, over 25,000 acts of more minor sabotage were committed. It continued to fight against both the Germans and the Soviets; however, it did aid the Western Allies by collecting constant and detailed information on the German rail, wheeled, and horse transports. As for Stalin&#x27;s proxies, their actions led to a great number of the Polish and Jewish hostages, mostly civilians, being murdered in reprisal by the Germans. The Gwardia Ludowa destroyed around 200 German trains during the war, and indiscriminately threw hand grenades into places frequented by Germans.

The French Resistance ran an extremely effective sabotage campaign against the Germans during World War II. Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the BBC radio or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943. From January through March 1944, sabotage accounted for three times the number of locomotives damaged by Allied air power. See also Normandy landings for more information about sabotage on D-Day.

During World War II, the Allies committed sabotage against the Peugeot truck factory. After repeated failures in Allied bombing attempts to hit the factory, a team of French Resistance fighters and Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents distracted the German guards with a game of soccer while part of their team entered the plant and destroyed machinery.

In December 1944, the Germans ran a false flag sabotage infiltration, Operation Greif, which was commanded by Waffen-SS commando Otto Skorzeny during the Battle of the Bulge. German commandos, wearing US Army uniforms, carrying US Army weapons, and using US Army vehicles, penetrated US lines to spread panic and confusion among US troops and to blow up bridges, ammunition dumps, and fuel stores and to disrupt the lines of communication. Many of the commandos were captured by the Americans. Because they were wearing US uniforms, a number of the Germans were executed as spies, either summarily or after military commissions.

=== After World War II ===
From 1948 to 1960, the Malayan Communists committed numerous effective acts of sabotage against the British Colonial authorities, first targeting railway bridges, then hitting larger targets such as military camps. Most of their efforts were intended to weaken Malaysia&#x27;s colonial economy and involved sabotage against trains, rubber trees, water pipes, and electric lines. The Communists&#x27; sabotage efforts were so successful that they caused backlash among the Malaysian population, who gradually withdrew support for the Communist movement as their livelihoods became threatened.

In Mandatory Palestine from 1945 to 1948, Jewish groups opposed British control. Though that control was to end according to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1948, the groups used sabotage as an opposition tactic. The Haganah focused their efforts on camps used by the British to hold refugees, and radar installations that could be used to detect illegal immigrant ships. The Stern Gang and the Irgun used terrorism and sabotage against the British government and against lines of communications. In November 1946, the Irgun and Stern Gang attacked a railroad twenty-one times in a three-week period, eventually causing shell-shocked Arab railway workers to strike. The 6th Airborne Division was called in to provide security as a means of ending the strike.
=== In Cyprus ===
Sabotage against British Forces was one of the primary methods used by EOKA during the Cyprus liberation campaign in order to weaken the British posture on Cyprus. One of the more famous sabotage operations undertaken by EOKA was the Sabotage at RAF Akrotiri where 3 members of the organisation entered the base and placed multiple bombs undetected and destroying 4 English Electric Canberra aircraft and one de Havilland Venom aircraft.

=== In Vietnam ===
The Viet Cong used swimmer saboteurs often and effectively during the Vietnam War. Between 1969 and 1970, swimmer saboteurs sunk, destroyed, or damaged 77 assets of the U.S. and its allies. Viet Cong swimmers were poorly equipped but well-trained and resourceful. The swimmers provided a low-cost/low-risk option with high payoff; possible loss to the country for failure compared to the possible gains from a successful mission led to the obvious conclusion the swimmer saboteurs were a good idea.

=== During the Cold War ===
On 1 January 1984, the Cuscatlan bridge over the Lempa river in El Salvador, critical to the flow of commercial and military traffic, was destroyed by guerrilla forces using explosives after using mortar fire to &quot;scatter&quot; the bridge&#x27;s guards, causing an estimated $3.7 million in required repairs, and considerably impacting on El Salvadoran business and security.

In 1982 in Honduras, a group of nine Salvadorans and Nicaraguans destroyed a main electrical power station, leaving the capital city Tegucigalpa without power for three days.

== As crime ==
Some criminals have engaged in acts of sabotage for reasons of extortion. For example, Klaus-Peter Sabotta sabotaged German railway lines in the late 1990s in an attempt to extort DM10 million from the German railway operator Deutsche Bahn. He is now serving a sentence of life imprisonment. In 1989, ex-Scotland Yard detective Rodney Whitchelo was sentenced to 17 years in prison for spiking Heinz baby food products in supermarkets, in an extortion attempt on the food manufacturer.

On October 8, 2022, the GSM-R radio communication system of the Deutsche Bahn was sabotaged by the cutting of two cables of crucial importance. In the aftermath, the railway traffic in Northern Germany was completely shut down for several hours. German criminal police took over the investigation.

== As political action ==

The term political sabotage is sometimes used to define the acts of one political camp to disrupt, harass or damage the reputation of a political opponent, usually during an electoral campaign, such as during Watergate. Smear campaigns are a commonly used tactic. The term could also describe the actions and expenditures of private entities, corporations, and organizations against democratically approved or enacted laws, policies and programs.

After the Cold War ended, the Mitrokhin Archives were declassified, which included detailed KGB plans of active measures to subvert politics in opposing nations.

=== In a coup d&#x27;état ===
Sabotage is a crucial tool of the successful coup d&#x27;etat, which requires control of communications before, during, and after the coup is staged. Simple sabotage against physical communications platforms using semi-skilled technicians, or even those trained only for this task, could effectively silence the target government of the coup, leaving the information battle space open to the dominance of the coup&#x27;s leaders. To underscore the effectiveness of sabotage, &quot;A single cooperative technician will be able temporarily to put out of action a radio station which would otherwise require a full-scale assault.&quot;

Railroads, where strategically important to the regime the coup is against, are prime targets for sabotage—if a section of the track is damaged entire portions of the transportation network can be stopped until it is fixed.

== Derivative usages ==

=== Sabotage radio ===
A sabotage radio was a small two-way radio designed for use by resistance movements in World War II, and after the war often used by expeditions and similar parties.

=== Cybotage ===
Arquilla and Rondfeldt, in their work entitled &quot;Networks and Netwars&quot;, differentiate their definition of &quot;netwar&quot; from a list of &quot;trendy synonyms&quot;, including &quot;cybotage&quot;, a portmanteau from the words &quot;sabotage&quot; and &quot;cyber&quot;. They dub the practitioners of cybotage &quot;cyboteurs&quot; and note while all cybotage is not netwar, some netwar is cybotage.

=== Counter-sabotage ===
Counter-sabotage, defined by &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, is &quot;counterintelligence designed to detect and counteract sabotage&quot;. The United States Department of Defense definition, found in the &quot;Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms&quot;, is &quot;action designed to detect and counteract sabotage. See also counterintelligence&quot;.

==== In World War II ====
During World War II, British subject Eddie Chapman, trained by the Germans in sabotage, became a double agent for the British. The German Abwehr entrusted Chapman to destroy the British de Havilland Company&#x27;s main plant which manufactured the outstanding Mosquito light bomber but required photographic proof from their agent to verify the mission&#x27;s completion. A special unit of the Royal Engineers known as the Magic Gang covered the de Havilland plant with canvas panels and scattered papier-mâché furniture and chunks of masonry around three broken and burnt giant generators. Photos of the plant taken from the air reflected devastation for the factory and a successful sabotage mission, and Chapman, as a British sabotage double-agent, fooled the Germans for the duration of the war.

=== Self-sabotage ===
In psychology, self-sabotage is defined as behaviour that undermines one&#x27;s own existing or potential achievements.

<doc id="29463" wikidata="Q661140" url="?curid=29463" title="Scabbard">
<text>A scabbard is a sheath for holding a sword, dagger, knife, or similar edged weapons. Rifles and other long guns may also be stored in scabbards by horse riders for transportation. Military cavalry and cowboys had scabbards for their saddle ring carbines and rifles for transportation and protection. Scabbards have been made of many materials over the millennia, including leather, wood, and metal such as brass or steel.

Most commonly, sword scabbards were worn suspended from a sword belt or shoulder belt called a baldric.

==Antiquity==
Scabbards have at least been around since the Bronze Age, and are thought to have existed as long as the blade has. Wooden scabbards were typically covered in fabric or leather; the leather versions also usually bore metal or leather fittings for added protection and carrying ease. All-metal scabbards were popular items for a display of wealth among elites in the European Iron Age, and often intricately decorated. Little is known about the scabbards of the early Iron Age, due to their wooden construction. However, during the Middle and late Iron Ages, the scabbard became important especially as a vehicle for decorative elaboration and social status. After 200 BC fully decorated scabbards became rare, but in their lesser extent existed well into the Medieval period. 

A number of ancient scabbards have been recovered from weapons sacrifices, a few of which had a lining of fur on the inside. The fur was probably kept oily, keeping the blade free from rust. The fur would also allow a smoother, quicker draw, and protect the blade. In classical antiquity, Greek scabbards often had ornamental metal fittings, characteristic of the Iron Age. The Roman army used scabbards to a great extent with short baldrics, carrying their swords quite high up.

Japanese blades typically have their sharp cutting edge protected by a wooden scabbard called a saya.

==Modern era==

Entirely metal scabbards became popular in Europe early in the 19th century and eventually superseded most other types. Metal was more durable than leather and could better withstand the rigors of field use, particularly among troops mounted on horseback. In addition, metal offered the ability to present a more military appearance, as well as the opportunity to display increased ornamentation. Nevertheless, leather scabbards never entirely lost favor among military users and were widely used as late as the American Civil War (1861–1865). As late as the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, swords and leather scabbards were still being carried on active service by the military officers of participating nations. Metal scabbards had however been withdrawn as noisy, heavy and likely to blunt the blades of newly sharpened swords. In the event swords and scabbards were quickly discarded except for use by mounted cavalry. 

Some military police forces, naval shore patrols, law enforcement and other groups used leather scabbards as a kind of truncheon.
On the other hand, in Japan, except for some cases of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, water-resistant lacquered wooden scabbards have been used throughout history.
Scabbards were historically, albeit rarely, worn across the back, but only by a handful of Celtic tribes, and only with very short lengths of sword. This is because drawing a long, sharp blade over one&#x27;s shoulder and past one&#x27;s head from a scabbard on the back is relatively awkward, especially in a hurry, and the length of the arm sets a hard upper limit on how long a blade can be drawn at all in this way. Sheathing the sword again is even harder since it has to be done effectively blind unless the scabbard is taken off first. Common depictions of long swords being drawn from the back are a modern invention, born from safety and convenience considerations on a film set and typically enabled by creative editing, and have enjoyed such great popularity in fiction and fantasy that they are widely and incorrectly believed to have been common in Medieval times. Some more well-known examples of this include the back scabbard depicted in the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; and the back scabbard seen in the video game series &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. This has facilitated the modern anachronism colloquially known as a &quot;shabbard&quot;, developed by YouTuber and novel writer Shad Brooks. It uses a flat plate attached to the sheath which more easily guides even large swords into the scabbard. There is some limited data from woodcuts and textual fragments that Mongol light horse archers, Chinese soldiers, Japanese samurai and European knights wore a slung baldric over the shoulder, allowing longer blades such as greatswords/zweihanders and nodachi/ōdachi to be strapped across the back, though these would have to be removed from the back before the sword could be unsheathed.

In &quot;The Ancient Celts&quot; by Barry Cunliffe, Cunliffe writes, &quot;All these pieces of equipment [shields, spears, swords, mail] mentioned in the texts, are reflected in the archaeological record and in the surviving iconography, though it is sometimes possible to detect regional variations&quot; (page 94). Among the Parisii of Yorkshire, for example, the &quot;...sword was sometimes worn across the back and therefore had to be drawn over the shoulder from behind the head.&quot;

Modern knife sheaths are frequently made of polymer materials such as Kydex.

==Common terms==
The metal fitting where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the throat, which is often part of a larger scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade&#x27;s point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which, on both leather and metal scabbards, is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.

<doc id="29467" wikidata="Q191310" url="?curid=29467" title="Spinel">
<text>Spinel () is the magnesium/aluminium member of the larger spinel group of minerals. It has the formula in the cubic crystal system. Its name comes from the Latin word , a diminutive form of &quot;spine,&quot; in reference to its pointed crystals.

==Properties==

Spinel crystallizes in the isometric system; common crystal forms are octahedra, usually twinned. It has no true cleavage, but shows an octahedral parting and a conchoidal fracture. Its hardness is 8, its specific gravity is 3.5–4.1, and it is transparent to opaque with a vitreous to dull luster. It may be colorless, but is usually various shades of red, lavender, blue, green, brown, black, or yellow. Chromium(III) causes the red color in spinel from Burma. Some spinels are among the most famous gemstones; among them are the Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby and the &quot;Timur ruby&quot; in the British Crown Jewels, and the &quot;Côte de Bretagne&quot;, formerly from the French Crown jewels. The Samarian Spinel is the largest known spinel in the world, weighing .

The transparent red spinels were called spinel-rubies or balas rubies. In the past, before the arrival of modern science, spinels and rubies were equally known as rubies. After the 18th century, the word ruby was only used for the red gem variety of the mineral corundum, and the word spinel came to be used. &quot;Balas&quot; is derived from Balascia, the ancient name for Badakhshan, a region in central Asia situated in the upper valley of the Panj River, one of the principal tributaries of the Oxus River. However, &quot;Balascia&quot; itself may be derived from Sanskrit &quot;bālasūryaka&quot;, which translates as &quot;crimson-coloured morning sun&quot;. Mines in the Gorno Badakhshan region of Tajikistan constituted for centuries the main source for red and pink spinels.

==Occurrence==

===Geologic occurrence===
Spinel is found as a metamorphic mineral in metamorphosed limestones and silica-poor mudstones. It also occurs as a primary mineral in rare mafic igneous rocks; in these igneous rocks, the magmas are relatively deficient in alkalis relative to aluminium, and aluminium oxide may form as the mineral corundum or may combine with magnesia to form spinel. This is why spinel and ruby are often found together. The spinel petrogenesis in mafic magmatic rocks is strongly debated, but certainly results from mafic magma interaction with more evolved magma or rock (e.g. gabbro, troctolite).

Spinel, , is common in peridotite in the uppermost Earth&#x27;s mantle, between approximately 20 km to approximately 120 km, possibly to lower depths depending on the chromium content. At significantly shallower depths, above the Moho, calcic plagioclase is the more stable aluminous mineral in peridotite while garnet is the stable phase deeper in the mantle below the spinel stability region.

Spinel, , is a common mineral in the Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) in some chondritic meteorites.

===Geographical occurrence===
Spinel has long been found in the gemstone-bearing gravel of Sri Lanka and in limestones of the Badakshan Province in modern-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan; and of Mogok in Myanmar. Over the last decades gem quality spinels are found in the marbles of Lục Yên District (Vietnam), Mahenge and Matombo (Tanzania), Tsavo (Kenya) and in the gravels of Tunduru (Tanzania) and Ilakaka (Madagascar).

Since 2000, in several locations around the world, spinels have been discovered with unusual vivid pink or blue colors. Such &quot;glowing&quot; spinels are known from Mogok (Myanmar), Mahenge plateau (Tanzania), Lục Yên District (Vietnam) and some more localities. In 2018 bright blue spinels have been reported also in the southern part of Baffin Island (Canada). The pure blue coloration of spinel is caused by small additions of cobalt.

==Synthetic spinel==
Synthetic spinel can be produced by similar means to synthetic corundum, including the Verneuil method and the flux method pioneered by Edmond Frémy. It is widely used as an inexpensive cut gem in birthstone jewelry for the month of August. Light blue synthetic spinel is a good imitation of aquamarine beryl, and green synthetic spinel is used as an emerald or tourmaline simulant. By 2015, transparent spinel was being made in sheets and other shapes through sintering. Synthetic spinel, which looks like glass but has notably higher strength against pressure, can also have applications in military and commercial use.

<text>Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech-to-text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.

Some speech recognition systems require &quot;training&quot; (also called &quot;enrollment&quot;) where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person&#x27;s specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person&#x27;s speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called &quot;speaker-independent&quot; systems. Systems that use training are called &quot;speaker dependent&quot;.

Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. &quot;call home&quot;), call routing (e.g. &quot;I would like to make a collect call&quot;), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input). Automatic pronunciation assessment is used in education such as for spoken language learning.

The term &quot;voice recognition&quot; or &quot;speaker identification&quot; refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person&#x27;s voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.

From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems.

==History==
The key areas of growth were: vocabulary size, speaker independence, and processing speed.

===Pre-1970===
* 1952 – Three Bell Labs researchers, Stephen Balashek, R. Biddulph, and K. H. Davis built a system called &quot;Audrey&quot; for single-speaker digit recognition. Their system located the formants in the power spectrum of each utterance. 
* 1960 – Gunnar Fant developed and published the source-filter model of speech production. 
* 1962 – IBM demonstrated its 16-word &quot;Shoebox&quot; machine&#x27;s speech recognition capability at the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair.
* 1966 – Linear predictive coding (LPC), a speech coding method, was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), while working on speech recognition.
* 1969 – Funding at Bell Labs dried up for several years when, in 1969, the influential John Pierce wrote an open letter that was critical of and defunded speech recognition research. This defunding lasted until Pierce retired and James L. Flanagan took over.

Raj Reddy was the first person to take on continuous speech recognition as a graduate student at Stanford University in the late 1960s. Previous systems required users to pause after each word. Reddy&#x27;s system issued spoken commands for playing chess.

Around this time Soviet researchers invented the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and used it to create a recognizer capable of operating on a 200-word vocabulary. DTW processed speech by dividing it into short frames, e.g. 10ms segments, and processing each frame as a single unit. Although DTW would be superseded by later algorithms, the technique carried on. Achieving speaker independence remained unsolved at this time period.

===1970–1990===
* 1971 – DARPA funded five years for &quot;Speech Understanding Research&quot;, speech recognition research seeking a minimum vocabulary size of 1,000 words. They thought speech &quot;understanding&quot; would be key to making progress in speech &quot;recognition&quot;, but this later proved untrue. BBN, IBM, Carnegie Mellon and Stanford Research Institute all participated in the program. This revived speech recognition research post John Pierce&#x27;s letter.
* 1972 – The IEEE Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing group held a conference in Newton, Massachusetts. 
* 1976 – The first ICASSP was held in Philadelphia, which since then has been a major venue for the publication of research on speech recognition.

During the late 1960s Leonard Baum developed the mathematics of Markov chains at the Institute for Defense Analysis. A decade later, at CMU, Raj Reddy&#x27;s students James Baker and Janet M. Baker began using the hidden Markov model (HMM) for speech recognition. James Baker had learned about HMMs from a summer job at the Institute of Defense Analysis during his undergraduate education. The use of HMMs allowed researchers to combine different sources of knowledge, such as acoustics, language, and syntax, in a unified probabilistic model.

* By the mid-1980s IBM&#x27;s Fred Jelinek&#x27;s team created a voice activated typewriter called Tangora, which could handle a 20,000-word vocabulary Jelinek&#x27;s statistical approach put less emphasis on emulating the way the human brain processes and understands speech in favor of using statistical modeling techniques like HMMs. (Jelinek&#x27;s group independently discovered the application of HMMs to speech.) This was controversial with linguists since HMMs are too simplistic to account for many common features of human languages. However, the HMM proved to be a highly useful way for modeling speech and replaced dynamic time warping to become the dominant speech recognition algorithm in the 1980s.
* 1982 – Dragon Systems, founded by James and Janet M. Baker, was one of IBM&#x27;s few competitors.

===Practical speech recognition===
The 1980s also saw the introduction of the n-gram language model.
* 1987 – The back-off model allowed language models to use multiple length n-grams, and CSELT used HMM to recognize languages (both in software and in hardware specialized processors, e.g. RIPAC).
Much of the progress in the field is owed to the rapidly increasing capabilities of computers. At the end of the DARPA program in 1976, the best computer available to researchers was the PDP-10 with 4 MB ram. It could take up to 100 minutes to decode just 30 seconds of speech.

Two practical products were:
* 1984 – was released the Apricot Portable with up to 4096 words support, of which only 64 could be held in RAM at a time.
*1987 – a recognizer from Kurzweil Applied Intelligence
* 1990 – Dragon Dictate, a consumer product released in 1990 AT&amp;T deployed the Voice Recognition Call Processing service in 1992 to route telephone calls without the use of a human operator. The technology was developed by Lawrence Rabiner and others at Bell Labs.

By this point, the vocabulary of the typical commercial speech recognition system was larger than the average human vocabulary. Raj Reddy&#x27;s former student, Xuedong Huang, developed the Sphinx-II system at CMU. The Sphinx-II system was the first to do speaker-independent, large vocabulary, continuous speech recognition and it had the best performance in DARPA&#x27;s 1992 evaluation. Handling continuous speech with a large vocabulary was a major milestone in the history of speech recognition. Huang went on to found the speech recognition group at Microsoft in 1993. Raj Reddy&#x27;s student Kai-Fu Lee joined Apple where, in 1992, he helped develop a speech interface prototype for the Apple computer known as Casper.

Lernout &amp; Hauspie, a Belgium-based speech recognition company, acquired several other companies, including Kurzweil Applied Intelligence in 1997 and Dragon Systems in 2000. The L&amp;H speech technology was used in the Windows XP operating system. L&amp;H was an industry leader until an accounting scandal brought an end to the company in 2001. The speech technology from L&amp;H was bought by ScanSoft which became Nuance in 2005. Apple originally licensed software from Nuance to provide speech recognition capability to its digital assistant Siri.

====2000s====
In the 2000s DARPA sponsored two speech recognition programs: Effective Affordable Reusable Speech-to-Text (EARS) in 2002 and Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE). Four teams participated in the EARS program: IBM, a team led by BBN with LIMSI and Univ. of Pittsburgh, Cambridge University, and a team composed of ICSI, SRI and University of Washington. EARS funded the collection of the Switchboard telephone speech corpus containing 260 hours of recorded conversations from over 500 speakers. The GALE program focused on Arabic and Mandarin broadcast news speech. Google&#x27;s first effort at speech recognition came in 2007 after hiring some researchers from Nuance. The first product was GOOG-411, a telephone based directory service. The recordings from GOOG-411 produced valuable data that helped Google improve their recognition systems. Google Voice Search is now supported in over 30 languages.

In the United States, the National Security Agency has made use of a type of speech recognition for keyword spotting since at least 2006. This technology allows analysts to search through large volumes of recorded conversations and isolate mentions of keywords. Recordings can be indexed and analysts can run queries over the database to find conversations of interest. Some government research programs focused on intelligence applications of speech recognition, e.g. DARPA&#x27;s EARS&#x27;s program and IARPA&#x27;s Babel program.

In the early 2000s, speech recognition was still dominated by traditional approaches such as hidden Markov models combined with feedforward artificial neural networks.
Today, however, many aspects of speech recognition have been taken over by a deep learning method called Long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Sepp Hochreiter &amp; Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1997. LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn &quot;Very Deep Learning&quot; tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps ago, which is important for speech.
Around 2007, LSTM trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) started to outperform traditional speech recognition in certain applications. In 2015, Google&#x27;s speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through Google Voice to all smartphone users. Transformers, a type of neural network based solely on &quot;attention&quot;, have been widely adopted in computer vision and language modeling, sparking the interest of adapting such models to new domains, including speech recognition. Some recent papers reported superior performance levels using transformer models for speech recognition, but these models usually require large scale training datasets to reach high performance levels.

The use of deep feedforward (non-recurrent) networks for acoustic modeling was introduced during the later part of 2009 by Geoffrey Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto and by Li Deng and colleagues at Microsoft Research, initially in the collaborative work between Microsoft and the University of Toronto which was subsequently expanded to include IBM and Google (hence &quot;The shared views of four research groups&quot; subtitle in their 2012 review paper). A Microsoft research executive called this innovation &quot;the most dramatic change in accuracy since 1979&quot;. In contrast to the steady incremental improvements of the past few decades, the application of deep learning decreased word error rate by 30%. This innovation was quickly adopted across the field. Researchers have begun to use deep learning techniques for language modeling as well.

In the long history of speech recognition, both shallow form and deep form (e.g. recurrent nets) of artificial neural networks had been explored for many years during 1980s, 1990s and a few years into the 2000s.
But these methods never won over the non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. A number of key difficulties had been methodologically analyzed in the 1990s, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in the neural predictive models. All these difficulties were in addition to the lack of big training data and big computing power in these early days. Most speech recognition researchers who understood such barriers hence subsequently moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling approaches until the recent resurgence of deep learning starting around 2009–2010 that had overcome all these difficulties. Hinton et al. and Deng et al. reviewed part of this recent history about how their collaboration with each other and then with colleagues across four groups (University of Toronto, Microsoft, Google, and IBM) ignited a renaissance of applications of deep feedforward neural networks for speech recognition.

====2010s====
By early 2010s &quot;speech&quot; recognition, also called voice recognition was clearly differentiated from &quot;speaker&quot; recognition, and speaker independence was considered a major breakthrough. Until then, systems required a &quot;training&quot; period. A 1987 ad for a doll had carried the tagline &quot;Finally, the doll that understands you.&quot; – despite the fact that it was described as &quot;which children could train to respond to their voice&quot;.

In 2017, Microsoft researchers reached a historical human parity milestone of transcribing conversational telephony speech on the widely benchmarked Switchboard task. Multiple deep learning models were used to optimize speech recognition accuracy. The speech recognition word error rate was reported to be as low as 4 professional human transcribers working together on the same benchmark, which was funded by IBM Watson speech team on the same task.

==Models, methods, and algorithms==
Both acoustic modeling and language modeling are important parts of modern statistically based speech recognition algorithms. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in many systems. Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as document classification or statistical machine translation.

===Hidden Markov models===

Modern general-purpose speech recognition systems are based on hidden Markov models. These are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities. HMMs are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short-time stationary signal. In a short time scale (e.g., 10 milliseconds), speech can be approximated as a stationary process. Speech can be thought of as a Markov model for many stochastic purposes.

Another reason why HMMs are popular is that they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. In speech recognition, the hidden Markov model would output a sequence of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real-valued vectors (with &quot;n&quot; being a small integer, such as 10), outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds. The vectors would consist of cepstral coefficients, which are obtained by taking a Fourier transform of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a cosine transform, then taking the first (most significant) coefficients. The hidden Markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians, which will give a likelihood for each observed vector. Each word, or (for more general speech recognition systems), each phoneme, will have a different output distribution; a hidden Markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden Markov models for the separate words and phonemes.

Described above are the core elements of the most common, HMM-based approach to speech recognition. Modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above. A typical large-vocabulary system would need context dependency for the phonemes (so that phonemes with different left and right context would have different realizations as HMM states); it would use cepstral normalization to normalize for a different speaker and recording conditions; for further speaker normalization, it might use vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) for male-female normalization and maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) for more general speaker adaptation. The features would have so-called delta and delta-delta coefficients to capture speech dynamics and in addition, might use heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA); or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use splicing and an LDA-based projection followed perhaps by heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis or a global semi-tied co variance transform (also known as maximum likelihood linear transform, or MLLT). Many systems use so-called discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to HMM parameter estimation and instead optimize some classification-related measure of the training data. Examples are maximum mutual information (MMI), minimum classification error (MCE), and minimum phone error (MPE).

Decoding of the speech (the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence) would probably use the Viterbi algorithm to find the best path, and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden Markov model, which includes both the acoustic and language model information and combining it statically beforehand (the finite state transducer, or FST, approach).

A possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate, and to use a better scoring function (re scoring) to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score. The set of candidates can be kept either as a list (the N-best list approach) or as a subset of the models (a lattice). Re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the Bayes risk (or an approximation thereof) Instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability, we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions (i.e., we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability). The loss function is usually the Levenshtein distance, though it can be different distances for specific tasks; the set of possible transcriptions is, of course, pruned to maintain tractability. Efficient algorithms have been devised to re score lattices represented as weighted finite state transducers with edit distances represented themselves as a finite state transducer verifying certain assumptions.

===Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based speech recognition===
Dynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful HMM-based approach.

Dynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns would be detected, even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly, or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation. DTW has been applied to video, audio, and graphics – indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with DTW.

A well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. In general, it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions. That is, the sequences are &quot;warped&quot; non-linearly to match each other. This sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden Markov models.

===Neural networks===

Neural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in ASR in the late 1980s. Since then, neural networks have been used in many aspects of speech recognition such as phoneme classification, phoneme classification through multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, isolated word recognition, audiovisual speech recognition, audiovisual speaker recognition and speaker adaptation.

Neural networks make fewer explicit assumptions about feature statistical properties than HMMs and have several qualities making them more attractive recognition models for speech recognition. When used to estimate the probabilities of a speech feature segment, neural networks allow discriminative training in a natural and efficient manner. However, in spite of their effectiveness in classifying short-time units such as individual phonemes and isolated words, early neural networks were rarely successful for continuous recognition tasks because of their limited ability to model temporal dependencies.

One approach to this limitation was to use neural networks as a pre-processing, feature transformation or dimensionality reduction, step prior to HMM based recognition. However, more recently, LSTM and related recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Time Delay Neural Networks(TDNN&#x27;s), and transformers have demonstrated improved performance in this area.

====Deep feedforward and recurrent neural networks====
Deep neural networks and denoising autoencoders are also under investigation. A deep feedforward neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers. Similar to shallow neural networks, DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models, where extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, giving a huge learning capacity and thus the potential of modeling complex patterns of speech data.

A success of DNNs in large vocabulary speech recognition occurred in 2010 by industrial researchers, in collaboration with academic researchers, where large output layers of the DNN based on context dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees were adopted.
 See comprehensive reviews of this development and of the state of the art as of October 2014 in the recent Springer book from Microsoft Research. See also the related background of automatic speech recognition and the impact of various machine learning paradigms, notably including deep learning, in
recent overview articles.

One fundamental principle of deep learning is to do away with hand-crafted feature engineering and to use raw features. This principle was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the &quot;raw&quot; spectrogram or linear filter-bank features, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features which contain a few stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms.
The true &quot;raw&quot; features of speech, waveforms, have more recently been shown to produce excellent larger-scale speech recognition results.

=== End-to-end automatic speech recognition ===
Since 2014, there has been much research interest in &quot;end-to-end&quot; ASR. Traditional phonetic-based (i.e., all HMM-based model) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation, acoustic, and language model. End-to-end models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer. This is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process. For example, a n-gram language model is required for all HMM-based systems, and a typical n-gram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices. Consequently, modern commercial ASR systems from Google and Apple () are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally.

The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014. The model consisted of recurrent neural networks and a CTC layer. Jointly, the RNN-CTC model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together, however it is incapable of learning the language due to conditional independence assumptions similar to a HMM. Consequently, CTC models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to English characters, but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts. Later, Baidu expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in Chinese Mandarin and English. In 2016, University of Oxford presented LipNet, the first end-to-end sentence-level lipreading model, using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an RNN-CTC architecture, surpassing human-level performance in a restricted grammar dataset. A large-scale CNN-RNN-CTC architecture was presented in 2018 by Google DeepMind achieving 6 times better performance than human experts. In 2019, Nvidia launched two CNN-CTC ASR models, Jasper and QuarzNet, with an overall performance WER of 3%. Similar to other deep learning applications, transfer learning and domain adaptation are important strategies for reusing and extending the capabilities of deep learning models, particularly due to the high costs of training models from scratch, and the small size of available corpus in many languages and/or specific domains.

An alternative approach to CTC-based models are attention-based models. Attention-based ASR models were introduced simultaneously by Chan et al. of Carnegie Mellon University and Google Brain and Bahdanau et al. of the University of Montreal in 2016. The model named &quot;Listen, Attend and Spell&quot; (LAS), literally &quot;listens&quot; to the acoustic signal, pays &quot;attention&quot; to different parts of the signal and &quot;spells&quot; out the transcript one character at a time. Unlike CTC-based models, attention-based models do not have conditional-independence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation, acoustic and language model directly. This means, during deployment, there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory. By the end of 2016, the attention-based models have seen considerable success including outperforming the CTC models (with or without an external language model). Various extensions have been proposed since the original LAS model. Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD) was proposed by Carnegie Mellon University, MIT and Google Brain to directly emit sub-word units which are more natural than English characters; University of Oxford and Google DeepMind extended LAS to &quot;Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell&quot; (WLAS) to handle lip reading surpassing human-level performance.

==Applications==

===In-car systems===
Typically a manual control input, for example by means of a finger control on the steering-wheel, enables the speech recognition system and this is signaled to the driver by an audio prompt. Following the audio prompt, the system has a &quot;listening window&quot; during which it may accept a speech input for recognition. 
Simple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls, select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone, MP3 player or music-loaded flash drive. Voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model. Some of the most recent car models offer natural-language speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands, allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases. With such systems there is, therefore, no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words.

===Education===
Automatic pronunciation assessment is the use of speech recognition to verify the correctness of pronounced speech, as distinguished from manual assessment by an instructor or proctor. Also called speech verification, pronunciation evaluation, and pronunciation scoring, the main application of this technology is computer-aided pronunciation teaching (CAPT) when combined with computer-aided instruction for computer-assisted language learning (CALL), speech remediation, or accent reduction. Pronunciation assessment does not determine unknown speech (as in dictation or automatic transcription) but instead, knowing the expected word(s) in advance, it attempts to verify the correctness of the learner&#x27;s pronunciation and ideally their intelligibility to listeners, sometimes along with often inconsequential prosody such as intonation, pitch, tempo, rhythm, and stress. Pronunciation assessment is also used in reading tutoring, for example in products such as Microsoft Teams and from Amira Learning. Automatic pronunciation assessment can also be used to help diagnose and treat speech disorders such as apraxia.

Assessing authentic listener intelligibility is essential for avoiding inaccuracies from accent bias, especially in high-stakes assessments; from words with multiple correct pronunciations; and from phoneme coding errors in machine-readable pronunciation dictionaries. In 2022, researchers found that some newer speech to text systems, based on end-to-end reinforcement learning to map audio signals directly into words, produce word and phrase confidence scores very closely correlated with genuine listener intelligibility. In the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) assessment criteria for &quot;overall phonological control&quot;, intelligibility outweighs formally correct pronunciation at all levels.

===Health care===

====Medical documentation====
In the health care sector, speech recognition can be implemented in front-end or back-end of the medical documentation process. Front-end speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speech-recognition engine, the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken, and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document. Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a digital dictation system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized. Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently.

One of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to &quot;Meaningful Use&quot; standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an Electronic Health Record or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a controlled vocabulary) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.

A more significant issue is that most EHRs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voice-recognition capabilities. A large part of the clinician&#x27;s interaction with the EHR involves navigation through the user interface using menus, and tab/button clicks, and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse: voice-based navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits. By contrast, many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice &quot;macros&quot;, where the use of certain phrases – e.g., &quot;normal report&quot;, will automatically fill in a large number of default values and/or generate boilerplate, which will vary with the type of the exam – e.g., a chest X-ray vs. a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system.

====Therapeutic use====
Prolonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with word processors has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in brain AVM patients who have been treated with resection. Further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs have been treated using radiologic techniques.

===Military===

====High-performance fighter aircraft====
Substantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in fighter aircraft. Of particular note have been the US program in speech recognition for the Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)/F-16 aircraft (F-16 VISTA), the program in France for Mirage aircraft, and other programs in the UK dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms. In these programs, speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft, with applications including setting radio frequencies, commanding an autopilot system, setting steer-point coordinates and weapons release parameters, and controlling flight display.

Working with Swedish pilots flying in the JAS-39 Gripen cockpit, Englund (2004) found recognition deteriorated with increasing g-loads. The report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly. Contrary to what might have been expected, no effects of the broken English of the speakers were found. It was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer, as might have been expected. A restricted vocabulary, and above all, a proper syntax, could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially.

The Eurofighter Typhoon, currently in service with the UK RAF, employs a speaker-dependent system, requiring each pilot to create a template. The system is not used for any safety-critical or weapon-critical tasks, such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage, but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions. Voice commands are confirmed by visual and/or aural feedback. The system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot workload, and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands.

Speaker-independent systems are also being developed and are under test for the F-35 Lightning II (JSF) and the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master lead-in fighter trainer. These systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of 98%.

====Helicopters====
The problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise are particularly relevant in the helicopter environment as well as in the jet fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment, not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot, in general, does not wear a facemask, which would reduce acoustic noise in the microphone. Substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters, notably by the U.S. Army Avionics Research and Development Activity (AVRADA) and by the Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE) in the UK. Work in France has included speech recognition in the Puma helicopter. There has also been much useful work in Canada. Results have been encouraging, and voice applications have included: control of communication radios, setting of navigation systems, and control of an automated target handover system.

As in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness. Encouraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment. Much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall speech technology in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings.

====Training air traffic controllers====
Training for air traffic controllers (ATC) represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems. Many ATC training systems currently require a person to act as a &quot;pseudo-pilot&quot;, engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation. Speech recognition and synthesis techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as a pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support personnel. In theory, Air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible. In practice, this is rarely the case. The FAA document 7110.65 details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers. While this document gives less than 150 examples of such phrases, the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of 500,000.

The USAF, USMC, US Army, US Navy, and FAA as well as a number of international ATC training organizations such as the Royal Australian Air Force and Civil Aviation Authorities in Italy, Brazil, and Canada are currently using ATC simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors.

===Telephony and other domains===
ASR is now commonplace in the field of telephony and is becoming more widespread in the field of computer gaming and simulation. In telephony systems, ASR is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with IVR systems. Despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing, in the field of document production, ASR has not seen the expected increases in use.

The improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in smartphones. Speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface, for creating predefined or custom speech commands.

=== People with disabilities ===
People with disabilities can benefit from speech recognition programs. For individuals that are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, speech recognition software is used to automatically generate a closed-captioning of conversations such as discussions in conference rooms, classroom lectures, and/or religious services.

Students who are blind (see Blindness and education) or have very low vision can benefit from using the technology to convey words and then hear the computer recite them, as well as use a computer by commanding with their voice, instead of having to look at the screen and keyboard.

Students who are physically disabled have a Repetitive strain injury/other injuries to the upper extremities can be relieved from having to worry about handwriting, typing, or working with scribe on school assignments by using speech-to-text programs. They can also utilize speech recognition technology to enjoy searching the Internet or using a computer at home without having to physically operate a mouse and keyboard.

Speech recognition can allow students with learning disabilities to become better writers. By saying the words aloud, they can increase the fluidity of their writing, and be alleviated of concerns regarding spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of writing. Also, see Learning disability.

The use of voice recognition software, in conjunction with a digital audio recorder and a personal computer running word-processing software has proven to be positive for restoring damaged short-term memory capacity, in stroke and craniotomy individuals.

Speech recognition is also very useful for people who have difficulty using their hands, ranging from mild repetitive stress injuries to involve disabilities that preclude using conventional computer input devices. In fact, people who used the keyboard a lot and developed RSI became an urgent early market for speech recognition. Speech recognition is used in deaf telephony, such as voicemail to text, relay services, and captioned telephone. Individuals with learning disabilities who have problems with thought-to-paper communication (essentially they think of an idea but it is processed incorrectly causing it to end up differently on paper) can possibly benefit from the software but the technology is not bug proof. Also the whole idea of speak to text can be hard for intellectually disabled person&#x27;s due to the fact that it is rare that anyone tries to learn the technology to teach the person with the disability.

This type of technology can help those with dyslexia but other disabilities are still in question. The effectiveness of the product is the problem that is hindering it from being effective. Although a kid may be able to say a word depending on how clear they say it the technology may think they are saying another word and input the wrong one. Giving them more work to fix, causing them to have to take more time with fixing the wrong word.

==Performance==
The performance of speech recognition systems is usually evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed. Accuracy is usually rated with word error rate (WER), whereas speed is measured with the real time factor. Other measures of accuracy include Single Word Error Rate (SWER) and Command Success Rate (CSR).

Speech recognition by machine is a very complex problem, however. Vocalizations vary in terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. Accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following:
* Vocabulary size and confusability
* Speaker dependence versus independence
* Isolated, discontinuous or continuous speech
* Task and language constraints
* Read versus spontaneous speech
* Adverse conditions

===Accuracy===
As mentioned earlier in this article, the accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors:
* Error rates increase as the vocabulary size grows: 
::e.g. the 10 digits &quot;zero&quot; to &quot;nine&quot; can be recognized essentially perfectly, but vocabulary sizes of 200, 5000 or 100000 may have error rates of 3%, 7%, or 45% respectively.
* Vocabulary is hard to recognize if it contains confusing letters:
::e.g. the 26 letters of the English alphabet are difficult to discriminate because they are confusing words (most notoriously, the E-set: &quot;B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z — when &quot;Z&quot; is pronounced &quot;zee&quot; rather than &quot;zed&quot; depending on the English region); an 8% error rate is considered good for this vocabulary.
* Speaker dependence vs. independence:
:: A speaker-dependent system is intended for use by a single speaker.
:: A speaker-independent system is intended for use by any speaker (more difficult).
* Isolated, Discontinuous or continuous speech
:: With isolated speech, single words are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech.
With discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech. 
With continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used, therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech, different from both isolated and discontinuous speech.

* Task and language constraints
**e.g. Querying application may dismiss the hypothesis &quot;The apple is red.&quot;
**e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting &quot;The apple is angry.&quot;
**e.g. Syntactic; rejecting &quot;Red is apple the.&quot;

Constraints are often represented by grammar. 
* Read vs. Spontaneous Speech – When a person reads it&#x27;s usually in a context that has been previously prepared, but when a person uses spontaneous speech, it is difficult to recognize the speech because of the disfluencies (like &quot;uh&quot; and &quot;um&quot;, false starts, incomplete sentences, stuttering, coughing, and laughter) and limited vocabulary. 
* Adverse conditions – Environmental noise (e.g. Noise in a car or a factory). Acoustical distortions (e.g. echoes, room acoustics)
Speech recognition is a multi-leveled pattern recognition task.
* Acoustical signals are structured into a hierarchy of units, e.g. Phonemes, Words, Phrases, and Sentences;
* Each level provides additional constraints;
e.g. Known word pronunciations or legal word sequences, which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at a lower level;
* This hierarchy of constraints is exploited. By combining decisions probabilistically at all lower levels, and making more deterministic decisions only at the highest level, speech recognition by a machine is a process broken into several phases. Computationally, it is a problem in which a sound pattern has to be recognized or classified into a category that represents a meaning to a human. Every acoustic signal can be broken into smaller more basic sub-signals. As the more complex sound signal is broken into the smaller sub-sounds, different levels are created, where at the top level we have complex sounds, which are made of simpler sounds on the lower level, and going to lower levels, even more, we create more basic and shorter and simpler sounds. At the lowest level, where the sounds are the most fundamental, a machine would check for simple and more probabilistic rules of what sound should represent. Once these sounds are put together into more complex sounds on upper level, a new set of more deterministic rules should predict what the new complex sound should represent. The most upper level of a deterministic rule should figure out the meaning of complex expressions. In order to expand our knowledge about speech recognition, we need to take into consideration neural networks. There are four steps of neural network approaches: 
* Digitize the speech that we want to recognize
For telephone speech the sampling rate is 8000 samples per second; 
* Compute features of spectral-domain of the speech (with Fourier transform);
computed every 10 ms, with one 10 ms section called a frame;

Analysis of four-step neural network approaches can be explained by further information. Sound is produced by air (or some other medium) vibration, which we register by ears, but machines by receivers. Basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions: amplitude (how strong is it), and frequency (how often it vibrates per second).
Accuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate (WER). Word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment. The problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of the recognized word and referenced word.

The formula to compute the word error rate (WER) is:

formula_1

where &quot;s&quot; is the number of substitutions, &quot;d&quot; is the number of deletions, &quot;i&quot; is the number of insertions, and &quot;n&quot; is the number of word references.

While computing, the word recognition rate (WRR) is used. The formula is:

: formula_2

where &quot;h&quot; is the number of correctly recognized words:

: formula_3

===Security concerns===
Speech recognition can become a means of attack, theft, or accidental operation. For example, activation words like &quot;Alexa&quot; spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately, or possibly take an unwanted action. Voice-controlled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building, or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside. Attackers may be able to gain access to personal information, like calendar, address book contents, private messages, and documents. They may also be able to impersonate the user to send messages or make online purchases.

Two attacks have been demonstrated that use artificial sounds. One transmits ultrasound and attempt to send commands without nearby people noticing. The other adds small, inaudible distortions to other speech or music that are specially crafted to confuse the specific speech recognition system into recognizing music as speech, or to make what sounds like one command to a human sound like a different command to the system.

=== Conferences and journals ===
Popular speech recognition conferences held each year or two include SpeechTEK and SpeechTEK Europe, ICASSP, Interspeech/Eurospeech, and the IEEE ASRU. Conferences in the field of natural language processing, such as ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and HLT, are beginning to include papers on speech processing. Important journals include the IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing (later renamed IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing and since Sept 2014 renamed IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing—after merging with an ACM publication), Computer Speech and Language, and Speech Communication.

=== Books ===
Books like &quot;Fundamentals of Speech Recognition&quot; by Lawrence Rabiner can be useful to acquire basic knowledge but may not be fully up to date (1993). Another good source can be &quot;Statistical Methods for Speech Recognition&quot; by Frederick Jelinek and &quot;Spoken Language Processing (2001)&quot; by Xuedong Huang etc., &quot;Computer Speech&quot;, by Manfred R. Schroeder, second edition published in 2004, and &quot;Speech Processing: A Dynamic and Optimization-Oriented Approach&quot; published in 2003 by Li Deng and Doug O&#x27;Shaughnessey. The updated textbook &quot;Speech and Language Processing&quot; (2008) by Jurafsky and Martin presents the basics and the state of the art for ASR. Speaker recognition also uses the same features, most of the same front-end processing, and classification techniques as is done in speech recognition. A comprehensive textbook, &quot;Fundamentals of Speaker Recognition&quot; is an in depth source for up to date details on the theory and practice. A good insight into the techniques used in the best modern systems can be gained by paying attention to government sponsored evaluations such as those organised by DARPA (the largest speech recognition-related project ongoing as of 2007 is the GALE project, which involves both speech recognition and translation components).

A good and accessible introduction to speech recognition technology and its history is provided by the general audience book &quot;The Voice in the Machine. Building Computers That Understand Speech&quot; by Roberto Pieraccini (2012).

The most recent book on speech recognition is &quot;Automatic Speech Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach&quot; (Publisher: Springer) written by Microsoft researchers D. Yu and L. Deng and published near the end of 2014, with highly mathematically oriented technical detail on how deep learning methods are derived and implemented in modern speech recognition systems based on DNNs and related deep learning methods. A related book, published earlier in 2014, &quot;Deep Learning: Methods and Applications&quot; by L. Deng and D. Yu provides a less technical but more methodology-focused overview of DNN-based speech recognition during 2009–2014, placed within the more general context of deep learning applications including not only speech recognition but also image recognition, natural language processing, information retrieval, multimodal processing, and multitask learning.

=== Software ===
In terms of freely available resources, Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Sphinx toolkit is one place to start to both learn about speech recognition and to start experimenting. Another resource (free but copyrighted) is the HTK book (and the accompanying HTK toolkit). For more recent and state-of-the-art techniques, Kaldi toolkit can be used. In 2017 Mozilla launched the open source project called Common Voice to gather big database of voices that would help build free speech recognition project DeepSpeech (available free at GitHub), using Google&#x27;s open source platform TensorFlow. When Mozilla redirected funding away from the project in 2020, it was forked by its original developers as Coqui STT using the same open-source license.

Google Gboard supports speech recognition on all Android applications. It can be activated through the microphone icon.

The commercial cloud based speech recognition APIs are broadly available.

<doc id="29469" wikidata="Q127583" url="?curid=29469" title="Sapphire">
<text>Sapphire is a precious gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum, consisting of aluminium oxide () with trace amounts of elements such as iron, titanium, cobalt, lead, chromium, vanadium, magnesium, boron, and silicon. The name &quot;sapphire&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, itself from the Greek word (), which referred to lapis lazuli. It is typically blue, but natural &quot;fancy&quot; sapphires also occur in yellow, purple, orange, and green colors; &quot;parti sapphires&quot; show two or more colors. Red corundum stones also occur, but are called rubies rather than sapphires. Pink-colored corundum may be classified either as ruby or sapphire depending on the locale. Commonly, natural sapphires are cut and polished into gemstones and worn in jewelry. They also may be created synthetically in laboratories for industrial or decorative purposes in large crystal boules. Because of the remarkable hardness of sapphires 9 on the Mohs scale (the third-hardest mineral, after diamond at 10 and moissanite at 9.5) sapphires are also used in some non-ornamental applications, such as infrared optical components, high-durability windows, wristwatch crystals and movement bearings, and very thin electronic wafers, which are used as the insulating substrates of special-purpose solid-state electronics such as integrated circuits and GaN-based blue LEDs. Sapphire is the birthstone for September and the gem of the 45th anniversary. A sapphire jubilee occurs after 65 years.

==Natural sapphires==
Sapphire is one of the two gem-varieties of corundum, the other being ruby (defined as corundum in a shade of red). Although blue is the best-known sapphire color, it occurs in other colors, including gray and black, and also can be colorless. A pinkish orange variety of sapphire is called padparadscha.

Significant sapphire deposits are found in Australia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cameroon, China (Shandong), Colombia, Ethiopia, India Jammu and Kashmir (Padder, Kishtwar), Kenya, Laos, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar (Burma), Nigeria, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, United States (Montana) and Vietnam. Sapphire and rubies are often found in the same geographical settings, but they generally have different geological formations. For example, both ruby and sapphire are found in Myanmar&#x27;s Mogok Stone Tract, but the rubies form in marble, while the sapphire forms in granitic pegmatites or corundum syenites.

Every sapphire mine produces a wide range of quality, and origin is not a guarantee of quality. For sapphire, Jammu and Kashmir receives the highest premium, although Burma, Sri Lanka, and Madagascar also produce large quantities of fine quality gems.

The cost of natural sapphires varies depending on their color, clarity, size, cut, and overall quality. Sapphires that are completely untreated are worth far more than those that have been treated. Geographical origin also has a major impact on price. For most gems of one carat or more, an independent report from a respected laboratory such as GIA, Lotus Gemology, or SSEF, is often required by buyers before they will make a purchase.

==Colors==
Sapphires in colors other than blue are called &quot;fancy&quot; sapphires. &quot;Parti sapphire&quot; is used for multicolor stones with zoning of different colors (hues), but not different shades.

Fancy sapphires are found in yellow, orange, green, brown, purple, violet, and practically any other hue.

===Blue sapphire===
Gemstone color can be described in terms of hue, saturation, and tone. Hue is commonly understood as the &quot;color&quot; of the gemstone. Saturation refers to the vividness or brightness of the hue, and tone is the lightness to darkness of the hue. Blue sapphire exists in various mixtures of its primary (blue) and secondary hues, various tonal levels (shades) and at various levels of saturation (vividness).

Blue sapphires are evaluated based upon the purity of their blue hue. Violet and green are the most common secondary hues found in blue sapphires. The highest prices are paid for gems that are pure blue and of vivid saturation. Gems that are of lower saturation, or are too dark or too light in tone are of less value. However, color preferences are a personal taste.

The Logan sapphire in the National Museum of Natural History, in Washington, D.C., is one of the largest faceted gem-quality blue sapphires in existence. 

===Parti sapphires===

Particolored sapphires (or bi-color sapphires) are those stones that exhibit two or more colors within a single stone. The desirability of particolored or bi-color sapphires is usually judged based on the zoning or location of their colors, the colors&#x27; saturation, and the contrast of their colors. Australia is the largest source of particolored sapphires; they are not commonly used in mainstream jewelry and remain relatively unknown. Particolored sapphires cannot be created synthetically and only occur naturally.

===Pink sapphires===

Pink sapphires occur in shades from light to dark pink, and deepen in color as the quantity of chromium increases. The deeper the pink color, the higher their monetary value. In the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby, otherwise the stone is referred to as a &quot;pink sapphire&quot;.

===Padparadscha===
&quot;Padparadscha&quot; is a delicate, light to medium toned, pink-orange to orange-pink hued corundum, originally found in Sri Lanka, but also found in deposits in Vietnam and parts of East Africa. Padparadscha sapphires are rare; the rarest of all is the totally natural variety, with no sign of artificial treatment.

The name is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;padma ranga&quot; (padma = lotus; ranga = color), a color akin to the lotus flower (&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;).

Among the fancy (non-blue) sapphires, natural padparadscha fetch the highest prices. Since 2001, more sapphires of this color have appeared on the market as a result of artificial lattice diffusion of beryllium.

===Star sapphire===
A &quot;star sapphire&quot; is a type of sapphire that exhibits a star-like phenomenon known as asterism; red stones are known as &quot;star rubies&quot;. Star sapphires contain intersecting needle-like inclusions following the underlying crystal structure that causes the appearance of a six-rayed &quot;star&quot;-shaped pattern when viewed with a single overhead light source. The inclusion is often the mineral rutile, a mineral composed primarily of titanium dioxide. The stones are cut &quot;en cabochon&quot;, typically with the center of the star near the top of the dome. Occasionally, twelve-rayed stars are found, typically because two different sets of inclusions are found within the same stone, such as a combination of fine needles of rutile with small platelets of hematite; the first results in a whitish star and the second results in a golden-colored star. During crystallization, the two types of inclusions become preferentially oriented in different directions within the crystal, thereby forming two six-rayed stars that are superimposed upon each other to form a twelve-rayed star. Misshapen stars or 12-rayed stars may also form as a result of twinning.
The inclusions can alternatively produce a cat&#x27;s eye effect if the girdle plane of the cabochon is oriented parallel to the crystal&#x27;s c-axis rather than perpendicular to it. To get a cat&#x27;s eye, the planes of exsolved inclusions must be extremely uniform and tightly packed. If the dome is oriented in between these two directions, an off-center star will be visible, offset away from the high point of the dome.

At 1404.49 carats, The Star of Adam is the largest known blue star sapphire. The gem was mined in the city of Ratnapura, southern Sri Lanka. The Black Star of Queensland, the second largest star sapphire in the world, weighs 733 carats. The Star of India mined in Sri Lanka and weighing 563.4 carats is thought to be the third-largest star sapphire, and is currently on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The 182-carat Star of Bombay, mined in Sri Lanka and located in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., is another example of a large blue star sapphire. The value of a star sapphire depends not only on the weight of the stone, but also the body color, visibility, and intensity of the asterism. The color of the stone has more impact on the value than the visibility of the star. Since more transparent stones tend to have better colors, the most expensive star stones are semi-transparent &quot;glass body&quot; stones with vivid colors.

On 28 July 2021, the world&#x27;s largest cluster of star sapphires, weighing , was unearthed from Ratnapura, Sri Lanka. This star sapphire cluster was named &quot;Serendipity Sapphire&quot;.

===Color-change sapphire===
A rare variety of natural sapphire, known as color-change sapphire, exhibits different colors in different light. Color change sapphires are blue in outdoor light and purple under incandescent indoor light, or green to gray-green in daylight and pink to reddish-violet in incandescent light. Color-change sapphires come from a variety of locations, including Madagascar, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. Two types exist. The first features the chromium chromophore that creates the red color of ruby, combined with the iron + titanium chromophore that produces the blue color in sapphire. A rarer type, which comes from the Mogok area of Myanmar, features a vanadium chromophore, the same as is present in Verneuil synthetic color-change sapphire.

Virtually all gemstones that show the &quot;alexandrite effect&quot; (color change or &#x27;metamerism&#x27;) show similar absorption/transmission features in the visible spectrum. This is an absorption band in the yellow (~590 nm), along with valleys of transmission in the blue-green and red. Thus the color one sees depends on the spectral composition of the light source. Daylight is relatively balanced in its spectral power distribution (SPD) and since the human eye is most sensitive to green light, the balance is tipped to the green side. However incandescent light (including candle light) is heavily tilted to the red end of the spectrum, thus tipping the balance to red.

Color-change sapphires colored by the Cr + Fe/Ti chromophores generally change from blue or violet-blue to violet or purple. Those colored by the V chromophore can show a more pronounced change, moving from blue-green to purple.

Certain synthetic color-change sapphires have a similar color change to the natural gemstone alexandrite and they are sometimes marketed as &quot;alexandrium&quot; or &quot;synthetic alexandrite&quot;. However, the latter term is a misnomer: synthetic color-change sapphires are, technically, not synthetic alexandrites but rather alexandrite &quot;simulants&quot;. This is because genuine alexandrite is a variety of chrysoberyl: not sapphire, but an entirely different mineral from corundum.

===Large rubies and sapphires===
Large rubies and sapphires of poor transparency are frequently used with suspect appraisals that vastly overstate their value. This was the case of the &quot;Life and Pride of America Star Sapphire&quot;. Circa 1985, Roy Whetstine claimed to have bought the 1905-ct stone for $10 at the Tucson gem show, but a reporter discovered that L.A. Ward of Fallbrook, California, who appraised it at the price of $1200/ct, had appraised another stone of the exact same weight several years before Whetstine claimed to have found it.

Bangkok-based Lotus Gemology maintains an updated listing of world auction records of ruby, sapphire, and spinel. As of November 2019, no sapphire has ever sold at auction for more than $17,295,796.

==Cause of color==
Rubies are corundum with a dominant red body color. This is generally caused by traces of chromium (Cr3+) substituting for the (Al3+) ion in the corundum structure. The color can be modified by both iron and trapped hole color centers.

Unlike localized (&quot;intra-atomic&quot;) absorption of light, which causes color for chromium and vanadium impurities, blue color in sapphires comes from intervalence charge transfer, which is the transfer of an electron from one transition-metal ion to another via the conduction or valence band. The iron can take the form Fe2+ or Fe3+, while titanium generally takes the form Ti4+. If Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions are substituted for Al3+, localized areas of charge imbalance are created. An electron transfer from Fe2+ and Ti4+ can cause a change in the valence state of both. Because of the valence change, there is a specific change in energy for the electron, and electromagnetic energy is absorbed. The wavelength of the energy absorbed corresponds to yellow light. When this light is subtracted from incident white light, the complementary color blue results. Sometimes when atomic spacing is different in different directions, there is resulting blue-green dichroism.

Purple sapphires contain trace amounts of chromium and iron plus titanium and come in a variety of shades. Corundum that contains extremely low levels of chromophores is near colorless. Completely colorless corundum generally does not exist in nature. If trace amounts of iron are present, a very pale yellow to green color may be seen. However, if both titanium and iron impurities are present together, and in the correct valence states, the result is a blue color.

Intervalence charge transfer is a process that produces a strong colored appearance at a low percentage of impurity. While at least 1% chromium must be present in corundum before the deep red ruby color is seen, sapphire blue is apparent with the presence of only 0.01% of titanium and iron.

Colorless sapphires, which are uncommon in nature, were once used as diamond substitutes in jewelry, and are presently used as accent stones.

The most complete description of the causes of color in corundum extant can be found in Chapter 4 of &quot;Ruby &amp; Sapphire: A Gemologist&#x27;s Guide&quot; (chapter authored by John Emmett, Emily Dubinsky and Richard Hughes).

==Mining==
Sapphires are mined from alluvial deposits or from primary underground workings. Commercial mining locations for sapphire and ruby include (but are not limited to) the following countries: Afghanistan, Australia, Myanmar/Burma, Cambodia, China, Colombia, India, Kenya, Laos, Madagascar, Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, United States, and Vietnam. Sapphires from different geographic locations may have different appearances or chemical-impurity concentrations, and tend to contain different types of microscopic inclusions. Because of this, sapphires can be divided into three broad categories: classic metamorphic, non-classic metamorphic or magmatic, and classic magmatic.

Sapphires from certain locations, or of certain categories, may be more commercially appealing than others, particularly classic metamorphic sapphires from Kashmir, Burma, or Sri Lanka that have not been subjected to heat-treatment.

The Logan sapphire, the Star of India, The Star of Adam and the Star of Bombay originate from Sri Lankan mines. Madagascar is the world leader in sapphire production (as of 2007) specifically its deposits in and around the town of Ilakaka. Prior to the opening of the Ilakaka mines, Australia was the largest producer of sapphires (such as in 1987). In 1991 a new source of sapphires was discovered in Andranondambo, southern Madagascar. The exploitation started in 1993, but was practically abandoned just a few years later because of the difficulties in recovering sapphires in their bedrock.

In North America, sapphires have been mined mostly from deposits in Montana: facies along the Missouri River near Helena, Montana, Dry Cottonwood Creek near Deer Lodge, Montana, and Rock Creek near Philipsburg, Montana. Fine blue Yogo sapphires are found at Yogo Gulch west of Lewistown, Montana. A few gem-grade sapphires and rubies have also been found in the area of Franklin, North Carolina.

The sapphire deposits of Kashmir are well known in the gem industry, although their peak production took place in a relatively short period at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These deposits are located in the Paddar Valley of the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir in India. They have a superior vivid blue hue, coupled with a mysterious and almost sleepy quality, described by some gem enthusiasts as ‘blue velvet”. Kashmir-origin contributes meaningfully to the value of a sapphire, and most corundum of Kashmir origin can be readily identified by its characteristic silky appearance and exceptional hue. The unique blue appears lustrous under any kind of light, unlike non-Kashmir sapphires which may appear purplish or grayish in comparison. Sotheby&#x27;s has been in the forefront overseeing record-breaking sales of Kashmir sapphires worldwide. In October 2014, Sotheby&#x27;s Hong Kong achieved consecutive per-carat price records for Kashmir sapphires – first with the 12.00 carat Cartier sapphire ring at US$193,975 per carat, then with a 17.16 carat sapphire at US$236,404, and again in June 2015 when the per-carat auction record was set at US$240,205. At present, the world record price-per-carat for sapphire at auction is held by a sapphire from Kashmir in a ring, which sold in October 2015 for approximately US$242,000 per carat (HK$52,280,000 in total, including buyer&#x27;s premium, or more than US$6.74 million).

==Treatments==
Sapphires can be treated by several methods to enhance and improve their clarity and color. It is common practice to heat natural sapphires to improve or enhance their appearance. This is done by heating the sapphires in furnaces to temperatures between for several hours, or even weeks at a time. Different atmospheres may be used. Upon heating, the stone becomes bluer in color, but loses some of the rutile inclusions (silk). When high temperatures (1400 °C+) are used, exsolved rutile silk is dissolved and it becomes clear under magnification. The titanium from the rutile enters solid solution and thus creates with iron the blue color. The inclusions in natural stones are easily seen with a jeweler&#x27;s loupe. Evidence of sapphire and other gemstones being subjected to heating goes back at least to Roman times. Un-heated natural stones are somewhat rare and will often be sold accompanied by a certificate from an independent gemological laboratory attesting to &quot;no evidence of heat treatment&quot;.
Yogo sapphires do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue color is attractive out of the ground; they are generally free of inclusions, and have high uniform clarity. When Intergem Limited began marketing the Yogo in the 1980s as the world&#x27;s only guaranteed untreated sapphire, heat treatment was not commonly disclosed; by the late 1980s, heat treatment became a major issue. At that time, much of all the world&#x27;s sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Intergem&#x27;s marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. This issue appeared as a front-page story in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on 29 August 1984 in an article by Bill Richards, &quot;Carats and Schticks: Sapphire Marketer Upsets The Gem Industry&quot;. However, the biggest problem the Yogo mine faced was not competition from heated sapphires, but the fact that the Yogo stones could never produce quantities of sapphire above one carat after faceting. As a result, it has remained a niche product, with a market that largely exists in the US.

Lattice (&#x27;bulk&#x27;) diffusion treatments are used to add impurities to the sapphire to enhance color. This process was originally developed and patented by Linde Air division of Union Carbide and involved diffusing titanium into synthetic sapphire to even out the blue color. It was later applied to natural sapphire. Today, titanium diffusion often uses a synthetic colorless sapphire base. The color layer created by titanium diffusion is extremely thin (less than 0.5 mm). Thus repolishing can and does produce slight to significant loss of color. Chromium diffusion has been attempted, but was abandoned due to the slow diffusion rates of chromium in corundum.

In the year 2000, beryllium diffused &quot;padparadscha&quot; colored sapphires entered the market. Typically beryllium is diffused into a sapphire under very high heat, just below the melting point of the sapphire. Initially () orange sapphires were created, although now the process has been advanced and many colors of sapphire are often treated with beryllium. Due to the small size of the beryllium ion, the color penetration is far greater than with titanium diffusion. In some cases, it may penetrate the entire stone. Beryllium-diffused orange sapphires may be difficult to detect, requiring advanced chemical analysis by gemological labs (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Gübelin, SSEF, GIA, American Gemological Laboratories (AGL), Lotus Gemology.

According to United States Federal Trade Commission guidelines, disclosure is required of any mode of enhancement that has a significant effect on the gem&#x27;s value.

There are several ways of treating sapphire. Heat-treatment in a reducing or oxidizing atmosphere (but without the use of any other added impurities) is commonly used to improve the color of sapphires, and this process is sometimes known as &quot;heating only&quot; in the gem trade. In contrast, however, heat treatment combined with the deliberate addition of certain specific impurities (e.g. beryllium, titanium, iron, chromium or nickel, which are absorbed into the crystal structure of the sapphire) is also commonly performed, and this process can be known as &quot;diffusion&quot; in the gem trade. However, despite what the terms &quot;heating only&quot; and &quot;diffusion&quot; might suggest, both of these categories of treatment actually involve diffusion processes.

The most complete description of corundum treatments extant can be found in Chapter 6 of &quot;Ruby &amp; Sapphire: A Gemologist&#x27;s Guide&quot; (chapter authored by John Emmett, Richard Hughes and Troy R. Douthit).

==Synthetic sapphire== 
In 1902, the French chemist Auguste Verneuil announced a process for producing synthetic ruby crystals. In the flame-fusion (Verneuil process), fine alumina powder is added to an oxyhydrogen flame, and this is directed downward against a ceramic pedestal. Following the successful synthesis of ruby, Verneuil focused his efforts on sapphire. Synthesis of blue sapphire came in 1909, after chemical analyses of sapphire suggested to Verneuil that iron and titanium were the cause of the blue color. Verneuil patented the process of producing synthetic blue sapphire in 1911.

The key to the process is that the alumina powder does not melt as it falls through the flame. Instead it forms a sinter cone on the pedestal. When the tip of that cone reaches the hottest part of the flame, the tip melts. Thus the crystal growth is started from a tiny point, ensuring minimal strain.

Next, more oxygen is added to the flame, causing it to burn slightly hotter. This expands the growing crystal laterally. At the same time, the pedestal is lowered at the same rate that the crystal grows vertically. The alumina in the flame is slowly deposited, creating a teardrop shaped &quot;boule&quot; of sapphire material. This step is continued until the desired size is reached, the flame is shut off and the crystal cools. The now elongated crystal contains a lot of strain due to the high thermal gradient between the flame and surrounding air. To release this strain, the now finger-shaped crystal will be tapped with a chisel to split it into two halves.

Due to the vertical layered growth of the crystal and the curved upper growth surface (which starts from a drop), the crystals will display curved growth lines following the top surface of the boule. This is in contrast to natural corundum crystals, which feature angular growth lines expanding from a single point and following the planar crystal faces.

===Dopants===
Chemical dopants can be added to create artificial versions of the ruby, and all the other natural colors of sapphire, and in addition, other colors never seen in geological samples. Artificial sapphire material is identical to natural sapphire, except it can be made without the flaws that are found in natural stones. The disadvantage of the Verneuil process is that the grown crystals have high internal strains. Many methods of manufacturing sapphire today are variations of the Czochralski process, which was invented in 1916 by Polish chemist Jan Czochralski. In this process, a tiny sapphire seed crystal is dipped into a crucible made of the precious metal iridium or molybdenum, containing molten alumina, and then slowly withdrawn upward at a rate of 1 to 100 mm per hour. The alumina crystallizes on the end, creating long carrot-shaped boules of large size up to 200 kg in mass.

===Other growth methods===
Synthetic sapphire is also produced industrially from agglomerated aluminum oxide, sintered and fused (such as by hot isostatic pressing) in an inert atmosphere, yielding a transparent but slightly porous polycrystalline product.

In 2003, the world&#x27;s production of synthetic sapphire was 250 tons (1.25 × 109 carats), mostly by the United States and Russia. The availability of cheap synthetic sapphire unlocked many industrial uses for this unique material.

===Applications===
====Equipment windows====

Synthetic sapphire—also referred to as &quot;sapphire glass&quot;—is commonly used for small windows, because it is both highly transparent to wavelengths of light between 150 nm (UV) and 5500 nm (IR) (the visible spectrum extends about 380 nm to 750 nm), and extraordinarily scratch-resistant.

The key benefits of sapphire windows are:

* Very wide optical transmission band from UV to near infrared (0.15–5.5 μm)
* Significantly stronger than other optical materials or standard glass windows
* Highly resistant to scratching and abrasion (9 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness scale, the third-hardest natural substance next to moissanite and diamonds)
* Extremely high melting temperature (2030 °C)
Some sapphire-glass windows are made from pure sapphire boules that have been grown in a specific crystal orientation, typically along the optical axis, the &quot;c&quot; axis, for minimum birefringence for the application.

The boules are sliced up into the desired window thickness and finally polished to the desired surface finish. Sapphire optical windows can be polished to a wide range of surface finishes due to its crystal structure and its hardness. The surface finishes of optical windows are normally called out by the scratch-dig specifications in accordance with the globally adopted MIL-O-13830 specification.

Sapphire windows are used in both high-pressure and vacuum chambers for spectroscopy, crystals for watches, and windows in grocery-store barcode scanners, since the material&#x27;s exceptional hardness and toughness makes it very resistant to scratching.

In 2014 Apple consumed &quot;one-fourth of the world&#x27;s supply of sapphire to cover the iPhone&#x27;s camera lens and fingerprint reader&quot;.

Several attempts have been made to make sapphire screens for smartphones viable. Apple contracted GT Advanced Technologies, Inc. to manufacture sapphire screens for iPhones, but the venture failed, causing the bankruptcy of GTAT. The Kyocera Brigadier was the first production smartphone with a sapphire screen.

Sapphire is used for end windows on some high-powered laser tubes, as its wide-band transparency and thermal conductivity allow it to handle very high power densities in the infrared and UV spectrum without degrading due to heating.

One type of xenon arc lamporiginally called the &quot;Cermax&quot; and now known generically as the &quot;ceramic-body xenon lamp&quot;uses sapphire crystal output windows that tolerate higher thermal loads and consequently can provide higher output powers than conventional Xe lamps with pure silica windows.

Sapphire window was used for the F-35 Lightning 2 Electro Optical Targeting System window, due to its high strength.
Along with zirconia and aluminum oxynitride, synthetic sapphire is used for shatter-resistant windows in armored vehicles and various military body armor suits, in association with composites.

====As substrate for semiconducting circuits====

Thin sapphire wafers were the first successful use of an insulating substrate upon which to deposit silicon to make the integrated circuits known as silicon on sapphire or &quot;SOS&quot;; now other substrates can also be used for the class of circuits known more generally as silicon on insulator. Besides its excellent electrical insulating properties, sapphire has high thermal conductivity. CMOS chips on sapphire are especially useful for high-power radio-frequency (RF) applications such as those found in cellular telephones, public-safety band radios, and satellite communication systems. &quot;SOS&quot; also allows for the monolithic integration of both digital and analog circuitry all on one IC chip, and the construction of extremely low power circuits.

In one process, after single crystal sapphire boules are grown, they are core-drilled into cylindrical rods, and wafers are then sliced from these cores.

Wafers of single-crystal sapphire are also used in the semiconductor industry as substrates for the growth of devices based on gallium nitride (GaN). The use of sapphire significantly reduces the cost, because it has about one-seventh the cost of germanium. Gallium nitride on sapphire is commonly used in blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

====In lasers====
The first laser was made in 1960 by Theodore Maiman with a rod of synthetic ruby. Titanium-sapphire lasers are popular due to their relatively rare capacity to be tuned to various wavelengths in the red and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They can also be easily mode-locked. In these lasers a synthetically produced sapphire crystal with chromium or titanium impurities is irradiated with intense light from a special lamp, or another laser, to create stimulated emission.

====In endoprostheses====
Monocrystalline sapphire is fairly biocompatible and the exceptionally low wear of sapphire–metal pairs has led to the introduction (in Ukraine) of sapphire monocrystals for hip joint endoprostheses.

==Historical and cultural references==
* Etymologically, the English word &quot;sapphire&quot; derives from French &#x27;, from Latin &#x27;, &quot;sappirus&quot; from Greek σαπφειρος (&quot;sappheiros&quot;) from Hebrew (), a term that probably originally referred to lapis lazuli, as sapphires were only discovered in Roman times. The term is believed to derive from the root סָפַר (&quot;sāp̄ar&quot;), meaning &quot;to score with a mark,&quot; presumably because gemstones can be used to scratch stone surfaces due to their high hardness.
* A traditional Hindu belief holds that the sapphire causes the planet Saturn (Shani) to be favorable to the wearer.
* The Greek term for sapphire quite likely was instead used to refer to lapis lazuli.
* During the Medieval Ages, European lapidaries came to refer to blue corundum crystal by &quot;sapphire&quot;, a derivative of the Latin word for blue: .
* The sapphire is the traditional gift for a 45th wedding anniversary.
* A sapphire jubilee occurs after 65 years. In 2017 Queen Elizabeth II marked the sapphire jubilee of her accession to the throne.
* The sapphire is the birthstone of September.
* An Italian superstition holds that sapphires are amulets against eye problems, and melancholy. Mary, Queen of Scots, owned a medicinal sapphire worn as a pendant to rub sore eyes.
* Pope Innocent III decreed that rings of bishops should be made of pure gold, set with an unengraved sapphire, as possessing the virtues and qualities essential to its dignified position as a seal of secrets, for there be many things &quot;that a priest conceals from the senses of the vulgar and less intelligent; which he keeps locked up as it were under seal.&quot;
*The sapphire is the official state gem of Queensland since August 1985.

<text>Slack voice (or lax voice) is the pronunciation of consonant or vowels with a glottal opening slightly wider than that occurring in modal voice. Such sounds are often referred to informally as lenis or half-voiced in the case of consonants. In some Chinese varieties, such as Wu, and in a few Austronesian languages, the &#x27;intermediate&#x27; phonation of slack stops confuses listeners of languages without these distinctions, so that different transcription systems may use or for the same consonant. In Xhosa, slack-voiced consonants have usually been transcribed as breathy voice. Although the IPA has no dedicated diacritic for slack voice, the voiceless diacritic (the under-ring) may be used with a voiced consonant letter, though this convention is also used for partially voiced consonants in languages such as English.

Wu Chinese &quot;muddy&quot; consonants are slack voice word-initially, the primary effect of which is a slightly breathy quality of the following vowel.

Javanese contrasts slack and stiff voiced bilabial, dental, retroflex, and velar stops.


Parauk contrasts slack voicing in its vowels. The contrast is between &quot;slightly stiff&quot; and &quot;slightly breathy&quot; vowels; the first are between modal and stiff voice, while the latter are captured by slack voice.

<doc id="29473" wikidata="Q192054" url="?curid=29473" title="Salvation">
<text>Salvation (from Latin: &quot;salvatio&quot;, from &quot;salva&quot;, &#x27;safe, saved&#x27;) is the state of being saved or protected from harm or a dire situation. In religion and theology, &quot;salvation&quot; generally refers to the deliverance of the soul from sin and its consequences. The academic study of salvation is called &quot;soteriology&quot;.

== Meaning ==
In Abrahamic religions and theology, &quot;salvation&quot; is the saving of the soul from sin and its consequences. It may also be called &quot;deliverance&quot; or &quot;redemption&quot; from sin and its effects. Depending on the religion or even denomination, salvation is considered to be caused either only by the grace of God (i.e. unmerited and unearned), or by faith, good deeds (works), or a combination thereof. Religions often emphasize that man is a sinner by nature and that the penalty of sin is death (physical death, spiritual death: spiritual separation from God and eternal punishment in hell).

==Judaism==
In contemporary Judaism, redemption (Hebrew: ), refers to God redeeming the people of Israel from their various exiles. This includes the final redemption from the present exile.

Judaism holds that adherents do not need personal salvation as Christians believe. Jews do not subscribe to the doctrine of original sin. Instead, they place a high value on individual morality as defined in the law of God—embodied in what Jews know as the Torah or The Law, given to Moses by God on biblical Mount Sinai.

In Judaism, salvation is closely related to the idea of redemption, a saving from the states or circumstances that destroy the value of human existence. God, as the universal spirit and Creator of the World, is the source of all salvation for humanity, provided that an individual honours God by observing His precepts. So redemption or salvation depends on the individual. Judaism stresses that salvation cannot be obtained through anyone else or by just invoking a deity or believing in any outside power or influence.

When examining Jewish intellectual sources throughout history, there is clearly a spectrum of opinions regarding death versus the afterlife. Possibly an over-simplification, one source says salvation can be achieved in the following manner: Live a holy and righteous life dedicated to Yahweh, the God of Creation. Fast, worship, and celebrate during the appropriate holidays.

By origin and nature, Judaism is an ethnic religion. Therefore, salvation has been primarily conceived in terms of the destiny of Israel as the elect people of Yahweh (often referred to as &quot;the Lord&quot;), the God of Israel.

In the biblical text of Psalms, there is a description of death, when people go into the earth or the &quot;realm of the dead&quot; and cannot praise God. The first reference to resurrection is collective in Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of the dry bones, when all the Israelites in exile will be resurrected. There is a reference to individual resurrection in the Book of Daniel. It was not until the 2nd century BCE that there arose a belief in an afterlife, in which the dead would be resurrected and undergo divine judgment. Before that time, the individual had to be content that his posterity continued within the holy nation.

The salvation of the individual Jew was connected to the salvation of the entire people. This belief stemmed directly from the teachings of the Torah. In the Torah, God taught his people sanctification of the individual. However, he also expected them to function together (spiritually) and be accountable to one another. The concept of salvation was tied to that of restoration for Israel.

== Christianity ==

Christianity&#x27;s primary premise is that the incarnation and death of Jesus Christ formed the climax of a divine plan for humanity&#x27;s salvation. This plan was conceived by God before the creation of the world, achieved at the cross, and it would be completed at the Last Judgment, when the Second Coming of Christ would mark the catastrophic end of the world and the creation of a new world.

For Christianity, salvation is only possible through Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus&#x27; death on the cross was the once-for-all sacrifice that atoned for the sin of humanity.

The Christian religion, though not the exclusive possessor of the idea of redemption, has given to it a special definiteness and a dominant position. Taken in its widest sense, as deliverance from dangers and ills in general, most religions teach some form of it. It assumes an important position, however, only when the ills in question form part of a great system against which human power is helpless.

According to Christian belief, sin as the human predicament is considered to be universal. For example, in the Apostle Paul declared everyone to be under sin—Jew and Gentile alike. Salvation is made possible by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, which in the context of salvation is referred to as the &quot;atonement&quot;. Christian soteriology ranges from exclusive salvation to universal reconciliation concepts. While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agree that salvation is made possible by the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, dying on the cross.

Variant views on salvation are among the main fault lines dividing the various Christian denominations: Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. A few examples are found within Protestantism, notably in the Calvinist–Arminian debate, and between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, notably when dealing with Sola Fide during the Protestant Reformation. The fault lines can include conflicting definitions of depravity, predestination, atonement, but most pointedly justification.

Salvation, according to most denominations, is believed to be a process that begins when a person first becomes a Christian, continues through that person&#x27;s life, and is completed when they stand before Christ in judgment. Therefore, according to Catholic apologist James Akin, the faithful Christian can say in faith and hope, &quot;I &quot;have been&quot; saved; I &quot;am being&quot; saved; and I &quot;will be&quot; saved.&quot;

Christian salvation concepts are varied and complicated by certain theological concepts, traditional beliefs, and dogmas. Scripture is subject to individual and ecclesiastical interpretations. While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agrees that salvation is made possible by the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, dying on the cross.

The purpose of salvation is debated, but in general most Christian theologians agree that God devised and implemented his plan of salvation because he loves them and regards human beings as his children. Since human existence on Earth is said to be &quot;given to sin,&quot; salvation also has connotations that deal with the liberation of human beings from sin, and the sufferings associated with the punishment of sin—i.e., &quot;the wages of sin are death.&quot;

Christians believe that salvation depends on the grace of God. Stagg writes that a fact assumed throughout the Bible is that humanity is in, &quot;serious trouble from which we need deliverance…. The fact of sin as the human predicament is implied in the mission of Jesus, and it is explicitly affirmed in that connection.&quot; By its nature, salvation must answer to the plight of humankind as it actually is. Each individual&#x27;s plight as a sinner is the result of a fatal choice involving the whole person in bondage, guilt, estrangement, and death. Therefore, salvation must be concerned with the total person. &quot;It must offer redemption from bondage, forgiveness for guilt, reconciliation for estrangement, renewal for the marred image of God.&quot;

== Latter-Day Saints ==
According to doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the plan of salvation is God&#x27;s plan to save, redeem, and exalt all humankind who chose, either in this life, or in the world of spirits of the dead, to accept the grace of Jesus Christ by exercising faith in Him, repenting of their sins, and by making and keeping sacred covenants (including baptism). Since the vast majority of God&#x27;s children depart this life without that opportunity, Christ&#x27;s gospel is preached to the unbelieving spirits in spirit prison (1 Peter 3: 19) so that they might be judged by the same standards as the living and live by following God in their spirit form (1 Peter 4: 6). If they accept Christ, sincerely repent of their sins, and accept ordinances done on their behalf, they can, by the grace of Christ, receive salvation on the same terms as the living. For this reason, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints do vicarious work for the dead in sacred temples. The elements of this plan are drawn from various sources, including the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine &amp; Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and numerous statements made by the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

In Islam, salvation refers to the eventual entrance to Paradise. Islam teaches that people who die disbelieving in Islam do not receive salvation. Those who die believing in the one God and His message (Islam) receive salvation.

Narrated Anas, that The Prophet said:

Islam teaches that all who enter into Islam must remain so in order to receive salvation.

For those who have not been granted Islam or to whom the message has not been brought:

===Tawhid===
Belief in the &quot;One God&quot;, also known as the &quot;Tawhid&quot; () in Arabic, consists of two parts (or principles):

# &quot;Tawḥīdu r-Rubūbiyya&quot; (): Believing in the attributes of God and attributing them to no other but God. Such attributes include Creation, having no beginning, and having no end. These attributes are what make a God. Islam also teaches no less than 99 names for God, and each of these names defines one attribute. One breaks this principle, for example, by believing in an Idol as an intercessor to God. The idol, in this case, is thought of having powers that only God should have, thereby breaking this part of Tawheed. No intercession is required to communicate with, or worship, God.
# &quot;Tawḥīdu l-&#x27;ulūhiyya&quot; () : Directing worship, prayer, or deed to God, and God only. For example, worshiping an idol or any saint or prophet is also considered Shirk.

===Sin and repentance===
Islam also stresses that in order to gain salvation, one must also avoid sinning along with performing good deeds. Islam acknowledges the inclination of humanity towards sin. Therefore, Muslims are constantly commanded to seek God&#x27;s forgiveness and repent. Islam teaches that no one can gain salvation simply by virtue of their belief or deeds, instead it is the Mercy of God, which merits them salvation, as we have to know that by the mercy of god we are doing the good deeds and we are believing in God. However, repentance must not be used to sin any further. Islam teaches that God is Merciful.

Islam describes a true believer to have Love of God and Fear of God. Islam also teaches that every person is responsible for their own sins. The Quran states;

Al-Agharr al-Muzani who was from amongst the Companions of Allah&#x27;s Apostle reported that Ibn &#x27;Umar stated to him that Allah&#x27;s Messenger said:

Sin in Islam is not a state, but an action (a bad deed); Islam teaches that a child is born sinless, regardless of the belief of his parents, dies a Muslim; he enters heaven, and does not enter hell.

===Five Pillars===
Islam is built on five principles, acts of worship that Islam teaches to be mandatory. Not performing the mandatory acts of worship may deprive Muslims of the chance of salvation. According to Ibn &#x27;Umar, Muhammad said that Islam is based on the following five principles:

# To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah&#x27;s Messenger.
# To offer the compulsory prayers dutifully and perfectly.
# To pay Zakat to poor and needy (i.e. obligatory charity of 2.5% annually of surplus wealth).
# To perform Hajj (i.e. pilgrimage to Mecca).
# To observe fast during the month of Ramadhan.

== Indian religions ==
Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism share certain key concepts, which are interpreted differently by different groups and individuals. In these religions one is not liberated from sin and its consequences, but from the &quot;saṃsāra&quot; (cycle of rebirth) perpetuated by passions and delusions and its resulting karma. They differ however on the exact nature of this liberation.

Salvation is always self-attained in Indian religions, and a more appropriate term would be &quot;moksha&quot; (&#x27;liberation&#x27;) or &quot;mukti&quot; (&#x27;release&#x27;). This state and the conditions considered necessary for its realization is described in early texts of Indian religion such as the Upanishads and the Pāli Canon, and later texts such the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Vedanta tradition. &quot;Moksha&quot; can be attained by &quot;sādhanā&quot;, literally &#x27;means of accomplishing something&#x27;. It includes a variety of disciplines, such as yoga and &quot;dhyana&quot; (meditation).

Nirvana is the profound peace of mind that is acquired with &quot;moksha&quot;. In Buddhism and Jainism, it is the state of being free from suffering. In Hindu philosophy, it is union with the Brahman (Supreme Being). The word literally means &#x27;blown out&#x27; (as in a candle) and refers, in the Buddhist context, to the blowing out of the fires of desire, aversion, and delusion, and the imperturbable stillness of mind acquired thereafter.

In Theravada Buddhism the emphasis is on one&#x27;s own liberation from samsara. The Mahayana traditions emphasize the &quot;bodhisattva&quot; path, in which &quot;each Buddha and Bodhisattva is a redeemer,&quot; assisting the Buddhist in seeking to achieve the redemptive state. The assistance rendered is a form of self-sacrifice on the part of the teachers, who would presumably be able to achieve total detachment from worldly concerns, but have instead chosen to remain engaged in the material world to the degree that this is necessary to assist others in achieving such detachment.

== Jainism ==
In Jainism, &quot;salvation&quot;, &quot;moksha&quot;, and &quot;nirvana&quot; are one and the same. When a soul (&quot;atman&quot;) achieves &quot;moksha&quot;, it is released from the cycle of births and deaths, and achieves its pure self. It then becomes a &quot;siddha&quot; (&#x27;one who has accomplished his ultimate objective&#x27;). Attaining Moksha requires annihilation of all &quot;karmas&quot;, good and bad, because if karma is left, it must bear fruit.

== Taoism ==
While early Taoism had no understanding of the concept of salvation, later in Taoist history, salvation became a major part of beliefs about it. Things one could do to be saved was to pray, offer sacrifices, and/or become a &quot;xian&quot; () immortal.

<doc id="29475" wikidata="Q249890" url="?curid=29475" title="Lockheed S-3 Viking">
<text>The Lockheed S-3 Viking is a four-crew, twin-engine turbofan-powered jet aircraft designed and produced by the American aerospace manufacturer Lockheed Corporation. Because of its characteristic sound, it was nicknamed the &quot;War Hoover&quot; after the vacuum cleaner brand.

The S-3 was developed in response to the VSX program conducted by the U.S. Navy (USN) to procure a successor anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft to the Grumman S-2 Tracker. It was designed, with assistance from Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV), to be a carrier-based, subsonic, all-weather, long-range, multi-mission aircraft.

On 21 January 1972, the prototype &quot;YS-3A&quot; performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight. Upon entering regular service during February 1974, it proved to be a reliable workhorse. In the ASW role, the S-3 carried automated weapons and in-flight refueling gear. Further variants, such as the &quot;ES-3A Shadow&quot; carrier-based electronic intelligence (ELINT) platform, and the &quot;US-3A&quot; carrier-based utility and cargo transport, arrived during the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1990s, the S-3B&#x27;s mission focus shifted to surface warfare and aerial refueling a carrier battle group. It saw combat during the Gulf War of the early 1990s, the Yugoslav Wars of the mid-to-late 1990s, and the War in Afghanistan during the 2000s.

The S-3 was removed from front-line fleet service aboard aircraft carriers in January 2009, its missions having been taken over by the P-3C Orion, P-8 Poseidon, SH-60 Seahawk, and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. For more than a decade after that, some S-3s were flown by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Thirty (VX-30) at Naval Base Ventura County / NAS Point Mugu, California, for range clearance and surveillance operations at the NAVAIR Point Mugu Range. These final examples in U.S. Navy service were retired in early 2016. The last operational S-3 was used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at its Glenn Research Center until NASA retired it in mid-2021. Most retired S-3s were placed into storage while options for their future were investigated. During the 2010s, Lockheed Martin proposed to refurbish them for carrier onboard delivery. The Republic of Korea Navy also had plans to operate revived S-3s for ASW; these plans were cancelled in 2017.

==Development==

In the mid-1960s, the United States Navy (USN) formulated the &quot;VSX&quot; (Heavier-than-air, Anti-submarine, Experimental) requirement, which sought a dedicated anti-submarine aircraft capable of flying off of its aircraft carriers as a replacement for its existing inventory of piston-engined Grumman S-2 Trackers. The service issued a request for proposals to industry. During August 1968, a team led by Lockheed, as well as a rival team comprising Convair and Grumman, were requested to further develop their proposals to meet this requirement.

At this stage, Lockheed recognised that it had little experience in designing carrier based aircraft, thus the company reached out to the industrial conglomerate Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV), which joined the team. LTV assumed responsibility for the design of various elements of the airframe, such as the folding wings and tail, the engine nacelles, and the landing gear, some of which had been derived from the earlier LTV A-7 Corsair II and Vought F-8 Crusader. Sperry Univac Federal Systems was assigned the task of developing the aircraft&#x27;s onboard computers which integrated input from sensors and sonobuoys.

On 4 August 1969, Lockheed&#x27;s design was selected as the winner of the VSX contest; an order for eight prototypes, designated &quot;YS-3A&quot;, was promptly received by the company. On 21 January 1972, the first prototype performed its maiden flight in the hands of military test pilot John Christiansen. Flight testing proceeded quickly with no major issues; two years later, the S-3 entered operational service with the U.S. Navy. During the type&#x27;s production run, which ran from 1974 to 1978, a total of 186 S-3As were constructed. The majority of the surviving S-3As were later upgraded to the improved &quot;S-3B&quot; variant, while 16 aircraft were also converted into &quot;ES-3A Shadow&quot; electronic intelligence (ELINT) collection aircraft.

==Design==
The Lockheed S-3 Viking is a conventional monoplane with a cantilever shoulder wing, very slightly swept with a leading edge angle of 15° and an almost straight trailing edge. Its twin GE TF-34 high-bypass turbofan engines mounted in nacelles under the wings provide excellent fuel efficiency, providing the Viking with the required long range and endurance, while also maintaining relatively docile engine-out characteristics.
The aircraft can seat four crew members (three officers and one enlisted) with pilot and copilot/tactical coordinator (COTAC) in the front of the cockpit and the tactical coordinator (TACCO) and sensor operator (SENSO) in the back. Entry is via a hatch/ladder folding down out of the lower starboard side of the fuselage behind the cockpit, in between the rear and front seats on the starboard side. When the aircraft&#x27;s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role ended in the late 1990s, the enlisted SENSOs were removed from the crew. In tanker crew configuration, the S-3B typically flew with a pilot and co-pilot/COTAC. The wing is fitted with leading edge and Fowler flaps. Spoilers are fitted to both the upper and the lower surfaces of the wings. All control surfaces are actuated by dual hydraulically boosted irreversible systems. In the event of dual hydraulic failures, an Emergency Flight Control System (EFCS) permits manual control with greatly increased stick forces and reduced control authority.

Unlike many tactical jets which required ground service equipment, the S-3 was equipped with an auxiliary power unit (APU) and capable of unassisted starts. The aircraft&#x27;s original APU could provide only minimal electric power and pressurized air for both aircraft cooling and for the engines&#x27; pneumatic starters. A newer, more powerful APU could provide full electrical service to the aircraft. The APU itself was started from a hydraulic accumulator by pulling a handle in the cockpit. The APU accumulator was fed from the primary hydraulic system, but could also be pumped up manually (with much effort) from the cockpit.

All crew members sit on forward-facing, upward-firing Douglas Escapac zero-zero ejection seats. In &quot;group eject&quot; mode, initiating ejection from either of the front seats ejects the entire crew in sequence, with the back seats ejecting 0.5 seconds before the front in order to provide safe separation (this was to prevent the pilots, who were more aware of what was happening outside the aircraft from ejecting without the rest of the crew, or being forced to delay ejection to order the crew to eject in an emergency; ejection from either rear seat would not eject the pilots, who had to initiate their own ejections, to prevent loss of the aircraft if a rear crewmember ejected prematurely. If a pilot ejected prematurely, the plane was lost anyway, and automatic ejection prevented the crew from crashing with a pilot-less aircraft before they were aware of what had happened). The rear seats are capable of self ejection and the ejection sequence includes a pyrotechnic charge that stows the rear keyboard trays out of the occupants&#x27; way immediately before ejection. Safe ejection requires the seats to be weighted in pairs, and when flying with a single crewman in the back the unoccupied seat is fitted with ballast.

At the time it entered the fleet, the S-3 introduced an unprecedented level of systems integration. Previous ASW aircraft like the Lockheed P-3 Orion and S-3&#x27;s predecessor, the Grumman S-2 Tracker, featured separate instrumentation and controls for each sensor system. Sensor operators often monitored paper traces, using mechanical calipers to make precise measurements and annotating data by writing on the scrolling paper. Beginning with the S-3, all sensor systems were integrated through a single General Purpose Digital Computer (GPDC). Each crew station had its own display, the co-pilot/COTAC, TACCO and SENSO displays were Multi-Purpose Displays (MPD) capable of displaying data from any of a number of systems. This new level of integration allowed the crew to consult with each other by examining the same data at multiple stations simultaneously, to manage workload by assigning responsibility for a given sensor from one station to another and to easily combine clues from each sensor to classify faint targets. As a consequence of this integration, the four-crew S-3 was considered roughly equivalent in terms of capability to the much larger P-3, operated by a crew of 12.

The aircraft has two underwing hardpoints that can be used to carry fuel tanks, general purpose and cluster bombs, missiles, rockets, and storage pods. It also has four internal bomb bay stations that can be used to carry general-purpose bombs, aerial torpedoes, and special stores (B57 and B61 nuclear weapons). Fifty-nine sonobuoys are carried, as well as a dedicated Search and Rescue (SAR) chute. The S-3 is fitted with the ALE-39 countermeasure system and can carry up to 90 rounds of chaff, flares, and expendable jammers (or a combination of all) in three dispensers. A retractable magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) Boom is fitted in the tail.

In the late 1990s, the S-3B&#x27;s role was changed from anti-submarine warfare (ASW) to anti-surface warfare (ASuW). As a consequence of this role change, the MAD Boom was removed, along with several hundred pounds of submarine detection electronics. As there was no remaining sonobuoy processing capability, most of the sonobuoy chutes were faired over with a blanking plate.

==Operational history==
On 20 February 1974, the S-3A officially became operational with the Air Antisubmarine Squadron FORTY-ONE (VS-41), the &quot;Shamrocks,&quot; at NAS North Island, California, which served as the initial S-3 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets until a separate Atlantic Fleet FRS, VS-27, was established in the 1980s. The first operational cruise of the S-3A took place in 1975 with the VS-21 &quot;Fighting Redtails&quot; aboard .

Initial operations of the Viking were somewhat troubled in the carrier environment, its sophisticated mission systems were largely dependent on the mission computer, which would often &quot;dump&quot; during the stress of a catapult-assisted take-off, requiring the crew to restart it and reload the software. The U.S. Navy had also purchased an insufficient number of spare parts, which negatively impacted the aircraft&#x27;s mission readiness. Performance improved considerably once an ample supply of spares was provisioned, allowing the S-3 to become a valuable ASW asset as well as a good surface-surveillance platform.

Starting in 1987, the majority of S-3As were progressively upgraded to the improved &quot;S-3B&quot; standard; this involved the addition of several new sensors, avionics, and weapons systems, which included the capability to launch the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile. The S-3B could also be fitted with &quot;buddy stores&quot;, external fuel tanks that allowed the Viking to refuel other aircraft. During July 1988, VS-30 became the first fleet squadron to receive the enhanced capability Harpoon/ISAR equipped S-3B, based at NAS Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida.

Additional, often more specialised variants, were also produced. 16 S-3As were converted to &quot;ES-3A Shadow&quot;s for carrier-based electronic intelligence (ELINT) duties. Six aircraft, designated &quot;US-3A&quot;, were converted for a specialized utility and limited cargo Carrier onboard delivery (COD) requirement. This model played a key role in US military efforts to relieve the Iran hostage crisis of 1979–1981. Plans were also made to develop the &quot;KS-3A&quot; carrier-based tanker aircraft, but this program was ultimately cancelled after the conversion of just one early development S-3A.

As a consequence of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the Warsaw Pact in the early 1990s, the Soviet-Russian submarine threat was perceived as much reduced, and the Vikings had the majority of their antisubmarine warfare equipment removed. The aircraft&#x27;s mission subsequently changed to sea surface search, sea and ground attack, over-the-horizon targeting, and aircraft refueling. As a result, the S-3B after 1997 was typically crewed by a single pilot along with a copilot [NFO]; the additional seats remained in place in the S-3B and could be used by additional crew members for certain missions. To reflect these new missions, the Viking squadrons were redesignated from &quot;Air Antisubmarine Warfare Squadrons&quot; to &quot;Sea Control Squadrons&quot;.
Prior to the aircraft&#x27;s retirement from front-line fleet use aboard US aircraft carriers, a number of upgrade programs were implemented. These include the Carrier Airborne Inertial Navigation System II (CAINS II) upgrade, which replaced older inertial navigation hardware with ring laser gyroscopes with a Honeywell EGI (Enhanced GPS Inertial Navigation System) and added digital electronic flight instruments (EFI). The Maverick Plus System (MPS) added the capability to employ the AGM-65E laser-guided or AGM-65F infrared-guided air-to-surface missile, and the AGM-84H/K Stand-off Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM/ER). The SLAM/ER is a GPS/inertial/infrared guided cruise missile derived from the AGM-84 Harpoon that can be controlled by the aircrew in the terminal phase of flight if an AWW-13 data link pod is carried by the aircraft.

The S-3B saw extensive service during the 1991 Gulf War, performing attack, tanker, and ELINT duties, and launching ADM-141 TALD decoys. One such aircraft, launched from the aircraft carrier , was responsible for the destruction of an Iraqi Silkworm anti-ship missile site, having fired AGM-84 SLAM missiles at it. It was commonly deployed to hunt for Scud missile launcher. The Vikings also identified and targeted numerous Iraqi naval vessels, and even destroyed anti-aircraft gun emplacements and coastal radars. The Gulf War was the first event in which the type had been employed overland in offensive air strike capacity.

The Viking also participated in the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s, and in Operation Enduring Freedom in the 2000s. For the latter, the opening phase of the War in Afghanistan in October 2001, many Vikings were deployed as tankers to continuously undertake refueling sorties to support various fighters stationed aboard U.S. carriers, giving them the necessary endurance to fly to and from the conflict zone.

===Electronic surveillance===
The first ES-3A was delivered during 1991 and entered front-line service after two years of testing. The U.S. Navy established two squadrons, each equipped with eight ES-3As, stationed in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets to provide detachments of typically two aircraft, ten officers, and 55 enlisted aircrew, maintenance and support personnel (which comprised/supported four complete aircrews) to deploying carrier air wings. The Pacific Fleet squadron, Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron FIVE (VQ-5), the &quot;Sea Shadows,&quot; was originally based at the former NAS Agana, Guam but later relocated to NAS North Island in San Diego, California, with the Pacific Fleet S-3 Viking squadrons when NAS Agana closed in 1995 as a result of a 1993 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision. The Atlantic Fleet squadron, the VQ-6 &quot;Black Ravens,&quot; were originally based with all Atlantic Fleet S-3 Vikings at the former NAS Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida, but later moved to NAS Jacksonville, approximately to the east, when NAS Cecil Field was closed in 1999 as a result of the same 1993 BRAC decision that closed NAS Agana.
The ES-3A operated primarily with carrier battle groups, providing organic &#x27;Indications and Warning&#x27; support to the group and joint theater commanders. In addition to their warning and reconnaissance roles, and their extraordinarily stable handling characteristics and range, Shadows were a preferred recovery tanker (aircraft that provide refueling for returning aircraft). They were also deployed to active combat zones, seeing use over Yugoslavia to identify targets, as well as to enforce the no-fly zone over Iraq. The Shadows reportedly averaged over 100 flight hours per month while deployed. Excessive utilization caused earlier than expected equipment replacement when Naval aviation funds were limited, making them an easy target for budget-driven decision makers. The type was also deemed by some officials to be too costly to continue operating. In 1999, both ES-3A squadrons and all 16 aircraft were decommissioned and the ES-3A inventory placed in Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona.

===Iraq War===
The S-3 was an active participant in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the US invasion of Iraq; it largely performed intelligence and reconnaissance missions in support of other coalition assets. On one occasion, in March 2003 a single S-3B Viking from Sea Control Squadron 38 (The &quot;Red Griffins&quot;), piloted by Richard McGrath Jr., from the aircraft carrier successfully executed a time-sensitive strike, firing a laser-guided Maverick missile that neutralized a significant Iraqi naval and leadership target in the port city of Basra, Iraq. This was the first time an S-3 launched a laser-guided Maverick missile in combat. As the conflict progressed, S-3s were regularly used as surveillance aircraft, often to identify improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and the insurgents who planted them.
On 1 May 2003, US President George W. Bush flew in the co-pilot seat of a VS-35 Viking from NAS North Island, California, to the aircraft carrier off the California coast; while the carrier was well within range of helicopters, it is believed that the S-3 was used as a means of setting a desired tone. Aboard the carrier, he delivered his &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; speech announcing the end of major combat in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the flight, the aircraft used the presidential callsign of &quot;Navy One&quot;. The aircraft that President Bush flew in was retired shortly thereafter and on 15 July 2003 was accepted as an exhibit at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida.

Between July and December 2008, the VS-22 Checkmates, the last sea control squadron, operated a detachment of four S-3Bs from the Al Asad Airbase in Al Anbar Province, west of Baghdad. The planes were fitted with LANTIRN pods and they performed non-traditional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. After more than 350 missions, the Checkmates returned to NAS Jacksonville, Florida, on 15 December 2008. The squadron was disestablished on 29 January 2009.

===Final years and retirement===

A proposed airframe known as the Common Support Aircraft was advanced as a successor to the S-3, E-2, and C-2, but this initiative failed to materialize. In 1998, the U.S. Navy awarded a $40 million contract for Lockheed Martin to perform a full-scale Fatigue testing of the existing S-3s; these tests, which commenced in June 2001, were aimed at extending the viable service life of each remaining aircraft, which had originally been certified for a structural life of 13,000 flight-hours. It was hoped that this could be extended to as much as 17,750 hours.

The final carrier-based S-3B squadron, VS-22, was decommissioned at NAS Jacksonville on 29 January 2009. Sea Control Wing Atlantic was decommissioned the following day, along with the last S-3s in frontline fleet service.

In June 2010, the first of three S-3s to patrol the Pacific Missile Test Center&#x27;s range areas off of California was reactivated and delivered. The jet aircraft&#x27;s higher speed, ten-hour endurance, modern radar, and a LANTIRN targeting pod allowed it to quickly confirm the test range being clear of wayward ships and aircraft before tests commence. These S-3Bs are flown by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Thirty (VX-30) based out of NAS Point Mugu, California. By late 2015, the U.S. Navy were operating a total of three Vikings in support roles. One was relocated to The Boneyard in November 2015, while the final two were retired, one being stored and the other transferred to NASA, on 11 January 2016, officially retiring the S-3 from Navy service.

During 2004, NASA acquired four of the withdrawn S-3Bs for use at its Glenn Research Center. In 2009, one of these aircraft (USN BuNo 160607) was given the civil registration &quot;N601NA&quot;, it was involved in numerous tests conducted by the agency. For over a decade, this aircraft was flying almost every day in support for various research programs; one such initiative was the definition of new Federal Aviation Administration communication standards for unmanned aerial vehicles operating in US airspace. However, a lack of spare parts and increasing difficulty supporting the type meant their use could not continue in the long term. The last of the NASA&#x27;s S-3Bs, which were the final working members of the type in existence with any operator at that point, were retired on 13 July 2021.

Naval analysts have suggested that the U.S. Navy return to service an unspecified quantity of the stored S-3s in order to fill gaps that were left in the carrier air wing when it was retired. This move was promoted as a response to the realization that the Chinese navy is producing increasingly capable weapons that can threaten carriers beyond the range their aircraft can strike them. Against the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, carrier-based F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-35C Lightning IIs have about half the unrefueled strike range, so bringing the S-3 back to aerial tanking duties would extend their range against it, as well as free up Super Hornets forced into tanking. Against submarines armed with anti-ship cruise missiles like the Klub and YJ-18, the S-3 would restore area coverage for ASW duties. Bringing the S-3 out of retirement could at least be a stop-gap measure to increase the survivability and capabilities of aircraft carriers until new aircraft can be developed for such purposes.

===Potential revival and proposals===
In October 2013, the Republic of Korea Navy expressed its interest in acquiring up to 18 ex-USN S-3s to augment their fleet of 16 Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft. In August 2015, a military program review group approved a proposal to incorporate 12 mothballed S-3s to perform ASW duties; the Viking plan was sent onto the Defense Acquisition Program Administration for further assessment before final approval decision by the national defense system committee. Although the planes are relatively old, being in storage has supposedly kept them serviceable, and using them is an affordable means of fulfilling short-range airborne ASW capabilities that were vacated by the retirement of the S-2 Tracker. Refurbished S-3s could have been returned to use by 2019. In 2017, the Republic of Korea Navy canceled plans to purchase refurbished and upgraded Lockheed S-3 Viking aircraft for maritime patrol and anti-submarine duties, leaving offers by Airbus, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Saab on the table.

During April 2014, Lockheed Martin announced that they would offer refurbished and remanufactured S-3s, dubbed the &quot;C-3&quot;, as a replacement for the Northrop Grumman C-2A Greyhound for carrier onboard delivery. The requirement for 35 aircraft would be met from the 91 S-3s currently in storage. In February 2015, the Navy announced that the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey had been selected to replace the C-2 for the COD mission. A SV-22 was a proposed anti-submarine warfare variant the U.S. Navy studied in the 1980s to replace S-3 Viking and late model SH-2 Seasprite ASW helicopters.

==Variants==

;S-3A
:First production version, 187 built.
;S-3B
:Upgraded avionics, AN/APS-137 inverse synthetic aperture radar, Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, AGM-84 Harpoon launch capability, first flight 13 September 1984, 119 converted from S-3As.
;ES-3A Shadow
:Designed as a carrier-based, subsonic, all-weather, long-range, electronic reconnaissance (ELINT) aircraft. 16 aircraft were modified to replace the EA-3B Skywarrior, entering fleet service in 1993. The ES-3A carried an extensive suite of electronic sensors and communications gear, replacing the S-3&#x27;s submarine detection, armament, and maritime surveillance equipment with avionics racks accommodating the ES-3A&#x27;s sensors. These modifications had minor impact on airspeed, reducing its top rated speed from but had no noticeable impact on the aircraft&#x27;s range and actually increased its rated loiter time. Because these aircraft were standoff indications and warnings platforms and were never intended to be part of an ingress strike package, this new speed limitation was considered insignificant.
;KS-3A
:Proposed dedicated air tanker with fuel capacity of 4,382 US gal (16,600 L), one converted from YS-3A, later converted to US-3A.
;KS-3B
:Proposed air tanker based on S-3B and utilizing the buddy refueling system, not built.
;US-3A
:S-3A modified for carrier onboard delivery, capacity for six passengers or of cargo, retired in 1998.
;Aladdin Viking
:Conversion of six aircraft for overland surveillance and Elint missions. May have dropped ground sensors in the Bosnian War.
;Beartrap Viking
:S-3Bs fitted with still-classified modifications.
;Calypso Viking
:Proposed anti-smuggling variant, not built.
;Gray Wolf Viking
:One aircraft fitted with AN/APG-76 radar in a modified cargo pod under the wing. Also dubbed SeaSTARS in reference to E-8 Joint STARS.
;Orca Viking
:Avionics testbed.
;Outlaw Viking
:One S-3B fitted with Over-the-horizon Airborne Sensor Information System (OASIS III), returned to regular S-3B in 1998. This particular Viking is now on display at the USS &quot;Midway&quot; Museum, located on the decommissioned .
;NASA Viking
:One aircraft was extensively rebuilt into a state-of-the-art NASA research aircraft. The Navy&#x27;s Fleet Readiness Center Southeast and a Boeing facility in Florida modified it, adding commercial satellite communications, global positioning navigation, and weather radar systems. They also installed research equipment racks in what was once the plane&#x27;s bomb bay. NASA&#x27;s S-3B Viking was equipped to conduct science and aeronautics missions, such as environmental monitoring, satellite communications testing, and aviation safety research.

<text>The Kaman SH-2 Seasprite is a ship-based helicopter originally developed and produced by American manufacturer Kaman Aircraft Corporation. It has been typically used as a compact and fast-moving rotorcraft for utility and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. Early on it was modest sized single-engined naval utility helicopter, and progressed to twin-engine ASW and SAR, and the latest model served well into the 21st century, with G model in active service in the 2020s with Egypt, New Zealand, Peru, and Poland.

The Seasprite, with the internal Kaman designation &quot;K-20&quot;, was developed in the late 1950s in response to a United States Navy (USN) requirement for a suitably fast and compact naval utility helicopter. The USN found the Seasprite attractive, and ordered four prototypes and an initial batch of 12 production helicopters as the &quot;HU2K-1&quot;. Under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, the &quot;HU2K&quot; and &quot;HU2K-1&quot; were re-designated as &quot;H-2&quot; and &quot;UH-2A&quot; respectively. Kaman also pursued foreign sales; after showing interest, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) rejected the Seasprite due to an unexpected price increase and underperformance during sea trials. The USN addressed the poor performance by converting the single-engine Seasprites into a more powerful twin-engine configuration from 1968.

In October 1970, the USN selected the Seasprite as the interim Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter, resulting in the &quot;SH-2D/F&quot; variant with enhanced ASW and anti-surface warfare sensors. Most UH-2s were converted into SH-2Fs.

USN Seasprites were used for ASW, search and rescue (SAR), utility and plane guard for aircraft carriers. In the Vietnam War they were mainly used for combat search and rescue (CSAR), and combat support and surface warfare during the Gulf War. The SH-2G Super Seasprite was the last variant and — in 2001 — the last Seasprite to leave USN service. Retired USN Seasprites were offered as foreign aid in the 1990s and 2000s; this led to quite some interest and F and/or G models served with New Zealand, Poland, and Egypt. Retired models were also sent to aviation museums, and a number have been put on display. However, the latest upgraded models are still in frontline service with several navies around the world.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
In 1956, the USN launched a competition for a compact, all-weather multipurpose naval helicopter, and encouraged submissions from private companies. Kaman responded with its &quot;K-20&quot; design, a relatively conventional helicopter with a General Electric T58-8F turboshaft engine droving a 44-foot four-bladed main rotor and a four-bladed tail rotor. Kaman won the competition and was awarded a contract to construct four prototypes and an initial batch of 12 production helicopters, designated as the &quot;HU2K-1&quot;.

In 1960, the HU2K was the RCN&#x27;s preferred option for its ASW helicopter program, and the Government of Canada approved the purchase of 12 Seasprites for $14.5 million. However, the purchase was disrupted by Kaman suddenly raising the price to $23 million, and concerns that the helicopter&#x27;s designed weight and performance criteria were overoptimistic. The RCN delayed making a decision until after the USN sea trials which confirmed that the HU2K was overweight and underpowered for their needs. In late-1961, Canada selected the competing Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King instead.

In the late-1960s, without further orders Kaman decided to terminate production after completing the USN order of 184 H-2s. However, in 1971, production was restarted for the improved SH-2F to operate from older frigates. This ability meant it stayed in service to the end of the century, as even with the introduction of the newer, larger and overall more capable Sikorsky SH-60 Sea Hawk which entered service starting in the mid-1980s, but it could not operate safety from the smaller flight decks like the smaller Seasprite.

===Further developments===


The HU2K-1 and HU2K-1U were re-designated as the UH-2A and UH-2B respectively under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. The Seasprite continued to receive modifications and improvements, including external stores mounts. Beginning in 1968, the USN&#x27;s remaining UH-2s underwent a major conversion into a more powerful two-engine configuration.

In the 1960s, the US Army commissioned a gunship version, which was called the Kaman H-2 Tomahawk, and featured multiple M-60 machine guns (7.62) and options for rocket launchers, however, it was passed over in favor of the AH-1 Cobra.

In 1968 two UH-2Bs, were converted to NUH-2B. These were experimental versions for the U.S. Army, which attached a J85 turbojet to the helicopter, and achieved speeds over 220s mph, and the second prototype had wings attached. Both prototypes were returned to SH2-D after the trials.

In October 1970, the UH-2 was selected as the interim Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter. LAMPS evolved during the 1960s from an urgent requirement to provide non-aviation ships with manned support and ASW helicopters. The &quot;LAMPS Mark I&quot; suite included advanced sensors, processors, and display capabilities. H-2s upgraded with LAMPS were called SH-2Ds, and became mobile radar and sonar platforms that enhanced the situational awareness of ships.

The SH-2D first flew on 16 March 1971. Deliveries of the SH-2F began in 1973; the SH-2F included LAMPS I and other improvements, such as upgraded engines, an extended life main rotor, and an heavier take-off weight. During 1981, the USN ordered 60 SH-2Fs. From 1987, 16 SH-2Fs were upgraded with a chin-mounted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor, chaff/flare launchers, dual rear-mounted infrared countermeasures, and missile/mine detecting equipment.

All but two USN H-2s were converted into SH-2Fs. Fiscal Year 1986 was the last time SH-2F were ordered; the final six were converted into SH-2G Super Seasprites.

==Operational history==

===United States===


The UH-2 entered operational service with the USN in 1962. The single engine greatly restricted performance. Kaman was ordered to convert all of the Seasprites to a twin-engine configuration. The upgraded helicopters had a airspeed and a operating range. The USN operated nearly 200 Seasprites in multiple roles, including ASW, SAR, and utility transport. Under typical operational conditions, USN aircraft carrier deployed with several UH-2s in the plane guard and SAR roles.

The UH-2 was introduced in time to see action in the Tonkin Gulf incident in August 1964. The Seasprite&#x27;s main role in the Vietnam War was CSAR of downed aircrews at sea and overland, reliance on the Seasprite in this role increased as the conflict intensified, such as during Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965. During October 1966, helicopter-based SAR teams recovered 103 out of 269 downed pilots.

During the 1970s, the conversion of UH-2s to the SH-2 anti-submarine configuration provided the U.S. Navy with its first dedicated ASW helicopter capable of operating from vessels other than its aircraft carriers. The compact size of the SH-2 allowed the type to be operated from flight decks that were too small for the majority of helicopters; this factor would later play a role in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s decision to acquire the improved SH-2F during the early 1980s.

The SH-2F fleet was utilized to enforce and support Operation Earnest Will in July 1987, Operation Praying Mantis in April 1988, and Operation Desert Storm during January 1991 in the Persian Gulf region. The countermeasures and additional equipment present upon the SH-2F allowed the type to conduct combat support and surface warfare missions within these hostile environments, which had an often-minimal submarine threat. In April 1994, the SH-2F was retired from active service with the U.S. Navy; the timing corresponded with the retirement of the last of the Vietnam-era Knox-class frigates that were unable to accommodate the new and larger SH-60 Sea Hawks, which were used to replace the aging Seasprites.

In 1991, the U.S. Navy had begun to receive deliveries of the new SH-2G Super Seasprite; a total of 18 converted SH-2Fs and 6 new-built SH-2Gs were produced. These were assigned to Naval Reserve squadrons, the SH-2G entered service with HSL-84 in 1993. The SH-2 served in some 600 deployments and flew 1.5 million flight hours before the last of the type were finally retired from US Navy service in mid-2001.

===New Zealand===
The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) replaced its Westland Wasps with an initial batch of four interim SH-2F Seasprites (formerly operated by the U.S. Navy), operated and maintained by a mix of Navy and Air Force personnel known as No. 3 Squadron RNZAF Naval Support Flight, to operate with ANZAC class frigates until the fleet of five new SH-2G(NZ) Super Seasprites were delivered. In October 2005, the Navy air element was transferred to No. 6 Squadron RNZAF at RNZAF Base Auckland in Whenuapai. RNZN Seasprites have seen service in East Timor. 10 of the 11 SH-2G(A)s rejected by the Royal Australian Navy were purchased in 2014 to replace the five RNZN SH-2G(NZ) Seasprites that had required either a MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) or replacement due to corrosion issues, maintenance problems and obsolescence. Kaman modified the ex-Australian aircraft and renamed them SH-2G(I), with the last one being delivered to New Zealand in early 2016. Eight of the aircraft are flying with the ninth and tenth aircraft being attritional aircraft used for spares etc. The 11th aircraft is held by Kaman as a prototype and test aircraft. The five SH-2G(NZ) have been sold to Peru. A SH-2F (ex-RNZN, NZ3442) is preserved in the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum, donated to the museum by Kaman Aircraft Corporation after an accident while in service with the RNZN.

RNAF uses the FN Mag 58 machine gun firing 7.62 mm, and it was fielded by 2008.

===Exports===
During the late 1990s, the United States decided to offer the surplus U.S. Navy SH-2Fs as foreign aid to a number of overseas countries. Among those to be offered the type included Greece, which had been offered six, and Turkey, which had been offered 14, but they rejected the offer.

Egypt opted to acquire four SH-2F under this aid program, they were mainly used for spares in to support of their existing fleet of ten SH-2Gs. In the early 2000s, Australia acquired the SH-2G model, with ten delivered by 2007, 11 had been ordered in the late 1990s, but they only served from 2003 to 2008; the RAN consolidated on using the SH-60 Seahawk and was launching the MRH-90 Taipan program at the time. Poland chose to acquire the later SH-2G variant. Peru acquired Ex-RNZAF SH-2Gs and they entered service in the late 2010s.

<text>In phonetics, a plosive, also known as an [[occlusive]] or simply a stop, is a pulmonic consonant in which the vocal tract is blocked so that all airflow ceases.

The occlusion may be made with the tongue tip or blade (, ), tongue body (, ), lips (, ), or glottis (). Plosives contrast with nasals, where the vocal tract is blocked but airflow continues through the nose, as in and , and with fricatives, where partial occlusion impedes but does not block airflow in the vocal tract.

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;stop, occlusive,&quot; and &quot;plosive&quot; are often used interchangeably. Linguists who distinguish them may not agree on the distinction being made. The terms refer to different features of the consonant. &quot;Stop&quot; refers to the airflow that is stopped. &quot;Occlusive&quot; refers to the articulation, which occludes (blocks) the vocal tract. &quot;Plosive&quot; refers to the release burst (plosion) of the consonant. Some object to the use of &quot;plosive&quot; for inaudibly released stops, which may then instead be called &quot;applosives&quot;. The International Phonetic Association and the International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association use the term &quot;plosive&quot;.

Either &quot;occlusive&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; may be used as a general term covering the other together with nasals. That is, &#x27;occlusive&#x27; may be defined as oral occlusive (plosives and affricates) plus nasal occlusives (nasals such as , ), or &#x27;stop&#x27; may be defined as oral stops (plosives) plus nasal stops (nasals). Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996) prefer to restrict &#x27;stop&#x27; to oral non-affricated occlusives. They say,

In addition, they restrict &quot;plosive&quot; for pulmonic consonants; &quot;stops&quot; in their usage include ejective and implosive consonants.

If a term such as &quot;plosive&quot; is used for oral non-affricated obstruents, and nasals are not called nasal stops, then a &quot;stop&quot; may mean the glottal stop; &quot;plosive&quot; may even mean non-glottal stop. In other cases, however, it may be the word &quot;plosive&quot; that is restricted to the glottal stop. Generally speaking, plosives do not have plosion (a release burst). In English, for example, there are plosives with no audible release, such as the in &quot;apt&quot;. However, English plosives do have plosion in other environments.

In Ancient Greek, the term for plosive was (&quot;áphōnon&quot;), which means &quot;unpronounceable&quot;, &quot;voiceless&quot;, or &quot;silent&quot;, because plosives could not be pronounced without a vowel. This term was calqued into Latin as , and from there borrowed into English as &quot;mute&quot;. &quot;Mute&quot; was sometimes used instead for voiceless consonants, whether plosives or fricatives, a usage that was later replaced with &quot;surd&quot;, from Latin &quot;deaf&quot; or &quot;silent&quot;, a term still occasionally seen in the literature. For more information on the Ancient Greek terms, see .

==Articulation==
A plosive is typically analysed as having up to three phases:
*Approach, during which articulators come together
*Hold (or &quot;occlusion&quot; or &quot;closure&quot;), during which the articulators are held and block the airstream
*Release (or &quot;burst&quot; or &quot;plosion&quot;), when the articulators are separated, releasing the compressed air

Only the hold phase is requisite. A plosive may lack an approach when it is preceded by a consonant that involves an occlusion at the same place of articulation, as in in &quot;end&quot; or &quot;old&quot;. In many languages, such as Malay and Vietnamese, word-final plosives lack a release burst, even when followed by a vowel, or have a nasal release. See no audible release.

In affricates, the catch and hold are those of a plosive, but the release is that of a fricative. That is, affricates are plosive–fricative contours.

==Common plosives==
All spoken natural languages in the world have plosives, and most have at least the voiceless plosives , , and . However, there are exceptions: Colloquial Samoan lacks the coronal , and several North American languages, such as the Iroquoian languages (e.g., Mohawk and Cherokee), and Arabic lack the labial . In fact, the labial is the least stable of the voiceless plosives in the languages of the world, as the unconditioned sound change → (→ → ) is quite common in unrelated languages, having occurred in the history of Classical Japanese, Classical Arabic, and Proto-Celtic, for instance. Formal Samoan has only one word with velar ; colloquial Samoan conflates and to . Ni‘ihau Hawaiian has for to a greater extent than Standard Hawaiian, but neither distinguish a from a . It may be more accurate to say that Hawaiian and colloquial Samoan do not distinguish velar and coronal plosives than to say they lack one or the other. 

Ontena Gadsup has only 1 phonemic plosive . Yanyuwa distinguishes plosives in 7 places of articulations (it does not have voiceless plosives) which is the most out of all languages.

See Common occlusives for the distribution of both plosives and nasals.

==Classification==
===Voice===
Voiced plosives are pronounced with vibration of the vocal cords, voiceless plosives without. Plosives are commonly voiceless, and many languages, such as Mandarin Chinese and Hawaiian, have only voiceless plosives. Others, such as most Australian languages, are indeterminate: plosives may vary between voiced and voiceless without distinction, some of them like Yanyuwa and Yidiny have only voiced plosives.

===Aspiration===
In aspirated plosives, the vocal cords (vocal folds) are abducted at the time of release. In a prevocalic aspirated plosive (a plosive followed by a vowel or sonorant), the time when the vocal cords begin to vibrate will be delayed until the vocal folds come together enough for voicing to begin, and will usually start with breathy voicing. The duration between the release of the plosive and the voice onset is called the &quot;voice onset time&quot; (VOT) or the &quot;aspiration interval&quot;. Highly aspirated plosives have a long period of aspiration, so that there is a long period of voiceless airflow (a phonetic ) before the onset of the vowel. In tenuis plosives, the vocal cords come together for voicing immediately following the release, and there is little or no aspiration (a voice onset time close to zero). In English, there may be a brief segment of breathy voice that identifies the plosive as voiceless and not voiced. In voiced plosives, the vocal folds are set for voice before the release, and often vibrate during the entire hold, and in English, the voicing after release is not breathy. A plosive is called &quot;fully voiced&quot; if it is voiced during the entire occlusion. In English, however, initial voiced plosives like or may have no voicing during the period of occlusion, or the voicing may start shortly before the release and continue after release, and word-final plosives tend to be fully devoiced: In most dialects of English, the final /b/, /d/ and /g/ in words like &quot;rib&quot;, &quot;mad&quot; and &quot;dog&quot; are fully devoiced. Initial voiceless plosives, like the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pie&quot;, are aspirated, with a palpable puff of air upon release, whereas a plosive after an &quot;s&quot;, as in &quot;spy&quot;, is tenuis (unaspirated). When spoken near a candle flame, the flame will flicker more after the words &quot;par, tar,&quot; and &quot;car&quot; are articulated, compared with &quot;spar, star,&quot; and &quot;scar&quot;. In the common pronunciation of &quot;papa&quot;, the initial &quot;p&quot; is aspirated whereas the medial &quot;p&quot; is not.

===Length===
In a geminate or long consonant, the occlusion lasts longer than in simple consonants. In languages where plosives are only distinguished by length (e.g., Arabic, Ilwana, Icelandic), the long plosives may be held up to three times as long as the short plosives. Italian is well known for its geminate plosives, as the double &quot;t&quot; in the name &quot;Vittoria&quot; takes just as long to say as the &quot;ct&quot; does in English &quot;Victoria&quot;. Japanese also prominently features geminate consonants, such as in the minimal pair 来た &quot;kita&quot; &#x27;came&#x27; and 切った &quot;kitta&quot; &#x27;cut&#x27;. Estonian is unusual for contrasting three lengths, as in the minimal triplet &quot;kabi&quot; &#x27;hoof&#x27;, &quot;kapi&quot; &#x27;wardrobe [gen. sg.]&#x27;, and &quot;kappi&quot; &#x27;wardrobe [ill. sg.]&#x27;.

There are many languages where the features voice, aspiration, and length reinforce each other, and in such cases it may be hard to determine which of these features predominates. In such cases, the terms fortis is sometimes used for aspiration or gemination, whereas lenis is used for single, tenuous, or voiced plosives. However, the terms &quot;fortis&quot; and &quot;lenis&quot; are poorly defined, and their meanings vary from source to source.

===Nasalization===

Simple nasals are differentiated from plosives only by a lowered velum that allows the air to escape through the nose during the occlusion. Nasals are acoustically sonorants, as they have a non-turbulent airflow and are nearly always voiced, but they are articulatorily obstruents, as there is complete blockage of the oral cavity. The term occlusive may be used as a cover term for both nasals and plosives.

A prenasalized stop starts out with a lowered velum that raises during the occlusion. The closest examples in English are consonant clusters such as the [nd] in &quot;candy&quot;, but many languages have prenasalized stops that function phonologically as single consonants. Swahili is well known for having words beginning with prenasalized stops, as in &quot;ndege&quot; &#x27;bird&#x27;, and in many languages of the South Pacific, such as Fijian, these are even spelled with single letters: &quot;b&quot; [mb], &quot;d&quot; [nd].

A postnasalized plosive begins with a raised velum that lowers during the occlusion. This causes an audible nasal &quot;release&quot;, as in English &quot;sudden&quot;. This could also be compared to the /dn/ cluster found in Russian and other Slavic languages, which can be seen in the name of the Dnieper River.

The terms &quot;prenasalization&quot; and &quot;postnasalization&quot; are normally used only in languages where these sounds are phonemic: that is, not analyzed into sequences of plosive plus nasal.

===Airstream mechanism===
Stops may be made with more than one airstream mechanism. The normal mechanism is pulmonic egressive, that is, with air flowing outward from the lungs. All spoken languages have pulmonic stops. Some languages have stops made with other mechanisms as well: ejective stops (glottalic egressive), implosive stops (glottalic ingressive), or click consonants (lingual ingressive).

===Tenseness===

A fortis plosive is produced with more muscular tension than a lenis plosive. However, this is difficult to measure, and there is usually debate over the actual mechanism of alleged fortis or lenis consonants.

There are a series of plosives in the Korean language, sometimes written with the IPA symbol for ejectives, which are produced using &quot;stiff voice&quot;, meaning there is increased contraction of the glottis than for normal production of voiceless plosives. The indirect evidence for stiff voice is in the following vowels, which have a higher fundamental frequency than those following other plosives. The higher frequency is explained as a result of the glottis being tense. Other such phonation types include breathy voice, or murmur; slack voice; and creaky voice.

==Transcription==
The following plosives have been given dedicated symbols in the IPA.

===Variations===
Many subclassifications of plosives are transcribed by adding a diacritic or modifier letter to the IPA symbols above.

<doc id="29482" wikidata="Q2178626" url="?curid=29482" title="Stayman convention">
<text>Stayman is a bidding convention in the card game contract bridge. It is used by a partnership to find a 4-4 or 5-3 trump fit in a suit after making a one (1NT) opening bid and it has been adapted for use after a 2NT opening, a 1NT overcall, and many other natural notrump bids.

The convention is named for Sam Stayman, who wrote the first published description in 1945, but its inventors were two other players: the British expert Jack Marx in 1939, who published it only in 1946, and Stayman&#x27;s regular partner George Rapée in 1944.

==Rationale==
A bid and made in a major suit (i.e. 4 or 4 ) scores better than a game contract bid and made in a minor suit (i.e. 5 or 5 ) or in notrump (i.e. 3NT). Also, the success rate for a game contract in a major suit when a partnership has a combined holding of 26 points and eight cards in the major is about 80%, whereas a game contract in 3NT with 26 (HCP) has a success rate of only 60%, or 50% with 25 HCP; the success rate for a minor suit game contract when holding 26 points is about 30%.

Accordingly, partnership priority is to find an eight card or better major suit fit when jointly holding sufficient values for a game contract. 5-3 and 6-2 fits are easy to find in basic methods as responder can bid 3 or 3 over 1NT, and opener will not normally have a 5 card major to bid 1NT. However, finding 4-4 fits presents a problem. The 2 and 2 bids cannot be used for this as they are weak takeouts, a sign-off bid.

==Standard Stayman==
After an opening bid or an overcall of 1NT (2NT), or bids an artificial 2 (3) to ask opener or overcaller if he holds a four- or five-card major suit; some partnership agreements may require the major to be headed by an honor of at least a specified rank, such as the queen. The artificial club bid typically promises four cards in at least one of the major suits (promissory Stayman) and, &quot;in standard form&quot;, enough strength to continue bidding after partner&#x27;s response (8 HCP for an invitational bid opposite a standard strong 1NT opening or overcall showing 15-17 HCP, 11 HCP opposite a weak notrump of 12-14 HCP, or 5 HCP to go to game opposite a standard 2NT showing 20-21 points). It also promises distribution that is not 4333. By invoking the Stayman convention, the responder takes control of the bidding since strength and distribution of the opener&#x27;s hand is already known within a limited range. The opener responds with the following rebids.
* 2 (3) denies four or more cards in either major suit.
* 2 (3) shows at least four hearts (also meeting the criteria for an honor holding as may be set by partnership agreement).
* 2 (3) shows at least four spades (also meeting the criteria for an honor holding as may be set by partnership agreement).
A notrump opener should have neither a suit longer than five cards nor more than one 5-card suit since an opening notrump bid shows a balanced hand. A notrump bidder who has at least four cards in each major suit normally responds in hearts, as this can still allow a spade fit to be found. Variant methods are to bid the longer or stronger major, with a preference given to spades, or to use 2NT to show both majors.

In the standard form of Stayman over 1NT, the responder has a number of options depending on his partner&#x27;s answer:
* If the notrump opener names a major suit and the responder has four cards in that suit, the responder bids three of the notrump bidder&#x27;s suit (invitational) with 8-9 HCP or four of the notrump bidder&#x27;s major suit (game) with 10 or more HCP.
* If the notrump bidder bids a major suit in which the responder does not have at least four cards, the responder may bid 2NT (invitational) with 8-9 HCP or 3NT (game) with 10 or more HCP. However, if responder has 5 cards in the unnamed major, he may bid it at a convenient level in an attempt to find a 5-3 fit.
* If the notrump bidder bids 2, the opener denies a four-card major. With 4-5 distribution in the majors, the responder may bid this five-card suit with a call of 2 with 8-9 HCP, or with a call of 3 with 10 HCP. This allows notrump bidder to find game in a major with a 5-3 split. Without a 4-5 distribution in the majors, responder bids the appropriate notrump contract. 
Over these bids, the notrump bidder (1) with a maximum hand (17 HCP), goes to game over an invitational bid and (2) with four (or more) cards in each major suit, corrects to the previously unbid major suit.

In the standard form of Stayman over 2NT, the responder has only two normal rebids.
* If the notrump bidder names a major suit and the responder has four cards in that suit, the responder bids four of the notrump bidder&#x27;s suit (game).
* If the notrump bidder names a major suit in which the responder does not have at least four cards or bids diamonds to deny a major suit, the responder bids 3NT (game). If the notrump bidder has four cards in each major suit, the notrump bidder corrects to the previously unbid major suit.

In either case, a responder who rebids notrump over a response in a major suit promises four cards of the other major suit. Thus, a notrump opener who holds at least four cards in each major suit should &quot;correct&quot; by bidding the other major suit at the lowest level.

Of course, once a fit is found, responder who has sufficient strength also may bid 4 (Gerber) or 4NT (Blackwood), or cue bid aces, depending upon partnership agreement, to explore slam in any of the above sequences. Some partnerships also admit responder&#x27;s rebids of a major suit that the notrump bidder did not name.

A bid of 4 over an opening bid of 3NT may be either Stayman or Gerber, depending upon the partnership agreement.

If an adverse suit bid is inserted immediately after a 1NT opening, Stayman may be employed via a double (by partnership agreement) or a cue bid, depending on the strength of his hand. The cue bid, which is conventional, is completely artificial and means nothing other than invoking Stayman. For example, if South opens 1NT, and West overcalls 2, North, if he has adequate values, may call 3, invoking Stayman. South would then show his major or bid game in notrump. Alternatively, North, if his hand lacks the values for game in notrump, may double, which by partnership agreement employs Stayman. This keeps the Stayman bidding at second level.

Partnerships who have not yet learned Stayman but choose to adopt Stayman (without having yet learned or having chosen not to use Jacoby Transfers) will need to adjust their use of normal two-level responses after a 1NT opening, because the availability of this convention changes the nature of what had been normal 1NT responses. When the notrump bidder&#x27;s partner does not invoke Stayman but instead calls 2 or 2, it is a sign of relative weakness (since if responder held 8 HCP or more, he would have invoked Stayman). These bids are commonly referred to as &quot;drop dead bids&quot;, as the opening notrump bidder is requested to withdraw from the auction. If opener has maximum values, a fit, and strong support, he may raise to the 3-level, but under no circumstances may he take any other action. This provides the partnership with an advantage that the non-Stayman partnership doesn&#x27;t enjoy. For example, a responder may have no honors at all; that is, a total of zero HCP. His partner is likely to be set if he passes. A non-Stayman responder would have to pass, because to bid would provoke a rebid. But a Stayman responder can respond to his partner&#x27;s 1NT opening at level 2 if he has a 6-card non-club suit. The responder with 3 HCP and a singleton can make a similar call with a 5-card non-club suit. This gives the partnership a better than even chance of success in making the contract, whereas without a response (and without Stayman), the contract would likely be set.

Similarly, a response of 2 indicates less than 8 HCP and should usually be passed. In rare cases, when the opener has maximum values and a fit in diamonds with at least two of the top three honors, he may raise diamonds, and responder may see a chance for game in notrump.

There are many variations on this basic theme, and partnership agreement may alter the details of its use. It is one of the most widely used conventions in bridge.

===Non-promissory Stayman and 2 checkback by responder===

Some partnerships play that 2 Stayman does not absolutely promise a four-card major (non promissory Stayman). For example, if responder has a short suit and wishes to know if opener has four-card cover in it, so as to play in no-trumps. If opener shows hearts initially, 2 can be used to find a fit in spades when the 2 does not promise a four-card major.

1NT - 2, 2 -
*2 = four spades, not four hearts, invitational
*2NT = no four spades, invitational
*3NT = four spades and game values
Alternatively 2 can be used for all hands with four spades and not four hearts, either invitational or game values, while 3NT denies four spades.

==Using Jacoby transfers with Stayman==
Today, most players use Stayman in conjunction with Jacoby transfers. With Stayman in effect, the responder practically denies having a five-card major, as otherwise he would transfer to the major immediately. The only exception is when responder has 5-4 in the majors; in that case, he could use Stayman, and in the case of a 2 response, bid the five-card major at the two level (weakness take-out / Garbage Stayman) or at the three level (forcing to game). However, the latter hand can also be bid by first using a transfer and then showing the second suit naturally. The Smolen convention provides an alternative method to show a five-card major and game-going values. A minor drawback of Jacoby transfers is that a 2 contract is not possible.

==Smolen convention==
The Smolen convention is an adjunct to Stayman for situations in which the notrump opener has denied holding a four-card major and responder has a five-card major and a four-card major with game-going values.

If the notrump opener responds to the Stayman 2 asking bid with 2, denying a four-card major, responder initiates the Smolen Transfer with a jump shift to three of his four-card major. The jump shift shows which is the four-card major and promises five in the other major. The notrump opener then bids four of the other major with three cards in the suit or 3NT with fewer than three.

Smolen may also be used when responder has a six-card major and a four-card major with game-going values; after the 2 negative response by opener, responder double jump shifts to four in the suit just below his six-card major and the notrump opener transfers to four of his partner&#x27;s six-card major.

This convention allows a partnership to find either a 5-3 fit, 6-3 and 6-2 fit while ensuring that the notrump opener, who has the stronger hand, will be declarer.

==Garbage Stayman and crawling Stayman==
&quot;Garbage&quot; Stayman (or &quot;Weak Stayman&quot; or &quot;Rescue Stayman&quot;) and &quot;Crawling&quot; Stayman are adaptations of Stayman frequently used for damage control when holding a weak hand opposite a 1NT opening bid. For example, on the following hand.

Partner opens 1NT (15-17), and right hand opponent passes. Opponents have 23-25 HCP. Thus, 1NT is virtually certain to go down by at least three or four tricks. Indeed, in No-trumps, this dummy will be completely worthless.

In &quot;Garbage Stayman&quot;, you bid 2 Stayman with this &quot;garbage&quot; hand rather than passing on the first round, and then &quot;pass opener&#x27;s response&quot;. If opener rebids a major suit you have found a 4-4 fit and ability to trump club losers. Likewise, a response of 2 guarantees no worse than a 5-2 fit in diamonds and, with a fifth trump, a potential additional ruff. Declarer can also reach dummy with ruffs and may then be able to take finesses or execute a squeeze that otherwise would not be possible. The result is a contract that will go down fewer tricks or may even make, rather than a contract that is virtually certain to go down at least three or four tricks. However the hand must be able to tolerate any rebid from opener.

&quot;Crawling Stayman&quot; is an optional extension of &quot;Garbage Stayman&quot; for situations in which the responder&#x27;s diamond suit is short. In &quot;Crawling Stayman&quot;, the responder rebids 2 over the Notrump bidder&#x27;s 2 reply. This conventional bid shows a weak hand with at least four cards in each major suit, asking the Notrump bidder to choose between the major suits at the cheapest level by either passing the 2 bid or correcting to 2. The name &quot;Crawling Stayman&quot; comes from the fact that the bidding &quot;crawls&quot; at the slowest possible pace: (pass) – 1NT – (pass) – 2; (pass) – 2 – (pass) – 2; (pass) – 2; (pass) – pass – (pass).

Alternatively, responder&#x27;s 2 and 2 bids after the 2 rebid can be weak sign-offs. This allows responder to effectively bid hands which are 5-4 in the majors, by looking first for a 4-4 fit and, if none is found, signing off in his 5 card suit.

&quot;Garbage Stayman&quot; is even more useful opposite a weak NT opening (12-14) as it occurs more frequently and can mitigate very expensive penalties if responder is weak. It is in frequent use in Acol.

&quot;Garbage Stayman&quot; and &quot;Crawling Stayman&quot; bids over a 2NT bid work the same way, but occur at the &quot;three&quot; level.

Disadvantage is that it tells the opponents the opener’s distribution.

Don’t apply 2NT as showing both majors. Instead use 2.

==Forcing and non-forcing Stayman==
If Jacoby transfers are not played, there are two approaches to resolve the situation when responder has a 5-card major but only invitational values. In one, more common, referred to as &quot;non-forcing Stayman&quot;, in the sequence:
:1NT – 2; 2 – 2
responder&#x27;s simple rebid of a major suit is invitational, showing 8-9 points and a 5-card spade suit. In the &quot;forcing Stayman&quot; variant, the bid is one-round forcing.

In the original Precision Club system, forcing and non-forcing Stayman are differentiated in the start: 2 by responder shows only invitational values (and the continuation is the same as in basic Stayman), while 2 is forcing to game (responder bids 2NT without majors).

==Non promissory game forcing Stayman==

This allows responder to find exact shape of 1NT opener. Developed for use with weak 1 NT opening. Relay bids over opener&#x27;s rebids of 2, 2, 2, 2NT, 3 allow shape to be defined further if attempting to find 5-3 major fits. Advantages are responder&#x27;s shape, which may be any distribution, is undisclosed, and responder is able to locate suit shortage holdings not suitable for no trumps.

1NT – 2♣
* 2 5,3,3,2 shape with 5 diamonds
* 2 4,4,3,2 shape with 4 hearts
* 2 4,4,3,2 shape with 4 spades (denies 4 hearts)
* 2NT 4,4,3,2 shape with both 4 card minors
* 3♣ 5,3,3,2 shape with 5 clubs
* 3 4,3,3,3 shape with 4 diamonds
* 3 4,3,3,3 shape with 4 hearts
* 3 4,3,3,3 shape with 4 spades
* 3NT 4,3,3,3 shape with 4 clubs

Developed to be used in combination with following other responses to 1NT: 2, 2 Jacoby transfers to majors; 2 range finder/transfer to minors (opener&#x27;s rebids: 2NT 12-13 HCP, 3 14 HCP. Responder passes or corrects to 3 or 3 sign off if weak. After opener&#x27;s 3 rebid responder bids 3 to show 4 hearts or 3 to show 4 spades both game forcing. Responder&#x27;s rebid of 3NT denies 4 card major); 2NT invitational hand with both 4 card majors (opener&#x27;s rebids: no bid no 4 card major 12-13 HCP, 3 4 hearts 12-13 HCP, 3 4 spades 12-13 HCP, 3 4 hearts 14 HCP, 3 4 spades 14 HCP, 3NT 14 HCP no 4 card major).

Disadvantage is that it tells the opponents the opener’s distribution.

==Four card major non promissory relay Stayman==

This allows responder to find exact shape of 1NT opener that may only contain a four-card major. Developed for use with weak 1 NT opening. Relay bids over opener&#x27;s rebids of 2, 2, 2 allow shape to be defined further if attempting to find 5-3 major fits. Advantages are responder&#x27;s shape, which may be any distribution, is undisclosed, and responder is able to locate suit shortage holdings not suitable for notrumps. May be also used as a damage control bid, and for both invitational, and game forcing hands.

1NT – 2♣
* 2 All 5,3,3,2, 4,4,3,2, and 4,3,3,3 shapes without a four-card major.
** 2 game force relay (opener&#x27;s rebid 2 4,4,3,2 shape, 2NT 5,3,3,2 shape with five diamonds, 3 5,3,3,2 shape with five clubs, 3 4,3,3,3 shape with four diamonds 3 4,3,3,3 shape with four clubs). Further relays used over 2, 2NT and 3 if attempting to find 5-3 major fits.
** 2 weak sign off bid with five or more spades, four hearts.
** 2NT invitational
* 2 4,4,3,2 or 4,3,3,3 shape with four hearts
** 2 game force relay (opener&#x27;s rebid 2NT 4,3,3,3 shape, 3 4,4,3,2 shape with four clubs, 3 4,4,3,2 shape with four diamonds 3 4,4,3,2 shape with four spades). Further relays used over 3 and 3 to find 5-3 major fits.
** 2NT invitational.
** 3 weak sign off.
** raise to 3 invitational.
* 2 4,4,3,2 or 4,3,3,3 shape with four spades (denies four hearts).
** 2NT invitational.
** 3 game force relay (opener&#x27;s rebid 3 4,4,3,2 shape with four diamonds, 3 4,4,3,2 shape with four clubs, 3 4,3,3,3 shape). Further relays used over 3 and 3 to find 5-3 major fits.
** raise to 3 invitational.
** 3 weak sign off

1NT – 3♣ weak sign off.

Opener&#x27;s rebids of 2, 2, 2 may all be passed if responder is weak.

Developed to be used in combination with following other responses to 1NT: 2, 2 Jacoby transfers to majors; 2 five spades four hearts 10-11 HCP; 2NT invitational hand with 5,5 minors 10-11 HCP.

==Five card major non promissory relay Stayman==

This allows responder to find exact shape of 1NT opener that may contain a 5 card major. Developed for use with weak 1NT opening. Relay bids over opener&#x27;s rebids of 2D, 2H, 2S allow shape to be defined further if attempting to find 5-3 major fits. Advantages are responder&#x27;s shape, which may be any distribution, is undisclosed, and responder is able to locate suit shortage holdings not suitable for no trumps. May be also used as a damage control bid, and for both invitational, and game forcing hands.

1NT – 2C
* 2D All 5,3,3,2, 4,4,3,2, and 4,3,3,3 shapes without 4 or 5 card major.
** 2H game force relay (opener&#x27;s rebid: 2S 4,4,3,2 or 4,3,3,3 shape, 2NT 5,3,3,2 shape with 5 diamonds, 3C 5,3,3,2 shape with 5 clubs). Further relays used over 2S, 2NT and 3C if attempting to find 5-3 major fits. After 2NT relay over 2S rebid: 3C 4C,3,3,3 shape, 3D 4D,3,3,3 shape, 3H 4,4,3H,2 shape, 3S 4,4,3S,2 shape.
** 2S weak sign off bid 5+ spades, 4 hearts.

* 2H 4,4,3,2 or 4,3,3,3, or 5,3,3,2 shape with 4 or 5 hearts
** 2S game force relay (opener&#x27;s rebid: 2NT 4H,3,3,3 shape, 3C 4H,4C,3,2 shape, 3D 4H,4D,3,2 shape, 3H 5H332 shape, 3S 4H,4S,3,2 shape min HCP, 3NT 4H,4S,3,2 shape max HCP). Further relays used over 3C , 3D, and 3H to find 5-3 major fits.
** 2NT invitational (opener&#x27;s rebid maximum: 3C 4H,4C,3,2 shape, 3D 4H,4D,3,2 shape, 3H 5H,3,3,2 shape, 3S 4H,4S,3,2 shape, 3NT 4H,3,3,3 shape)

** raise to 3S invitational.

Opener&#x27;s rebids of 2D, 2H, 2S may all be passed if responder is weak.

Developed to be used in combination with following other responses to 1NT: 2D, 2H Jacoby transfers to majors; 2S range finder/transfer C; 2NT invitational hand with 5,5 minors 10-11 HCP.

==Five-card major Stayman==
This allows responder to check for 5-3 major fits where it is possible that opener&#x27;s 1NT or 2NT might include a five-card major. As described by Australian Ron Klinger, it can be played with a weak or strong 1NT.

1NT - 2
*2 = minimum, no 5M
*2M = minimum, 5M
*2NT = Maximum, no 5M
*3M = Maximum, 5M

1NT - 2; 2/2NT
*3 = Stayman
*3 = --&gt; 
*3 = --&gt; 
*3 = ?
*3NT = to play

After a transfer, accept it with any 4333, bid 3NT with only two trumps, otherwise bid 4M.

1NT - 2; 2/2NT - 3 = Stayman
*3 = 4M333
*3 = 4, not 4333
*3 = 4, not 4333, not 4
*3NT = no 4M

1NT - 2; 2/2NT - 3, 3
*3 = 4, not 4
*3 = 4, not 4
*3NT = to play
*4 = bid your 4 card Major

An alternative, simpler version of five-card Stayman is:

1NT - 2
*2 = No 5CM
*2M = 5CM

This structure permits use by weak hands with 5+ diamonds and 2+ cards in each major.

After 1NT - 2; 2
*2M = 4M invitational
*2NT = invitational, no major
*3M = 4M game-forcing

If responder has a five-card major, he begins with a transfer. After completion of the transfer, bidding the other major at the three level shows four cards in it and a game forcing hand, in line with the 1NT - 2, 2 structure above (1NT - 2, 2 - 2 = invitational 5-4).

Similarly after 2NT - 3; 3
*3M = 4M 
*3NT = no major

A drawback of Five-Card Major Stayman (particularly the simpler version) is that the weaker hand may become declarer in a 4-4 major fit.

==Puppet Stayman==
Puppet Stayman is similar to Five-Card Stayman. It is more complex but has the major advantage that the strong hand virtually always becomes declarer.

Initially developed by Neil Silverman and refined by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson in 1977-78, is a variation of the Stayman convention designed to find a 5-3 fit in a major, augmenting the search for a 4-4 major fit by standard Stayman. In 1977, Woolsey wrote that Puppet Stayman has several advantages over standard Stayman:
* Opener is usually better placed than responder to choose the proper denomination given distributional information about his partner&#x27;s hand
* Opener becomes declarer in most cases without revealing his distribution, it being deemed less injurious to reveal responder&#x27;s distribution, usually the weaker of the two hands
* The side can stop in two diamonds
* Since opener can show a five-card major immediately in response to the 2C bid, it is less dangerous to open 1NT with a five-card major
* It is possible to stop at two spades with a 4-4 fit, e.g. 1NT - 2, 2 - 2, 2 - All Pass
* Opener may be able to perceive a weakness for a notrump contract and so save to three of a minor or a good 4-3 major-suit game instead
* It is possible that a 3NT contract may be preferred over a 4-4 major fit in certain auctions

===Responder&#x27;s rebids===
As in standard Stayman, Puppet Stayman begins with a 2 response to a 1NT opening and is at least game invitational; this asks opener to bid a 5-card major if he has one and otherwise to bid 2. Over a 2 response, rebids by responder are intended to disclose his distributional features in the majors as well as his strength. The original 1977 and 1978 revised rebids described by Woolsey are tabulated below: 
Opener and responder continue the bidding having a clearer understanding of each other&#x27;s distributional features and are better positioned to select the ultimate and level of the contract.

===Modern applications===
Many variations to the Puppet Stayman bidding structure have been devised since Woolsey&#x27;s 1978 summary; partnership review and agreement on the preferred modern treatment is required.

Some no longer advocate use of Puppet Stayman over a 1NT opening preferring to use the concept exclusively over a 2NT opening and reserving other Stayman variations and conventions such Jacoby Transfers and Smolen Transfers in search of major-suit fits after a 1NT opening.

===Responses to a 2NT opening or rebid===
Puppet Stayman is more commonly used after a 2NT opening than after a 1NT opening. Responses to a 2NT opening or very strong 2NT rebid (20-22 or 23-24):
* 3 = Puppet Stayman
* 3 = --&gt; hearts
* 3 = --&gt; spades
* 3 = --&gt; 5 spades and 4 hearts
* 3NT = no 3+ major, to play

Responder bids 3 seeking information about opener&#x27;s major suit holding. Opener replies:
* 3NT denying a 4 or 5-card major
* 3 showing a 5-card heart suit
* 3 showing a 5-card spade suit
* 3 holding a 4-card major and denying a 5-card major; following this responder bids:
** 3 showing a 4-card spade suit and denying a 4-card heart suit
** 3 showing a 4-card heart suit and denying a 4-card spade suit
** 3NT denying a 4-card major, to play
** 4 showing 4 spades and 4 hearts, slam try
*** 4 RKCB in hearts
*** 4 to play
*** 4 to play
*** 4NT RKCB in spades
** 4 showing 4 spades and 4 hearts, you choose
** 4NT denying a 4-card major, invitational to 6NT

By this means all 5-3 and 4-4 major suit fits can be found.

An alternative pattern frees up the 2NT-3 sequence as a slam try in the minors. To allow 3-5 spade fits to be found when responder holds 5 spades and 4 hearts, some of the responses change:
* After 2NT-3, opener&#x27;s 3 denies a 5-card major but promises 4 hearts or 3 or 4 spades. Following this, responder bids:
** 3 showing a 4-card spade suit, possibly including a 4-card heart suit, or 5 spades and 4 hearts. Opener&#x27;s rebids:
*** 3 = showing 3 spades and denying 4 hearts, responder now bids 4 with 5 spades and 4 hearts, or 3NT otherwise
*** 3NT = showing 4 hearts and denying 4 spades, responder now leaves in NT or converts to 4 with a 4-card heart suit
*** 4 = showing 4 spades.
** 3 showing a 4-card heart suit and denying a 4-card spade suit, responder converts to 3NT or 4 as appropriate
** 3NT denying a 4-card major, to play.

==Checkback Stayman==
2 Checkback Stayman (or simply Checkback) is used after a 1NT rebid by opener rather than a 1NT opening. It is used to &quot;check back&quot; if opener has major suit support, saying nothing additional about the club suit. It can find 3-5 fits, 4-4 fits (in Standard American) and 5-3 fits (in Acol), and also shows whether opener was maximum or minimum strength for his notrump bid. In five-card major systems, bidding Checkback implies that the responder has five cards in his major, and may have four in the other.

1m – 1M; 1NT – 2

The 2 is &quot;Checkback Stayman&quot;. Responses by opener shows the following:
:2: No three-card support for partner&#x27;s major, no four-card holding in the other major and a minimum hand.
:2/: Bidding responder&#x27;s major shows three-card support and a minimum hand; bidding the other major shows four cards and a minimum hand.
:2NT: No three-card support for partner&#x27;s major, no four-card holding in the other major and a maximum hand.
:3/: Bidding responder&#x27;s major shows three-card support and a maximum hand; bidding the other major shows four cards and a maximum hand.

Partnership agreement is required on how to handle the case of holding four of the other major and three of partner&#x27;s suit. One could agree to bid up the line, or support partner&#x27;s suit first. If partner cannot support your first suit, he will invite with 2NT or bid game with 3NT and you will then correct to your other suit.

In Acol, if the opening bid was a major, opener can rebid his major after a Checkback inquiry to show that it has five cards rather than four and find 5-3 fits. Moreover, 1M – 2m; 2NT – 3 can also be used as Checkback Stayman. It is useful also to include an indication of range, particularly if opener&#x27;s 2NT rebid is forcing to game and shows a wide points range (15-19). This is achieved by using 3 for minimum hands and 3/3/3NT for maximum hands, or vice versa. After 3, responder can still bid 3/3 to look for a 5-3 fit.

New Minor Forcing is an alternative to Checkback Stayman where either 2 or 2 can be used as the checkback bid. It can be used by responder with invitational values or better to find three-card support for his major or to find a 4-4 heart fit if holding five spades and four hearts; it also allows a return to the minor to play.

<text>Saks Fifth Avenue (originally Saks &amp; Company; colloquially Saks) is an American luxury department store chain founded by Andrew Saks and headquartered in New York City. The original Saks opened in the F Street shopping district of Washington, D.C. in 1867. Saks expanded into Manhattan with its Herald Square store in 1902 and flagship store on Fifth Avenue in 1924. The chain was acquired by Tennessee-based Proffitt&#x27;s, Inc. (renamed Saks, Inc.) in 1998, and Saks, Inc. was acquired by the Toronto-based Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 2013. With the establishment of HBC&#x27;s American division Saks Global in 2024, it is sister brands with department stores Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus. Saks Off 5th, originally a clearance store for Saks Fifth Avenue, is now a large off-price retailer in its own right.

==History==
=== Saks &amp; Co. ===
Andrew Saks was born to a German Jewish family, in Baltimore, Maryland. He worked as a peddler and paper boy before moving to Washington, D.C., where at the age of only 20, and in the still-chaotic and tough economic times of 1867, two years after the United States prevailed in the American Civil War, he established a men&#x27;s clothing store with his brother Isadore. A. Saks &amp; Co. occupied a storefront in the Avenue House Hotel building at 517 (300–308) 7th Street, N.W., in what is still Washington&#x27;s downtown shopping district. Saks offered his goods at one price only, no bargaining, and offered refunds on merchandise returns, neither of which were the more common practice at that place and time. Saks was also known for its &quot;forceful and interesting, but strictly truthful&quot; newspaper advertising, according to the Washington &quot;Evening Star&quot;, including a two-page spread, large for that time, in that newspaper on April 4, 1898. Saks annexed the store next door, and in 1887 started building a large new store on the site of the old Avenue Hotel Building at 7th and Market Space (now United States Navy Memorial Plaza).

By 1896, Saks and Co. had stores in Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; New York City; and Indianapolis, in addition to Washington, D.C., where, Saks called itself &quot;Washington&#x27;s Wonderful Store&quot;.

Saks opened a very large store in 1902 in New York City&#x27;s Herald Square on 34th Street and Broadway. Andrew Saks ran the New York store as a family business with his brother Isadore, and his sons Horace and William. Andrew Saks died in 1912 and his son Horace took over the company&#x27;s management.

===Saks Fifth Avenue===
In 1923, Saks &amp; Co. merged with Gimbel Brothers, Inc., which was owned by a cousin of Horace Saks, Bernard Gimbel, operating as a separate autonomous subsidiary. On September 15, 1924, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel opened in the Saks Fifth Avenue Building at 611 Fifth Avenue, with a full-block avenue frontage south of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, facing what would become Rockefeller Center. The architects were Starrett &amp; van Vleck, who developed a design derived from classical architecture.
===Resort and university stores===
When Bernard&#x27;s cousin, Adam Gimbel, became president of Saks Fifth Avenue in 1926 after Horace Saks&#x27;s sudden death, the company expanded, opening seasonal resort branches in Palm Beach (1926), Atlantic City (1927), Lincoln Road in Miami Beach (1929), Southampton on Long Island (1931), Newport, Rhode Island (1935), Sun Valley, Idaho and Westbury, L.I. (1936), and Greenwich, Connecticut (1937).

In 1929, Saks opened its first full-line, year-round flagship store in Chicago, and only six years later moved to a larger location. By the end of the 1930s, Saks Fifth Avenue had a total of 10 stores – the 2 large urban flagships in New York and Chicago, and 8 resort stores.

During World War Two, Saks opened Navy and Army shops in New Haven, Connecticut and Princeton, New Jersey, and after the war turned the small branches into University Shops, catering to the Ivy League communities there. More University Shops would open, one near Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., another in Ann Arbor, Michigan (1960).

===New urban flagships===
Saks had already opened two urban flagship stores before the U.S. joined the war: its now-legendary store in Beverly Hills, and in Detroit (1940). After the war, three more downtown stores opened, albeit smaller in scale: Pittsburgh (1949), Philadelphia (1952) and San Francisco (1952) where Saks competed head-on with local luxury champion I. Magnin.

===Suburban malls===
During the 1950s, the shift from downtown shopping to suburban shopping malls gained momentum. Saks Fifth Avenue&#x27;s first anchor department store in a mall in 1954, at Sunrise Center, now The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale. A few of the new suburban stores were freestanding in suburbs that had a significant downtown shopping district, such as in White Plains, New York (1954) and both Garden City, Long Island and Surfside, near Miami in 1962. A few were in malls built in downtowns, such as New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis. But most new SFA stores, dozens, opened in malls over the decades through the 1990s.

===1990s===
====Sunbelt expansion====
More expansion followed through in the 1990s particularly into Texas, Florida and California. Plans to open in Mexico City were also scrapped following the Mexican peso crisis in 1995. the store was set to open at the Molière222 mall in Polanco, El Palacio de Hierro then took over the site where they still operate.

California-based I. Magnin closed in 1995, allowing Saks to acquire some of their locations and open in San Diego&#x27;s Fashion Valley and expand in Carmel. As in the 1950s, the company opened a wave of smaller &quot;Main Street&quot; stores in suburbs with downtown shopping, such as Pasadena, Santa Barbara, and San Diego&#x27;s La Jolla in California, and in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Charleston, South Carolina.

In Texas, Saks acquired 3 Texas locations where Marshall Fields was exiting. In 1997 SFA moved its main Houston store from the Saks Pavilion to The Galleria and added a new location at Town &amp; Country. In the Dallas Galleria, Saks moved within the mall to a larger location. In addition to the former Field&#x27;s locations, SFA Austin opened in 1997 and Fort Worth in 2000.

In Florida in the 1990s, 7 Saks Fifth Avenue stores opened, for a total of 11 stores by the end of the decade, adding Palm Beach Gardens, Naples, Fort Myers, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa and doubled the size of its Boca Raton store.

====Commercial changes====
Also in 1990, the company launched &quot;Saks Off 5th&quot;, an outlet store offshoot of the main brand, with 107 stores worldwide by 2016.

In 1998, Proffitt&#x27;s, Inc. the parent company of Proffitt&#x27;s and other department stores, acquired Saks Holdings Inc. Upon completing the acquisition, Proffitt&#x27;s, Inc. changed its name to Saks, Inc.

=== 2000s ===
====Middle East expansion====
In November 2001 the first Middle East SFA opened at Kingdom Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The store closed in 2012. In 2003 plans for stores in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were announced following the signing of licensing agreements, along with plans for 5 to 10 stores across Japan. Saks was also looking at sites in Bahrain and Beirut for new stores.

In 2005, Saks opened a 80,000 square foot store at the BurJuman Centre in Dubai which closed in 2016; the store was Saks last store in the UAE after failed attempts at expansion. The store was originally scheduled to open in early 2004. A Doha store was scheduled to open in 2005 at Landmark Mall however plans never came to fruition. A Tokyo store was also planned to open in 2005.

In 2008, Saks opened its third Middle East store at City Centre Bahrain in Manama, Bahrain. The store has two floors and is in size. After closing Riyadh and its 2 Dubai stores, it remains Saks&#x27; sole store in the Middle East.

====Eight US SFA stores close====
In 2004, Saks was enjoying an annual sales growth rate of 7.7% on a same-store basis, but was underperforming Neiman Marcus (+17%) and Nordstrom (+10%). In Southern California, analysts said that SFA was &quot;struggling to maintain its cachet&quot; against the two competitors and Bloomingdales. On October 1, Saks announced the closing of 8 underperforming, mostly smaller SFA stores: Pasadena, Palos Verdes, Mission Viejo, La Jolla and Carmel in California, Garden City NY, Hilton Head SC, and Downtown Minneapolis.

====Mexico expansion====

In November 2007, Grupo Sanborns, part of billionaire Carlos Slim&#x27;s corporate empire, secured a franchise and opened the first SFA store in Mexico, on the affluent far west side of Mexico City at Centro Santa Fe, that country&#x27;s largest mall. The store closed in 2022. Another store opened in the affluent urban neighborhood of Polanco at Plaza Carso in 2010, but it closed in October 2020.

===Commercial strategies===
In August 2007, the United States Postal Service began an experimental program selling the plus ZIP code extension to businesses. The first company to do so was Saks Fifth Avenue, which received the ZIP code of 10022-7463 (&quot;SHOE&quot;, on a U.S. touch-tone keypad) for the eighth-floor shoe department in its flagship Fifth Avenue store.

During the 2007–2009 recession, Saks had to cut prices and profit margins, thus according to Reuters &quot;training shoppers to expect discounts. It took three years before it could start selling at closer to full price&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In 2012, Saks licensed its first store in Central Asia, in Almaty, Kazakhstan, at the then-new Esentai Mall, together with boutiques of international luxury brands. SFA Almaty is 3 floors tall and in size.

In 2012, the Riyadh franchise store, owned by Prince Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud, closed after the licensing agreement expired.
As of 2013, the New York flagship store, whose real estate value was estimated between $800 million and over $1 billion at the time, generated around 20% of Saks&#x27; annual sales at $620 million, with other stores being less profitable according to analysts.

On July 29, 2013, Canada-based Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), the oldest commercial corporation in North America and owner of the competing chain Lord &amp; Taylor, announced it would acquire Saks Fifth Avenue&#x27;s parent company for US$2.9 billion.

Canada expansion plans were drafted, calling for up to seven SFA stores across the country, of which three eventually opened. In February 2016, it opened a Saks Fifth Avenue in downtown Toronto, in a section carved out of the building housing the flagship of its namesake department store, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, connected by sky bridge to the largest downtown mall, Eaton Centre. A second Greater Toronto location opened at Sherway Gardens shortly thereafter. And in February 2018, its third Canadian store opened in Calgary at Chinook Centre.

In 2015 Saks began a $250 million, three-year restoration of its Fifth Avenue flagship store. In October 2015, Saks announced a new location in Greenwich, Connecticut. In autumn 2015, Saks announced it would replace its existing store at the Houston Galleria with a new store.

=== 2020s ===
====2021====
On January 15, 2021, Saks Fifth Avenue unveiled a space on the fifth floor of its New York flagship, branded &quot;Barneys at Saks&quot;. The collaboration is aimed at continuing Barneys New York tradition of unearthing and promoting emerging designers.

On January 25, SFA launched the first standalone Barneys at Saks store in a location in Greenwich, Connecticut. This marked the first time Saks had offered men&#x27;s clothing and furnishings in that market.

In March, HBC and growth capital investor, Insight Partners, established Saks Fifth Avenue&#x27;s ecommerce business as a stand-alone entity, known as &quot;Saks&quot;. Insight Partners made a $500 million minority equity investment in Saks. The retailer&#x27;s 39-store fleet operates separately as an entity referred to as &quot;SFA,&quot; which remains wholly owned by HBC. At the time of the separation, HBC named Marc Metrick, CEO of Saks, the ecommerce business. Metrick was previously president of Saks Fifth Avenue since 2015.

In April, Saks announced that it would close all 27 of its fur salons, among which New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Beverly Hills, by the end of January 2022. The company also said that by January 2023, it would stop sales of products made from fur of wild animals or from animals raised for their fur.

In August, the company announced a collaboration with WeWork to convert some SFA spaces to co-working locations.

====2022====
In June 2022, Saks announced that it would convert the original 1938 store building in Beverly Hills, 9600 Wilshire, into offices and apartments. SFA Beverly Hills continues to operate from the former I. Magnin and Barneys buildings, which had previously been incorporated into the store complex.

In August of the same year, Grupo Sanborns announced that in 2023, it would close its SFA franchise store at Centro Santa Fe in Mexico City, the only store still operating in Mexico after the closure of the Polanco store two years earlier. A branch of Sears Mexico, also part of Grupo Sanborns, was to replace it, and staff were to be retained.

==== Under Saks Global (2024–present) ====
In July 2024 Saks announced that it planned to acquire rival retailer Neiman Marcus in a reported $2.65 billion merger. The acquisition was finalised in December 2024 and Saks Fifth Avenue became part of the new holding company Saks Global.

A franchise agreement was signed with Reliance Industries in early 2025 to open Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th stores in India.

== Legal controversies ==
In 2005, vendors filed against Saks alleging unlawful chargebacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the complaint for years and, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;exposed a tangle of illicit tactics that let Saks... keep money it owed to clothing makers&quot;, inflating Saks&#x27; yearly earnings up to 43% and abusively collecting around $30 million from suppliers over seven years. Saks settled with the SEC in 2007, after firing three or more executives involved in the fraudulent activities.

In 2014, Saks fired transgender employee Leyth Jamal after she was allegedly &quot;belittled by coworkers, forced to use the men&#x27;s room and repeatedly referred to by male pronouns (he and him)&quot;. After Jamal submitted a lawsuit for unfair dismissal, the company stated in a motion to dismiss that &quot;it is well settled that transsexuals are not protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&quot; In a court filing, the United States Department of Justice rebuked Saks&#x27; argument, stating that &quot;discrimination against an individual based on gender identity is discrimination because of sex.&quot; The Human Rights Campaign removed the company from its list of &quot;allies&quot; during the controversy. The lawsuit was settled out of court with undisclosed terms.

In 2017, following the events of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, Saks&#x27;s San Juan store in Mall of San Juan suffered major damages along with its neighboring anchor store Nordstrom. Taubman Centers, the company which owns the mall, filed a lawsuit against Saks for failing to provide an estimated reopening date and failing to restore damages after the hurricane due to a binding contract. Although Nordstrom reopened on November 9, 2018, Saks Fifth Avenue vacated The Mall of San Juan after two years of litigation.

== Notable locations ==
=== Saks–34th Street ===
Saks-34th Street was a fashion-focused middle market department store at 1293-1311 Broadway on Herald Square. The building, built in 1902, had seven stories and was designed by Buchman &amp; Fox. The store was spun off from Saks &amp; Company when that upscale retailer moved to Fifth Avenue, a location that Saks Fifth Avenue maintains to this day. The newly renamed Saks-34th Street was sold to Bernard F. Gimbel, and became a part of the New York division of Gimbels (later Manhattan Mall), and a sky bridge across 33rd Street connected the second floors of both flagship buildings. In the 1947 movie &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; the facade of Saks-34th Street is shown in a scene that focuses on the Gimbel&#x27;s flagship store. Branch locations were opened around the greater New York area. The store closed in 1965, citing poor layouts, no escalators, a confused identity, and outdated facade. After Gimbels decided to close the division, the first floor of the building was used as a Christmas season annex for Gimbel&#x27;s before being sold to the E. J. Korvettes chain. After the demise of the Korvette&#x27;s chain the building was remodeled into the Herald Center, in 1985. the primary tenant is H&amp;M, following another remodel.

=== Beverly Hills ===

The original Saks Fifth Avenue store in Beverly Hills, California, at 9600 Wilshire Boulevard, was designed by the architectural firm Parkinson and Parkinson, with interiors by Paul R. Williams. The store opened in 1938. The store was immediately successful upon opening and it would subsequently expand to almost and employ 500 people. Williams created an interior reminiscent of his designs for luxurious private residences, with rooms lit by indirect lamps and footlights focused on the clothes. New departments for furs, corsets, gifts and debutante dresses were added in the 1940 expansion.

The store relocated to the adjacent 9570 Wilshire Boulevard in 2024, and the original location will be converted into a mixed-use development by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.
