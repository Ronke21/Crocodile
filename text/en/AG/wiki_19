<text>The Savage Land is a fictional prehistoric land that features in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is a tropical preserve, hidden in Antarctica. It has appeared in many story arcs in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; as well as other related books.

Savage Land makes a brief appearance in the 2022 Marvel Cinematic Universe live-action film, &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;.

==Publication history==
The Savage Land first appeared as &#x27;The Land Where Time Stands Still&#x27; in &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #22 (Aug. 1941), in the tale &quot;Khor, the Black Sorcerer&quot; by Joe Simon, Jack Kirby, and Syd Shores. It gained its familiar form and moniker in &quot;X-Men&quot; #10 (March 1965), courtesy of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

==Fictional history==

In the &quot;X-Men&quot; series of comics, the Savage Land was created by the alien Nuwali at the behest of the other-dimensional, nigh-omnipotent aliens known as the Beyonders who sought to observe the process of evolution under relatively controlled conditions. In order to accomplish this, they had the Nuwali set up a number of game preserves on several planets. One of these planets was Earth during the Triassic period where the Nuwali chose a valley in Antarctica surrounded by active volcanoes. They proceeded to install a number of advanced technological devices in order to maintain a tropical climate. The aliens then stocked the area with all manner of Earth life over the following several millennia such as dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals. They also brought over the Man-Apes, earlier hominid ancestors of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

The Beyonders eventually grew bored with the experiment, and the Nuwali stopped maintaining the Savage Land during the Late Pleistocene era (the Ice Age era). However, the self-maintaining technology that allowed the pocket of tropical climate was left running, and many species which became extinct in other areas of the Earth continued to thrive within the Savage Land.

Later on, a group of human survivors from Atlantis sailed to Antarctica before the &quot;Great Cataclysm&quot; which sank Atlantis into the ocean. There, they discovered a cavern where they found an immense climate-controlling device and harnessed the technology used to keep the Savage Land&#x27;s volcanoes working. They named their location &quot;Pangea&quot;, which is Atlantean for &quot;paradise&quot;.

They mastered genetic engineering, which had been used on the Man-Apes when the Nuwali were still maintaining the Savage Land area. They used their genetic engineering techniques to transform other Savage Land inhabitants like the Golden People, the Lizard Men, the Reptile Men, the Tubantis, and others. The Atlanteans then forced them to work for them until these animal people revolted. After a time of war, the animal people demanded civil rights and the Atlanteans used technology to expand the Savage Land&#x27;s surface area for the animal people to live in. When the Great Cataclysm struck, the Atlantean empire fell and thanks to the machines, the Savage Land locations were spared from sinking into the sea.

In more recent years, the Savage Land was rediscovered by Lord Robert Plunder, who took back a sample of the metal known as &quot;anti-metal&quot; or &quot;Antarctic vibranium&quot; with him. This mysterious metal had the ability to produce vibrations which would liquefy all other metals. Fleeing from those who sought to steal this discovery, Plunder took his eldest son Kevin with him for a second trip into the Savage Land. The elder Plunder was killed by a local tribe of Man-Apes.

Kevin survived, thanks to the timely intervention of the orphaned sabretooth tiger later known as Zabu. He grew to adulthood in the Savage Land, becoming the adventurer known as Ka-Zar. Ka-Zar had many team-ups with the X-Men, who first revealed the Savage Land&#x27;s existence, Spider-Man, and many other superheroes who had visited the Savage Land. He later met and married Shanna the She-Devil.

The Savage Land&#x27;s existence is common knowledge throughout the world. At one time, there were press junkets sponsored by the oil company Roxxon. &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; photographer Peter Parker was sent and helped uncover Roxxon&#x27;s unethical and dangerous manipulation of the local resources.

At one point, Spider-Man teamed up with Ka-Zar to save Gwen Stacy from Kraven the Hunter and Gog at the time when her class and J. Jonah Jameson were visiting the Savage Land.

Many villains have threatened the Savage Land, including Sauron, Garokk, Magneto, and Thanos.

The Savage Land was decimated by an evil alien named Terminus (or one of his pawns) when he destroyed the machines that maintained the tropical climate. Many of the Savage Land&#x27;s native people were saved from the ensuing destruction by M&#x27;rin: The Warlord of The Skies who took them into her own native dimension to safety. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu wandered until the High Evolutionary (with help from the X-Men, M&#x27;rin, and Garokk) restored the region and its creatures, allowing them to return to the Savage Land with their newborn son. The other natives who had taken refuge in M&#x27;rin&#x27;s dimension returned as well.

Sometime after that, Spider-Man had Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy emigrated to the Savage Land after rescuing them from Ringmaster.

Evidence in the pages of the &quot;New Avengers&quot; suggests that S.H.I.E.L.D. is operating in the Savage Land, mining vibranium while using the indigenous population as slave labor, but these operations have been classified, and the operation was apparently decimated by a missile strike from the Helicarrier during an attack by the New Avengers. The team only survived thanks to Iron Man&#x27;s force field.

The Savage Land is featured in the limited series &quot;Claws&quot;, serving as a place of revenge for Wolverine and Black Cat on Arcade and White Rabbit. After defeating the two villains, the heroes left them stranded.

In &quot;X-Men: Divided We Stand&quot;, Cyclops and Emma Frost were vacationing there until Archangel contacted them about San Francisco looking like the 1960s.

Alyosha Kravinoff fled to the Savage Land after Punisher sabotaged his zoo.

During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Ka-Zar and Shanna discover Skrulls mining for vibranium. The New Avengers and the Mighty Avengers head toward the Savage Land where a downed Skrull ship was sighted. Luke Cage opens the downed Skrull ship and a large group of Marvel superheroes with older appearances and costumes come out, speaking as if they believe themselves to be authentic. They soon break out into a fight where the Spider-Man from the ship is killed by a Tyrannosaurus and regresses to a Skrull. The Hawkeye from the ship is killed by Ronin and regresses to a Skrull. This causes the superheroes from the ship to scatter into the jungle. The New Avengers&#x27; Spider-Man is knocked away by a Tyrannosaurus and ends up confronting Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and Sauron as well as some of the other locals (ranging from the Man-Apes, the Sun People, the Swamp Men, the Tree People, and the Zebra People). At the point where Spider-Man accuses Ka-Zar and Shanna for being Skrulls, the Captain America from the ship attacks who thinks the same thing for Spider-Man. When the Captain America is hit by a dart coated in some type of poison by one of the Swamp Men, it regresses to a Skrull named Pit&#x27;o Nilli and is then killed by Shanna. The ship&#x27;s Beast is trapped underground with Wonder Man. The two try to escape together, but Beast betrays Wonder Man as the two are about to return to the surface. During this, Iron Man uses an abandoned scientific facility nearby to try and recreate his original armor. When it came to the confrontation with both Avengers teams, the Savage Land natives, and the heroes from the ship, Mister Fantastic and Abigail Brand used a laser to identify the heroes from the ship as Skrulls. Ka-Zar joined the Avengers teams into fighting the Skrulls in New York while Shanna and the other Savage Land natives hunted down the remaining Skrulls hiding out in the Savage Land.

After the events of &quot;Second Coming&quot; during the &quot;Heroic Age&quot; storyline, Cyclops takes some time off to go hunting in the Savage Land during which he encounters Steve Rogers. Steve Rogers suggests to Cyclops that he brings the X-Men out of the shadows and into the light as heroes. Steve Rogers also arranges to have the president award Scott the Presidential Medal of Freedom which sways the people of San Francisco to welcome the X-Men back.

Around the same time following their defeat after the hunt for &quot;spiders&quot; in the &quot;Grim Hunt&quot; storyline, the Kravinoff Family are also currently residing in the Savage Land.

The United Council of Tribes was formed by Arwandi of the Zebra People. The meeting is crashed by Torran of the Ethereals. He mentions that the Ethereals have returned and took out some of the members of the Rock Tribe for making deals with outsiders. A Pteron mentioned that the Ethereals have abandoned the Savage Land for 1,000 years and that Torran has no voice here with two other representatives agreeing. When Torran tries to attack, Shanna the She-Devil tackles him and gets shocked. Ka-Zar then attacks Torran who zaps him. Torran then asks the United Council of Tribes to head the Ethereals&#x27; warning that anyone who bargains with outsiders will answer to the Ethereals. None of the tribes want to cut a deal with Roxxon Energy Corporation. Ka-Zar briefly encountered Maa-Gor who stated the Ethereals arrived after the Man-Apes arrived in the Savage Land and were thrown out by their creators. Torran later watched the confrontation between Ka-Zar, Arwandi, and the Fall People member Skeel who had given in to the deals made by Roxxon. Roxxon&#x27;s oil rig later explodes spewing oil into the Goran sea causing everyone to work together to keep the oil-filled water from reaching the other bodies of water as some Tubanti refugees emerge. When Torran crashes another meeting, a plan from those in the trees to net him fails. After Torran disappears, Arwandi tells the tribe representatives that he will &quot;go outside&quot;. As Arwandi goes to the United Nations, Ka-Zar finally tracks down Torran and works to subdue him to keep more people from dying as more Ethereals arrive. Ka-Zar is then joined by representatives of the Tree People, the Fall People, the Disians, the Swamp Men, and the Aerians. He works to convince the Ethereals to listen to reason and condemns Torrans&#x27; actions as an act of treason. As Ka-Zar and the tribes deal with the Ethereals, Arwandi speaks before the United Nations asking them to provide aid to the Savage Land after what happened with Roxxon&#x27;s oil platform. Arwandi&#x27;s plea works as all types of exploitation are removed from the Savage Land. At Roxxon, Timothy Litsch asks for Jennifer to cancel all of his appointments as he reaches for his gun. With help from some warriors on armored Triceratops, Ka-Zar defeats the Ethereals who end up departing as Torran warns that what will happen to the Savage Land at some point in the future will be Ka-Zar&#x27;s fault.

It is later revealed that Miek and the other Imperials and Natives from Sakaar that came back with Hulk in &quot;World War Hulk&quot; had settled in the Savage Land. There they constructed a village called New Imperia.

During the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Captain America ends up fighting Gambit in the Savage Land.

As part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event, some of The Garden&#x27;s evolution seeds had fallen into the Savage Land. While working to get it under control, the Avengers find that A.I.M. is also there where they test the extracted formula from one of the pods and tests it on their intern Dr. Jema. The formula puts a strain on Dr. Jema just as the Avengers arrive.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Magneto led a new team of X-Men to protect mutant-kind at all costs with their base in the Savage Land.

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, the Cotati have invaded the Savage Land.

==Savage Land races==
There are many types of races in the Savage Land and Pangea. The Nuwali transported primitive man now known as the Man-Apes, which unlike the rest of the world thrived until the 21st century. The next arrivals were the Ancient Atlanteans who added the region as part of their empire. They used the Nuwali technology to mutate the Man-Apes into various Beast-Men to perform certain tasks. These slaves rebelled after the great Cataclysm and made Pangea their home. Many Atlanteans remained and their descendants became the various human tribes, with some clinging to the old ways and technology but most forget and resort to more primitive hunter-gatherer societies.

It was mentioned in Torran&#x27;s narration that there are at least 1,000 races living in the Savage Land.

Since then, the different races of the Savage Land have been sorted between the human tribes, the early hominids, the Beast-Men, and the miscellaneous.

===Human tribes===
The following are the human tribes of the Savage Land:

* Awakilius – The Awakilius are a tribe of pygmies that live in the Savage Land and are descended from the immigrants that came from Africa. Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil prevented the Awakilius chief from sacrificing a Lemuran.
* Bhadwuans – The Bhadwuans are a society of advanced people that live in the Savage Land that are the supposed descendants of the Atlanteans. They specialize in magic, they can fly, and they can discharge energy when they act in unison. The live in the mystical realm of Bhadwuan and watched the Earth for a millennium. Some Bhadwuans wanted to change the Savage Land&#x27;s environment only for them to be stopped by Ka-Zar.
* Cat People – The Cat People (also called Pandorians) are a tribe of humans that dwell in Pandori, Pangea and in the periphery of the Lemuran society. They are a hunter-gatherer society. The Cat People worship and kill the Smilodons and other big cats that live in the Savage Land. These Cat People are not to be confused with the Cat People that are associated with Tigra.
* Cliff Forest People – The Cliff Forest People are a tribe of humans that live on a steep cliff in the Savage Land. They were allied with the Durammi against an unnamed barbarian tribe.
* Durammi – The Durammi are a tribe of humans that live in a peaceful valley within the Savage Land. They were allied with the Cliff Forest People against an unnamed barbarian tribe.
* Fall People – The Fall People are a hunter-gatherer tribe that live in villages, and are led by a chieftain. Their appearance and culture were similar to the Native Americans. Ka-Zar was very friendly with the Fall People, and their chieftain Tongah was his best friend. Most of the Fall People were killed in attacks by the Sun People and the extraterrestrial Quarlians. The Fall People later befriended the X-Men. The Fall People are a strong faction in the United Tribes.
* Gondorans – The Gondorans are a tribe of humans that inhabit Gondora, a city in a dormant volcano. It was ruled by a God-Man whose actual name was Montgomery Ford, a rogue scientist from the outside world. He used technology to build the city and rule with an iron fist. Gondora has been destroyed with some of its inhabitants escaping.
* Gwundas – The Gwundas are a race of primitive humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Ka-Zar once saved their tribe from a Tyrannosaurus that they accidentally unleashed.
* Hill-Forest People – The Hill-Forest People are a race of primitive humans that live in the Savage Land. They are an agricultural tribe when they stumbled upon a capsule containing Grond of Gondwanaland (who was placed in suspended animation by his creators). The Hill-Forest People worshiped the capsule until Grond woke up and was defeated by Ka-Zar.
* Lemurans – The Lemurans are a society of humans that inhabit Lemura, an area of the section of Pangea known as Zarhan. Their level of technology is the same as Medieval England and are one of the descendants of the ancient Atlanteans. These humans are strongly loyal to their monarchy. The Lemurans were longtime allies of the Pterons.
* Locot – The Locots are a society of hunter-gatherers that have been at war with the Noweks.
* Nowek – The Noweks are a society of hunters and gatherers that have been at war against the tribes that are less developed.
* Palandorians – The Palandorians are a tribe of humans that live on an island surrounded by a lake in the original Savage Land. They live in the city of Palandor and ride giant lizards. Their culture likely derives form ancient Atlantis (same as the Lemurans). The Palandorians were often preyed upon by the Klantorrs. During the reign of Queen Omel, the Palandorians performed human sacrifices which ceased when a mutated Apatosaurus destroyed the temple which killed Queen Omel.
* Sun People – The Sun People control the Sun Empire, formerly ruled by their priestess-queen Zaladane. They were the most powerful grouping of sentient beings within the Savage Land, and they established a small empire through conquest. They conquered in the name of their sun god Garokk. Although the Sun People were depicted as green-skinned in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; #19 (Dec. 1987), they are in fact indistinguishable from ordinary Caucasians (see Zaladane). The cited Handbook entry in fact erroneously depicted a Sheenarian, member of an extradimensional race who once invaded the Savage Land (first seen in &quot;Ka-Zar: Lord of the Hidden Jungle&quot; #14). During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, the Sun People were depicted among Ka-Zar&#x27;s allies in his fight against the Skrulls, presumably as a result of the aforementioned error being used as reference.
* Swamp Men – The Swamp Men are humanoids covered head to toe in hair that live in the swamplands of the Savage Land. These tribal people have a level of technology comparable to that of Europe&#x27;s Dark Ages, ride giant birds, and are highly skilled in devising weaponry. They are continual enemies of Ka-Zar. The Swamp Men long worshipped Umbu the Unliving, a gigantic robot constructed by the alien Saggitarians. The Savage Land Mutates are Swamp Men who Magneto subjected to mutation by artificial means. During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, some of the Swamp Men joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.
* Sylandans – The Sylandans are a society of humans that are one of the descendants of the ancient Atlanteans. They live in Sylanda, a city of glass located in the Savage Land&#x27;s Mountain of Darkness. They cling to their Atlantean ways as their level of technology is high. The Sylandans use the Water of Life to cure all diseases and used it to treat the people of the Savage Land for centuries. Their city was later damaged by a large dinosaur.
* Tandar-Kaans – The Tandar-Kaans are a tribe of people that live in the Savage Land. They are expert ship builders and fishermen. They formed a community of barges on the river Tabar allowing them to move to new shores when they want to.
* Tokchis – The Tokchis have not yet been seen in the comics yet have been mentioned a lot. They are mentioned to be a human society of hunter-gatherers that use walkie-talkies. Ka-Zar formed an alliance with them to coordinate efforts to hunt.
* Tordon-Naans – The Tordon-Naans inhabit a city called Tordon-Naa in a secluded valley deep in the Savage Land behind the &quot;curtain of gods&#x27; tears&quot;. They worship the god Ilaka-Aron and their beliefs were manipulated Sylitha who sought greater power. The Tordon-Naans are a lost Hindu colony as their culture closely resembles that of ancient India.
* Tribe of Fire – The Tribe of Fire is a tribe of humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Some of the tribe members were used in an experiment conducted by an Apocalypse robot until it was destroyed by Wolverine. The cyborgs from these experiments joined the Tribe of Fire.
* Water People – The Water People are a tribe of humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society that live close to the rivers where they survive by fishing.
* Zebra People – The Zebra People are a racially integrated society made of up both white and black people, who wear makeup over their body in the form of zebra-like stripes. White Zebra People wear black stripes and black Zebra People wear white stripes. The Zebra People are known to ride dinosaurs that they have domesticated. During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, some of the Zebra People joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.
** Lizard People – There is also a rogue faction of the Zebra People called the Lizard People which wore reptilian armor and worked for Zaur and Sheeas the Witch. Zaur and those that were members of the Lizard People returned to the Zebra People after the death of Sheeas the Witch. Of course, some of them may have preserved the traditions of the Lizard People.

===Primitive hominids===
The following are the primitive hominids of the Savage Land:

* Ape-Men – The Ape-Men consist of all the species of upright apes that developed into man. Each group lives in its own territory and has its own level of technology. The most advanced species of Ape-Man (the Neanderthals often called Man-Apes in the Savage Land) are the most dominant human race of the Savage Land and are capable of bringing down even the largest of dinosaurs.
* Kantos – The Kantos are a race of primitive humans that live near an underground river.
* Karems – The Karems are a race of primitive humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Many of the Karem were abducted by the Nuwali and Plunderer using the Motyka Bone (a teleportation bone that was lost for centuries), but were rescued by Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil.
* Man-Apes – The Man-Apes are tribal, highly primitive cave-dwelling humans that are often called Neanderthals by paleontologists. These savage hominids were the first humanoid beings native to Earth to inhabit the Savage Land. Atlantean scientists used Man-Apes as subjects in the experiments by which they created the various non-human races of the Savage Land. Maa-Gor&#x27;s Man-Ape tribe are said to have been the last living Man-Apes in the Savage Land and were responsible for killing some of the Smilodons including Zabu&#x27;s mate. Ka-Zar killed all the male Man-Apes of Maa-Gor&#x27;s tribe except for Maa-Gor himself. It seems likely that the Man-Apes are the only remaining humanoids on Earth that haven&#x27;t had their genome tampered with like the other races in Savage Land or like the humans in the outside world were experimented with by the Celestials. During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, some of the Man-Apes joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.

===Beast-Men===
The following are the Beast-Men of the Savage Land:

* Aerians – The Aerians are a race of avian-type Beast-Men with large feathered wings which allow them to fly. Each member has a different color of skin and matching feathers (green, blue, orange, etc.). They are located in the city of Aerie Shalan which is located on a stone pillar high above Pangea. They are ruled by a technocracy, led by a chief scientist. Their technology advanced far beyond that of human scientists because they adapted and improved upon surviving antediluvian Atlantean technology. The Aerians became the principal allies of Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil in Pangea, who aided them in their war with the Pterons.
* Gorankians – The Gorankians are a race of gray-skinned, ape-like, semi-intelligent, Beast-Men with small tusks coming from their lower jaw, pointed ears, and surprisingly small amount of hair. They are tribal in nature and led by Etuban. The Gorankians are a hunter-gatherer society and are long-time enemies of the Uruburians. Ka-Zar helped settle their dispute by having them play different games which includes baseball in order to prevent an all-out war.
* Jeriens – The Jeriens are a race of Pterosaur-like Beast-Men that live in the Savage Land.
* Klantorrs – The Klantorrs are a race of Saurian-like Beast-Men with Pterosaur-like wings that inhabit the forest-country surrounding Palandor. They have a taste for human flesh. Possibly resulted from the genetic tinkering of the ancient Atlanteans just like the genetic tinkering that resulted in the creations of the Aerians and Pterons. They have occasionally hunted the Palandorians.
* Lizard Men – The Lizard Man are a lizard-like race that were one of the Beast-Men created by the Ancient Atlanteans. There had been two different Lizard Men that lived in the Savage Land where they are much different from the Lizard Men of Subterranea and the Lizard Men of Tok (from the Microverse).
** Lizard Men of Vala Kuri – The first group of Lizard Men are a hunter-gatherer society of Beast-Men with pointy ears and reside in the city of Vala Kuri. The Lizard Men of Vala Kuri are peaceful in nature. They are protected from the Sun People by Ka-Zar and Garokk. The Lizard Men have ancestors in the Reptile Men and the Waidians.
** Queen Iranda&#x27;s Lizard Men – The second group of the Lizard Men were actually a group of mystically-altered humans that went missing from their village and turned into Lizard Men by Queen Iranda. When Ka-Zar comes to their aid, he barely escapes them and manages to escape with Queen Iranda&#x27;s crown which regressed Queen Iranda back to a lizard and the Lizard Men back to their human forms.
* N&#x27;Galans - The N&#x27;Galans are humanoid dinosaurs with possible ties to the Lizardmen and are a hunter-gatherer society. Most are highly superstitious. Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s trainer, Gregor, forced the N&#x27;Galans to work for him when he served Pillard&#x27;s interests in the Savage Land.
* Pterons – The Pterons are a race of Beast-Men that greatly resemble humanoid Pteranodons and have the ability to fly with their enormous wings. They inhabit the caverns of Athmeth beneath Pangea. They are ruled by their king Khalf. The Pterons launched a war against the Aerians, in which the Pteron race was mostly killed in a cave-in.
* Reptile Men – The Reptile Men are a race of green-skinned reptilian humanoids that reside in the marshes of the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society. When the alien Quor crash-landed on Earth and encountered the Reptile Men, he convinced them to make him their leader and provided them with advanced technology. The Reptile Men started to plunder the Vibranium deposits of the other tribes like the Golden People which attracted the attention of Ka-Zar. Once Ka-Zar managed to defeat Quor with the help of the Golden People, the Reptile Men retreated.
* Tree People – The Tree People are a race of Beast-Men that looks much like humans though they have long, prehensile monkey-like tails. They live in Botor (a treetop village in Pangea) and are a hunter-gatherer society. Shanna the She-Devil was briefly married to one of the Tree People named Mele. During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, some of the Tree People joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.
* Tubanti – The Tubantis are a race of fish-type Beast-Men that dwell in Pangea&#x27;s inland Gorahn Sea. They briefly served the demon Belasco when he tried to conquer the Savage Land. The Tubantis are allies with the Lemurans and the other races of the Savage Land.
* Uruburians – The Uruburians are a race of Beast-Men with unspecified feline-like faces and fangs that live in the Savage Land as a hunter-gatherer tribe. The Uruburians are long-time enemies of the Gorankians. Ka-Zar helped settle their dispute by having them play different games which includes baseball in order to prevent an all-out war.
* Waidians – The Waidians are a race of green-skinned dinosaur-like Beast-Men that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society and are very peaceful. When Ka-Zar was a teenager, he was trained by the wise Waidian sage named Benazu.

===Others===
The following don&#x27;t fit in the categories above:

* Disians – The Dissians (also known as the Children of Dis) are underground yellow-skinned humanoids who are the descendants of the Dante&#x27;s Crew and had bee mutated into creatures that resembled the Moloids of Subterranea. They reside in the underground city of Belasco beneath the Savage Land. Some Dissians can emit bursts of energy from their eyes.
* Ethereals – The Ethereals are a race of advanced humanoids that were genetically enhanced by the Nuwali thousands of years ago. Until recently, they were considered to be mythical by the other tribes of the Savage Land. They are culturally arrogant and hostile to outsiders.
* Golden People – The Golden People are a race of yellow-skinned humans that reside in the Savage Land. They are the descendants of the Gortokians of Subterranea. The Golden People are longtime allies of Ka-Zar and have salvaged Atlantean technology.
* Hauk&#x27;kas – The Hauk&#x27;kas are a race of reptilians that evolved from dinosaurs the same time way that humanity has evolved from apes. The Hauk&#x27;kas possess technology, culture, and civilization that rivals the human race. The Hauk&#x27;kas have a good knowledge of the superhuman side of the human race. A council of older Hauk&#x27;kas serve as the leaders of the Hauk&#x27;kas. The X-Men first encountered the Hauk&#x27;kas when investigating the mysterious resurrection of Psylocke at the same time when the Hauk&#x27;kas were capturing the Saurians that the X-Men once helped to emigrate to the Savage Land. The Hauk&#x27;kas are currently on neutral terms with the human race.
* Neo-Men – The Neo-Men are a society of mutated humans that were mutated by Nuwali technology.
* Nhu&#x27;Gari – The Nhu&#x27;Gari are a race of mutated humans with winged forms. They were actually altered by the radioactive properties of Hidden Valley which also provides them with telepathy. The Nhu&#x27;Gari once allied with Magneto. Volcanic upheavals later destroyed their city.
* Rock Tribe – The Rock Tribe are a group of stone-like humanoids.
* Saurians – The Saurians (also known as &quot;The People&quot;) were originally lizards that were exposed to the first nuclear bomb test in New Mexico. It took them awhile for them to evolve and they built an underground city. They did have an encounter with Ms. Marvel when she discovered their underground city. When the Dire Wraiths attacked, the Saurians encountered Rom. The Saurian survivors hid from the humans until they later learned of the Savage Land. The Saurians were spotted by some people when traveling through Argentina and were rescued by the X-Men who helped them get to the Savage Land. They became part of the United Tribes at the time when the Savage Land Mutates attacked. Sometime later, the Saurians were captured by the Hauk&#x27;ka yet were rescued by the X-Men.
* Snowmen – The Snowmen lived on the high steppes of Pangea and resemble brown-furred Yeti-like creatures. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil encountered two of them channeling the lava from Mt. Flavius.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality, the Savage Land houses Avalon, a secret haven for humans and mutants. A method to reach it exists, but it will only cost the refugee everything they own and even then, there is no guarantee of arriving alive. It is led by Destiny, a pacifist Juggernaut and Douglas Ramsey, the latter of whom provides a field that allows everybody to understand each other despite speaking different languages. Avalon was eventually found by Apocalypse forces and destroyed by the Shadow King who mind-controlled its inhabitants into killing each other. He was defeated, but casualties were high.

===Age of Ultron===
During the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, the superhero resistance against Ultron had relocated to the Savage Land to come up with a plan to defeat Ultron.

===Marvel Zombies Return===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;, the Savage Land, like everywhere else on Earth, has been eaten by the superhuman zombies, with the surviving zombies musing that the Savage Land was their &#x27;number one&#x27; meal in the aftermath, as it contained such an abundance of food that they were actually full for a full hour after eating there, as opposed to the usual ravenous hunger they feel. It is also the location of the final battle between the zombies and &#x27;New Avengers&#x27; - three zombies who have beaten their hunger and the cyborg James Rhodes - at the storyline&#x27;s conclusion, with Rhodes using one of his fingers to lure the zombies into an ambush.

===Earth X===
In the &quot;Earth X&quot; universe, the Savage Land is where Magneto built his sanctuary called Sentinel City.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality created by an insane Scarlet Witch, the Savage Land was known as &quot;Pangea&quot;. It is also known that Kevin Plunder has been granted political asylum in the United States for his human rights activism in this prehistoric land.

===Marvel 2099===
In the alternate future depicted in Marvel 2099, an alien attack floods much of the earth rendering the Savage Land the only habitable space. Thousands of refugees (including Miguel O&#x27;Hara and most of X-Nation and X-Men) make new homes here. It is not without its own dangers.

===The Transformers===
In the &quot;Transformers&quot; Marvel comics continuity, shortly after the &quot;Ark&quot; spacecraft crashed on Earth 4 million years before the present day, the computer aboard the Ark detected Shockwave landing on the prehistoric Savage Land. The &quot;Ark&quot; used the last of its capabilities to revive five Autobot warriors and rebuild them into the Dinobots, based on scans of the Savage Land&#x27;s dominant lifeform: dinosaurs. The Dinobots fought Shockwave, a battle that ended in stalemate when Snarl brought down the mountain that Shockwave stood upon, knocking all of them into a tar pit. They remained deactivated until the year 1984. Since the Dinobots&#x27; alt-mode forms resemble creatures that were long-extinct by 4 million years ago, the Savage Land provided author Bob Budiansky a way to explain this within the canon timeline.

===Spider-Geddon===
During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, an alternate unidentified Earth has a version of Spider-Man that lives in the Savage Land and was raised by a tribe of giant spiders following an airplane crash. It was mentioned by Ka-Zar the Hunter to Wilson Fisk that his father killed the last of the Man-Apes.

===Squirrel Girl volume 8===
In the Squirrel Girl reality, the Savage Land was created by an unknown race of aliens that created dinosaurs as an experiment on earth biology. Eventually, the experiment was abandoned, and all dinosaurs, except the ones in the Savage Land were left to die. In modern times it belongs to scientists, who protect it as a Nature Reserve. The Savage Land harbors no other intelligent creatures, except Ultron, who has rebuilt himself in the form of a dinosaur and resides in the Savage Land.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Savage Land is a large island somewhere in the southern hemisphere. It was originally stated in &quot;Ultimate Origins&quot; to have been created by Magneto, using theories and methods developed by Professor X, as the site for genetic experiments. Magneto&#x27;s goal there was to create a new human race who would be less trouble to rule than the current one. He decided to restart evolution from scratch, and control the process to his own specifications. As a result of this, at its current level of advancement it has dinosaurs, but Magneto has shown no further interest in advancing the evolution of the Savage Land. It has remained in its dinosaur state since the departure of Professor X. This story is later revealed as false.

Magneto&#x27;s original base was on the Savage Land, but when it was destroyed in the first arc of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, the computer controlling the base gained self-awareness, and hijacked the genetic experiment project to create an army of nanotech-enhanced, zombie-like thralls. It planned to take over the world, but was stopped by Wolverine, Cyclops, and Kitty Pryde.

The Savage Land is now the home of Longshot, who managed to get there in a small boat which launched from Genosha. Longshot recently aided Magneto in breaking out of prison, and the two were alluded to be planning something, but Magneto later killed Longshot.

In &quot;Ultimates 3&quot;, it is revealed that the dinosaurs were conjured by Scarlet Witch as a result of her reality warping abilities and not by Magneto&#x27;s creation. The aboriginal inhabitants were wiped out and only a small tribe of survivors including Ka-Zar and Shanna remain.

The inhabitants help the Ultimates remove the last of Magneto&#x27;s forces as of &quot;Ultimatum&quot;.

===Ultimate Universe===
An alternate universe variation of the Savage Land from Earth-6160 appears in the Ultimate Universe imprint. In &quot;The Ultimates&quot; (vol. 4), the Roxxon Energy Partners harvested much of its natural resources, turning it into a polluted wasteland and causing an extinction event. Additionally, they are stated to have taken it over during the 1970s.

In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; (vol. 3), it is implied that an untouched part of the Savage Land is connected to Subterranea and under Mole Man&#x27;s rule.

===What If?===
The Savage Land appears in a &quot;What If&quot; story where the Savage Land was terraforming and has taken over New York. Both Ka-Zar and Parnival sacrifice themselves to return New York to normal, with Shanna the only survivor of his &quot;family&quot;.

Additionally, in the &quot;What If&quot; issues involving alternative outcomes to the Age of Ultron, a group composed of Wolverine, the Hulk, Peter Parker and a Ghost Rider venture to the Savage Land in order to prevent a Master Mold under the control of a future version of Ezekiel Stane from unleashing a wave of Stark armors on the world.

<text>Stephen Henry Schneider (February 11, 1945 – July 19, 2010) was professor of environmental biology and global change at Stanford University, a co-director at the Center for Environment Science and Policy of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and a senior fellow in the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. Schneider served as a consultant to federal agencies and White House staff in the Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations.

Schneider&#x27;s research included modeling of the atmosphere, climate change, and the effect of global climate change on biological systems. Schneider was the founder and editor of the journal &quot;Climatic Change&quot; and authored or co-authored over 450 scientific papers and other publications. He was a coordinating lead author in Working Group II Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report and was engaged as a co-anchor of the Key Vulnerabilities Cross-Cutting Theme for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) at the time of his death. During the 1980s, Schneider emerged as a leading public advocate of sharp reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. In 2006 Professor Schneider was an Adelaide Thinker in Residence advising the South Australian Government of Premier Mike Rann on climate change and renewable energy policies. In ten years South Australia went from zero to 31% of its electricity generation coming from renewables.

An annual award for outstanding climate science communication was created in Schneider&#x27;s honor after his death, by the Commonwealth Club of California. The Stephen Schneider Memorial Lecture of the American Geophysical Union honors Schneider&#x27;s life and work.

==Early work==
Schneider grew up on Long Island, New York. He studied engineering at Columbia University, receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering in 1966. In 1971, he earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and plasma physics. Schneider studied the role of greenhouse gases and suspended particulate material on climate as a postdoctoral fellow at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Schneider was awarded the Marshall Scholarship.

In 1971, Schneider was second author on a &quot;Science&quot; paper with S. Ichtiaque Rasool titled &quot;Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate&quot; (&quot;Science&quot; 173, 138–141). This paper used a one-dimensional radiative transfer model to examine the competing effects of cooling from aerosols and warming from CO2. The paper concluded that:

Carbon dioxide was predicted to have only a minor role. However, the model was very simple and the calculation of the CO2 effect was lower than other estimates by a factor of about three, as noted in a footnote to the paper.

The story made headlines in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Schneider became aware that he had overestimated the cooling effect of aerosols, and underestimated the warming effect of CO2 by a factor of about three. He had mistakenly assumed that measurements of air particles he had taken near the source of pollution applied worldwide. He also found that much of the effect was due to natural aerosols which would not be affected by human activities, so the cooling effect of changes in industrial pollution would be much less than he had calculated. Having found that recalculation showed that global warming was the more likely outcome, he published a retraction of his earlier findings in 1974.

In a 1976 book &quot;The Genesis Strategy&quot; he discusses both long-term warming due to carbon dioxide and short-term cooling due to aerosols, and advocated for adopting policies that are resilient to future changes in climate.

==Media contributions==
Schneider was a frequent contributor to commercial and noncommercial print and broadcast media on climate and environmental issues, e.g., &quot;Nova&quot;, &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Bill Maher&#x27;s shows, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Dateline&quot;, The Discovery Channel, as well as appearances on the British, Canadian and Australian Broadcasting Corporations.

Schneider commented about the frustrations and difficulties involved with assessing and communicating scientific ideas. In a January 2002 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article, he wrote:
In 1989, Schneider addressed the challenge scientists face trying to communicate complex, important issues without adequate time during media interviews. This citation sometimes was used by his critics to accuse him of supporting misuse of science for political goals:

For the original, together with Schneider&#x27;s commentary on its misrepresentation, see also American Physical Society, &quot;APS News&quot; August/September 1996.

==Honors==
* 1991 AAAS Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology
* 1992 MacArthur Fellowship
* 2002 Elected to the National Academy of Sciences
* Chair of the American Association for the Advancement of Science&#x27;s Section on Atmospheric and Hydrospheric Sciences (1999–2001)
* The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to which Schneider made very significant contributions, shared in the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.

==Personal life==
Schneider was married to the biologist Terry Root. Schneider was a survivor of an aggressive cancer, mantle cell lymphoma. He documented his struggle to conquer the condition, including applying his own knowledge of science to design his own treatment regime, in a self-published 2005 book, &quot;The Patient from Hell&quot;. He died unexpectedly on July 19, 2010, after suffering a pulmonary embolism while returning from a scientific meeting in , Sweden.

<doc id="29537" wikidata="Q428632" url="?curid=29537" title="Scientific misconduct">
<text>Scientific misconduct is the violation of the standard codes of scholarly conduct and ethical behavior in the publication of professional scientific research. It is the violation of scientific integrity: violation of the scientific method and of research ethics in science, including in the design, conduct, and reporting of research. 

A &quot;Lancet&quot; review on &quot;Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries&quot; provides the following sample definitions, reproduced in The COPE report 1999:
* Danish definition: &quot;Intention or gross negligence leading to fabrication of the scientific message or a false credit or emphasis given to a scientist&quot;
* Swedish definition: &quot;Intention[al] distortion of the research process by fabrication of data, text, hypothesis, or methods from another researcher&#x27;s manuscript form or publication; or distortion of the research process in other ways.&quot;

The consequences of scientific misconduct can be damaging for perpetrators and journal audiences and for any individual who exposes it. In addition there are public health implications attached to the promotion of medical or other interventions based on false or fabricated research findings. Scientific misconduct can result in loss of public trust in the integrity of science.

Three percent of the 3,475 research institutions that report to the US Department of Health and Human Services&#x27; Office of Research Integrity indicate some form of scientific misconduct. However the ORI will only investigate allegations of impropriety where research was funded by federal grants. They routinely monitor such research publications for red flags and their investigation is subject to a statute of limitations. Other private organizations like the Committee of Medical Journal Editors (COJE) can only police their own members.

==Motivation==
According to David Goodstein of Caltech, there are motivators for scientists to commit misconduct, which are briefly summarised here.
; Career pressure
:Science is still a very strongly career-driven discipline. Scientists depend on a good reputation to receive ongoing support and funding, and a good reputation relies largely on the publication of high-profile scientific papers. Hence, there is a strong imperative to &quot;publish or perish&quot;. This may motivate desperate (or fame-hungry) scientists to fabricate results.
; Ease of fabrication
: In many scientific fields, results are often difficult to reproduce accurately, being obscured by noise, artifacts, and other extraneous data. That means that even if a scientist does falsify data, they can expect to get away with it – or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field. There are few strongly backed systems to investigate possible violations, attempt to press charges, or punish deliberate misconduct. It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data.
;Monetary Gain
: In many scientific fields, the most lucrative options for professionals are often selling opinions. Corporations can pay experts to support products directly or indirectly via conferences. Psychologists can make money by repeatedly acting as an expert witness in custody proceedings for the same law firms.

==Forms==
The U.S. National Science Foundation defines three types of research misconduct: fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism.
* &quot;Fabrication&quot; is making up results and recording or reporting them. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;drylabbing&quot;. A more minor form of fabrication is where references are included to give arguments the appearance of widespread acceptance, but are actually fake, or do not support the argument.
* &quot;Falsification&quot; is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
* &quot;Plagiarism&quot; is the appropriation of another person&#x27;s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. One form is the appropriation of the ideas and results of others, and publishing as to make it appear the author had performed all the work under which the data was obtained. A subset is citation plagiarism – willful or negligent failure to appropriately credit other or prior discoverers, so as to give an improper impression of priority. This is also known as, &quot;citation amnesia&quot;, the &quot;disregard syndrome&quot; and &quot;bibliographic negligence&quot;. Arguably, this is the most common type of scientific misconduct. Sometimes it is difficult to guess whether authors intentionally ignored a highly relevant cite or lacked knowledge of the prior work. Discovery credit can also be inadvertently reassigned from the original discoverer to a better-known researcher. This is a special case of the Matthew effect.
** Plagiarism-fabrication – the act of taking an unrelated figure from an unrelated publication and reproducing it exactly in a new publication, claiming that it represents new data.
** Self-plagiarism – or multiple publication of the same content with different titles or in different journals is sometimes also considered misconduct; scientific journals explicitly ask authors not to do this. It is referred to as &quot;salami&quot; (i.e. many identical slices) in the jargon of medical journal editors. According to some editors, this includes publishing the same article in a different language.
Other types of research misconduct are also recognized:
* Ghostwriting describes when someone other than the named author(s) makes a major contribution to the research. Typically, this is done to mask contributions from authors with a conflict of interest.
* &quot;Guest authorship&quot; is the phenomenon wherein authorship is given to someone who has not made any substantial contribution. This can be done by senior researchers who muscle their way onto the papers of inexperienced junior researchers as well as others that stack authorship in an effort to guarantee publication. This is much harder to prove due to a lack of consistency in defining &quot;authorship&quot; or &quot;substantial contribution&quot;.
* Scientific misconduct can also occur during the peer-review process by a reviewer or editor with a conflict of interest. Reviewer-coerced citation can also inflate the perceived citation impact of a researcher&#x27;s work and their reputation in the scientific community, similar to excessive self-citation. Reviewers are expected to be impartial and assess the quality of their work. They are expected to declare a conflict of interest to the editors if they are colleagues or competitors of the authors. A rarer case of scientific misconduct is editorial misconduct, where an editor does not declare conflicts of interest, creates pseudonyms to review papers, gives strongly worded editorial decisions to support reviews suggesting to add excessive citations to their own unrelated works or to add themselves as a co-author or their name to the title of the manuscript.
* Publishing in a predatory journal, knowingly or unknowingly, was discussed as a form of potential scientific misconduct.
* The peer-review process can have limitations when considering research outside the conventional scientific paradigm: social factors such as &quot;groupthink&quot; can interfere with open and fair deliberation of new research.
* &quot;Sneaked references&quot; is the act of subtly embedding references that are not present in a manuscript in the metadata of this accepted manuscript without the original authors being capable of noticing or correcting such modifications. 

=== Photo manipulation ===
Compared to other forms of scientific misconduct, image fraud (manipulation of images to distort their meaning) is of particular interest since it can frequently be detected by external parties. In 2006, the &quot;Journal of Cell Biology&quot; gained publicity for instituting tests to detect photo manipulation in papers that were being considered for publication. This was in response to the increased usage of programs such as Adobe Photoshop by scientists, which facilitate photo manipulation. Since then more publishers, including the Nature Publishing Group, have instituted similar tests and require authors to minimize and specify the extent of photo manipulation when a manuscript is submitted for publication. However, there is little evidence to indicate that such tests are applied rigorously. One &quot;Nature&quot; paper published in 2009 has subsequently been reported to contain around 20 separate instances of image fraud.

Although the type of manipulation that is allowed can depend greatly on the type of experiment that is presented and also differ from one journal to another, in general the following manipulations are not allowed:
* splicing together different images to represent a single experiment
* changing brightness and contrast of only a part of the image
* any change that conceals information, even when it is considered to be non-specific, which includes:
** changing brightness and contrast to leave only the most intense signal
** using clone tools to hide information
* showing only a very small part of the photograph so that additional information is not visible

Image manipulations are typically done on visually repetitive images such as those of blots and microscope images.

==Responsibilities==
===Authorship responsibility===
All authors of a scientific publication are expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted to academic journals for publication.

Simultaneous submission of scientific findings to more than one journal or duplicate publication of findings is usually regarded as misconduct, under what is known as the Ingelfinger rule, named after the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine 1967–1977, Franz Ingelfinger.

Guest authorship (where there is stated authorship in the absence of involvement, also known as gift authorship) and ghost authorship (where the real author is not listed as an author) are commonly regarded as forms of research misconduct. In some cases coauthors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of Gerald Schatten who co-authored with Hwang Woo-Suk, the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce, (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce&#x27;s deception) – and the coauthors with Jan Hendrik Schön at Bell Laboratories. More recent cases include that of Charles Nemeroff, then the editor-in-chief of &quot;Neuropsychopharmacology&quot;, and a well-documented case involving the drug Actonel.

Authors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. The failure to keep data may be regarded as misconduct. Some scientific journals require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors might have commercial or non-commercial conflicts of interest. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about ethical aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies.

=== Research institution responsibility ===
In general, defining whether an individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual&#x27;s employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, the more likely it is that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.

Well publicised cases illustrate the potential role that senior academics in research institutions play in concealing scientific misconduct. A King&#x27;s College (London) internal investigation showed research findings from one of their researchers to be &#x27;at best unreliable, and in many cases spurious&#x27; but the college took no action, such as retracting relevant published research or preventing further episodes from occurring.

In a more recent case an internal investigation at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune determined that there was evidence of misconduct by Gopal Kundu, but an external committee was then organised which dismissed the allegation, and the NCCS issued a memorandum exonerating the authors of all charges of misconduct. Undeterred by the NCCS exoneration, the relevant journal (&quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;) withdrew the paper based on its own analysis.

===Scientific peer responsibility===
Some academics believe that scientific colleagues who suspect scientific misconduct should consider taking informal action themselves, or reporting their concerns. This question is of great importance since much research suggests that it is very difficult for people to act or come forward when they see unacceptable behavior, unless they have help from their organizations. A &quot;User-friendly Guide&quot; and the existence of a confidential organizational ombudsman may help people who are uncertain about what to do, or afraid of bad consequences for their speaking up.

===Responsibility of journals===
Journals are responsible for safeguarding the research record and hence have a critical role in dealing with suspected misconduct. This is recognised by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), which has issued clear guidelines on the form (e.g. retraction) that concerns over the research record should take.
* The COPE guidelines state that journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error). Retraction is also appropriate in cases of redundant publication, plagiarism and unethical research.
* Journal editors should consider issuing an expression of concern if they receive inconclusive evidence of research or publication misconduct by the authors, there is evidence that the findings are unreliable but the authors&#x27; institution will not investigate the case, they believe that an investigation into alleged misconduct related to the publication either has not been, or would not be, fair and impartial or conclusive, or an investigation is underway but a judgement will not be available for a considerable time.
* Journal editors should consider issuing a correction if a small portion of an otherwise reliable publication proves to be misleading (especially because of honest error), or the author / contributor list is incorrect (i.e. a deserving author has been omitted or somebody who does not meet authorship criteria has been included).

Evidence emerged in 2012 that journals learning of cases where there is strong evidence of possible misconduct, with issues potentially affecting a large portion of the findings, frequently fail to issue an expression of concern or correspond with the host institution so that an investigation can be undertaken. In one case, &quot;Nature&quot; allowed a corrigendum to be published despite clear evidence of image fraud. Subsequent retraction of the paper required the actions of an independent whistleblower.

The cases of Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii in anaesthesiology focussed attention on the role that journals play in perpetuating scientific fraud as well as how they can deal with it. In the Boldt case, the editors-in-chief of 18 specialist journals (generally anesthesia and intensive care) made a joint statement regarding 88 published clinical trials conducted without Ethics Committee approval. In the Fujii case, involving nearly 200 papers, the journal &quot;Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia&quot;, which published 24 of Fujii&#x27;s papers, has accepted that its handling of the issue was inadequate. Following publication of a letter to the editor from Kranke and colleagues in April 2000, along with a non-specific response from Dr. Fujii, there was no follow-up on the allegation of data manipulation and no request for an institutional review of Dr. Fujii&#x27;s research. &quot;Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia&quot; went on to publish 11 additional manuscripts by Dr. Fujii following the 2000 allegations of research fraud, with Editor Steven Shafer stating in March 2012 that subsequent submissions to the journal by Dr. Fujii should not have been published without first vetting the allegations of fraud. In April 2012 Shafer led a group of editors to write a joint statement, in the form of an ultimatum made available to the public, to a large number of academic institutions where Fujii had been employed, offering these institutions the chance to attest to the integrity of the bulk of the allegedly fraudulent papers.

==Consequences of scientific misconduct==
===Consequences for science===
The consequences of scientific fraud vary based on the severity of the fraud, the level of notice it receives, and how long it goes undetected. For cases of fabricated evidence, the consequences can be wide-ranging, with others working to confirm (or refute) the false finding, or with research agendas being distorted to address the fraudulent evidence. The Piltdown Man fraud is a case in point: The significance of the bona-fide fossils that were being found was muted for decades because they disagreed with Piltdown Man and the preconceived notions that those faked fossils supported. In addition, the prominent paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward spent time at Piltdown each year until he died, trying to find more Piltdown Man remains. The misdirection of resources kept others from taking the real fossils more seriously and delayed the reaching of a correct understanding of human evolution. (The Taung Child, which should have been the death knell for the view that the human brain evolved first, was instead treated very critically because of its disagreement with the Piltdown Man evidence.)

In the case of Prof. Don Poldermans, the misconduct occurred in reports of trials of treatment to prevent death and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing operations. The trial reports were relied upon to issue guidelines that applied for many years across North America and Europe.

In the case of Dr Alfred Steinschneider, two decades and tens of millions of research dollars were lost trying to find the elusive link between infant sleep apnea, which Steinschneider said he had observed and recorded in his laboratory, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), of which he stated it was a precursor. The cover was blown in 1994, 22 years after Steinschneider&#x27;s 1972 &quot;Pediatrics&quot; paper claiming such an association, when Waneta Hoyt, the mother of the patients in the paper, was arrested, indicted and convicted on five counts of second-degree murder for the smothering deaths of her five children. While that in itself was bad enough, the paper, presumably written as an attempt to save infants&#x27; lives, ironically was ultimately used as a defense by parents suspected in multiple deaths of their own children in cases of Münchausen syndrome by proxy. The 1972 &quot;Pediatrics&quot; paper was cited in 404 papers in the interim and is still listed on PubMed without comment.

===Consequences for those who expose misconduct===
The potentially severe consequences for individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research. This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct. Persons who expose such cases, commonly called whistleblowers, find themselves open to retaliation by a number of different means. These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters – designed to protect those who raise concerns (&quot;for more details refer to retaliation (law)&quot;).

===Regulatory Violations and Consequences &quot;(example)&quot;===
Title 10 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 50.5, Deliberate Misconduct of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations, addresses the prohibition of certain activities by individual involved in NRC-licensed activities. 10 CFR 50.5 is designed to ensure the safety and integrity of nuclear operations. 10 CFR Part 50.9, Completeness and Accuracy of Information, focuses on the requirements for providing information and data to the NRC. The intent of 10 CFR 50.5 is to deter and penalize intentional wrongdoing (i.e., violations). 10 CFR 50.9 is crucial in maintaining transparency and reliability in the nuclear industry, which effectively emphasizes honesty and integrity in maintaining the safety and security of nuclear operations. Providing false or misleading information or data to the NRC is therefore a violation of 10 CFR 50.9.

Violation of any of these rules can lead to severe penalties, including termination, fines and criminal prosecution. It can also result in the revocation of licenses or certifications, thereby barring individuals or entities from participating in any NRC-licensed activities in the future.

==Data issues==
===Exposure of fraudulent data===
With the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of plagiarism and multiple publication within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Dr. Harold Garner&#x27;s laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas is Déjà vu, an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication. All of the entries in the database were discovered through the use of text data mining algorithm eTBLAST, also created in Dr. Garner&#x27;s laboratory. The creation of Déjà vu and the subsequent classification of several hundred articles contained therein have ignited much discussion in the scientific community concerning issues such as ethical behavior, journal standards, and intellectual copyright. Studies within this database have been published in journals such as &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;, among others.

Other tools which may be used to detect fraudulent data include error analysis. Measurements generally have a small amount of error, and repeated measurements of the same item will generally result in slight differences in readings. These differences can be analyzed, and follow certain known mathematical and statistical properties. Should a set of data appear to be too faithful to the hypothesis, i.e., the amount of error that would normally be in such measurements does not appear, a conclusion can be drawn that the data may have been forged. Error analysis alone is typically not sufficient to prove that data have been falsified or fabricated, but it may provide the supporting evidence necessary to confirm suspicions of misconduct.

===Data sharing===
Kirby Lee and Lisa Bero suggest, &quot;Although reviewing raw data can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, having such a policy would hold authors more accountable for the accuracy of their data and potentially reduce scientific fraud or misconduct.&quot;

== Underreporting ==
The vast majority of cases of scientific misconduct may not be reported. The number of article retractions in 2022 was nearly 5,500, but Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus, co-founders of &quot;Retraction Watch&quot;, estimate that at least 100,000 retractions should occur every year, with only about one in five being due to &quot;honest error&quot;.

== Some notable cases ==

In 1998 Andrew Wakefield published a fraudulent research paper in &quot;The Lancet&quot; claiming links between the MMR vaccine, autism, and inflammatory bowel disease. In 2010, he was found guilty of dishonesty in his research and banned from medicine by the UK General Medical Council following an investigation by Brian Deer of the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. 

The claims in Wakefield&#x27;s paper were widely reported, leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland and outbreaks of mumps and measles. Promotion of the claimed link continues to fuel the anti-vaccination movement.

In 2011 Diederik Stapel, a highly regarded Dutch social psychologist was discovered to have fabricated data in dozens of studies on human behaviour. He has been called &quot;the biggest con man in academic science&quot;.

In 2020, Sapan Desai and his coauthors published two papers in the prestigious medical journals &quot;The Lancet&quot; and &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The papers were based on a very large dataset published by Surgisphere, a company owned by Desai. The dataset was exposed as a fabrication, and the papers were soon retracted.

In 2024, Eliezer Masliah, head of the Division of Neuroscience at the National Institute on Aging, was suspected of having manipulated and inappropriately reused images in over 100 scientific papers spanning several decades, including those that were used by the FDA to greenlight testing for the experimental drug prasinezumab as a treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s.

== Solutions ==

=== Changing research assessment ===
Since 2012, the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), from San Francisco, gathered many institutions, publishers, and individuals committing to improving the metrics used to assess research and to stop focusing on the journal impact factor.

<text>Set (stylized as SET or SET!) is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple). Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with three striped green diamonds) appears as a card precisely &quot;once&quot; in the deck.

== Gameplay ==
In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a &quot;set&quot;. For each one of the four categories of features—color, number, shape, and shading—the three cards must display that feature as either a) all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature the three cards must &quot;avoid&quot; having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version.

For example, 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid green squiggles, and 1 solid purple oval form a set, because the shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the shapes among the three cards are all different.

For any set, the number of features that are constant (the same on all three cards) and the number of features that differ (different on all three cards) may break down as: all 4 features differing; or 1 feature being constant and 3 differing; or 2 constant and 2 differing; or 3 constant and 1 differing. (All 4 features being constant would imply that the three cards in the set are identical, which is impossible since no cards in the Set deck are identical.)

== History ==
The game evolved out of a coding system that the designer used in her job as a geneticist. The shapes are based on those in ISO 5807. &quot;Set&quot; won American Mensa&#x27;s &quot;Mensa Select&quot; award in 1991 and placed 9th in the 1995 &quot;Deutscher Spiele Preis&quot;.

== Games ==
Several games can be played with these cards, all involving the concept of a &quot;set&quot;. A set consists of three cards satisfying &quot;all&quot; of these conditions:
* They all have the same number or have three different numbers.
* They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.
* They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.
* They all have the same color or have three different colors.

The rules of &quot;Set&quot; are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into &quot;two of ____ and one of ____&quot;, then it is not a set.

For example, these three cards form a set:
* One red striped diamond
* Two red solid diamonds
* Three red open diamonds

Given any two cards from the deck, there is one and only one other card that forms a set with them.

In the standard &quot;Set&quot; game, the dealer lays out cards on the table until either twelve are laid down or someone sees a set and calls &quot;Set!&quot;. The player who called &quot;Set&quot; takes the cards in the set, and the dealer continues to deal out cards until twelve are on the table. A player who sees a set among the twelve cards calls &quot;Set&quot; and takes the three cards, and the dealer lays three more cards on the table. (To call out &quot;set&quot; and not pick one up quickly enough results in a penalty.) There may be no set among the twelve cards; in this case, the dealer deals out three more cards to make fifteen dealt cards, or eighteen or more, as necessary. This process of dealing by threes and finding sets continues until the deck is exhausted and there are no more sets on the table. At this point, whoever has collected the most sets wins.

Variants were included with the Set game that involve different mechanics to find sets, as well as different player interaction. Additional variants continue to be created by avid players of the game.

== Basic combinatorics of &quot;Set&quot; ==

* Given any two cards, there is exactly one card that forms a set with those two cards. Therefore, the probability of producing a Set from 3 randomly drawn cards from a complete deck is 1/79.
* A cap set is a mathematical structure describing a Set layout in which no set may be taken. The largest group of cards that can be put together without creating a set is 20, proven in 1971 (cap sets were studied before the game). Such a group is called a maximal cap set . Donald Knuth found in 2001 that there are 682344 such cap sets of size 20 for the 81-card version of Set; under affine transformations on 4-dimensional finite space, they all reduce to essentially one cap set.
* There are formula_1 unique sets.
* The probability that a set will have formula_2 features different and formula_3 features the same is formula_4. (Note: The case where &quot;d&quot; = 0 is impossible, since no two cards are identical.) Thus, 10% of possible sets differ in one feature, 30% in two features, 40% in three features, and 20% in all four features.

* The number of different 12-card deals is formula_5.
* The odds against there being no &quot;Set&quot; in 12 cards when playing a game of Set start off at 30:1 for the first round. Then they quickly fall, and after about the 4th round they are 14:1 and for the next 20 rounds, they slowly fall towards 13:1. So for most of the rounds played, the odds are between 14:1 and 13:1.
* The odds against there being no Set in 15 cards &quot;when playing a game&quot; are 88:1. (This is different from the odds against there being no Set in &quot;any&quot; 15 cards (which is 2700:1) since during play, 15 cards are only shown when a group of 12 cards has no Set.)
* Around 30% of all games always have a Set among the 12 cards, and thus never need to go to 15 cards.
* The maximum number of Sets for 12 cards is 14.
* The average number of available Sets among 12 cards is formula_6 and among 15 cards formula_7. However, in play the numbers are smaller.
* If there were 26 sets picked from the deck, the last three cards would necessarily form another 27th set.

== Complexity ==
Using a natural generalization of &quot;Set&quot;, where the number of properties and values vary, it was shown that determining whether a set exists from a collection of dealt cards is NP-complete.

<text>The Silver Star Medal (SSM) is the United States Armed Forces&#x27; third-highest military decoration for valor in combat. The Silver Star Medal is awarded primarily to members of the United States Armed Forces for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States.

==History==
The Silver Star Medal (SSM) is the successor award to the Citation Star which was established by an Act of Congress on 9 July 1918, during World War I. On 19 July 1932, the Secretary of War approved the conversion of the Citation Star to the SSM with the original Citation Star incorporated into the center of the medal.

Authorization for the Silver Star Medal was placed into law by an Act of Congress for the U.S. Navy on 7 August 1942, and an Act of Congress for the U.S. Army on 15 December 1942. The current statutory authorization for the medal is Title 10 of the United States Code, for the U.S. Army, for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, and for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force.

The U.S. Army awards the medal as the &quot;Silver Star&quot;. The U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard award the medal as the &quot;Silver Star Medal&quot;. Since 21 December 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) refers to the decoration as the &quot;Silver Star Medal&quot;.

==Award criteria==
The Silver Star Medal is awarded for gallantry, so long as the action does not justify the award of one of the next higher valor awards: the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, the Air Force Cross, or the Coast Guard Cross. The gallantry displayed must have taken place while in action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

The Silver Star Medal is awarded for singular acts of valor or heroism over a brief period, such as one or two days of a battle.

Air Force pilots and combat systems officers and Navy/Marine Corps naval aviators and flight officers flying fighter aircraft, are often considered eligible to receive the Silver Star upon becoming an ace (i.e., having five or more confirmed aerial kills), which entails the pilot and, in multi-seat fighters, the weapons system officer or radar intercept officer, intentionally and successfully risking his life multiple times under combat conditions and emerging victorious. However, during the Vietnam War, the last conflict to produce U.S. fighter aces: an Air Force pilot and two navigators/weapon systems officers (who were later retrained as Air Force pilots), a naval aviator and a naval flight officer/radar intercept officer who had achieved this distinction, were eventually awarded the Air Force Cross and Navy Cross, respectively, in addition to SSMs previously awarded for earlier aerial kills.

;Unit award equivalent
* Air Force – Gallant Unit Citation
* Army – Valorous Unit Award
* Coast Guard – Coast Guard Unit Commendation
* Navy-Marine Corps – Navy Unit Commendation

==Appearance==
The Silver Star Medal is a gold five-pointed star, in circumscribing diameter with a laurel wreath encircling rays from the center and a diameter silver star superimposed in the center. The pendant is suspended from a rectangular shaped metal loop with rounded corners. The reverse has the inscription &quot;FOR GALLANTRY IN ACTION&quot;. The ribbon is wide and consists of the following stripes: Old Glory red (center stripe); proceeding outward in pairs white; ultramarine blue; white; and ultramarine blue.

;Ribbon devices
Second and subsequent awards of the Silver Star Medal are denoted by bronze or silver oak leaf clusters in the Army and Air Force and by gold or silver inch stars in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.

==Recipients==

The Department of Defense does not keep extensive records for the Silver Star Medal. Independent groups estimate that between 100,000 and 150,000 SSMs have been awarded since the decoration was established. Colonel David Hackworth who was awarded ten SSMs while serving in the Army during the Korean War and Vietnam War, is likely to be the person awarded the most SSMs. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was awarded seven SSMs for his service in France in World War I from February to November 1918 as a colonel and then brigadier general. Donald H. Russell, a civilian Vought F4U Corsair technical support engineer attached to a Marine Corps fighter wing, received the SSM for his actions aboard after the carrier was attacked by a Japanese dive bomber in March 1945. In the fall of 1944, President Roosevelt&#x27;s close adviser Harry Hopkins, the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow W. Averell Harriman and a military attaché presented the SSM to Soviet Red Army artillery officer Alexei Voloshin, who was the first to cross the Dnieper with his battery and was one of four junior Red Army officers who received the award.

===Female recipients===
Three Army nurses that served in World War I were cited in 1919 and 1920 with Citation Stars for gallantry in attending to the wounded while under artillery fire in July 1918. In 2007, it was discovered that they had never been awarded their Citation Stars. The three nurses (Army nurses served without rank until 1920) were awarded the Silver Star Medal posthumously:
* Jane Rignel – Mobile Hospital No. 2, 42nd Division, for gallantry in &quot;giving aid to the wounded under heavy fire&quot; in France on 15 July 1918
* Linnie Leckrone – Shock Team No. 134, Field Hospital No. 127, 32nd Division, for gallantry while &quot;attending to the wounded during an artillery bombardment&quot; in France on 29 July 1918
* Irene Robar – Shock Team No. 134, Field Hospital No. 127, 32nd Division, for gallantry while &quot;attending to the wounded during an artillery bombardment&quot; in France on 29 July 1918

An unknown number of servicewomen received the award in World War II. Four Army nurses serving in Italy during the war—First Lieutenant Mary Roberts, Second Lieutenant Elaine Roe, Second Lieutenant Rita Virginia Rourke, and Second Lieutenant Ellen Ainsworth (posthumous)—became the first women recipients of the Silver Star, all cited for their bravery in evacuating the 33rd Field Hospital at Anzio on 10 February 1944. Later that same year, Corporal Maggie Leones, a Filipino who later immigrated to the United States, received the medal for clandestine activities on Luzon; , she is the only female Asian to receive a Silver Star.

The next known servicewomen to receive the Silver Star were Army National Guard Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester in 2005, for gallantry during an insurgent ambush on a convoy in Iraq and Army Specialist Monica Lin Brown in March 2008, for extraordinary heroism as a combat medic in the War in Afghanistan.

On November 12, 2024, Capt Lacie “Sonic” Hester, 494th Fighter Squadron, became the first woman airman awarded the Silver Star for her role in the shootdown of more than 80 Iranian drones launched at Israeli cities.

<text>The Single UNIX Specification (SUS) is a standard for computer operating systems, compliance with which is required to qualify for using the &quot;UNIX&quot; trademark. The standard specifies programming interfaces for the C language, a command-line shell, and user commands. The core specifications of the SUS known as &quot;Base Specifications&quot; are developed and maintained by the Austin Group, which is a joint working group of IEEE, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 15 and The Open Group. If an operating system is submitted to The Open Group for certification and passes conformance tests, then it is deemed to be compliant with a UNIX standard such as UNIX 98 or UNIX 03.

Very few BSD and Linux-based operating systems are submitted for compliance with the Single UNIX Specification, although system developers generally aim for compliance with POSIX standards, which form the core of the Single UNIX Specification.

The latest SUS consists of two parts: the &quot;base specifications&quot; technically identical to POSIX, and the X/Open Curses specification.

Some parts of the SUS are optional.

==History==

===1980s: Motivation===
The SUS emerged from multiple 1980s efforts to standardize operating system interfaces for software designed for variants of the Unix operating system. The need for standardization arose because enterprises using computers wanted to be able to develop programs that could be used on the computer systems of different manufacturers without reimplementing the programs. Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface partly because it was manufacturer-neutral.

In 1984, the UNIX user group called /usr/group published the results of their standardization effort for programming interfaces in their 1984 /usr/group standard, which became basis for what would become the POSIX.1-1988 standard.

In 1985, AT&amp;T published System V Interface Definition (SVID), a specification of UNIX System V programming interfaces.

===1988: POSIX===
In 1988, standardization efforts resulted in IEEE 1003 (also registered as ISO/IEC 9945), or POSIX.1-1988, which loosely stands for Portable Operating System Interface.

===1980s and 1990s: X/Open Portability Guide===
The X/Open Portability Guide (XPG) was a precursor to the SUS, published by the X/Open Company, a consortium of companies established in 1984. The guides were published in the following years. 
* XPG1: X/Open Portability Guide Issue 1: 1985
* XPG2: X/Open Portability Guide Issue 2: 1987
* XPG3: X/Open Portability Guide Issue 3: 1989
* XPG4: X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4: 1992

XPG4 Base included the following documents:
* System Interface Definitions, Issue 4, 
* System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 4, 
* Commands and Utilities, Issue 4, 

===1990s: Spec 1170===
In the early 1990s, a separate effort known as the Common API Specification or Spec 1170 was initiated by several major vendors, who formed the COSE alliance in the wake of the Unix wars. In 1993, Spec 1170 was assigned by COSE to X/Open for fasttrack. In October 1993, a planned transfer of UNIX trademark from Novell to X/Open was announced; it was finalized in 2nd quarter of 1994. Spec 1170 would eventually become the Single Unix Specification.

===1994: Single UNIX Specification===
In 1994, the X/Open Company released the Single UNIX Specification. The SUS was made up of documents that were part of the X/Open Common Applications Environment (CAE):
* System Interface Definitions, Issue 4, Version 2
* System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 4, Version 2
* Commands and Utilities, Issue 4, Version 2
* Networking Services, Issue 4

This was a repackaging of the X/Open Portability Guide (XPG), Issue 4, Version 2.

Sources differ on whether X/Open Curses, Issue 4, Version 2 was part of this SUS; its copyright date is given as 1996. X/Open Curses, Issue 4 was published in 1995.

In October 1994, X/Open indicated they were going to refer to Spec 1170 as &#x27;&quot;Single-Unix&quot; specification&#x27;.

The SUS was at the core of the UNIX 95 brand.

This version had 1168 programming interfaces.

This version of SUS was drawn from the following sources:
* XPG4 Base by X/Open
* System V Interface Definition, (SVID) Edition 3, Level 1 calls by AT&amp;T
* Application Environment Specification (AES) by the Open Software Foundation (OSF)
* Interfaces found in common use and not yet covered by a formal specification, drawn from a survey of major applications.

===1997: Single UNIX Specification, version 2===
In 1996, X/Open merged with Open Software Foundation (OSF) to form The Open Group.

In 1997, the Open Group released the Single UNIX Specification, Version 2.

This specification consisted of:
* System Interface Definitions, Issue 5,
* System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 5,
* Commands and Utilities, Issue 5,
* Networking Services, Issue 5,
* X/Open Curses, Issue 4, Version 2,
and was at the core of the UNIX 98 brand.

This version had 1434 programming interfaces.

===2001: Single UNIX Specification, version 3, POSIX.1-2001===
Beginning in 1998, a joint working group of IEEE, ISO JTC 1 SC22 and The Open Group known as the Austin Group began to develop the combined standard that would be known as the core of Single UNIX Specification, Version 3 and as POSIX.1-2001. It was released on January 30, 2002.

This SUS consisted of:
* Base Specifications, Issue 6
** Base Definitions, Issue 6
** System Interfaces, Issue 6
** Shell and Utilities, Issue 6
** Rationale (Informative)
* X/Open Curses, Issue 4, Version 2
and is at the core of the UNIX 03 brand.

The Base Specifications are technically identical to POSIX.1-2001, which is IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

This version had 1742 programming interfaces.

An authorized guide is available for the version.

====2004 Edition====
In 2004, a new edition of the POSIX.1-2001 standard was released, incorporating two technical corrigenda. It is called IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition. Some informally call it POSIX.1-2004, but this is not an official identification.

===2008: Single UNIX Specification, version 4, POSIX.1-2008===
In December 2008, the Austin Group published a new major revision of SUS and POSIX. This is the Single UNIX Specification, Version 4 (SUSv4).

This SUS consists of:
* Base Specifications, Issue 7
** Base Definitions, Issue 7
** System Interfaces, Issue 7
** Shell and Utilities, Issue 7
** Rationale, Issue 7, (Informative) 
* X/Open Curses, Issue 7 

The Base Specifications are technically identical to POSIX.1-2008, which is IEEE Std 1003.1-2008.

This version had 1833 interfaces, of which 1191 were in the System Interfaces section.

====2013 Edition====
Technical Corrigendum 1 mostly targeted internationalization, and also introduced a role-based access model. A trademark &quot;UNIX V7&quot; (not to be confused with V7 UNIX, the version of Research Unix from 1979) was created to mark compliance with SUS Version 4.

====2016 Edition====
Technical Corrigendum 2 was published in September 2016, leading into &quot;IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition&quot; and &quot;Single UNIX Specification, Version 4, 2016 Edition&quot;.

====2018 Edition, POSIX.1-2017====
In January 2018, an &quot;administrative rollup&quot; edition was released. It incorporates Single UNIX Specification version 4 TC1 and TC2, and is technically identical to the 2016 edition.

The Base Specifications are technically identical to POSIX.1-2017, which is IEEE Std 1003.1-2017.

==Specification==
SUSv3 totals some 3700 pages, which are divided into four main parts:

* Base Definitions (XBD) - a list of definitions and conventions used in the specifications and a list of C header files which must be provided by compliant systems. 84 header files in total are provided.
* Shell and Utilities (XCU) - a list of utilities and a description of the shell, sh. 160 utilities in total are specified.
* System Interfaces (XSH) - contains the specification of various functions which are implemented as system calls or library functions. 1123 system interfaces in total are specified.
* Rationale (XRAT) - the explanation behind the standard.

The standard user command line and scripting interface is the POSIX shell, an extension of the Bourne Shell based on an early version of the Korn Shell. Other user-level programs, services and utilities include awk, echo, ed, vi, and hundreds of others. Required program-level services include basic I/O (file, terminal, and network) services. A test suite accompanies the standard. It is called PCTS or the POSIX Certification Test Suite.

Additionally, SUS includes CURSES (XCURSES) specification, which specifies 372 functions and 3 header files. All in all, SUSv3 specifies 1742 interfaces.

Note that a system need not include source code derived in any way from AT&amp;T Unix to meet the specification. For instance, IBM OS/390, now z/OS, qualifies as UNIX despite having no code in common.

==Marks for compliant systems==

There are five official marks for conforming systems:
* UNIX 93
* UNIX 95 - the mark for systems conforming to version 1 of the SUS
* UNIX 98 - the mark for systems conforming to version 2 of the SUS
* UNIX 03 - the mark for systems conforming to version 3 of the SUS
* UNIX V7 - the mark for systems conforming to version 4 of the SUS (including Corrigenda)

==Compliance==

===Currently registered UNIX systems===

===Previously registered UNIX systems===

====EulerOS====
EulerOS 2.0 for the x86-64 architecture was registered as UNIX 03 compliant. The UNIX 03 conformance statement shows that the standard C compiler is from the GNU Compiler Collection (), and that the system is a Linux distribution of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux family. The UNIX 03 certification expired in September 2022 and has not been renewed.

====FTX====
Stratus Technologies DNCP Series servers running FTX Release 3 were registered as UNIX 93 compliant.

====Inspur K-UX====
Inspur K-UX 2.0 and 3.0 for the x86-64 architecture were certified as UNIX 03 compliant. The UNIX 03 conformance statement for Inspur K-UX 2.0 and 3.0 shows that the standard C compiler is from the GNU Compiler Collection (), and that the system is a Linux distribution of the Red Hat family.

====IRIX====

SGI IRIX 6.5 was registered as UNIX 95 compliant.

====OS/390====
IBM OS/390 was registered as UNIX 95 compliant beginning with the V2R4 release.

====Reliant UNIX====
The last Reliant UNIX versions were registered as UNIX 95 compliant (XPG4 hard branding).

====Solaris====
Solaris 11.4 was previously registered as UNIX v7 compliant in 2018. Solaris 11 and Solaris 10 were registered as UNIX 03 compliant on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 (X86-64) and SPARC systems. Solaris 8 and 9 were registered as UNIX 98 compliant on 32-bit x86 and SPARC systems; 64-bit x86 systems were not supported. Solaris 2.4 and 2.6, on both x86 and SPARC, were certified to the UNIX 93 and UNIX 95 marks respectively.

Solaris 2.5.1 was also registered as UNIX 95 compliant on the PReP PowerPC platform in 1996, but the product was withdrawn before more than a few dozen copies had been sold.

====Tru64 UNIX====
Tru64 UNIX V5.1A and later were registered as UNIX 98 compliant.

====Other====
Other operating systems previously registered as UNIX 95 or UNIX 93 compliant:
*NCR UNIX SVR4
*NEC UX/4800

===Non-registered Unix-like systems===
Developers and vendors of Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and MINIX typically do not certify their distributions and do not install full POSIX utilities by default.

For Linux, pax command is usually not installed; furthermore, pax command packages available for Linux often lack pax file format support required by POSIX. Sometimes, SUS compliance can be improved by installing additional packages, but very few Linux systems can be configured to be completely conformant. The Linux Standard Base was formed in 2001 as an attempt to standardize the internal structures of Linux-based systems for increased compatibility. It is based on the POSIX specifications, the Single UNIX Specification, and other open standards, and also extends them in several areas; but there are some conflicts between the LSB and the POSIX standards. Few Linux distributions actually go through certification as LSB compliant.

Darwin, the open source subset of macOS, has behavior that can be set to comply with UNIX 03. Darwin uses a 4.4BSD-derived pax command, which lacks multibyte support for filenames.

FreeBSD previously had a &quot;C99 and POSIX Conformance Project&quot; which aimed for compliance with a subset of the Single UNIX Specification, and documentation where there were differences. FreeBSD pax command, derived from 4.4BSD, does not fully support pax file format. pax and ustar in-archive format use the same with slightly different defaults (5120 block size vs 10240 block size); however, FreeBSD&#x27;s pax lacks the extended PAX headers used for extended character set support. FreeBSD man pages sometimes indicate deviations from POSIX and thus SUS in their STANDARDS sections.

OpenBSD man pages sometimes indicate deviations from POSIX and thus SUS in their STANDARDS sections.

MINIX pax command does not support pax file format and thereby fails POSIX.1-2001.

<text>The Scientific Revolution was a series of events that marked the emergence of modern science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature. The Scientific Revolution took place in Europe in the second half of the Renaissance period, with the 1543 Nicolaus Copernicus publication &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot;) often cited as its beginning. The Scientific Revolution has been called &quot;the most important transformation in human history&quot; since the Neolithic Revolution.

The era of the Scientific Renaissance focused to some degree on recovering the knowledge of the ancients and is considered to have culminated in Isaac Newton&#x27;s 1687 publication &quot;Principia&quot; which formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, thereby completing the synthesis of a new cosmology. The subsequent Age of Enlightenment saw the concept of a scientific revolution emerge in the 18th-century work of Jean Sylvain Bailly, who described a two-stage process of sweeping away the old and establishing the new. There continues to be scholarly engagement regarding the boundaries of the Scientific Revolution and its chronology.

==Introduction==
Great advances in science have been termed &quot;revolutions&quot; since the 18th century. For example, in 1747, the French mathematician Alexis Clairaut wrote that &quot;Newton was said in his own life to have created a revolution&quot;. The word was also used in the preface to Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s 1789 work announcing the discovery of oxygen. &quot;Few revolutions in science have immediately excited so much general notice as the introduction of the theory of oxygen ... Lavoisier saw his theory accepted by all the most eminent men of his time, and established over a great part of Europe within a few years from its first promulgation.&quot;

In the 19th century, William Whewell described the revolution in science itself – the scientific method – that had taken place in the 15th–16th century. &quot;Among the most conspicuous of the revolutions which opinions on this subject have undergone, is the transition from an implicit trust in the internal powers of man&#x27;s mind to a professed dependence upon external observation; and from an unbounded reverence for the wisdom of the past, to a fervid expectation of change and improvement.&quot; This gave rise to the common view of the Scientific Revolution today:


The Scientific Revolution is traditionally assumed to start with the Copernican Revolution (initiated in 1543) and to be complete in the &quot;grand synthesis&quot; of Isaac Newton&#x27;s 1687 &quot;Principia&quot;. Much of the change of attitude came from Francis Bacon whose &quot;confident and emphatic announcement&quot; in the modern progress of science inspired the creation of scientific societies such as the Royal Society, and Galileo who championed Copernicus and developed the science of motion.

The Scientific Revolution was enabled by advances in book production. Before the advent of the printing press, introduced in Europe in the 1440s by Johannes Gutenberg, there was no mass market on the continent for scientific treatises, as there had been for religious books. Printing decisively changed the way scientific knowledge was created, as well as how it was disseminated. It enabled accurate diagrams, maps, anatomical drawings, and representations of flora and fauna to be reproduced, and printing made scholarly books more widely accessible, allowing researchers to consult ancient texts freely and to compare their own observations with those of fellow scholars. Although printers&#x27; blunders still often resulted in the spread of false data (for instance, in Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; (The Starry Messenger), published in Venice in 1610, his telescopic images of the lunar surface mistakenly appeared back to front), the development of engraved metal plates allowed accurate visual information to be made permanent, a change from previously, when woodcut illustrations deteriorated through repetitive use. The ability to access previous scientific research meant that researchers did not have to always start from scratch in making sense of their own observational data.

In the 20th century, Alexandre Koyré introduced the term &quot;scientific revolution&quot;, centering his analysis on Galileo. The term was popularized by Herbert Butterfield in his &quot;Origins of Modern Science&quot;. Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s 1962 work &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; emphasizes that different theoretical frameworks—such as Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity and Newton&#x27;s theory of gravity, which it replaced—cannot be directly compared without meaning loss.

===Significance===
The period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across mathematics, physics, astronomy, and biology in institutions supporting scientific investigation and in the more widely held picture of the universe. The Scientific Revolution led to the establishment of several modern sciences. In 1984, Joseph Ben-David wrote:

Many contemporary writers and modern historians claim that there was a revolutionary change in world view. In 1611 English poet John Donne wrote:
Butterfield was less disconcerted but nevertheless saw the change as fundamental:
Historian Peter Harrison attributes Christianity to having contributed to the rise of the Scientific Revolution:
==Ancient and medieval background==

The Scientific Revolution was built upon the foundation of ancient Greek learning and science in the Middle Ages, as it had been elaborated and further developed by Roman/Byzantine science and medieval Islamic science. Some scholars have noted a direct tie between &quot;particular aspects of traditional Christianity&quot; and the rise of science. The &quot;Aristotelian tradition&quot; was still an important intellectual framework in the 17th century, although by that time natural philosophers had moved away from much of it. Key scientific ideas dating back to classical antiquity had changed drastically over the years and in many cases had been discredited. The ideas that remained, which were transformed fundamentally during the Scientific Revolution, include:
* Aristotle&#x27;s cosmology that placed the Earth at the center of a spherical hierarchic cosmos. The terrestrial and celestial regions were made up of different elements which had different kinds of &quot;natural movement&quot;.
** The terrestrial region, according to Aristotle, consisted of concentric spheres of the four classical elements—earth, water, air, and fire. All bodies naturally moved in straight lines until they reached the sphere appropriate to their elemental composition—their &quot;natural place&quot;. All other terrestrial motions were non-natural, or &quot;violent&quot;.
** The celestial region was made up of the fifth element, aether, which was unchanging and moved naturally with uniform circular motion. In the Aristotelian tradition, astronomical theories sought to explain the observed irregular motion of celestial objects through the combined effects of multiple uniform circular motions.
* The Ptolemaic model of planetary motion: based on the geometrical model of Eudoxus of Cnidus, Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, demonstrated that calculations could compute the exact positions of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets in the future and in the past, and showed how these computational models were derived from astronomical observations. As such they formed the model for later astronomical developments. The physical basis for Ptolemaic models invoked layers of spherical shells, though the most complex models were inconsistent with this physical explanation.

Ancient precedent existed for alternative theories and developments which prefigured later discoveries in the area of physics and mechanics; but in light of the limited number of works to survive translation in a period when many books were lost to warfare, such developments remained obscure for centuries and are traditionally held to have had little effect on the re-discovery of such phenomena; whereas the invention of the printing press made the wide dissemination of such incremental advances of knowledge commonplace. Meanwhile, however, significant progress in geometry, mathematics, and astronomy was made in medieval times.

It is also true that many of the important figures of the Scientific Revolution shared in the general Renaissance respect for ancient learning and cited ancient pedigrees for their innovations. Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler and Newton all traced different ancient and medieval ancestries for the heliocentric system. In the Axioms Scholium of his &quot;Principia,&quot; Newton said its axiomatic three laws of motion were already accepted by mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens, Wallace, Wren and others. While preparing a revised edition of his &quot;Principia&quot;, Newton attributed his law of gravity and his first law of motion to a range of historical figures.

Despite these qualifications, the standard theory of the history of the Scientific Revolution claims that the 17th century was a period of revolutionary scientific changes. Not only were there revolutionary theoretical and experimental developments, but that even more importantly, the way in which scientists worked was radically changed. For instance, although intimations of the concept of inertia are suggested sporadically in ancient discussion of motion, the salient point is that Newton&#x27;s theory differed from ancient understandings in key ways, such as an external force being a requirement for violent motion in Aristotle&#x27;s theory.

==Scientific method==

Under the scientific method as conceived in the 17th century, natural and artificial circumstances were set aside as a research tradition of systematic experimentation was slowly accepted by the scientific community. The philosophy of using an inductive approach to obtain knowledge—to abandon assumption and to attempt to observe with an open mind—was in contrast with the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding. In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed—the willingness to question assumptions, yet also to interpret observations assumed to have some degree of validity.

By the end of the Scientific Revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research. Though it is certainly not true that Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways. Many of the hallmarks of modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century.

===Empiricism===

The Aristotelian scientific tradition&#x27;s primary mode of interacting with the world was through observation and searching for &quot;natural&quot; circumstances through reasoning. Coupled with this approach was the belief that rare events which seemed to contradict theoretical models were aberrations, telling nothing about nature as it &quot;naturally&quot; was. During the Scientific Revolution, changing perceptions about the role of the scientist in respect to nature, the value of evidence, experimental or observed, led towards a scientific methodology in which empiricism played a large role.

By the start of the Scientific Revolution, empiricism had already become an important component of science and natural philosophy. Prior thinkers, including the early-14th-century nominalist philosopher William of Ockham, had begun the intellectual movement toward empiricism. The term British empiricism came into use to describe philosophical differences perceived between two of its founders Francis Bacon, described as empiricist, and René Descartes, who was described as a rationalist. Thomas Hobbes, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the philosophy&#x27;s primary exponents who developed a sophisticated empirical tradition as the basis of human knowledge.

An influential formulation of empiricism was John Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1689), in which he maintained that the only true knowledge that could be accessible to the human mind was that which was based on experience. He wrote that the human mind was created as a &quot;tabula rasa&quot;, a &quot;blank tablet,&quot; upon which sensory impressions were recorded and built up knowledge through a process of reflection.

===Bacon&#x27;s contributions===

The philosophical underpinnings of the Scientific Revolution were laid out by Francis Bacon, who has been called the father of empiricism. His works established and popularised inductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the &quot;Baconian method&quot;, or simply the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today.

Bacon proposed a great reformation of all process of knowledge for the advancement of learning divine and human, which he called &quot;Instauratio Magna&quot; (The Great Instauration). For Bacon, this reformation would lead to a great advancement in science and a progeny of inventions that would relieve mankind&#x27;s miseries and needs. His &quot;Novum Organum&quot; was published in 1620, in which he argues man is &quot;the minister and interpreter of nature,&quot; &quot;knowledge and human power are synonymous,&quot; &quot;effects are produced by the means of instruments and helps,&quot; &quot;man while operating can only apply or withdraw natural bodies; nature internally performs the rest,&quot; and &quot;nature can only be commanded by obeying her&quot;. Here is an abstract of the philosophy of this work, that by the knowledge of nature and the using of instruments, man can govern or direct the natural work of nature to produce definite results. Therefore, that man, by seeking knowledge of nature, can reach power over it—and thus reestablish the &quot;Empire of Man over creation,&quot; which had been lost by the Fall together with man&#x27;s original purity. In this way, he believed, would mankind be raised above conditions of helplessness, poverty and misery, while coming into a condition of peace, prosperity and security.

For this purpose of obtaining knowledge of and power over nature, Bacon outlined in this work a new system of logic he believed to be superior to the old ways of syllogism, developing his scientific method, consisting of procedures for isolating the formal cause of a phenomenon (heat, for example) through eliminative induction. For him, the philosopher should proceed through inductive reasoning from fact to axiom to physical law. Before beginning this induction, though, the enquirer must free his or her mind from certain false notions or tendencies which distort the truth. In particular, he found that philosophy was too preoccupied with words, particularly discourse and debate, rather than actually observing the material world: &quot;For while men believe their reason governs words, in fact, words turn back and reflect their power upon the understanding, and so render philosophy and science sophistical and inactive.&quot;

Bacon considered that it is of greatest importance to science not to keep doing intellectual discussions or seeking merely contemplative aims, but that it should work for the bettering of mankind&#x27;s life by bringing forth new inventions, even stating &quot;inventions are also, as it were, new creations and imitations of divine works&quot;. He explored the far-reaching and world-changing character of inventions, such as the printing press, gunpowder and the compass. Despite his influence on scientific methodology, he rejected correct novel theories such as William Gilbert&#x27;s magnetism, Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentrism, and Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion.

===Scientific experimentation===
Bacon first described the experimental method.
Gilbert was an early advocate of this method. He passionately rejected both the prevailing Aristotelian philosophy and the scholastic method of university teaching. His book &quot;De Magnete&quot; was written in 1600, and he is regarded by some as the father of electricity and magnetism. In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the terrella. From these experiments, he concluded that the Earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses point north.
&quot;De Magnete&quot; was influential because of the inherent interest of its subject matter as well as for the rigorous way in which Gilbert describes his experiments and his rejection of ancient theories of magnetism. According to Thomas Thomson, &quot;Gilbert[&#x27;s]... book on magnetism published in 1600, is one of the finest examples of inductive philosophy that has ever been presented to the world. It is the more remarkable, because it preceded the &quot;Novum Organum&quot; of Bacon, in which the inductive method of philosophizing was first explained.&quot;

Galileo Galilei has been called the &quot;father of modern observational astronomy,&quot; the &quot;father of modern physics,&quot; the &quot;father of science,&quot; and &quot;the Father of Modern Science.&quot; His original contributions to the science of motion were made through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. Galileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. In &quot;The Assayer&quot; he wrote &quot;Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe ... It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;...&quot; His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy. He ignored Aristotelianism. In broader terms, his work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning.

Galileo showed an appreciation for the relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of friction and other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile&#x27;s trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.

===Mathematization===
Scientific knowledge, according to the Aristotelians, was concerned with establishing true and necessary causes of things. To the extent that medieval natural philosophers used mathematical problems, they limited social studies to theoretical analyses of local speed and other aspects of life. The actual measurement of a physical quantity, and the comparison of that measurement to a value computed on the basis of theory, was largely limited to the mathematical disciplines of astronomy and optics in Europe.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, European scientists began increasingly applying quantitative measurements to the measurement of physical phenomena on the Earth. Galileo maintained strongly that mathematics provided a kind of necessary certainty that could be compared to God&#x27;s: &quot;...with regard to those few [mathematical propositions] which the human intellect does understand, I believe its knowledge equals the Divine in objective certainty...&quot;

Galileo anticipates the concept of a systematic mathematical interpretation of the world in his book &quot;Il Saggiatore&quot;:

In 1591 François Viète published &quot;In Artem Analyticem Isagoge&quot;, which gave the first symbolic notation of parameters in algebra. Newton&#x27;s development of infinitesimal calculus opened up new applications of the methods of mathematics to science. Newton taught that scientific theory should be coupled with rigorous experimentation, which became the keystone of modern science.

===Mechanical philosophy===
Aristotle recognized four kinds of causes, and where applicable, the most important of them is the &quot;final cause&quot;. The final cause was the aim, goal, or purpose of some natural process or man-made thing. Until the Scientific Revolution, it was very natural to see such aims, such as a child&#x27;s growth, for example, leading to a mature adult. Intelligence was assumed only in the purpose of man-made artifacts; it was not attributed to other animals or to nature.

In &quot;mechanical philosophy&quot; no field or action at a distance is permitted, particles or corpuscles of matter are fundamentally inert. Motion is caused by direct physical collision. Where natural substances had previously been understood organically, the mechanical philosophers viewed them as machines. As a result, Newton&#x27;s theory seemed like some kind of throwback to &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;. According to Thomas Kuhn, Newton and Descartes held the teleological principle that God conserved the amount of motion in the universe:

Gravity, interpreted as an innate attraction between every pair of particles of matter, was an occult quality in the same sense as the scholastics&#x27; &quot;tendency to fall&quot; had been... By the mid eighteenth century that interpretation had been almost universally accepted, and the result was a genuine reversion (which is not the same as a retrogression) to a scholastic standard. Innate attractions and repulsions joined size, shape, position and motion as physically irreducible primary properties of matter.

Newton had also specifically attributed the inherent power of inertia to matter, against the mechanist thesis that matter has no inherent powers. But whereas Newton vehemently denied gravity was an inherent power of matter, his collaborator Roger Cotes made gravity also an inherent power of matter, as set out in his famous preface to the &quot;Principia&#x27;s&quot; 1713 second edition which he edited, and contradicted Newton. And it was Cotes&#x27;s interpretation of gravity rather than Newton&#x27;s that came to be accepted.

===Institutionalization===

The first moves towards the institutionalization of scientific investigation and dissemination took the form of the establishment of societies, where new discoveries were aired, discussed, and published. The first scientific society to be established was the Royal Society of London. This grew out of an earlier group, centered around Gresham College in the 1640s and 1650s. According to a history of the college:

The scientific network which centered on Gresham College played a crucial part in the meetings which led to the formation of the Royal Society.

These physicians and natural philosophers were influenced by the &quot;new science&quot;, as promoted by Bacon in his &quot;New Atlantis&quot;, from approximately 1645 onwards. A group known as &quot;The Philosophical Society of Oxford&quot; was run under a set of rules still retained by the Bodleian Library.

On 28 November 1660, the &quot;1660 committee of 12&quot; announced the formation of a &quot;College for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning&quot;, which would meet weekly to discuss science and run experiments. At the second meeting, Robert Moray announced that King Charles approved of the gatherings, and a royal charter was signed on 15 July 1662 creating the &quot;Royal Society of London&quot;, with Lord Brouncker serving as the first president. A second royal charter was signed on 23 April 1663, with the king noted as the founder and with the name of &quot;the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge&quot;; Robert Hooke was appointed as curator of experiments in November. This initial royal favour has continued, and since then every monarch has been the patron of the society.

The society&#x27;s first secretary was Henry Oldenburg. Its early meetings included experiments performed first by Hooke and then by Denis Papin, who was appointed in 1684. These experiments varied in their subject area and were important in some cases and trivial in others. The society began publication of &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; from 1665, the oldest and longest-running scientific journal in the world, which established the important principles of scientific priority and peer review.

The French established the Academy of Sciences in 1666. In contrast to the private origins of its British counterpart, the academy was founded as a government body by Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Its rules were set down in 1699 by King Louis XIV, when it received the name of &#x27;Royal Academy of Sciences&#x27; and was installed in the Louvre in Paris.

==New ideas==
As the Scientific Revolution was not marked by any single change, the following new ideas contributed to what is called the Scientific Revolution. Many of them were revolutions in their own fields.

=== Astronomy ===

==== Heliocentrism ====
For almost five millennia, the geocentric model of the Earth as the center of the universe had been accepted by all but a few astronomers. In Aristotle&#x27;s cosmology, Earth&#x27;s central location was perhaps less significant than its identification as a realm of imperfection, inconstancy, irregularity, and change, as opposed to the &quot;heavens&quot; (Moon, Sun, planets, stars), which were regarded as perfect, permanent, unchangeable, and in religious thought, the realm of heavenly beings. The Earth was even composed of different material, the four elements &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, and &quot;air&quot;, while sufficiently far above its surface (roughly the Moon&#x27;s orbit), the heavens were composed of a different substance called &quot;aether&quot;. The heliocentric model that replaced it involved the radical displacement of the Earth to an orbit around the Sun; sharing a placement with the other planets implied a universe of heavenly components made from the same changeable substances as the Earth. Heavenly motions no longer needed to be governed by a theoretical perfection, confined to circular orbits.

Copernicus&#x27; 1543 work on the heliocentric model of the Solar System tried to demonstrate that the Sun was the center of the universe. Few were bothered by this suggestion, and the pope and several archbishops were interested enough by it to want more detail. His model was later used to create the calendar of Pope Gregory XIII. However, the idea that the Earth moved around the Sun was doubted by most of Copernicus&#x27; contemporaries. It contradicted not only empirical observation, due to the absence of an observable stellar parallax, but more significantly at the time, the authority of Aristotle. The discoveries of Kepler and Galileo gave the theory credibility. 

Kepler was an astronomer who is best known for his laws of planetary motion, and Kepler´s books &quot;Astronomia nova&quot;, &quot;Harmonice Mundi&quot;, and &quot;Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae&quot; influenced among others Isaac Newton, providing one of the foundations for his theory of universal gravitation. One of the most significant books in the history of astronomy, the Astronomia nova provided strong arguments for heliocentrism and contributed valuable insight into the movement of the planets. This included the first mention of the planets&#x27; elliptical paths and the change of their movement to the movement of free floating bodies as opposed to objects on rotating spheres. It is recognized as one of the most important works of the Scientific Revolution. Using the accurate observations of Tycho Brahe, Kepler proposed that the planets move around the Sun not in circular orbits but in elliptical ones. Together with Kepler´s other laws of planetary motion, this allowed him to create a model of the Solar System that was an improvement over Copernicus&#x27; original system. 

Galileo&#x27;s main contributions to the acceptance of the heliocentric system were his mechanics, the observations he made with his telescope, as well as his detailed presentation of the case for the system. Using an early theory of inertia, Galileo could explain why rocks dropped from a tower fall straight down even if the Earth rotates. His observations of the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, the spots on the Sun, and mountains on the Moon all helped to discredit the Aristotelian philosophy and the Ptolemaic theory of the Solar System. Through their combined discoveries, the heliocentric system gained support, and at the end of the 17th century it was generally accepted by astronomers.

This work culminated in the work of Newton, and his &quot;Principia&quot; formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation which dominated scientists&#x27; view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos. This work also demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. His prediction that the Earth should be shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by other scientists. His laws of motion were to be the solid foundation of mechanics; his law of universal gravitation combined terrestrial and celestial mechanics into one great system that seemed to be able to describe the whole world in mathematical formulae.

==== Gravitation ====
Newton also developed the theory of gravitation. In 1679, Newton began to consider gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton&#x27;s reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–81, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in &quot;De motu corporum in gyrum&quot; in 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the &quot;Principia&quot;.

The &quot;Principia&quot; was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work, Newton states the three universal laws of motion that contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not to be improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word &quot;gravitas&quot; (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity and defined the law of universal gravitation.

Newton&#x27;s postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing &quot;occult agencies&quot; into science. Later, in the second edition of the &quot;Principia&quot; (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding &quot;General Scholium,&quot; writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression &quot;hypotheses non fingo&quot;).

===Biology and medicine===
The writings of Greek physician Galen had dominated European medical thinking for over a millennium. The Flemish scholar Andreas Vesalius demonstrated mistakes in Galen&#x27;s ideas. Vesalius dissected human corpses, whereas Galen dissected animal corpses. Published in 1543, Vesalius&#x27; &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot; was a groundbreaking work of human anatomy. It emphasized the priority of dissection and what has come to be called the &quot;anatomical&quot; view of the body, seeing human internal functioning as an essentially corporeal structure filled with organs arranged in three-dimensional space. This was in stark contrast to many of the anatomical models used previously, which had strong Galenic/Aristotelean elements, as well as elements of astrology.

Besides the first good description of the sphenoid bone, Vesalius showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six; and he described accurately the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone. He verified the observation of anatomist Charles Estienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, described the vena azygos, and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named ductus venosus. He described the omentum and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon; gave the first correct views of the structure of the pylorus; observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first good account of the mediastinum and pleura and the fullest description of the anatomy of the brain yet advanced.

Before Vesalius, the anatomical notes by Alessandro Achillini demonstrate a detailed description of the human body and compare what he had found during his dissections to what others like Galen and Avicenna had found and notes their similarities and differences. Niccolò Massa was an Italian anatomist who wrote an early anatomy text &quot;Anatomiae Libri Introductorius&quot; in 1536, described the cerebrospinal fluid and was the author of several medical works. Jean Fernel was a French physician who introduced the term &quot;physiology&quot; to describe the study of the body&#x27;s function and was the first person to describe the spinal canal.

Further groundbreaking work was carried out by William Harvey, who published &quot;De Motu Cordis&quot; in 1628. Harvey made a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart, going on to an analysis of the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery. He noticed that the two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently like had been thought previously by his predecessors.

Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each pump of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in half an hour. From these estimations, he demonstrated that according to Gaelen&#x27;s theory that blood was continually produced in the liver, the absurdly large figure of 540 pounds of blood would have to be produced every day. Having this simple mathematical proportion at hand—which would imply a seemingly impossible role for the liver—Harvey went on to demonstrate how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on serpents and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up. This process was later performed on the human body: the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.

Various other advances in medical understanding and practice were made. French physician Pierre Fauchard started dentistry science as we know it today, and he has been named &quot;the father of modern dentistry&quot;. Surgeon Ambroise Paré was a leader in surgical techniques and battlefield medicine, especially the treatment of wounds, and Herman Boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a &quot;father of physiology&quot; because of his exemplary teaching in Leiden and his textbook &quot;Institutiones medicae&quot; (1708).

===Chemistry===
Chemistry, and its antecedent alchemy, became an increasingly important aspect of scientific thought in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries. The importance of chemistry is indicated by the range of important scholars who actively engaged in chemical research. Among them were the astronomer Tycho Brahe, the chemical physician Paracelsus, Robert Boyle, Thomas Browne and Isaac Newton. Unlike the mechanical philosophy, the chemical philosophy stressed the active powers of matter, which alchemists frequently expressed in terms of vital or active principles—of spirits operating in nature.

Practical attempts to improve the refining of ores and their extraction to smelt metals were an important source of information for early chemists in the 16th century, among them Georgius Agricola, who published his great work &quot;De re metallica&quot; in 1556. His work describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. His approach removed the mysticism associated with the subject, creating the practical base upon which others could build.

Chemist Robert Boyle is considered to have refined the modern scientific method for alchemy and to have separated chemistry further from alchemy. Although his research clearly has its roots in the alchemical tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. Although Boyle was not the original discoverer, he is best known for Boyle&#x27;s law, which he presented in 1662: the law describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system.

Boyle is also credited for his landmark publication &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot; in 1661, which is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry. In the work, Boyle presents his hypothesis that every phenomenon was the result of collisions of particles in motion. Boyle appealed to chemists to experiment and asserted that experiments denied the limiting of chemical elements to only the classic four: earth, fire, air, and water. He also pleaded that chemistry should cease to be subservient to medicine or to alchemy, and rise to the status of a science. Importantly, he advocated a rigorous approach to scientific experiment: he believed all theories must be tested experimentally before being regarded as true. The work contains some of the earliest modern ideas of atoms, molecules, and chemical reaction, and marks the beginning of modern chemistry.

=== Physical ===

==== Optics ====

In 1604 Johannes Kepler published &quot;Astronomiae Pars Optica&quot; (&quot;The Optical Part of Astronomy&quot;). In it, he describes the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. &quot;Astronomiae Pars Optica&quot; is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics.

Willebrord Snellius found the mathematical law of refraction, now known as Snell&#x27;s law, in 1621. It had been published earlier in 984 AD by Ibn Sahl. Subsequently René Descartes showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes&#x27; law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42° (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow&#x27;s centre is 42°). He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law. Christiaan Huygens wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the &quot;Opera reliqua&quot; (also known as &quot;Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma&quot;) and the &quot;Traité de la lumière&quot;.

Newton investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into a spectrum of colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton&#x27;s theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours. The interest of the Royal Society encouraged him to publish his notes &quot;On Colour&quot;. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or &quot;corpuscles&quot; and that are refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light.

In his &quot;Hypothesis of Light&quot; of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published &quot;Opticks&quot;, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation &quot;Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?&quot;

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek constructed powerful single lens microscopes and made extensive observations that he published around 1660, paving the way for the science of microbiology.

==== Electricity ====
William Gilbert, in &quot;De Magnete&quot;, invented the Neo-Latin word &quot;electricus&quot; from &quot;&quot; (&quot;elektron&quot;), the Greek word for &quot;amber&quot;. Gilbert undertook a number of careful electrical experiments, in the course of which he discovered that many substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc., were capable of manifesting electrical properties. Gilbert discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the electrification of all bodies. He noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet only attracted iron. The many discoveries of this nature earned Gilbert the title &quot;founder of the electrical science&quot;. By investigating the forces on a light metallic needle, balanced on a point, he extended the list of electric bodies and found that many substances, including metals and natural magnets, showed no attractive forces when rubbed. He noticed that dry weather with north or east wind was the most favourable atmospheric condition for exhibiting electric phenomena—an observation liable to misconception until the difference between conductor and insulator was understood.

Robert Boyle worked frequently at the new science of electricity and added several substances to Gilbert&#x27;s list of electrics. He left a detailed account of his researches under the title of &quot;Experiments on the Origin of Electricity&quot;. In 1675 Boyle stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum. One of his important discoveries was that electrified bodies in a vacuum would attract light substances, this indicating that the electrical effect did not depend upon the air as a medium.

This was followed in 1660 by Otto von Guericke, who invented an early electrostatic generator. By the end of the 17th century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction with an electrostatic generator, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the science of electricity. The first usage of the word &quot;electricity&quot; is ascribed to Thomas Browne in his 1646 work &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;. In 1729 Stephen Gray demonstrated that electricity could be &quot;transmitted&quot; through metal filaments.

==Mechanical devices==
As an aid to scientific investigation, various tools, measuring aids and calculating devices were developed in this period.

===Calculating devices===
John Napier introduced logarithms as a powerful mathematical tool. With the help of Henry Briggs their logarithmic tables embodied a computational advance that made calculations by hand much quicker. His Napier&#x27;s bones used a set of numbered rods as a multiplication tool using the system of lattice multiplication. The way was opened to later scientific advances, particularly in astronomy and dynamics.

At Oxford University, Edmund Gunter built the first analog device to aid computation. The &#x27;Gunter&#x27;s scale&#x27; was a large plane scale, engraved with various scales, or lines. Natural lines, such as the line of chords, the line of sines and tangents are placed on one side of the scale and the corresponding artificial or logarithmic ones were on the other side. This calculating aid was a predecessor of the slide rule. It was William Oughtred who first used two such scales sliding by one another to perform direct multiplication and division and thus is credited as the inventor of the slide rule in 1622.

Blaise Pascal invented the mechanical calculator in 1642. The introduction of his Pascaline in 1645 launched the development of mechanical calculators first in Europe and then all over the world. Gottfried Leibniz, building on Pascal&#x27;s work, became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators; he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685, and he invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, the foundation of virtually all modern computer architectures.

John Hadley was the inventor of the octant, the precursor to the sextant (invented by John Bird), which greatly improved the science of navigation.

===Industrial machines===
Denis Papin was best known for his pioneering invention of the steam digester, the forerunner of the steam engine. The first working steam engine was patented in 1698 by the English inventor Thomas Savery, as a &quot;...new invention for raising of water and occasioning motion to all sorts of mill work by the impellent force of fire, which will be of great use and advantage for drayning mines, serveing townes with water, and for the working of all sorts of mills where they have not the benefitt of water nor constant windes.&quot; The invention was demonstrated to the Royal Society on 14 June 1699, and the machine was described by Savery in his book &quot;The Miner&#x27;s Friend; or, An Engine to Raise Water by Fire&quot; (1702), in which he claimed that it could pump water out of mines. Thomas Newcomen perfected the practical steam engine for pumping water, the Newcomen steam engine. Consequently, Newcomen can be regarded as a forefather of the Industrial Revolution.

Abraham Darby I was the first, and most famous, of three generations of the Darby family who played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. He developed a method of producing high-grade iron in a blast furnace fueled by coke rather than charcoal. This was a major step forward in the production of iron as a raw material for the Industrial Revolution.

===Telescopes===
Refracting telescopes first appeared in the Netherlands in 1608, apparently the product of spectacle makers experimenting with lenses. The inventor is unknown, but Hans Lipperhey applied for the first patent, followed by Jacob Metius of Alkmaar. Galileo was one of the first scientists to use this tool for his astronomical observations in 1609. The reflecting telescope was described by James Gregory in his book &quot;Optica Promota&quot; (1663). He argued that a mirror shaped like the part of a conic section, would correct the spherical aberration that flawed the accuracy of refracting telescopes. His design, the &quot;Gregorian telescope&quot;, however, remained un-built.

In 1666, Newton argued that the faults of the refracting telescope were fundamental because the lens refracted light of different colors differently. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations. From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope. However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a reflecting telescope. It was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope. 50 years later, Hadley developed ways to make precision aspheric and parabolic objective mirrors for reflecting telescopes, building the first parabolic Newtonian telescope and a Gregorian telescope with accurately shaped mirrors. These were successfully demonstrated to the Royal Society.

===Other devices===
The invention of the vacuum pump paved the way for the experiments of Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke into the nature of vacuum and atmospheric pressure. The first such device was made by Otto von Guericke in 1654. It consisted of a piston and an air gun cylinder with flaps that could suck the air from any vessel that it was connected to. In 1657, he pumped the air out of two conjoined hemispheres and demonstrated that a team of sixteen horses were incapable of pulling it apart. The air pump construction was greatly improved by Hooke in 1658.

Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer in 1643. The motivation for the invention was to improve on the suction pumps that were used to raise water out of the mines. Torricelli constructed a sealed tube filled with mercury, set vertically into a basin of the same substance. The column of mercury fell downwards, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above.

=== Materials, construction, and aesthetics ===
Surviving instruments from this period tend to be made of durable metals such as brass, gold, or steel, although examples such as telescopes made of wood, pasteboard, or with leather components exist. Those instruments that exist in collections today tend to be robust examples, made by skilled craftspeople for and at the expense of wealthy patrons. These may have been commissioned as displays of wealth. In addition, the instruments preserved in collections may not have received heavy use in scientific work; instruments that had visibly received heavy use were typically destroyed, deemed unfit for display, or excluded from collections altogether. It is also postulated that the scientific instruments preserved in many collections were chosen because they were more appealing to collectors, by virtue of being more ornate, more portable, or made with higher-grade materials.

Intact air pumps are particularly rare. The pump at right included a glass sphere to permit demonstrations inside the vacuum chamber, a common use. The base was wooden, and the cylindrical pump was brass. Other vacuum chambers that survived were made of brass hemispheres.

Instrument makers of the late 17th and early 18th centuries were commissioned by organizations seeking help with navigation, surveying, warfare, and astronomical observation. The increase in uses for such instruments, and their widespread use in global exploration and conflict, created a need for new methods of manufacture and repair, which would be met by the Industrial Revolution.

==Criticism==
The idea that modern science took place as a kind of revolution has been debated among historians. A weakness of the idea of a scientific revolution is the lack of a systematic approach to the question of knowledge in the period comprehended between the 14th and 17th centuries, leading to misunderstandings on the value and role of modern authors. From this standpoint, the continuity thesis is the hypothesis that there was no radical discontinuity between the intellectual development of the Middle Ages and the developments in the Renaissance and early modern period and has been deeply and widely documented by the works of scholars like Pierre Duhem, John Hermann Randall, Alistair Crombie and William A. Wallace, who proved the preexistence of a wide range of ideas used by the followers of the Scientific Revolution thesis to substantiate their claims. Thus, the idea of a scientific revolution following the Renaissance is—according to the continuity thesis—a myth. Some continuity theorists point to earlier intellectual revolutions occurring in the Middle Ages, usually referring to either a European Renaissance of the 12th century or a medieval Muslim scientific revolution, as a sign of continuity.

Another contrary view has been recently proposed by Arun Bala in his dialogical history of the birth of modern science. Bala proposes that the changes involved in the Scientific Revolution—the mathematical realist turn, the mechanical philosophy, the atomism, the central role assigned to the Sun in Copernican heliocentrism—have to be seen as rooted in multicultural influences on Europe. He sees specific influences in Alhazen&#x27;s physical optical theory, Chinese mechanical technologies leading to the perception of the world as a machine, the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which carried implicitly a new mode of mathematical atomic thinking, and the heliocentrism rooted in ancient Egyptian religious ideas associated with Hermeticism. Bala argues that by ignoring such multicultural impacts we have been led to a Eurocentric conception of the Scientific Revolution. However, he states: &quot;The makers of the revolution—Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and many others—had to selectively appropriate relevant ideas, transform them, and create new auxiliary concepts in order to complete their task... In the ultimate analysis, even if the revolution was rooted upon a multicultural base it is the accomplishment of Europeans in Europe.&quot; Critics note that lacking documentary evidence of transmission of specific scientific ideas, Bala&#x27;s model will remain &quot;a working hypothesis, not a conclusion&quot;.

A third approach takes the term &quot;Renaissance&quot; literally as a &quot;rebirth&quot;. A closer study of Greek philosophy and Greek mathematics demonstrates that nearly all of the so-called revolutionary results of the so-called Scientific Revolution were in actuality restatements of ideas that were in many cases older than those of Aristotle and in nearly all cases at least as old as Archimedes. Aristotle even explicitly argues against some of the ideas that were espoused during the Scientific Revolution, such as heliocentrism. The basic ideas of the scientific method were well known to Archimedes and his contemporaries, as demonstrated in the discovery of buoyancy. This approach to the Scientific Revolution reduces it to a period of relearning classical ideas that is very much an extension of the Renaissance. This view does not deny that a change occurred but argues that it was a reassertion of previous knowledge (a renaissance) and not the creation of new knowledge. It cites statements from Newton, Copernicus and others in favour of the Pythagorean worldview as evidence.

In more recent analysis of the Scientific Revolution during this period, there has been criticism of the dominance of male scientists of the time. Female scholars were not given the opportunities that a male scholar would have had, and the incorporation of women&#x27;s work in the sciences during this time tends to be obscured. Scholars have tried to look into the participation of women in the 17th century in science, and even with sciences as simple as domestic knowledge women were making advances. With the limited history provided from texts of the period we cannot know the extent of women&#x27;s roles in developing the scientific ideas and inventions. Another idea to consider is the way this period influenced even the women scientists of the periods following it. Annie Jump Cannon was a 20th century astronomer who benefitted from the laws and theories developed from this period; she made several advances in the century following the Scientific Revolution. It was an important period for the future of science, including the incorporation of women into fields using the developments made.

<text>The Salian dynasty or Salic dynasty () was a dynasty in the High Middle Ages. The dynasty provided four kings of Germany (1024–1125), all of whom went on to be crowned Holy Roman emperors (1027–1125).

After the death of the last Ottonian emperor in 1024, the Kingdom of Germany and later the entire Holy Roman Empire passed to Conrad II, a Salian. He was followed by three more Salian rulers: Henry III, Henry IV, and Henry V. They established their monarchy as a major European power. The Salian dynasty developed a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.

==Origins and name==

Modern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the Widonids, a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers Moselle and Saar and they supported the Carolingians. The Widonids&#x27; eastward expansion towards the river Rhine started after they founded Hornbach Abbey in the Bliesgau around 750. Hornbach remained their proprietary monastery and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the Wormsgau. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians&#x27; forefathers remained in Rhenish Franconia.

Wipo of Burgundy, the biographer of the first Salian monarch, Emperor Conrad II, described Conrad&#x27;s father and uncle as &quot;distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia&quot; around 1044, but without calling them Salians. Wipo added that Conrad&#x27;s mother, Adelaide of Metz, was &quot;supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of Troy&quot;. The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal Merovingians who had claimed a Trojan ancestry for themselves.

Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relationship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as the Salic law. Peter H. Wilson states the Salians received their name due to their origins amongst the Franks living along the Rhine in western Franconia, a region &quot;distinguished through its use of Salic law&quot;. A less likely etymology links the appellation to the old German word &quot;sal&quot; (&quot;lordship&quot;), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs&#x27; well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.

The term &quot;reges salici&quot; (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th century. A list of monarchs and archbishops from Mainz, which was completed around 1139–40, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop Otto of Freising, a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his &quot;Chronicle or History of the Two Cities&quot; in the middle of the 12th century. In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appellation has already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians. An earlier name of the family, appearing in 982, was the Wormsers, due to their main holdings being in the Diocese of Worms.

All male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named Conrad or Henry. Emperor Conrad II&#x27;s grandfather, Otto of Worms, established this tradition in the late 10th century. He named his eldest son, Henry of Worms, after his maternal great-grandfather, King Henry the Fowler; and he gave the name of his father, Conrad the Red, to one of his younger sons, Conrad of Carinthia. Conrad the Red was most probably named for King Conrad I of Germany.

==Early Salians==





===Werner===

Count Werner, who held estates in the Nahegau, Speyergau and Wormsgau early in the 10th century, is the Salian monarchs&#x27; first certainly identified ancestor. His family links to the Widonids cannot be securely established, but his patrimonial lands and his close relationship with the Hornbach Abbey provide indirect evidence of his Widonid ancestry. He married a kinswoman, most probably a sister, of King Conrad I of Germany. This marriage alliance with the Conradines introduced Conrad as a leading name in his family.

===Conrad the Red===
Werner&#x27;s son, Conrad the Red, inherited his father Franconian estates. His family links with the Conradines facilitated his acquisition of large portions of their domains after King Otto I of Germany crushed their revolt in 939. The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto I&#x27;s principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the Duchy of Lotharingia in 944 or 945 and he married the King&#x27;s daughter, Luidgard, in 947.

The marriage forged a link between the royal Ottonian dynasty and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in-law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading Magyars in the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. The contemporaneous Widukind of Corvey praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the Worms Cathedral, although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals.

===Otto of Worms===
Conrad the Red&#x27;s son, Otto of Worms, found favour with his maternal grandfather, King Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor from 962. Still a minor, Otto of Worms was mentioned as a count in the Nahegau in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, Niddagau, Elsenzgau, Kraichgau and Pfinzgau, thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and Neckar by the time Otto I died in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, to Count Henry of Arlon, or to Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches.

Otto I&#x27;s son and successor, Emperor Otto II, was worried about the concentration of lands in his nephew&#x27;s hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway Duchy of Carinthia and March of Verona in 978. The Emperor persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms, and also parts of his revenues in the town, to the local bishop. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in Wasgau, the royal palace at Kaiserslautern and the proprietary rights over Weissenburg Abbey.

He could also preserve the title of duke, thus becoming the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor, thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor&#x27;s death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, Henry of Bavaria in 1002. Henry restored Carinthia to Otto in 1002 and he ruled the duchy until his death in 1004.

==Dukes and bishops==




===Henry of Worms===

Henry was Otto of Worms&#x27;s eldest son. His wife, Adelaide, was born into a prominent Lotharingian family, being the daughter of Richard, Count of Metz. Their son, Conrad, would be the first Salian monarch, but Henry could not transfer his seniority rights to his son, because he predeceased his father most probably in 990 or 991.

===Conrad of Carinthia===

After Henry of Worms&#x27; premature death, his seniority rights shifted to his younger brother, Conrad, enabling him to inherit the major part of the patrimonial lands from his father. Conrad married Matilda, a daughter of Herman II, Duke of Swabia, most probably in 1002. Two years later, he succeeded his father as Duke of Carinthia—the duchy passed from father to son for the first time on this occasion. His rule in Carinthia is poorly documented and he died in 1011.

===Pope Gregory V===

Bruno—the future Pope Gregory V—was a younger son of Otto of Worms. His father&#x27;s cousin, Otto III, placed him on the papal throne in 996, ignoring the provisions of his own &quot;Diploma Ottonianum&quot; on papal elections. Bruno, who was the first German pope, assumed his papal name in memory of Pope Gregory the Great. He crowned Otto III emperor on the Feast of the Ascension in the same year. The Roman aristocrat Crescentius the Younger expelled him from Rome, but the Emperor crushed the revolt and restored the papal throne to Gregory V. The Pope died at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven in 999.

===William of Strasbourg===

William was Otto of Worms&#x27; youngest son. After serving in the royal court as archchaplain to Queen Gisella, William was made bishop of Strasbourg in 1028 or 1029. The see of Strasbourg was one of the wealthiest German bishoprics. His tenure was almost uneventful and he died in 1046 or 1047.

===Conrad the Younger===

Conrad, the elder son of Duke Conrad I of Carinthia and Matilda of Swabia, was born between 1002 and 1005. He was underage when his father died in 1011. He inherited his father&#x27;s patrimonial lands, but Emperor Henry II made Adalbero of Eppelstein the new duke of Carinthia. After Emperor Henry II died in 1024, both Conrad and his cousin, Conrad the Elder, laid claim to the throne and Conrad the Elder was elected the new monarch.

==Imperial Salians==

===Conrad II===

Conrad the Elder was the sole son of Henry of Worms. After his father&#x27;s premature death, he was placed under the guardianship of Bishop Burchard of Worms. He married Gisela of Swabia in 1016. Both her father Herman II, Duke of Swabia and her mother Gerberga of Burgundy descended from Charlemagne. She was twice widowed. Gisela&#x27;s first husband Brun I, Count of Brunswick had been a candidate to the imperial throne along with her father and the winning Henry II. Her second husband Ernest succeeded her childless brother Herman III as duke of Swabia. 

Conrad the Elder was elected king of Germany against his cousin Conrad the Younger on 4 September 1024. Four days later, he was crowned in the Mainz Cathedral by Archbishop Aribo. On learning of Henry II the citizens of the Italian city Pavia demolished the local royal palace claiming that during the interregnum no king could own the palace. In his response to the rebels, Conrad emphasized that &quot;Even if the king died, the kingdom remaind, just as the ship whose steersman falls remains&quot;. A group of Lombard aristocrats offered the throne first to Robert II of France or his eldest son, Hugh Magnus, then to William V, Duke of Aquitaine, but the Lombard bishops and most aristocrats supported Conrad&#x27;s claim to rule. 

After crushing a revolt by his stepson Ernest II, Duke of Swabia and Conrad the Younger in Germany, Conrad marched to Italy. He was crowned king of the Lombards in Milan by Archbishop Aribert probably on 25th March 1026. Resistance against his rule was quickly crushed. He reached Rome where he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope John XIX on 26th March 1027.







==Salian monarchy==
After the death of the last Saxon Emperor Henry II, the first Salian regent, Conrad II, was elected by the majority of the Prince-electors and was crowned German king in Mainz on 8 September 1024. Early in 1026 Conrad went to Milan, where Ariberto, archbishop of Milan, crowned him king of Italy. When Rudolph III, King of Burgundy died in 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Provençal nobles paid homage to Conrad in Zürich in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the Kingdom of Arles from the 12th century.

Already in 1028 Conrad II had his son Henry III elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry&#x27;s tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign Speyer Cathedral was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry&#x27;s conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in Lorraine, this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. However, in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052–1055. In 1046 Henry ended the papal schism, freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.
The early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the Church, a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the Investiture Controversy (or &quot;Investiture Dispute&quot;), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, Gregory VII, demanded that Emperor Henry IV renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. 

More importantly, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication from supporting Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to Canossa in northern Italy in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an antipope (Antipope Clement III) in 1080.

The monarch&#x27;s struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the Concordat of Worms in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty Henry V coincided with the final phase of the great Investiture Controversy, which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of Gregorian reformers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. 

Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.

According to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of other princes, only on those living within his family&#x27;s territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire – in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in France and Italy. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.

The first Hohenstaufen king Conrad III was a grandson of the Salian Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. (Agnes, Henry IV&#x27;s daughter and Henry V&#x27;s sister, was the heiress to the Salian dynasty&#x27;s lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty and her second marriage the ducal Babenberg potentates of the Duchy of Austria, which was elevated much due to these connections via the Privilegium Minus.)

==Salian Kings and Emperors==

* Conrad II 1024–1039, crowned emperor on 26 March 1027
* Henry III 1039–1056, crowned emperor on 25 December 1046
* Henry IV 1056–1106, crowned emperor on 31 March 1084
** Conrad (III) 1087–1098, nominal king under his father Henry IV
* Henry V 1106–1125, crowned emperor on 13 April 1111

Their regnal dates as emperor take into account elections and subsequent coronations.

<text>Self-replication is any behavior of a dynamical system that yields construction of an identical or similar copy of itself. Biological cells, given suitable environments, reproduce by cell division. During cell division, DNA is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction. Biological viruses can replicate, but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection. Harmful prion proteins can replicate by converting normal proteins into rogue forms. Computer viruses reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers. Self-replication in robotics has been an area of research and a subject of interest in science fiction. Any self-replicating mechanism which does not make a perfect copy (mutation) will experience genetic variation and will create variants of itself. These variants will be subject to natural selection, since some will be better at surviving in their current environment than others and will out-breed them.

==Overview==

===Theory===
Early research by John von Neumann established that replicators have several parts:

*A coded representation of the replicator
*A mechanism to copy the coded representation
*A mechanism for effecting construction within the host environment of the replicator

Exceptions to this pattern may be possible, although almost all known examples adhere to it. Scientists have come close to constructing RNA that can be copied in an &quot;environment&quot; that is a solution of RNA monomers and transcriptase, but such systems are more accurately characterized as &quot;assisted replication&quot; than &quot;self-replication&quot;. In 2021 researchers succeeded in constructing a system with sixteen specially designed DNA sequences. Four of these can be linked together (through base pairing) in a certain order following a template of four already-linked sequences, by changing the temperature up and down. The number of template copies is thus increased in each cycle. No external agent such as an enzyme is needed, but the system must be supplied with a reservoir of the sixteen DNA sequences.

The simplest possible case is that only a genome exists. Without some specification of the self-reproducing steps, a genome-only system is probably better characterized as something like a crystal.

===Origin of life===

Self-replication is a fundamental feature of life. It was proposed that self-replication emerged in the evolution of life when a molecule similar to a double-stranded polynucleotide (possibly like RNA) dissociated into single-stranded polynucleotides and each of these acted as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand producing two double stranded copies. In a system such as this, individual duplex replicators with different nucleotide sequences could compete with each other for available mononucleotide resources, thus initiating natural selection for the most “fit” sequences. Replication of these early forms of life was likely highly inaccurate producing mutations that influenced the folding state of the polynucleotides, thus affecting the propensities for strand association (promoting stability) and disassociation (allowing genome replication). The evolution of order in living systems has been proposed to be an example of a fundamental order generating principle that also applies to physical systems.

===Classes of self-replication===
Recent research has begun to categorize replicators, often based on the amount of support they require.

*Natural replicators have all or most of their design from nonhuman sources. Such systems include natural life forms.
*Autotrophic replicators can reproduce themselves &quot;in the wild&quot;. They mine their own materials. It is conjectured that non-biological autotrophic replicators could be designed by humans, and could easily accept specifications for human products.
*Self-reproductive systems are conjectured systems which would produce copies of themselves from industrial feedstocks such as metal bar and wire.
*Self-assembling systems assemble copies of themselves from finished, delivered parts. Simple examples of such systems have been demonstrated at the macro scale.

The design space for machine replicators is very broad. A comprehensive study to date by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle has identified 137 design dimensions grouped into a dozen separate categories, including: (1) Replication Control, (2) Replication Information, (3) Replication Substrate, (4) Replicator Structure, (5) Passive Parts, (6) Active Subunits, (7) Replicator Energetics, (8) Replicator Kinematics, (9) Replication Process, (10) Replicator Performance, (11) Product Structure, and (12) Evolvability.

===A self-replicating computer program===
In computer science a quine is a self-reproducing computer program that, when executed, outputs its own code. For example, a quine in the Python programming language is:

A more trivial approach is to write a program that will make a copy of any stream of data that it is directed to, and then direct it at itself. In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated. This approach is common in most self-replicating systems, including biological life, and is simpler as it does not require the program to contain a complete description of itself.

In many programming languages an empty program is legal, and executes without producing errors or other output. The output is thus the same as the source code, so the program is trivially self-reproducing.

===Self-replicating tiling===
In geometry a self-replicating tiling is a tiling pattern in which several congruent tiles may be joined together to form a larger tile that is similar to the original. This is an aspect of the field of study known as tessellation. The &quot;sphinx&quot; hexiamond is the only known self-replicating pentagon. For example, four such concave pentagons can be joined together to make one with twice the dimensions. Solomon W. Golomb coined the term rep-tiles for self-replicating tilings.

In 2012, Lee Sallows identified rep-tiles as a special instance of a self-tiling tile set or setiset. A setiset of order &quot;n&quot; is a set of &quot;n&quot; shapes that can be assembled in &quot;n&quot; different ways so as to form larger replicas of themselves. Setisets in which every shape is distinct are called &#x27;perfect&#x27;. A rep-&quot;n&quot; rep-tile is just a setiset composed of &quot;n&quot; identical pieces.

===Self replicating clay crystals===
One form of natural self-replication that is not based on DNA or RNA occurs in clay crystals. Clay consists of a large number of small crystals, and clay is an environment that promotes crystal growth. Crystals consist of a regular lattice of atoms and are able to grow if e.g. placed in a water solution containing the crystal components; automatically arranging atoms at the crystal boundary into the crystalline form. Crystals may have irregularities where the regular atomic structure is broken, and when crystals grow, these irregularities may propagate, creating a form of self-replication of crystal irregularities. Because these irregularities may affect the probability of a crystal breaking apart to form new crystals, crystals with such irregularities could even be considered to undergo evolutionary development.

===Applications===
It is a long-term goal of some engineering sciences to achieve a clanking replicator, a material device that can self-replicate. The usual reason is to achieve a low cost per item while retaining the utility of a manufactured good. Many authorities say that in the limit, the cost of self-replicating items should approach the cost-per-weight of wood or other biological substances, because self-replication avoids the costs of labor, capital and distribution in conventional manufactured goods.

A fully novel artificial replicator is a reasonable near-term goal.
A NASA study recently placed the complexity of a clanking replicator at approximately that of Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 CPU. That is, the technology is achievable with a relatively small engineering group in a reasonable commercial time-scale at a reasonable cost.

Given the currently keen interest in biotechnology and the high levels of funding in that field, attempts to exploit the replicative ability of existing cells are timely, and may easily lead to significant insights and advances.

A variation of self replication is of practical relevance in compiler construction, where a similar bootstrapping problem occurs as in natural self replication. A compiler (phenotype) can be applied on the compiler&#x27;s own source code (genotype) producing the compiler itself. During compiler development, a modified (mutated) source is used to create the next generation of the compiler. This process differs from natural self-replication in that the process is directed by an engineer, not by the subject itself.

==Mechanical self-replication==
An activity in the field of robots is the self-replication of machines. Since all robots (at least in modern times) have a fair number of the same features, a self-replicating robot (or possibly a hive of robots) would need to do the following:

*Obtain construction materials
*Manufacture new parts including its smallest parts and thinking apparatus
*Provide a consistent power source
*Program the new members
*Error correct any mistakes in the offspring

On a nano scale, assemblers might also be designed to self-replicate under their own power. This, in turn, has given rise to the &quot;grey goo&quot; version of Armageddon, as featured in the science fiction novels &quot;Bloom&quot; and &quot;Prey&quot;.

The Foresight Institute has published guidelines for researchers in mechanical self-replication. The guidelines recommend that researchers use several specific techniques for preventing mechanical replicators from getting out of control, such as using a broadcast architecture.

==Fields==

Research has occurred in the following areas:

* Biology: studies of organismal and cellular natural replication and replicators, and their interaction, including sub-disciplines such as population dynamics, quorum sensing, autophagy pathways. These can be an important guide to avoid design difficulties in self-replicating machinery.
* Chemistry: self-replication studies are typically about how a specific set of molecules can act together to replicate each other within the set (often part of Systems chemistry field).
*Biochemistry: simple systems of &quot;in vitro&quot; ribosomal self replication have been attempted, but as of January 2021, indefinite &quot;in vitro&quot; ribosomal self replication has not been achieved in the lab. 
*Nanotechnology or more precisely, molecular nanotechnology is concerned with making nano scale assemblers. Without self-replication, capital and assembly costs of molecular machines become impossibly large. Many bottom-up approaches to nanotechnology take advantage of biochemical or chemical self-assembly.
*Space resources: NASA has sponsored a number of design studies to develop self-replicating mechanisms to mine space resources. Most of these designs include computer-controlled machinery that copies itself.
* Memetics: The idea of a meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene where he proposed a cognitive equivalent of the gene; a unit of behavior which is copied from one host mind to another through observation. Memes can only propagate via animal behavior and are thus analogous to information viruses and are often described as viral.
* Computer security: Many computer security problems are caused by self-reproducing computer programs that infect computers — computer worms and computer viruses.
* Parallel computing: loading a new program on every node of a large computer cluster or distributed computing system is time consuming. Using a mobile agents to self-replicate code from node-to-node can save the system administrator a lot of time. Mobile agents have a potential to crash a computer cluster if poorly implemented.

==In industry==

===Space exploration and manufacturing===
The goal of self-replication in space systems is to exploit large amounts of matter with a low launch mass. For example, an autotrophic self-replicating machine could cover a moon or planet with solar cells, and beam the power to the Earth using microwaves. Once in place, the same machinery that built itself could also produce raw materials or manufactured objects, including transportation systems to ship the products. Another model of self-replicating machine would copy itself through the galaxy and universe, sending information back.

In general, since these systems are autotrophic, they are the most difficult and complex known replicators. They are also thought to be the most hazardous, because they do not require any inputs from human beings in order to reproduce.

A classic theoretical study of replicators in space is the 1980 NASA study of autotrophic clanking replicators, edited by Robert Freitas.

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing lunar regolith, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in regolith. The limiting element was Chlorine, an essential element to process regolith for Aluminium. Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, and a substantially faster rate of reproduction could be assured by importing modest amounts.

The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails. Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic robot.

Power would be provided by a &quot;canopy&quot; of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery could run under the canopy.

A &quot;casting robot&quot; would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make plaster molds. Plaster molds are easy to make, and make precise parts with good surface finishes. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from non-conductive molten rock (basalt) or purified metals. An electric oven melted the materials.

A speculative, more complex &quot;chip factory&quot; was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were &quot;vitamins&quot;.

===Molecular manufacturing===
Nanotechnologists in particular believe that their work will likely fail to reach a state of maturity until human beings design a self-replicating assembler of nanometer dimensions.

These systems are substantially simpler than autotrophic systems, because they are provided with purified feedstocks and energy. They do not have to reproduce them. This distinction is at the root of some of the controversy about whether molecular manufacturing is possible or not. Many authorities who find it impossible are clearly citing sources for complex autotrophic self-replicating systems. Many of the authorities who find it possible are clearly citing sources for much simpler self-assembling systems, which have been demonstrated. In the meantime, a Lego-built autonomous robot able to follow a pre-set track and assemble an exact copy of itself, starting from four externally provided components, was demonstrated experimentally in 2003.

Merely exploiting the replicative abilities of existing cells is insufficient, because of limitations in the process of protein biosynthesis .

What is required is the rational design of an entirely novel replicator with a much wider range of synthesis capabilities.

In 2011, New York University scientists have developed artificial structures that can self-replicate, a process that has the potential to yield new types of materials. They have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate not just molecules like cellular DNA or RNA, but discrete structures that could in principle assume many different shapes, have many different functional features, and be associated with many different types of chemical species.

<text>Shmuel Yosef Agnon (; August 8, 1887 – February 17, 1970) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Israeli novelist, poet, and short-story writer. He was one of the central figures of modern Hebrew literature. In Hebrew, he is known by the acronym Shai Agnon (). In English, his works are published under the name S. Y. Agnon.

Agnon was born in Polish Galicia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and later immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, and died in Jerusalem.

His works deal with the conflict between the traditional Jewish life and language and the modern world. They also attempt to recapture the fading traditions of the European &quot;shtetl&quot; (village). In a wider context, he also contributed to broadening the characteristic conception of the narrator&#x27;s role in literature. Agnon had a distinctive linguistic style, mixing modern and rabbinic Hebrew. 

In 1966, he shared the Nobel Prize in Literature with the poet Nelly Sachs.

==Biography==

Shmuel Yosef Halevi Czaczkes (later Agnon) was born in Buczacz (&quot;Butschatsch&quot; in German), Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, then within the Austro-Hungary and now Buchach, Ukraine. Officially, his date of birth in the Hebrew calendar was 18 Av 5648 (July 26). However, he always said his birthday was on the fast day of Tisha B&#x27;Av, the commemoration of many disasters in Jewish history.

His father, Shalom Mordechai Halevy, was ordained as a rabbi but worked in the fur trade and had many connections among the Hasidim. His mother&#x27;s side had ties to the Misnagdim, a parallel religious movement opposed to Hasidic Judaism.

Shmuel did not attend school; he was schooled by his parents. In addition to studying Jewish texts, Agnon studied writings of the Haskalah, and was also tutored in Standard German. At the age of eight, he began to write in Hebrew and Yiddish. At the age of 15, he published his first poem – a Yiddish poem about the Kabbalist Joseph della Reina. He continued to write poems and stories in Hebrew and Yiddish that were published in Galicia.

In 1908, he moved to Jaffa in Ottoman Palestine. The first story he published there was &quot;Agunot&quot; (&quot;Chained Wives&quot;), which appeared that same year in the journal &quot;Ha`omer.&quot; He used the pen name &quot;Agnon,&quot; derived from the title of the story, which he adopted as his official surname in 1924. In 1910, &quot;Forsaken Wives&quot; was translated into German. In 1912, at the urging of Yosef Haim Brenner, he published a novella, &quot;Vehaya Ha&#x27;akov Lemishor&quot; (&quot;The Crooked Shall Be Made Straight&quot;).

In 1913, Agnon moved to the German Empire, where he met Esther Marx (1889-1973), the sister of Alexander Marx. They married in 1920 and had two children. In Germany, he lived in Berlin and Bad Homburg vor der Höhe (1921–24). Salman Schocken, a businessman and later also publisher, became his literary patron and freed him from financial worries. From 1931 on, his work was published by Schocken Books, and his short stories appeared regularly in the newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, also owned by the Schocken family. He continued to write short stories in Germany and collaborated with Martin Buber on an anthology of Hasidic stories. Many of his early books appeared in Buber&#x27;s &quot;Jüdischer Verlag&quot; (Berlin). The assimilated, secular German Jews, Buber and Franz Rosenzweig among them, considered Agnon a legitimate relic, religious man familiar with Jewish scripture. Gershom Scholem called him &quot;the Jews&#x27; Jew&quot;.

In 1924, a fire broke out in his home, destroying his manuscripts and rare book collection. This traumatic event crops up occasionally in his stories. Later that year, Agnon returned to Palestine and settled with his family in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Talpiot. In 1929, his library was destroyed again during anti-Jewish riots.

Agnon&#x27;s place in Hebrew literature was assured when his novel &quot;Hakhnasat Kalla&quot; (&quot;The Bridal Canopy&quot;) appeared in 1931 to critical acclaim. In 1935, he published &quot;Sippur Pashut&quot; (&quot;A Simple Story&quot;), a novella set in Buchach at the end of the 19th century. Another novel, &quot;Tmol Shilshom&quot; (&quot;Only Yesterday&quot;), set in early 20th century Palestine, appeared in 1945.

Agnon was a strict vegetarian in his personal life.

During much of the 20th century, there was debate about whether Agnon or Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog was the actual author of the Prayer for the Welfare of the State of Israel in 1948. Herzog was generally considered the author until a 1983 article in &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; by scholar David Tamar raised the possibility of Agnon&#x27;s authorship. However, findings by scholar Yoel Rappel and corroborated by the National Library of Israel in 2018 confirmed Herzog&#x27;s authorship but confirmed that Agnon had edited the work.

==Literary themes and influences==

Agnon&#x27;s writing has been the subject of extensive academic research. Many leading scholars of Hebrew literature have published books and papers on his work, among them Baruch Kurzweil, Dov Sadan, Nitza Ben-Dov, Dan Miron, Dan Laor and Alan Mintz. Agnon writes about Jewish life, but with his own unique perspective and special touch. In his Nobel acceptance speech, Agnon claimed &quot;Some see in my books the influences of authors whose names, in my ignorance, I have not even heard, while others see the influences of poets whose names I have heard but whose writings I have not read.&quot; He went on to detail that his primary influences were the stories of the Bible. Agnon acknowledged that he was also influenced by German literature and culture, and European literature in general, which he read in German translation. A collection of essays on this subject, edited in part by Hillel Weiss, with contributions from Israeli and German scholars, was published in 2010: &quot;Agnon and Germany: The Presence of the German World in the Writings of S.Y. Agnon&quot;. The budding Hebrew literature also influenced his works, notably that of his friend, Yosef Haim Brenner. In Germany, Agnon also spent time with the Hebraists Hayim Nahman Bialik and Ahad Ha&#x27;am.

The communities he passed through in his life are reflected in his works:
* Galicia: in the books &quot;The Bridal Canopy&quot;, &quot;A City and the Fullness Thereof&quot;, &quot;A Simple Story&quot; and &quot;A Guest for the Night&quot;.
* Germany: in the stories &quot;Fernheim&quot;, &quot;Thus Far&quot; and &quot;Between Two Cities&quot;.
* Jaffa: in the stories &quot;Oath of Allegiance&quot;, &quot;Tmol Shilshom&quot; and &quot;The Dune&quot;.
* Jerusalem: &quot;Tehilla&quot;, &quot;Tmol Shilshom&quot;, &quot;Ido ve-Inam&quot; and &quot;Shira&quot;.

Nitza Ben-Dov writes about Agnon&#x27;s use of allusiveness, free-association and imaginative dream-sequences, and discusses how seemingly inconsequential events and thoughts determine the lives of his characters.

Some of Agnon&#x27;s works, such as &quot;The Bridal Canopy&quot;, &quot;And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight&quot;, and &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Divorce&quot;, have been adapted for theatre. A play based on Agnon&#x27;s letters to his wife, &quot;Esterlein Yakirati&quot;, was performed at the Khan Theater in Jerusalem.

==Language==
Agnon&#x27;s writing often used words and phrases that differed from what would become established modern Hebrew. His distinct language is based on traditional Jewish sources, such as the Torah and the Prophets, Midrashic literature, the Mishnah, and other Rabbinic literature. Some examples include:

* &quot;batei yadayim&quot; (lit. &quot;hand-houses&quot;) for modern &quot;kfafot&quot; (gloves).
* &quot;yatzta&quot; () rather than the modern conjugation &quot;yatz&#x27;a&quot; () (&quot;she went out&quot;).
* &quot;rotev&quot; () meaning soup in place of modern &quot;marak&quot; (). In Modern Hebrew the term &#x27;rotev&#x27; means &#x27;sauce&#x27;.
* &quot;bet kahava&quot; for modern &quot;bet kafe&quot; (coffee house / café), based on transliteration of the word &#x27;coffee&#x27; from Arabic, rather than the contemporary term common in Hebrew, which comes from European languages.

Bar-Ilan University has made a computerized concordance of his works in order to study his language.

==Awards and critical acclaim==

Agnon was twice awarded the Bialik Prize for literature (1934 and 1950). He was also twice awarded the Israel Prize, for literature (1954 and 1958).

In 1966, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his profoundly characteristic narrative art with motifs from the life of the Jewish people&quot;. The prize was shared with German Jewish author Nelly Sachs. In his speech at the award ceremony, Agnon introduced himself in Hebrew: &quot;As a result of the historic catastrophe in which Titus of Rome destroyed Jerusalem and Israel was exiled from its land, I was born in one of the cities of the Exile. But always I regarded myself as one who was born in Jerusalem&quot;. The award ceremony took place on a Saturday during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Agnon, who was religiously observant, postponed attendance at the awards ceremony until he had performed two Jewish ceremonies of his own on Saturday night, to end the Sabbath and to light the menorah.

In later years, Agnon&#x27;s fame was such that when he complained to the municipality that traffic noise near his home was disturbing his work, the city closed the street to cars and posted a sign that read: &quot;No entry to all vehicles, writer at work!&quot;

==Death and legacy==
 
Agnon died in Jerusalem on February 17, 1970. His daughter, , continued to publish his work posthumously. Agnon&#x27;s archive was transferred by the family to the National Library in Jerusalem. His home in Talpiot, built in 1931 in the Bauhaus style, was turned into a museum, &quot;Beit Agnon.&quot; The study where he wrote many of his works was preserved intact. Agnon&#x27;s image, with a list of his works and his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, appeared on the fifty-shekel bill, second series, in circulation from 1985 to 2014. 

The main street in Jerusalem&#x27;s Givat Oranim neighborhood is called Sderot Shai Agnon, and a synagogue in Talpiot, a few blocks from his home, is named after him. Agnon is also memorialized in Buchach (now in Ukraine). The Historical Museum in Buchach has an exhibit about him and a bust of the author is mounted on a pedestal in a plaza across the street from the house where he lived. The house itself is preserved and marked as the home where Agnon lived from birth till the age of (approximately) 19; the street that runs in front of the house is named &quot;Agnon Street&quot; (in Ukrainian).

Agnotherapy is a method developed in Israel to help elderly people express their feelings.

==Beit Agnon==
After Agnon&#x27;s death, the former mayor of Jerusalem Mordechai Ish-Shalom initiated the opening of his home to the public. In the early 1980s, the kitchen and family dining room were turned into a lecture and conference hall, and literary and cultural evenings were held there. In 2005, the Agnon House Association in Jerusalem renovated the building, which reopened in January 2009. The house was designed by the German-Jewish architect Fritz Korenberg, who was also his neighbor.

<doc id="29551" wikidata="Q355652" url="?curid=29551" title="Steve Ditko">
<text>Stephen John Ditko (; November 2, 1927 – June 29, 2018) was an American comic book artist best known for being the co-creator of Marvel superheroes Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. He also made notable contributions to the character of Iron Man, introducing the character&#x27;s red and yellow design.

Ditko studied under Batman artist Jerry Robinson at the Cartoonist and Illustrators School in New York City. He began his professional career in 1953, working in the studio of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, beginning as an inker and coming under the influence of artist Mort Meskin. During this time, he began his long association with Charlton Comics, where he did work in the genres of science fiction, horror, and mystery. He also co-created the superhero Captain Atom in 1960.

During the 1950s, Ditko also drew for Atlas Comics, a forerunner of Marvel Comics. He went on to contribute much significant work to Marvel. Ditko was the artist for the first 38 issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, co-creating much of the Spider-Man supporting characters and villains with Stan Lee. Beginning with issue #25, Ditko was also credited as the plotter. In 1966, after being the exclusive artist on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and the &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; feature in &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, Ditko left Marvel.

He continued to work for Charlton and also DC Comics, including a revamp of the long-running character the Blue Beetle and creating or co-creating The Question, The Creeper, Shade, the Changing Man, Nightshade, and Hawk and Dove. Ditko also began contributing to small independent publishers, where he created Mr. A, a hero reflecting the influence of Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism. Ditko largely declined to give interviews, saying he preferred to communicate through his work.

He responded to fan mail, sending thousands of handwritten letters during his lifetime.

Ditko was inducted into the comics industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2024, Ditko was named a Disney Legend for his contributions to Publishing.

==Early life==

Stephen John Ditko was born on November 2, 1927, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. His parents were second-generation Americans: children of Rusyn Byzantine Catholic immigrants from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Slovakia). His father, Stefan (&quot;Stephen&quot;), was an artistically talented master carpenter at a steel mill and his mother, Anna (née Balaschak), a homemaker. The second-oldest child in a working-class family, he was preceded by sister Anna Marie, and followed by sister Elizabeth and brother Patrick. Inspired by his father&#x27;s love of newspaper comic strips, particularly Hal Foster&#x27;s &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of the superhero Batman in 1939, and by Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit&quot;, which appeared in a tabloid-sized comic-book insert in Sunday newspapers.

Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian World War II aircraft-spotters. Upon graduating from Greater Johnstown High School in 1945, he enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 26, 1945, and did military service in Allied-occupied Germany, where he drew comics for an Army newspaper.

==Career==

Following his discharge, Ditko learned that his idol, Batman artist Jerry Robinson, was teaching at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later the School of Visual Arts) in New York City. Moving there in 1950, he enrolled in the art school under the G.I. Bill. Robinson found the young student &quot;a very hard worker who really focused on his drawing&quot; and someone who &quot;could work well with other writers as well as write his own stories and create his own characters&quot;, and he helped Ditko acquire a scholarship for the following year. &quot;He was in my class for two years, four or five days a week, five hours a night. It was very intense.&quot; Robinson, who invited artists and editors to speak with his class, once brought in Stan Lee, then editor of Marvel Comics&#x27; 1950s precursor Atlas Comics and, &quot;I think that was when Stan first saw Steve&#x27;s work.&quot;

Ditko began professionally illustrating comic books in early 1953, drawing writer Bruce Hamilton&#x27;s science-fiction story &quot;Stretching Things&quot; for the Key Publications imprint Stanmor Publications, which sold the story to Ajax/Farrell, where it finally found publication in &quot;Fantastic Fears&quot; #5 (cover-dated February 1954). Ditko&#x27;s first published work was his second professional story, the six-page &quot;Paper Romance&quot; in &quot;Daring Love&quot; #1 (October 1953), published by the Key imprint Gillmor Magazines.

Shortly afterward, Ditko found work at the studio of writer-artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, who had created Captain America and other characters. Beginning as an inker on backgrounds, Ditko was soon working with and learning from Mort Meskin, an artist whose work he had long admired. &quot;Meskin was fabulous,&quot; Ditko once recalled. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe the ease with which he drew: strong compositions, loose pencils, yet complete; detail without clutter. I loved his stuff&quot;. Ditko&#x27;s known assistant work includes aiding inker Meskin on the Jack Kirby pencil work of Harvey Comics&#x27; &quot;Captain 3-D&quot; #1 (December 1953). For his own third published story, Ditko penciled and inked the six-page &quot;A Hole in His Head&quot; in &quot;Black Magic&quot; vol. 4, #3 (December 1953), published by Simon &amp; Kirby&#x27;s Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics.

Ditko then began a long association with the Derby, Connecticut, publisher Charlton Comics, a low-budget division of a company best known for song-lyric magazines. Beginning with the cover of &quot;The Thing!&quot; #12 (Feb. 1954) and the eight-page vampire story &quot;Cinderella&quot; in that issue, Ditko would continue to work intermittently for Charlton until the company&#x27;s demise in 1986, producing science fiction, horror and mystery stories, as well as co-creating Captain Atom, with writer Joe Gill, in &quot;Space Adventures&quot; #33 (March 1960). Ditko was allowed a great deal of creative freedom at Charlton due to very little editorial interference. However, the Comics Code Authority was imposed on the comics industry in 1954 due to public concern over graphic violence and horror imagery in comic books, and would prevent Ditko from further developing as a horror artist. He first went on hiatus from the company, and comics altogether, in mid-1954, when he contracted tuberculosis and returned to his parents&#x27; home in Johnstown to recuperate.

===Marvel Comics===
After he recovered, Ditko had originally intended to return to Charlton, but Charlton&#x27;s office had been flooded by Hurricane Diane and operations wouldn&#x27;t resume until months later. Ditko instead moved back to New York City in late 1955 and began drawing for Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics, beginning with the four-page &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Some Changes Made&quot; in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #33 (April 1956); this debut tale would be reprinted in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Curse of the Weird&quot; #4 (March 1994). In 1957, Atlas switched distributors to the American News Company, which shortly afterward lost a Justice Department lawsuit and discontinued its business, leading to Atlas&#x27;s entire staff being laid off. Ditko returned to Charlton afterward and experimented with various drawing styles and genres in series such as &quot;Tales of the Mysterious Traveler&quot; and &quot;This Magazine is Haunted&quot;.

During the summer of 1958, writer-editor Stan Lee invited Ditko back to Atlas. Ditko would go on to contribute a large number of stories, many considered classic, to Atlas/Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Strange Tales&quot; and the newly launched &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;, &quot;Strange Worlds&quot;, &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; and &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, issues of which would typically open with a Kirby-drawn monster story, followed by one or two twist-ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by Don Heck, Paul Reinman, or Joe Sinnott, all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflective short by Ditko and Stan Lee. The first collaboration between Ditko and Lee was &quot;2-Gun Western&quot; #4 (May 1956), which was also Ditko&#x27;s only non-fantasy story.

These Lee-Ditko short stories proved so popular that &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; was reformatted to feature such stories exclusively beginning with issue #7 (Dec. 1961), when the comic was rechristened &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot;, a name intended to reflect its more &quot;sophisticated&quot; nature, as likewise the new tagline &quot;The magazine that respects your intelligence&quot;. Lee in 2009 described these &quot;short, five-page filler strips that Steve and I did together&quot;, originally &quot;placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill&quot;, as &quot;odd fantasy tales that I&#x27;d dream up with O. Henry-type endings.&quot; Giving an early example of what would later be known as the &quot;Marvel Method&quot; of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said, &quot;All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he&#x27;d be off and running. He&#x27;d take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect.&quot;

====Creation of Spider-Man====
After Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee obtained permission from publisher Martin Goodman to create a new &quot;ordinary teen&quot; superhero named &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, Lee originally approached his leading artist, Jack Kirby. Kirby told Lee about his own 1950s character conception, variously called the Silver Spider and Spiderman, in which an orphaned boy finds a magic ring that gives him super powers. Comics historian Greg Theakston says Lee and Kirby &quot;immediately sat down for a story conference&quot; and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. &quot;A day or two later&quot;, Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, and, as Lee recalled, &quot;I hated the way he was doing it. Not that he did it badly — it just wasn&#x27;t the character I wanted; it was too heroic&quot;.

Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual motif Lee found satisfactory, although Lee would later replace Ditko&#x27;s original cover with one penciled by Kirby. Ditko said, &quot;The Spider-Man pages Stan showed me were nothing like the (eventually) published character. In fact, the only drawings of Spider-Man were on the splash [i.e., page 1] and at the end [where] Kirby had the guy leaping at you with a web gun... Anyway, the first five pages took place in the home, and the kid finds a ring and turns into Spider-Man.&quot;
Ditko also recalled that, &quot;One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn&#x27;t have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn&#x27;t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character&#x27;s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character...&quot;

Much earlier, in a rare contemporaneous account, Ditko described his and Lee&#x27;s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in &quot;Comic Fan&quot; #2 (Summer 1965): &quot;Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist &amp; spider signal&quot;. He added he would continue drawing Spider-Man &quot;[i]f nothing better comes along.&quot; That same year, he expressed to the fanzine &quot;Voice of Comicdom&quot;, regarding a poll of &quot;Best Liked&quot; fan-created comics, &quot;It seems a shame, since comics themselves have so little variety of stories and styles that you would deliberately restrict your own creative efforts to professional comics[&#x27;] shallow range. What is &#x27;Best Liked&#x27; by most readers is what they are most familiar in seeing and any policy based on readers likes has to end up with a lot of look-a-like (sic) strips. You have a great opportunity to show everyone a whole new range of ideas, unlimited types of stories and styles—why FLUB it!&quot;

From 1958 to 1968, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate. When either artist was under deadline pressure, it was not uncommon for them to pitch in and help the other with his assignment. Ditko biographer Blake Bell, without citing sources, said, &quot;At one time in history, Ditko denied ever touching Stanton&#x27;s work, even though Stanton himself said they would each dabble in each other&#x27;s art; mainly spot-inking&quot;, and the introduction to one book of Stanton&#x27;s work says, &quot;Eric Stanton drew his pictures in India ink, and they were then hand-coloured by Ditko&quot;. In a 1988 interview with Theakston, Stanton recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was &quot;almost nil&quot;, he and Ditko had &quot;worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands&quot;.

Spider-Man debuted in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (Aug. 1962), the final issue of that science-fiction/fantasy anthology series. When the issue proved to be a top seller, Spider-Man was given his own series, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Lee and Ditko&#x27;s collaboration on the series saw the creation of many of the character&#x27;s best known antagonists including Doctor Octopus in issue #3 (July 1963); the Sandman in #4 (Sept. 1963); the Lizard in #6 (Nov. 1963); Electro in #9 (March 1964); and the Green Goblin in #14 (July 1964). Increasingly irritated by his perception that he was not receiving his due or proper compensation, Ditko demanded credit for the plotting he was contributing under the Marvel Method. Lee acquiesced, and starting with #25 (June 1965), Ditko received plot credit for the stories.

One of the most celebrated issues of the Lee-Ditko run is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc &quot;If This Be My Destiny...!&quot;, and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery. Comics historian Les Daniels noted, &quot;Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider-Man&#x27;s predicament, complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save.&quot; Peter David observed, &quot;After his origin, this two-page sequence from &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #33 is perhaps the best-loved sequence from the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era.&quot; Steve Saffel stated the &quot;full page Ditko image from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #33 is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come.&quot; Matthew K. Manning wrote that &quot;Ditko&#x27;s illustrations for the first few pages of this Lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in Spider-Man&#x27;s history.&quot; The story was chosen as #15 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel&#x27;s readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story, &quot;These first five pages are a modern-day equivalent to Shakespeare as Parker&#x27;s soliloquy sets the stage for his next action. And with dramatic pacing and storytelling, Ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics.&quot;

In this series, Ditko also had a lasting effect on Marvel&#x27;s branding when he inserted a small box on the upper left-hand corner of issue #2 that featured a picture of Spider-Man&#x27;s face along with the company name and price. Stan Lee approved of this visual motif and soon made it a standard feature on all of Marvel&#x27;s subsequent comic books that would last for decades.

Two of the most sought-after Spider-Man collectibles during Ditko&#x27;s time on the series were mail-away items ordered through comic book ads. Ditko art was featured on a very popular t-shirt and on a 6&#x27; tall poster.

====Doctor Strange and other characters====

Ditko created the supernatural hero Doctor Strange in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #110 (July 1963). Ditko in the 2000s told a visiting fan that Lee gave Dr. Strange the first name &quot;Stephen&quot;.

Though often overshadowed by his Spider-Man work, Ditko&#x27;s Doctor Strange artwork has been equally acclaimed for its surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly psychedelic visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. &quot;People who read &#x27;Doctor Strange&#x27; thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e. drug users],&quot; recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer Roy Thomas in 1971, &quot;because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But ... I don&#x27;t use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do.&quot; Ditko, &quot;always the most straight-laced man in comics&quot;, was deeply offended by the suggestion that he used psychedelic drugs to create the worlds of &quot;Dr. Strange&quot;.

Eventually Lee &amp; Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #130–146 (March 1965 – July 1966), Lee and Ditko introduced the cosmic character Eternity, who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos. As historian Bradford W. Wright describes,

The cartoonist and fine artist Seth in 2003 described Ditko&#x27;s style as: 

In addition to Dr. Strange, Ditko in the 1960s also drew comics starring the Hulk and Iron Man. He penciled and inked the final issue of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (#6, March 1963), then continued to collaborate with writer-editor Lee on a relaunched Hulk feature in the omnibus &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, beginning with issue #60 (Oct. 1964). Ditko, inked by George Roussos, penciled the feature through #67 (May 1965). Ditko designed the Hulk&#x27;s primary antagonist, the Leader, in #63 (Jan. 1965).

Ditko also penciled the Iron Man feature in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #47–49 (Nov. 1963 – Jan. 1964), with various inkers. The first of these debuted the initial version of Iron Man&#x27;s modern red-and-golden armor. 

Whichever feature he drew, Ditko&#x27;s idiosyncratic, cleanly detailed, instantly recognizable art style, emphasizing mood and anxiety, found great favor with readers. The character of Spider-Man and his troubled personal life meshed well with Ditko&#x27;s own interests, which Lee eventually acknowledged by giving the artist plotting credits on the latter part of their 38-issue run. But after four years on the title, Ditko left Marvel; he and Lee had not been on speaking terms for some time, with art and editorial changes handled through intermediaries. The details of the rift remain uncertain, even to Lee, who confessed in 2003, &quot;I never really knew Steve on a personal level.&quot; Ditko later claimed it was Lee who broke off contact and disputed the long-held belief that the disagreement was over the true identity of the Green Goblin: &quot;Stan never knew what he was getting in my Spider-Man stories and covers until after [production manager] Sol Brodsky took the material from me ... so there couldn&#x27;t have been any disagreement or agreement, no exchanges ... no problems between us concerning the Green Goblin or anything else from before issue #25 to my final issues&quot;. Spider-Man successor artist John Romita, in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko &quot;ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters. ...&quot; A friendly farewell was given to Ditko in the &quot;Bullpen Bulletins&quot; of comics cover-dated July 1966, including &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #52: &quot;Steve recently told us he was leaving for personal reasons. After all these years, we&#x27;re sorry to see him go, and we wish the talented guy success with his future endeavors.&quot;

Regardless, said Lee in 2007, &quot;Quite a few years ago I met him up at the Marvel offices when I was last in New York. And we spoke; he&#x27;s a hell of a nice guy and it was very pleasant. ... I haven&#x27;t heard from him since that meeting.&quot;

===Charlton and DC Comics===
Back at Charlton—where the page rate was low but creators were allowed greater freedom—Ditko worked on such characters as the Blue Beetle (1967–1968), the Question (1967–1968), and Captain Atom (1965–1967), returning to the character he had co-created in 1960. In addition, in 1966 and 1967, he drew 16 stories, most of them written by Archie Goodwin, for Warren Publishing&#x27;s horror-comic magazines &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;, generally using an ink-wash technique.

In 1967, Ditko gave his Objectivist ideas ultimate expression in the form of Mr. A, published in Wally Wood&#x27;s independent title &quot;witzend&quot; # 3, an underground anthology comic in black and white that avoided the Comics Code Authority by being published in magazine format and only being available by subscription, and whose editorial policy was to allow artistic freedom without any editorial interference. Mr. A is a similar character to the Question, but without being restricted by the Comics Code. Ditko&#x27;s hard line against criminals was controversial and he continued to produce Mr. A stories and one-pagers until the end of the 1970s. Ditko returned to Mr. A in 2000 and in 2009. 
Ditko moved to DC Comics in 1968, where he co-created the Creeper in &quot;Showcase&quot; #73 (April 1968) with Don Segall, under editor Murray Boltinoff. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that Ditko&#x27;s art on the &quot;Creeper&quot; stories made &quot;them look unlike anything else being published by DC at the time.&quot; Ditko co-created the team Hawk and Dove in &quot;Showcase&quot; #75 (June 1968), with writer Steve Skeates. Around this time, he penciled the lead story, written and inked by Wally Wood, in Wood&#x27;s early mature-audience, independent-comics publication &quot;Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon&quot; (1969).

Ditko&#x27;s stay at DC was short—he would work on all six issues of the Creeper&#x27;s own title, &quot;Beware the Creeper&quot; (June 1968 – April 1969), though leaving midway through the final one—and the reasons for his departure uncertain. But while at DC, Ditko recommended Charlton staffer Dick Giordano to the company, who would go on to become a top DC penciller, inker, editor, and ultimately, in 1981, the managing editor.

From this time up through the mid-1970s, Ditko worked exclusively for Charlton and various small press/independent publishers. Frank McLaughlin, Charlton&#x27;s art director during this period, describes Ditko as living &quot;in a local hotel in Derby for a while. He was a very happy-go-lucky guy with a great sense of humor at that time, and always supplied the [female] color separators with candy and other little gifts&quot;.

For Charlton, in 1974, he did Liberty Belle backup stories in &quot;E-Man&quot; and conceived Killjoy. Ditko produced much work for Charlton&#x27;s science-fiction and horror titles, as well as for former Marvel publisher Martin Goodman&#x27;s start-up line Atlas/Seaboard Comics, where he co-created the superhero the Destructor with writer Archie Goodwin, and penciled all four issues of the namesake series (Feb.–Aug. 1975), the first two of which were inked by Wally Wood. Ditko worked on the second and third issues of &quot;Tiger-Man&quot; and the third issue of &quot;Morlock 2001&quot;, with Bernie Wrightson inking.

===After 1975===
Ditko returned to DC Comics in 1975, creating a short-lived title, &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; (1977–1978). Shade was later revived, without Ditko&#x27;s involvement, in DC&#x27;s mature-audience imprint Vertigo. With writer Paul Levitz, he co-created the four-issue sword and sorcery series &quot;Stalker&quot; (1975–1976). Ditko and writer Gerry Conway produced the first issue of a two-issue &quot;Man-Bat&quot; series. He also revived the Creeper and did such various other jobs as a short Demon backup series in 1979, created The Odd Man and stories in DC&#x27;s horror and science-fiction anthologies. Editor Jack C. Harris hired Ditko as guest artist on several issues of &quot;The Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title&#x27;s readership. Ditko also drew the Prince Gavyn version of Starman in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #467–478 (1980). He then decamped to do work for a variety of publishers, briefly contributing to DC again in the mid-1980s, with four pinups of his characters for &quot;Who&#x27;s Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe&quot; and a pinup for &quot;Superman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1984) and its companion portfolio.
Ditko returned to Marvel in 1979, taking over Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Machine Man&quot;, drawing &quot;The Micronauts&quot; and Captain Universe, and continuing to freelance for the company into the late 1990s. Starting in 1984, he penciled the last two years of the space-robot series &quot;Rom&quot;. A Godzilla story by Ditko and Marv Wolfman was changed into a Dragon Lord story published in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot;. Ditko and writer Tom DeFalco introduced the Speedball character in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #22 (1988) and Ditko drew a ten-issue series based on the character.

In 1982, he also began freelancing for the early independent comics label Pacific Comics, beginning with &quot;Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers&quot; #6 (Sept. 1982), in which he introduced the superhero Missing Man, with Mark Evanier scripting to Ditko&#x27;s plot and art. Subsequent Missing Man stories appeared in &quot;Pacific Presents&quot; #1–3 (Oct. 1982 – March 1984), with Ditko scripting the former and collaborating with longtime friend Robin Snyder on the script for the latter two. Ditko also created The Mocker for Pacific, in &quot;Silver Star&quot; #2 (April 1983).

For Eclipse Comics, he contributed a story featuring his character Static (no relation to the later Milestone Comics character) in &quot;Eclipse Monthly&quot; #1–3 (Aug.–Oct. 1983), introducing supervillain the Exploder in #2. With writer Jack C. Harris, Ditko drew the backup feature &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot; in First Comics&#x27; &quot;Warp&quot; #2–4 (April–June 1983). Working with that same writer and others, Ditko drew a handful of the Fly, Flygirl and Jaguar stories for &quot;The Fly&quot; #2–8 (July 1983 – Aug. 1984), for Archie Comics&#x27; short-lived 1980s superhero line; in a rare latter-day instance of Ditko inking another artist, he inked penciler Dick Ayers on the Jaguar story in &quot;The Fly&quot; #9 (Oct. 1984). Western Publishing in 1982 announced a series by Ditko and Harris would appear in a new science-fiction comic, &quot;Astral Frontiers&quot;, but that title never materialized.

Ditko and Harris created &quot;3-D Substance&quot;, a character with the power to turn invisible in a 3-D comic, in 1990. Substance also had the ability to project his voice away from himself, which Ditko demonstrated through the placement of word balloons. In the early 1990s Ditko worked for Jim Shooter&#x27;s newly founded company Valiant Comics, drawing, among others, issues of &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot;, &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; and &quot;X-O-Manowar&quot;. In 1992 Ditko worked with writer Will Murray to produce one of his last original characters for Marvel Comics, the superheroine Squirrel Girl, who debuted in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 2, #8, a.k.a. &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes Winter Special&quot; (Jan. 1992).

In 1992 he had a meeting with Stan Lee, who wanted to work with Ditko on a comic project about a &quot;garbageman superhero from the future&quot;, but he declined because he didn&#x27;t like the future portrayed in the concept. When Lee then suggested they should do a Spider-Man graphic novel together, he declined that too, claiming he no longer had the same feelings for the character that he once had.

In 1993, he did the Dark Horse Comics one-shot &quot;The Safest Place in the World&quot;. For the Defiant Comics series &quot;Dark Dominion,&quot; he drew issue #0, which was released as a set of trading cards. In 1995, he pencilled a four-issue series for Marvel based on the &quot;Phantom 2040&quot; animated TV series. This included a poster that was inked by John Romita Sr. &quot;Steve Ditko&#x27;s Strange Avenging Tales&quot; was announced as a quarterly series from Fantagraphics Books, although it only ran one issue (Feb. 1997) due to publicly unspecified disagreements between Ditko and the publisher.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; assessed in 2008 that, &quot;By the &#x27;70s he was regarded as a slightly old-fashioned odd-ball; by the &#x27;80s he was a commercial has-been, picking up wretched work-for-hire gigs. ...following the example of [Ayn] Rand&#x27;s John Galt, Ditko hacked out moneymaking work, saving his care for the crabbed Objectivist screeds he published with tiny presses. And boy, could Ditko hack: seeing samples of his &quot;Transformers&quot; coloring book and his Big Boy comic is like hearing Orson Welles sell frozen peas.&quot;

Ditko retired from mainstream comics in 1998. His later work for Marvel and DC included such established superheroes as the Sub-Mariner (in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;) and newer, licensed characters such as the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. The last mainstream character he created was Marvel&#x27;s Longarm in &quot;Shadows &amp; Light&quot; #1 (Feb. 1998), in a self-inked, 12-page Iron Man story &quot;A Man&#x27;s Reach...&quot;, scripted by Len Wein. His final mainstream work was a five-page New Gods story for DC Comics, &quot;Infinitely Gentle Infinitely Suffering&quot;, inked by Mick Gray and believed to be intended for the 2000–2002 &quot;Orion&quot; series but not published until the 2008 trade paperback &quot;Tales of the New Gods&quot;.

Thereafter, Ditko&#x27;s solo work was published intermittently by Robin Snyder, who was his editor at Charlton, Archie Comics, and Renegade Press in the 1980s. The Snyder publications have included a number of original books as well as reprints such as &quot;Static&quot;, &quot;The Missing Man&quot;, &quot;The Mocker&quot; and, in 2002, &quot;Avenging World&quot;, a collection of stories and essays spanning 30 years.

In 2008, Ditko and Snyder released &quot;The Avenging Mind&quot;, a 32-page essay publication featuring several pages of new artwork; and &quot;Ditko, Etc...&quot;, a 32-page comic book composed of brief vignettes and editorial cartoons. Releases have continued in that format, with stories introducing such characters as the Hero, Miss Eerie, the Cape, the Madman, the Grey Negotiator, the !? and the Outline. He said in 2012 of his self-published efforts, &quot;I do those because that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ll let me do&quot;.

In addition to the new material, Ditko and Snyder reprinted earlier Ditko material. In 2010 they published a new edition of the 1973 &quot;Mr. A&quot; comic and a selection of Ditko covers in &quot;The Cover Series&quot;. In 2011 they published a new edition of the 1975 comic &quot;...Wha...!? Ditko&#x27;s H. Series&quot;.

Two &quot;lost&quot; stories drawn by Ditko in 1978 have been published by DC in hardcover collections of the artist&#x27;s work. A Creeper story scheduled for the never published &quot;Showcase&quot; #106 appears in &quot;The Creeper by Steve Ditko&quot; (2010) and an unpublished &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; story appears in &quot;The Steve Ditko Omnibus Vol. 1&quot; (2011). A Hulk and the Human Torch story written by Jack C. Harris and drawn by Ditko in the 1980s was published by Marvel as &quot;Incredible Hulk and the Human Torch: From the Marvel Vault&quot; #1 in August 2011.

==Personal life ==
As of 2012, Ditko continued to work in Manhattan&#x27;s Midtown West neighborhood. He mostly declined to give interviews or make public appearances, explaining in 1969 that, &quot;When I do a job, it&#x27;s not my personality that I&#x27;m offering the readers but my artwork. It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m like that counts; it&#x27;s what I did and how well it was done. I produce a product, a comic art story. Steve Ditko is the brand name.&quot; However, he did contribute numerous essays to Robin Snyder&#x27;s fanzine &quot;The Comics&quot;.

He had a nephew who became an artist, also named Steve Ditko. As far as it is known, he never married and had no surviving children at the time of his death. Will Eisner stated that Ditko had a son out of wedlock, but this may have been a confused reference to the nephew.

Politically, Ditko supported a &quot;constitutional republic&quot; and &quot;individual&quot; and &quot;property rights&quot;, describing them as &quot;inalienable&quot;. He supported neither George W. Bush nor John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election due to believing neither would prioritize them.

Ditko said in 2012 that he had made no income on the four &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films released to that time. However, a neighbor of Ditko stated that Ditko received royalty checks. Those involved with creating the 2016 film &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; purposely declined to contact him during production, believing they would not be welcome.

Ditko described himself as an atheist.

===Objectivism===
Ditko was an ardent supporter of Objectivism. The philosophy of Ayn Rand had &quot;forever changed [Ditko&#x27;s] outlook on morality, finances and his mission as a comic-book creator&quot;. After Ditko had received greater control of the plotting, he began revering the role of policemen in his Spider-Man work. Ditko had once told his Charlton co-worker Pete Morisi, a policeman who moonlighted as a comic book artist, that he envied Morisi for being able to arrest criminals. Randian philosophy had influenced Ditko to demand being credited and compensated as both the plotter and artist for Spider-Man beginning in issue #25, which Stan Lee (now credited as &quot;scripter&quot;) allowed, though their working relationship would begin deteriorating. Other ways Ditko incorporated Randian views into Spider-Man were by having Peter Parker become more aggressive, demand better pay for his Spider-Man photos, and show contempt for student protestors. Marvel publisher Martin Goodman had been worried that Parker&#x27;s hard right-wing politics would distance the character from most left-leaning, countercultural university students, and disputes with Goodman over royalties had led to Ditko leaving Marvel. Ditko later expressed his Objectivist views even further with the Question, who criticized the apathy of the public toward right and wrong, and Mr. A, who refused to save villains from death.

He also described himself as an Aristotelian.

== Death ==
Ditko was found unresponsive in his apartment in New York City on June 29, 2018. Police said he had died within the previous two days. He was pronounced dead at the age of 90, with the cause of death initially deemed as a result of a heart attack, brought on by arteriosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

The final words of Ditko&#x27;s last essay, published posthumously in &quot;Down Memory Lane&quot; in February 2019, quoted an &quot;old toast&quot;: &quot;Here&#x27;s to those who wish me well, and those that don&#x27;t can go to hell.&quot;

In June 2021, Ditko&#x27;s nephew Mark Ditko was interviewed and discussed his history with his uncle and his legacy, dispelling myths about him while also discussing his work with the Bottleworks Exhibition which houses a Steve Ditko Exhibition. He also shared rare photos among many other facts.

== Legacy ==
In 2021, Steve Ditko&#x27;s younger brother Patrick, executor of his estate, in cooperation with the estates of artistic colleagues Don Heck, Gene Colan and Don Rico filed a lawsuit to terminate and reclaim the copyrights for their characters from Marvel Comics under the justification of the Copyright Act of 1976. Marvel countersued the litigants citing the same law since the creations were made under work for hire contracts, the company had full ownership. While the other participants settled in June 2023, the Ditko estate persisted until December 8, 2023. Although the settlements are confidential, Marvel&#x27;s full ownership of the copyrights was secured for undisclosed sums to the creators.

In June 2022, a mural was completed in Ditko&#x27;s hometown. Approved by Marvel Comics, and featuring his two most well-known characters (Spider-Man and Dr. Strange), the outline of the artwork was printed upon large white sheets of durable material. Community members painted upon the sheets during the winter and spring months, and then they were attached to a 28-foot tall wall.

Ditko was honored as a Disney Legend for his contributions to Marvel, and by extension the Walt Disney Company, at the 2024 D23 Expo.

==Artistic style==
Ditko preferred to introduce characters before giving them a proper origin story (which he called &quot;legends&quot;), believing that a character should first be proven worthy of having their origins told. For example, Doctor Strange first appeared abruptly in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #110 before his origin was revealed in issue #115, which Stan Lee attributed to the pair forgetting to tell but was in fact intentional.

==BBC documentary==
In September 2007, presenter Jonathan Ross hosted a one-hour documentary for BBC Four titled &quot;In Search of Steve Ditko&quot;. The program covers Ditko&#x27;s work at Marvel, DC, and Charlton Comics and at Wally Wood&#x27;s &quot;witzend&quot;, as well as his following of Objectivism. It includes testimonials by writers and artists Alan Moore, Mark Millar, Jerry Robinson and Stan Lee, among others. Ross, accompanied by writer Neil Gaiman, met Ditko briefly at his New York office, but he declined to be filmed, interviewed or photographed. He did, however, give the two a selection of some comic books. At the end of the show, Ross said he had since spoken to Ditko on the telephone and, as a joke, that he was now on first name terms with him.

<text>Gavinus () is a Christian saint who is greatly celebrated in Sardinia, Italy, as one of the Martyrs of Torres (), along with his companions Protus, a bishop, and Januarius, a deacon.

==Narrative==
He was a Roman soldier martyred for the Christian faith during the persecution of Diocletian in 304 in the city of Porto Torres (), according to the legend, on the orders of the governor (&quot;preside&quot;) of Sardinia and Corsica, a certain Barbarus.

The earliest &quot;passio&quot; dates to the 12th century:
Barbaro, who had been sent to Corsica and Sardinia, reached Turres and published the imperial edicts against the Christians, was denounced by Proto, Gavino and Gianuario. They were summoned to the tribunal and being steadfast in refusing to sacrifice to the gods, were summarily beheaded.

A second, longer, &quot;passio&quot;, from the middle of the thirteenth century, follows standard medieval hagiographical conventions. In this, Protus and Januarius are arrested and subjected to torture. Gavinus is a soldier conveying them to prison. Impressed with their courage, he releases them and asks for their prayers. The next day Gavinus was arrested for failing to produce his prisoners, and when he declared himself a Christian, was beheaded on the shore. Hearing that Gavinus had preceded them in martyrdom, Protus and Januarius returned to the city, were arrested, and likewise beheaded. The story of the martyrdom was distributed in nine readings for use in the recitation of Matins.

==Legacy==

The well-known Romanesque church of San Gavino in Gavoi is dedicated to him, as is the town of San Gavino Monreale, and a number of communes in Corsica.

The 11th-century Basilica of San Gavino in Porto Torres, is also dedicated to this saint. It was built by Comita or Gomida, Judge of Torres, and contains the relics, not only of Gavinus, but also of his companions, Protus and Januarius. According to legend, Gavinus appeared to Comita and requested he build the church. The relics of the saints were discovered in the crypt 1614.

==Patronage==
Gavinus is one of the patron saints of Sassari.

Gavinus is the patron saint of Porto Torres, Sardinia, and of Camposano, Campania. 

His feast day is given in the Roman Martyrology as 30 May.

<doc id="29559" wikidata="Q899318" url="?curid=29559" title="Sienna">
<text>Sienna (from , meaning &quot;Earth of Siena&quot;) is an earth pigment containing iron oxide and manganese oxide. In its natural state, it is yellowish brown, and it is called raw sienna. When heated, it becomes a reddish brown, and it is called burnt sienna. It takes its name from the city-state of Siena, where it was produced during the Renaissance. Along with ochre and umber, it was one of the first pigments to be used by humans, and is found in many cave paintings. Since the Renaissance, it has been one of the brown pigments most widely used by artists.

The first recorded use of &quot;sienna&quot; as a color name in English was in 1760.

The for sienna are identical to kobe, first recorded as a color name in English in 1924.

==Earth colors==
Like the other earth colors, such as yellow ochre and umber, sienna is a clay which is partially composed of iron oxides. In the case of sienna, the most prevalent iron oxides are limonite (which in its natural state has a yellowish color), and goethite. In addition to iron oxides, natural or raw sienna is also composed of manganese oxide, which makes it darker than ochre. Aluminum oxides have also been found in the soil at very low levels. When heated, the limonite and goethite is dehydrated and turns partially to hematite, which gives it a reddish-brown color.
Sienna is lighter in shade than raw umber, which is also clay with iron oxide, but which has a significantly higher content of manganese (5 to 20 percent) making it greenish brown or dark brown in color. When heated, raw umber becomes burnt umber, a very dark brown.

==History==
The pigment sienna was known and used in its natural form by the ancient Romans. It was mined near Arcidosso (formerly under Sienese control, now in the province of Grosseto) on Monte Amiata in southern Tuscany. It was called &quot;terra rossa&quot; (red earth), &quot;terra gialla&quot; (yellow earth), or terra di Siena&quot;.&quot;

In the Middle Ages the sienna pigments were used by artists such as Duccio di Buoninsegna and other painters who lived and worked in and around the Republic of Siena. Duccio was painting with earth pigments in the late 13th century until his death in the early 14th century.

During the Renaissance, Giorgio Vasari made note of the pigment under the name terra rossa. Along with umber and yellow ochre, sienna became one of the standard browns used by artists from the 16th to 19th centuries, including Caravaggio (1571–1610) and Rembrandt (1606–1669), who used all three earth colors in his palette. Cross sections of Rembrandt&#x27;s works, analyzed by X-Ray and infrared lenses, reveal that he used variations of sienna to prime his paintings. This was especially true for some of his later works.

Although these artists are known to have used sienna and its variations in their works, scholars have pointed out that the pigment was not commonly referenced by name in European sources until the mid-eighteenth century.

By the 1940s, the traditional Italian sources of the pigment were nearly exhausted. Much of today&#x27;s sienna production is carried out in the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily, while other major deposits are found in the Appalachian Mountains, where it is often found alongside the region&#x27;s iron deposits. It is also still produced in the French Ardennes in the small town of Bonne Fontaine near Ecordal. It is important to note that the chemical composition of the umbers produced in France are distinctly different from the original siennas.

In the 20th century, pigments began to be produced using synthetic iron oxide rather than natural deposits. The labels on paint tubes indicate whether they contain natural or synthetic ingredients. PY-43 indicates natural raw sienna, while PR-102 indicates natural burnt sienna.

== Historical preparation ==
Historically, the pigment was prepared by taking lumps of earth and placing them into a fire either using a crucible or shovel, in order to induce the necessary chemical reaction. In some seventeenth-century accounts, the lumps of earth are supposed to be pulverized, or at least broken down into smaller pieces, first. However, the instructions from the time period are inconsistent. Furthermore, the amount of time that the pigment needs to be heated is based on what the artist preparing the pigment desires. Generally, a longer exposure to heat leads to a deeper red hue.

==Shades and variations==

Sienna varies slightly in shade and hue based on the chemical composition of the soil and the temperature and length of time in which it is prepared. A higher composition of iron oxide in the soil leads to a deeper red pigment.

There is no single agreed standard for the color of sienna, and the name is used today for a wide variety of hues and shades. They vary by country and color list, and there are many proprietary variations offered by paint companies. The color box at the top of the article shows one variation from the ISCC-NBS color list.

===Raw sienna===

Raw sienna is a yellowish-brown natural earth pigment, composed primarily of iron oxide hydroxide. The box shows the color of the pigment in its natural, or raw state. It contains a large quantity of iron oxide and a small quantity (about five percent) of manganese oxide.

This kind of pigment is known as yellow ochre, yellow earth, limonite, or terra gialla. The pigment name for natural raw sienna from the Color Index International, shown on the labels of oil paints, is PY-43.

This box at right shows a variation of raw sienna from the Italian Ferrario 1919 color list.
===Burnt sienna===
Burnt sienna contains a large proportion of anhydrous iron oxide. It is made by heating raw sienna, which dehydrates the iron oxide, changing it partially to hematite, giving it rich reddish-brown color.

The pigment is also known as red earth, red ochre, and terra rossa. On the Color Index International, the pigment is known as PR-102.

This version is from the Italian Ferrario 1919 color list.

The first recorded use of &quot;burnt sienna&quot; as a color name in English was in 1853.

====Burnt sienna pigment (Maerz and Paul)====

This variation of burnt sienna is from the Maerz and Paul &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; from 1930. It is considerably lighter than most other versions of burnt sienna. It was a mix of burnt orange and raw sienna.
===Dark sienna (ISCC-NBS)===

This infobox shows the color dark sienna from the ISCC-NBS color list.
===Sienna (X11 color)===

The web color sienna is defined by the list of X11 colors used in web browsers and web design.

<doc id="29564" wikidata="Q1073479" url="?curid=29564" title="Super Bowl XXXVI">
<text>Super Bowl XXXVI was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion St. Louis Rams and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2001 season. The underdog Patriots defeated the heavily favored Rams by the score of 20–17. It was New England&#x27;s first Super Bowl championship, and the franchise&#x27;s first league championship of any kind. The game was also notable for snapping the AFC East&#x27;s long streak of not being able to win a Super Bowl championship, as the division&#x27;s teams had lost 8 Super Bowls between the Miami Dolphins&#x27; victory in 1974 and the Patriots&#x27; 2002 win. This was the last Super Bowl to feature the St. Louis Rams; after relocating to Los Angeles in 2016, the Rams returned to the NFL&#x27;s championship game in Super Bowl LIII, in which they were again defeated by the Patriots. The Rams would not win another Super Bowl until Super Bowl LVI, as the Los Angeles Rams, defeating the Cincinnati Bengals.

The game was played at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, on February 3, 2002. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 earlier in the season, the NFL postponed a week of regular-season games and moved the league&#x27;s playoff schedule back. As a result, Super Bowl XXXVI was rescheduled from the original date of January 27 to February 3, becoming the first Super Bowl played in February. The pregame ceremonies and the halftime show headlined by the Irish rock band U2 honored the victims of 9/11. Due to heightened security measures following the attacks, this was the first Super Bowl designated as a National Special Security Event (NSSE) by the Office of Homeland Security (OHS). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which replaced the OHS in 2003, later established the practice of naming each subsequent Super Bowl an NSSE. Additionally, it was the last Super Bowl to be played in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina ravaged the city on August 29, 2005; the first since then was Super Bowl XLVII in 2013.

This game marked the Rams&#x27; third Super Bowl appearance in franchise history and the second in three seasons. St. Louis posted an NFL-best 14–2 regular season record, led by quarterback Kurt Warner and &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot; offense. The Patriots clinched their third Super Bowl berth after posting an 11–5 regular season record, led by second-year quarterback and first-year starter Tom Brady and a defense that ended the regular season ranked sixth in scoring.

Although the Rams out-gained the Patriots 427–267 in total yards, New England built a 17–3 third-quarter lead off three Rams turnovers. After a holding penalty in the fourth quarter negated a Patriots fumble return for a touchdown, Warner scored a 2-yard touchdown run and threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to tie the game, 17–17, with 1:30 remaining. Without any timeouts, Brady led his team down the field to set up kicker Adam Vinatieri&#x27;s game-winning 48-yard field goal as time expired. Brady, who completed 16 of 27 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown, was named Super Bowl MVP. With the Rams being 14-point favorites, it was the biggest upset in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl III and, as of the 2023 season, the biggest upset since the AFL–NFL merger. Many media outlets regard this Super Bowl as one of the best Super Bowls of all time, and one of the most historically significant Super Bowls due to its finale that launched the New England Patriots dynasty. During the NFL&#x27;s 100th anniversary, this game was ranked as No. 20 of the NFL&#x27;s Greatest Games of all time.

==Background==

===Teams===

====St. Louis Rams====
After the Rams’ 1999 season that had culminated in a gripping victory over the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV, their offense again dominated the league in 2000, leading the NFL in passing, scoring, and total yards. However, the Rams had one of the worst defenses in the league, ranking last in points allowed (471). This, along with injury problems and a coaching change from championship-winning coach Dick Vermeil – who resigned just 48 hours after the game – to his offensive coordinator Mike Martz, caused the Rams to slip to a 10–6 record in 2000. The season ended with a disappointing loss to the New Orleans Saints in the wild card round of the playoffs.

After signing several new defensive players in the off-season, and hiring new defensive coordinator Lovie Smith, the Rams finished the 2001 season with the NFL&#x27;s best regular season record at 14–2. They led the league in both total offensive yards (6,930) and scoring (503). This was the Rams&#x27; third consecutive season with over 500 points, an NFL record. On defense, they only allowed 271 points, improving their 31st ranking in 2000 to 7th in 2001.

The Rams&#x27; 1999–2001 offense, nicknamed &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot;, is widely considered one of the best in NFL history. The team possessed an incredible amount of offensive talent at nearly every position. In 2001, quarterback Kurt Warner had the best season of his career and was awarded his second and final NFL Most Valuable Player Award after throwing for 4,830 yards and 36 touchdowns, but he also threw 22 interceptions, and earned a league high 101.4 passer rating. Wide receivers Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce each amassed over 1,100 receiving yards, combining for 142 receptions, 2,469 yards, and 13 touchdowns. Wide receiver Ricky Proehl caught 40 passes for 563 yards and 5 touchdowns. Tight end Ernie Conwell caught 38 passes for 431 yards and 4 touchdowns. Wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim caught 39 passes for 374 yards, and added another 333 yards returning punts.

Halfback Marshall Faulk won NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award for the third year in a row in 2001. He rushed for 1,382 yards, caught 83 passes for 765 yards, scored 21 touchdowns, and became the first NFL player ever to gain more than 2,000 combined rushing and receiving yards for 4 consecutive seasons. Running back Trung Canidate was also a major contributor, rushing for 441 yards, catching 17 passes for 154 yards, returning kickoffs for 748 yards, and scoring 6 touchdowns. The Rams offensive line was led by guard Adam Timmerman and offensive tackle Orlando Pace, who was selected to the Pro Bowl for the third consecutive year.

The Rams&#x27; defense ranked third in the league in fewest yards allowed (4,733). The line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end Leonard Little, who led the team with 14.5 sacks and recovered a fumble, and defensive end Grant Wistrom, who recorded 9 sacks, 2 interceptions, and 1 fumble recovery. The Rams linebackers unit was led by London Fletcher, who had 4.5 sacks, 2 interceptions, and 4 forced fumbles. St. Louis also had an outstanding secondary, led by Dré Bly (6 interceptions, 150 return yards, and 2 touchdowns), Pro Bowl selection Aeneas Williams (4 interceptions, 69 return yards, 2 touchdowns), and Dexter McCleon (4 interceptions, 66 yards).

The Rams also bested the Patriots in a nationally televised ESPN Sunday night game on November 18 at Foxboro Stadium. Although the Patriots jumped out to an early lead, a critical turnover before the end of the first half that led to a Rams score proved costly. In the second half, the Rams wore New England down and won 24–17. The Rams lost four of their defensive players with injuries. The Patriots&#x27; physical play led Rams coach Mike Martz to say after the game that the Patriots were &quot;a Super Bowl–caliber team.&quot;

====New England Patriots====
The Patriots&#x27; chances for a Super Bowl appearance seemed bleak shortly after the season had begun. Before the season started, quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein died of a heart attack at age 45. The Patriots, coached by Bill Belichick, lost their first two games, and in their second loss at home to the New York Jets, starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe suffered a sheared blood vessel on a hit by Jets linebacker Mo Lewis that caused him to miss several weeks. His replacement was second-year quarterback Tom Brady, a sixth-round draft pick who had thrown only three passes in 2000. Also, midway through the season, wide receiver Terry Glenn, the team&#x27;s leading receiver in 2000, was benched due to off-the-field problems. He had been suspended the first four games for failing a drug test and played in just four more before injuries and disputes with the coaching staff caused Belichick to deactivate him for good.
Upon assuming the role of starting quarterback, Brady enjoyed immediate success in the regular season, leading New England to a 44–13 win over the Indianapolis Colts in his first start and eventually to an 11–5 record. He completed 63.9 percent of his passes for 2,843 yards and 18 touchdowns with 12 interceptions and was selected to the Pro Bowl. Veteran Pro Bowl wide receiver Troy Brown was the main receiving threat, recording 101 receptions for 1,199 yards and 5 touchdowns, while also adding another 413 yards and 2 touchdowns returning punts. His 14.2 yards per punt return average led the NFL. Wide receiver David Patten also was productive, catching 51 passes for 749 yards and 4 touchdowns. Running back Antowain Smith provided the team with a stable running game, rushing for 1,157 yards, catching 19 passes for 192 yards, and scoring 13 touchdowns.

New England was outstanding on defense as well. Up front, linemen Bobby Hamilton (7 sacks, 1 fumble recovery) and rookie Richard Seymour excelled at pressuring quarterbacks and stuffing the run. Behind them, the Patriots had three outstanding linebackers: Mike Vrabel (2 interceptions, 3 sacks), Willie McGinest (5 sacks), and Tedy Bruschi (2 interceptions). The secondary also featured outstanding talent such as defensive back Otis Smith, who led the team with five interceptions for 181 yards and two touchdowns. Cornerback Ty Law intercepted three passes, returning them for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Safety Lawyer Milloy had two interceptions during the season, and was selected along with Law to represent the New England defense in the Pro Bowl. The defense ended the season ranked sixth in scoring, but 24th in total yards allowed. Following their loss to the Rams at home, the Patriots dropped to 5–5, but did not lose again the rest of the season to clinch a first-round bye in the AFC playoffs.

Coincidentally, this was the third straight time that the New England Patriots&#x27; Super Bowl appearance would be at the Superdome, joining the Dallas Cowboys as the only teams to play three different Super Bowls in one stadium; the Cowboys had played three at the old Miami Orange Bowl in the 1970s. In their maiden Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XX (1986), the Patriots lost 46–10 – the biggest margin of victory in a Super Bowl to that point – to a Chicago Bears team coached by Mike Ditka and including Mike Singletary and Walter Payton. The Patriots returned to the Superdome 11 years later for Super Bowl XXXI but lost 35–21 to a Green Bay Packers team including Brett Favre, Reggie White and Desmond Howard and coached by Mike Holmgren. Milloy, Law, Vinatieri, Bledsoe, McGinest, Bruschi, and Otis Smith were among the players who had played in that game while Belichick had been assistant head coach to Bill Parcells. The Patriots did not appear in a Super Bowl hosted by another city until the team played in Super Bowl XXXVIII two years later in Houston, Texas.

===Playoffs===
The Rams began their postseason run with a 45–17 win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC divisional round. Expected to be a close shootout between Warner and Packers quarterback Brett Favre, the Rams defense dominated the Packers by intercepting a playoff record 6 passes from Favre and returning 3 of them for touchdowns. The Rams offense also racked up 24 points on 2 touchdown passes by Warner, a touchdown run by Faulk, and a field goal by Jeff Wilkins, helping St. Louis put the game away by the end of the third quarter.

One week later, the Rams advanced to the Super Bowl with a 29–24 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship Game. Philadelphia managed to build a 17–13 halftime lead, but St. Louis scored 16 consecutive second half points (2 touchdown runs by Faulk and a Wilkins field goal) to earn the win, limiting the Eagles to only one touchdown pass in the second half. Warner finished the game with 22 of 33 pass completions for 212 yards and a touchdown, with no interceptions, while Faulk rushed for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns.

In the AFC Divisional Round, the Patriots defeated the Oakland Raiders 16–13 during a raging New England snowstorm in the last game ever played at Foxboro Stadium. The signature moment of the game was a controversial ruling by referee Walt Coleman in the fourth quarter that caused this game to be commonly known as the &quot;Tuck Rule Game.&quot; While the Patriots possessed the ball, trailing the Raiders 13–10 with under two minutes left in regulation and no time outs, Brady was sacked by defensive back Charles Woodson, and appeared to fumble the ball. The fumble was recovered by Raiders linebacker Greg Biekert, presumably ending the game with a Raiders victory. After reviewing the play using instant replay, Coleman reversed the call on the field pursuant to the &quot;tuck rule&quot;, where a loose ball is ruled an incomplete pass if lost while &quot;tucking&quot; the ball. Most of the controversy centered on whether Brady was still trying to tuck the ball away when he lost control. Brady then led his team to the Raiders 27-yard line, where kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 45-yard field goal which barely cleared the crossbar to send the game into overtime. The Patriots won the toss in overtime and won on another Vinatieri field goal from 23 yards; per the overtime rules in place at that time. Oakland&#x27;s offense never regained possession.

In the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots traveled to Heinz Field to face the Pittsburgh Steelers, who were coming off a 27–10 win over the previous season&#x27;s Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. New England scored first with a 55-yard punt return touchdown by Brown, but in the second quarter, Brady was knocked out of the game with a sprained ankle. He was replaced by Bledsoe in Bledsoe&#x27;s first game action since being injured in September. Upon entering the game, Bledsoe quickly moved the Patriots down the field and threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Patten to give the Patriots a 14–3 halftime lead. Early in the second half, the Steelers moved from their own 32 to the New England 16, where they lined up for a field goal by Kris Brown. However, Brandon Mitchell blocked the kick, Brown picked up the ball at the 40 and ran 11 yards before lateraling to Antwan Harris, who took it 49 yards for a touchdown that made the score 21–3. But Pittsburgh scored two third-quarter touchdowns to make the score 21–17. The Patriots ended the comeback attempt by scoring a field goal in the fourth quarter and intercepting 2 passes from Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart in the final 3 minutes of the game.

===Host selection process===
NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXXVI to New Orleans during their October 28, 1998 meeting in Kansas City, Missouri. Two cities made presentations, the other being San Diego (Qualcomm Stadium). San Francisco (Candlestick Park) had planned to pursue XXXVI, but due to logistical complications, withdrew themselves from consideration, and switched their proposal to XXXVII. With only two choices, the league set up a two-round voting system. A city would win if they received of the vote during the first round. If neither city won during the first round, the second round would revert to a simple majority. New Orleans won on the second ballot over San Diego in what was described as a &quot;close vote&quot;. This was the ninth time that New Orleans hosted the game, and fifth time it would be played in the Superdome.

Immediately after the vote, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue made an unexpected and largely unprecedented announcement that San Diego was the favorite to host the next available Super Bowl. With San Francisco tentatively scheduled to host XXXVII in 2003, San Diego was thought likely to host XXXVIII in 2004. However, the league took XXXVII away from San Francisco after plans for a new stadium fell through, and the 2003 game ultimately went to San Diego.

===Effect of the September 11, 2001, attacks===
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks led the league to postpone its September 16 games and play them a week after the scheduled conclusion of the regular season. This caused the playoffs and Super Bowl to be delayed by one week. Rescheduling Super Bowl XXXVI from January 27 to February 3 proved extraordinarily difficult. In addition to rescheduling the game itself, all related events and activities had to be accommodated. This marked the first time in NFL history that the Super Bowl was played in February; all subsequent Super Bowls (excluding XXXVII in 2003) have been played in February. In turn, this and the games from XXXVIII (2004) to LV (2021) were to now be played on the first Sunday in February. The NFL expanded its season from 16 to 17 regular season games, and LVI (2022) became the first to be played on the second Sunday of the month.

Historically, the NFL made allowance for an open weekend between the Conference Championship games and the Super Bowl. However, there was not one scheduled for 2001, due to the NFL&#x27;s decision beginning in the 1999 season to move the opening week of games to the weekend after Labor Day. Because the date of the Super Bowl had been set through 2003, the bye week prior to the Super Bowl did not return until 2004.

The NFL and New Orleans officials worked diligently to put together a deal to reschedule the game. The league considered a number of options, including shortening the regular season, shortening the playoffs, condensing the three playoff rounds in two weeks, and moving the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. It was eventually decided to make every effort to maintain a full regular season and playoff, and push the Super Bowl back to February 3. Additionally, due to the Super Bowl being moved back a week, the first weekend of New Orleans Mardi Gras parades rolled one week earlier than normal.

One of the most significant logistical challenges was accommodating the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) Convention, which was originally slated to occupy the Superdome on February 3. On October 3, 2001, the NFL announced its intentions to hold the game on February 3, even though no agreement had been reached with NADA. Several weeks later, the three parties came to an accord in which the NADA agreed to move its convention date to the original Super Bowl week in exchange for financial and other considerations, including promotional spots shown during selected regular season NFL games. This agreement permitted the NFL to move the game back to February 3, and allowed for a full standard playoff tournament.
The original logo for Super Bowl XXXVI had a style that reflected the host city, and was distributed on some memorabilia items during 2001. However, after the 9/11 attacks, a new logo reflecting American patriotism was designed, featuring the shape of the 48 contiguous states and the American flag colors of red, white, and blue. Rob Tornoe of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; noted that it had &quot;become one of the most iconic logos in Super Bowl history&quot;.

Janet Jackson was originally scheduled to perform during the Halftime Show, but allowed U2 to perform to tribute the events of September 11 (Jackson would perform at the halftime show two years later).

===Venue===
This was the final Super Bowl played on the first-generation AstroTurf surface. From 2000 to 2005, NFL stadiums phased out the short-pile AstroTurf in favor of natural grass or other, newer artificial surfaces which closely simulate grass, like FieldTurf.

Prior to Super Bowl XXXVI, Superdome officials considered installing natural grass for the game. The proposed installation method was comparable to what had been used at the Silverdome during the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and at Giants Stadium from 2000 to 2002. The plan called for large trays of grass to be grown and cultivated outdoors, then brought inside the dome and placed on the field for the game. In the end, cost and quality concerns prompted stadium and league officials to abandon the project.

===Pregame notes===
The Rams entered as 14-point favorites. This was partly because Rams quarterback Kurt Warner statistically had his best year of his career, with a quarterback rating of 101.4, a 68.7 percent completion rate, and threw for 4,830 yards. Many had believed that the Patriots&#x27; Cinderella story was simply a fluke, especially after beating the veteran Oakland Raiders in a controversial playoff game in which a recovered fumble by the Raiders was reversed by the tuck rule.

There had been speculation on whether longtime starter Drew Bledsoe might start the game. As stated above, Bledsoe replaced an injured Brady against the Steelers in the AFC Championship game. Eventually, though, Brady was named starter.

This Super Bowl also meant that Boston and St. Louis would play each other in the championship game or series of all four major North American sports leagues at least once, becoming the first time that that had happened between teams from two specific cities or regions. This was the eighth meeting between teams from Boston and St. Louis for a major professional sports championship overall. Previously, 
* In the NHL, the Bruins had swept the Blues in the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals with Game 4 being remembered for Bobby Orr&#x27;s Cup-winning overtime goal that sent him flying.
* In the NBA, the Celtics and Hawks had faced each other in the NBA Finals four times from to , with the Celtics winning three and the Hawks winning one.
* In MLB, the Cardinals had beaten the Red Sox to win the 1946 and 1967 World Series.

The Patriots, as the designated home team, wore their home nautical blue jerseys and silver pants, while the Rams donned their road white jerseys and New Century Gold pants.

==Broadcasting==

The game was broadcast in the United States by Fox. The telecast was presented in a 480p enhanced-definition widescreen format marketed as &quot;Fox Widescreen&quot;. While promoted as having higher quality than standard-definition, and being the first widescreen sports telecast on U.S. television to use a singular telecast for all viewers (rather than using a separate production exclusive to the widescreen feed), it was not true high definition, but still matched the aspect ratio of HDTV sets.

The game was called by play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden. Pam Oliver and Ron Pitts served as sideline reporters. This was Summerall&#x27;s 26th and final Super Bowl broadcast on television or radio (and his 11th doing play by play). It was also the eighth and final Super Bowl telecast, and final NFL telecast of any kind, for the Summerall and Madden announcing team. The two had become the NFL&#x27;s most famous broadcast duo since they were paired together in 1981 on CBS. After this game, Summerall retired from broadcasting and Madden moved to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. As a result, Madden was the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years when he called Super Bowl XXXVII on ABC with Al Michaels.

James Brown hosted all the events with help from his fellow &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; cast members Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Cris Collinsworth. Jillian Barberie served as the weather and entertainment reporter during the pre-game show.

===Advertising===
Memorable television commercials that aired during the game included Columbia Pictures&#x27; trailer for &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, Budweiser&#x27;s &quot;Picking a Card&quot;, and Super Bowl Ad Meter commercial of the year winners Bud Light &quot;Satin Sheets.&quot; The best commercial of the year from Adbowl M&amp;M&#x27;s &quot;Chocolate on our Pillow or Hotel Check In&quot; and EA Sports&#x27; &quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot;, which aired during the game three days after &quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot; started selling in Japan by Electronic Arts Square.

==Entertainment==

===Pregame===
Before the game, an ensemble of singers featured Barry Manilow, Yolanda Adams, James Ingram, Wynonna Judd, and Patti LaBelle performing Manilow&#x27;s song &quot;Let Freedom Ring.&quot;

In a video segment, past and present NFL players read excerpts from the Declaration of Independence, which has become a part of all subsequent Super Bowls carried by Fox Sports. Super Bowls XXXIX, XLII, and XLV used different active and former players (and a player&#x27;s widow) reading the Declaration for each version. Former U.S. presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton appeared in another videotaped segment and recited some of the speeches by Abraham Lincoln. Because Ronald Reagan had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, his wife Nancy appeared on the segment in place of him accompanied by Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot; performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra under the direction of maestro Keith Lockhart.

Singers Mary J. Blige and Marc Anthony, along with the Boston Pops, performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. Paul McCartney then sang his post-9/11 song &quot;Freedom&quot;. Afterwards, singer Mariah Carey, accompanied by the Boston Pops, performed the national anthem.

George H. W. Bush became the first president, past or present, to participate in a Super Bowl coin toss in person (Ronald Reagan participated in the Super Bowl XIX coin toss via satellite from the White House in 1985). Bush was joined by former Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach. Staubach played at the United States Naval Academy and was the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI, which was played 30 years prior at New Orleans&#x27; Tulane Stadium.

===Patriots entrance into the Superdome===
As was customary at the time, the Rams&#x27; individual offensive starters were introduced first, as the Rams were considered the visitors. However, when it came time to introduce the Patriots&#x27; starters, Pat Summerall, making the public address announcement, revealed that the Patriots chose &quot;to be introduced as a team.&quot; According to David Halberstam&#x27;s book, &quot;The Education of a Coach&quot;, Belichick was given a choice by the NFL to introduce either the offense or defense. Belichick chose neither, asking that the team be introduced all at once in the spirit of unity. Although this was initially rejected by the NFL, Belichick held his ground and the NFL honored his request. The full team introduction demonstrated solidarity, and struck a chord with the audience in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Since the next Super Bowl game, both Super Bowl participants have been introduced collectively as a team, a precedent which has continued.

===Halftime===

The halftime show featured a three-song set from Irish rock band U2, who had just completed their successful Elevation Tour. After a rendition of &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, the band played &quot;MLK&quot; and &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; as the names of the victims from the September 11 attacks were projected onto a sheet behind the stage. While singing &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, the group&#x27;s lead singer Bono replaced the lyrics &quot;take shelter from the poison rain&quot; with &quot;dance in the Louisiana rain&quot;, &quot;high on a desert plain&quot; with &quot;where there&#x27;s no sorrow or pain&quot;, and the final line &quot;it&#x27;s all I can do&quot; with &quot;it&#x27;s all we can do&quot;. At the conclusion of the song, Bono opened his jacket to reveal an American flag printed into the lining. U2&#x27;s halftime show captivated the audience as a poignant tribute to those who had been lost in the attacks. In 2013, SI.com ranked it as the best halftime show in Super Bowl history, while it was rated the second-greatest by &quot;Askmen.com&quot;.

Janet Jackson was originally selected to perform during the Halftime Show, but due to traveling concerns following the September 11 tragedies, the NFL opted for other acts. The NFL thought U2 would &quot;set the right tone&quot; in respect to the tragedy, after executives attended the band&#x27;s Elevation Tour in New York City. She performed for the Super Bowl halftime two years later, when her highly controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance incident occurred.

==Game summary==

===First quarter===
After the teams exchanged punts to start the game, the Rams scored first, with quarterback Kurt Warner completing six of seven passes for 43 yards on a 48-yard, 10-play drive to set up a 50-yard field goal by kicker Jeff Wilkins, giving St. Louis a 3–0 lead. At the time, the field goal was the third longest in Super Bowl history. While the rest of the quarter was scoreless, the Patriots were stifling the typically high-powered Rams offense by playing physical man coverage with the Rams receivers, forcing them into long drives that would end in punts or field goal attempts.

===Second quarter===
Early in the second quarter, the Rams drove to the New England 34-yard line, aided by Warner&#x27;s 29-yard completion to wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim on 3rd-and-15, but Wilkins&#x27; 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.

On St. Louis&#x27; next possession, with 8:49 left in the half, a blitz by linebacker Mike Vrabel led Warner to be intercepted by cornerback Ty Law on a pass intended for wide receiver Isaac Bruce. Law then returned the interception 47 yards for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 7–3 lead. After another exchange of punts, with less than two minutes left in the first half, Warner completed a 15-yard pass to wide receiver Ricky Proehl at the St. Louis 40-yard line, but safety Antwan Harris forced a fumble on Proehl, and cornerback Terrell Buckley recovered the ball for New England. Quarterback Tom Brady started off the Patriots&#x27; drive with a 16-yard completion to wide receiver Troy Brown and finished it with an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver David Patten with 31 seconds left in the half. By halftime, the Patriots owned a surprising 14–3 lead. It was the first time in the entire 2001 season that the Rams fell behind by more than eight points in a game.

===Third quarter===
The Patriots received the opening kickoff of the second half, but could only reach the St. Louis 43-yard line before being forced to punt. Aided by a 20-yard reception by Hakim, a 22-yard reception by Bruce, and a pass interference penalty on cornerback Otis Smith, the Rams advanced to the New England 41-yard line. However, on the next play, Vrabel and defensive tackle Richard Seymour sacked Warner for a 9-yard loss. Warner then threw two consecutive incompletions, which resulted in the Rams punting.

On St. Louis&#x27; next possession, they reached the New England 45-yard line on three runs for 30 yards by running back Marshall Faulk, but Smith intercepted a pass intended for Rams wide receiver Torry Holt, who slipped while coming off the line of scrimmage, as Smith returned the ball 30 yards to the Rams 33-yard line. The Patriots were only able to advance the ball 14 yards after the turnover, so kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 37-yard field goal to increase their lead to 17–3.

===Fourth quarter===
The Rams responded by driving to the Patriots&#x27; 3-yard line on their ensuing drive, which was highlighted by Warner&#x27;s 15-yard pass to Bruce, two receptions by Faulk for 29 yards, and a 14-yard reception by Hakim. After Warner threw back-to-back incompletions, he went back to pass on fourth down, but scrambled to his right after seeing no one open and attempted to score himself. Warner fumbled the ball while being tackled by linebacker Roman Phifer, and safety Tebucky Jones returned the fumble 97 yards for a touchdown, but the play was nullified by a holding penalty on linebacker Willie McGinest, who illegally hugged Faulk, giving the Rams a new set of downs on the 1-yard line. Two plays later, Warner scored on a 2-yard touchdown run to cut the Patriots&#x27; lead to 17–10.

After Warner&#x27;s touchdown, the Rams&#x27; defense forced the Patriots to a three-and-out. St. Louis then drove from their own 7-yard line to the New England 36-yard line, aided by a 30-yard reception by Proehl. However, McGinest sacked Warner for a 16-yard loss on second down, pushing the Rams back to their own 46-yard line. The Rams punted after Warner&#x27;s third down pass was incomplete.

====Final two minutes====
With the Rams trailing 17–10 in the final two minutes, they forced New England to another three-and-out, and got the ball back on their own 45-yard line with 1:51 left in the game and no timeouts. Warner threw three consecutive completions to three different receivers — an 18-yard pass to Hakim, an 11-yard pass to wide receiver Yo Murphy, and finally a 26-yard touchdown completion to Proehl that tied the game, 17–17, with 1:30 left in regulation.

The Patriots also had no timeouts left for their ensuing drive, which led Fox color commentator John Madden to initially suggest that the Patriots should run out the clock and attempt to win in overtime. Instead, New England attempted to get the winning score in regulation on the final drive. Bill Belichick conferred with offensive coordinator Charlie Weis and they agreed to go for it. Belichick later stated, &quot;With a quarterback like Brady, going for the win is not that dangerous, because he&#x27;s not going to make a mistake.&quot; Brady opened the drive with three dump-off completions to running back J. R. Redmond for 24 yards, who got out of bounds on the last one and moved the ball to their own 41-yard line with 33 seconds left. At this point, Madden admitted on the air that he now liked what the Patriots were doing. After an incomplete pass, Brady completed a 23-yard pass underneath the Rams&#x27; zone defense to wide receiver Troy Brown, who also got out of bounds, and followed it up with a 6-yard completion to tight end Jermaine Wiggins to advance to the Rams&#x27; 30-yard line. Brady then spiked the ball with seven seconds left, which set up Vinatieri&#x27;s 48-yard field goal attempt. Vinatieri, who had never missed a field goal indoors, made the kick as time expired, giving New England their first-ever Super Bowl title. It marked the first time in Super Bowl history that the game was won by a score on the final play and only the second game where a field goal was decisive, with the first being in Super Bowl V when the Baltimore Colts&#x27; Jim O&#x27;Brien kicked a 32-yard field goal with nine seconds left to defeat the Dallas Cowboys. With the victory, Brady became at the time the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl surpassing Joe Namath. (Namath was 25 years, 7 months and 12 days old when he won Super Bowl III while Brady was 24 years and 6 months old.)



===Box score===



===Statistical overview===
Warner finished the game with 28 completions out of 44 passes for 365 yards, 1 touchdown, and 2 interceptions, and rushed 3 times for 6 yards and a touchdown. Warner&#x27;s 365 passing yards were the second highest total in Super Bowl history behind his own record of 414 yards set in Super Bowl XXXIV. Hakim was the top receiver of the game with 5 catches for 90 yards, and also rushed once for 5 yards. Faulk led the team with 76 rushing yards, and also caught 4 passes for 54 yards.

Patriots running back Antowain Smith was the top rusher of the game with 92 yards, and caught a pass for 4 yards. Troy Brown was the Patriots leading receiver with 6 catches for 89 yards. Brown also had a 15-yard kickoff return, and a 4-yard punt return, which gave him 108 total yards. Although the Rams outgained the Patriots 427–267 in total yards, New England forced three turnovers that were converted into 17 points. The Patriots, on the other hand, committed no turnovers.

===Records===
* Kurt Warner&#x27;s 365 passing yards was the second-highest total in Super Bowl history, behind his own previous record of 414 yards set in Super Bowl XXXIV. It was later surpassed by Tom Brady&#x27;s 462 yards in Super Bowl LI and 505 passing yards in Super Bowl LII.
* This was the commonwealth of Massachusetts&#x27; and the region of New England&#x27;s first major professional championship since the Boston Celtics&#x27; NBA title in 1986. New England&#x27;s teams lost a Super Bowl, an NBA Finals, a World Series and two Stanley Cup Finals in the drought stretch.
* The Rams&#x27; fourth-quarter comeback of 14 points became the largest in Super Bowl history for a team to tie or take the lead in the fourth quarter, until surpassed by the Patriots&#x27; comeback from 25 points down in Super Bowl LI. Also this was the second time a team down 10 or more points in the 4th quarter had tied the game, the other being the Titans against the Rams two years earlier in Super Bowl XXXIV.
* The Patriots are the second team to have worn three different color jerseys in the Super Bowl: red in Super Bowl XX; white in Super Bowl XXXI, Super Bowl XXXIX, Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl LI, Super Bowl LII and Super Bowl LIII; and blue in Super Bowl XXXVI, Super Bowl XXXVIII, Super Bowl XLII, and Super Bowl XLVI. (Denver Broncos wore orange in Super Bowl XII, Super Bowl XXII, Super Bowl XXIV and Super Bowl XLVIII; blue in Super Bowl XXXII; and white in Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXXIII and Super Bowl 50.)
* The Patriots were the second biggest Super Bowl underdog to win behind only the Jets in Super Bowl III, who were underdogs against the Colts by 19 1⁄2 points.

===Patriots===
Four hours after the game ended, Tom Brady visited Bill Belichick&#x27;s hotel room where, as per team rules, he had to get his coach&#x27;s permission to miss the team flight and instead travel to Walt Disney World in Orlando. Belichick gave him a perplexed look, and after a few seconds of dead silence, responded, &quot;Of course you can go. How many times do you win the Super Bowl?&quot;

The game heralded the Patriots dynasty, being the first of nine Super Bowl appearances under the duo of head coach Belichick and quarterback Brady. The Patriots finished the 2002 NFL season 9–7, missing the playoffs. They went on to win Super Bowl XXXVIII, then Super Bowl XXXIX, thus winning three Super Bowls in four years. Then, they won their fourth, fifth, and sixth Super Bowls (Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl LI, and Super Bowl LIII) a decade after their third. Brady won four more Super Bowl MVP awards – three with the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII, Super Bowl XLIX, and Super Bowl LI and one more with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV – making him the only player to be named Super Bowl MVP five times.

Super Bowl XXXVI later became part of the wider 2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy, also known as &quot;Spygate&quot;. In addition to other videotaping allegations, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reported, citing an unnamed source, that the Patriots had also taped the Rams&#x27; walkthrough practice prior to the game. After further investigations, the league determined that no tape of the Rams&#x27; Super Bowl walkthrough was made, and the &quot;Herald&quot; later issued an apology in 2008 for their article about the alleged walkthrough tape. Nevertheless, the Patriots finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16–0 record, but failed to record an undefeated 19–0 championship season after losing Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants. And at the conclusion of the 2015 NFL season, the Patriots held the NFL&#x27;s best record since Spygate, compiling a 96–32 record from 2008 to 2015.

The Patriots&#x27; win in this Super Bowl, beyond just serving as a springboard to a dynasty that lasted nearly two decades and resulted in five more championships, also became the starting point for a decade of success in Boston sports, with the city&#x27;s teams in the four major North American sports leagues (the Red Sox, Celtics and Bruins in addition to the Patriots) winning seven championships including at least one each. Following the Bruins winning the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; columnist Dan Shaughnessy ranked all seven championships from the past decade and ranked the Patriots winning Super Bowl XXXVI as the second-greatest Boston sports championship of the decade behind only the Red Sox winning the 2004 World Series and breaking the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;.

Brady, Milloy and Vinatieri also provided the team&#x27;s commentary in the 2001 Patriots&#x27; episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The Super Bowl Champions&quot;, narrated by actor Martin Sheen.

The Patriots winning their first championship in franchise history started a run of a team in American sports from NCAA Football and Basketball and the four major sports (MLB baseball, NFL football, NBA basketball, and NHL hockey) winning either their first franchise championship or their next franchise championship after waiting at least 17 years since their last title. This streak is still continuing in 2024 after the Michigan Wolverines won their first NCAA football national championship in 26 years and the NHL&#x27;s Florida Panthers won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history.

===Rams===
Beginning with the Rams&#x27; appearance in Super Bowl XXXVI, 10 different NFC teams appeared in the Super Bowl over the next 10 years. This trend was broken when the New York Giants earned a trip to Super Bowl XLVI after participating in Super Bowl XLII four years earlier (the Giants defeated the Patriots in both games).

This game was regarded as a &quot;Super Bowl hangover&quot; for the Rams because they lost a Super Bowl where they were heavy favorites, with a win potentially ushering in a Rams dynasty, but instead the loss signaled the beginning of the end of The Greatest Show on Turf era. Due to injuries to Kurt Warner and Marshall Faulk, the Rams finished with a 7–9 record the following year and missed the postseason. They qualified for the playoffs only two more times (2003 and 2004), and only won one more playoff game (the 2004–05 wild card game) during the remainder of their tenure in St. Louis. Head coach Mike Martz was fired after missing most of the 2005 season due to illness. Warner suffered a concussion on opening day in 2003, and was later demoted to backup quarterback for the rest of that season. He then signed with the New York Giants in 2004 as a caretaker quarterback, eventually losing the starting job to rookie quarterback Eli Manning. Warner later joined the Arizona Cardinals in 2005 and eventually gained the starting job where he led that team to their first Super Bowl appearance, XLIII, following the 2008 season.

Super Bowl XXXVI ended up being the last Super Bowl that the Rams participated while based in St. Louis; they relocated back to Los Angeles in 2016. The Rams would once again reach the Super Bowl in the 2018 season and 2021 season, winning the latter.

===Super Bowl LIII rematch===
The Patriots and the now Los Angeles Rams rematched 17 years later in Super Bowl LIII (2019); again featuring the head coach-quarterback tandem of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, both of whom were the only active personnel left from Super Bowl XXXVI. Coincidentally like XXXVI, LIII also featured one of the league&#x27;s top offenses (Rams) against one of the top defenses (Patriots). The Patriots won their record-tying sixth Super Bowl by defeating the Rams again 13–3, with Brady remarking that LIII had a &quot;throwback feel&quot; to XXXVI. Meanwhile, the Rams would defeat the Cincinnati Bengals three years later.

<doc id="29577" wikidata="Q769180" url="?curid=29577" title="Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.">
<text>Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. is the debut studio album by the American folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Following their early incarnation as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll duo Tom and Jerry, Columbia Records signed the pair in late 1963. The album was produced by Tom Wilson and engineered by Roy Halee. The cover and the label include the subtitle &quot;exciting new sounds in the folk tradition&quot;. Recorded in March 1964, the album was released on October 19.

The album was initially unsuccessful, so Paul Simon moved to London, England and released his first solo album &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot;. Art Garfunkel continued his studies at Columbia University in his native New York City, before reuniting with Simon in late 1965. &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; was re-released in January 1966 (to capitalize on their newly found radio success because of the overdubbing of the song &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; in June 1965, adding electric guitars, bass guitar and a drum kit, which was done under the direction of producer Tom Wilson without the duo&#x27;s knowledge), and reached  30 on the Billboard 200. It was belatedly released in the UK two years later (in 1968) in both mono and stereo formats.

The song &quot;He Was My Brother&quot; was dedicated to Andrew Goodman, who was their friend and a classmate of Simon at Queens College. Andrew Goodman volunteered in Freedom Summer during 1964 and was abducted and killed in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.

The album is included in its entirety as part of the Simon &amp; Garfunkel box sets &quot;Collected Works&quot; and &quot;The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964–1970)&quot;.

==Production==
The album was produced by Tom Wilson and engineered by Roy Halee between March 10–31, 1964.

“Benedictus&quot; was arranged and adapted from Orlando di Lasso&#x27;s &quot;Missa Octavi toni&quot;, a Renaissance setting of the ordinary of the mass. The text, in Latin, is &quot;benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini&quot; (KJV: &quot;Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord&quot; ). The song is arranged for two voices with cello and sparse guitar accompaniment.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s cover photo was shot at the Fifth Avenue / 53rd Street subway station in New York City. In several concerts, Art Garfunkel related that during the photo session, several hundred pictures were taken that were unusable due to the &quot;old familiar suggestion&quot; on the wall in the background (a euphemism for the words &quot;Fuck You&quot;), which inspired Paul Simon to write the song &quot;A Poem on the Underground Wall&quot; for the duo&#x27;s later &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; album.

==Reception==
The album was initially unsuccessful, having been released in the shadow of the British Invasion. This resulted in Paul Simon moving to England and Art Garfunkel continuing his studies at Columbia University in New York City. It ultimately reached  24 on the UK Album Charts, albeit in 1968, long after the duo had re-formed and gone on to greater success. Following the success of &quot;The Sound of Silence,&quot; the album peaked at  30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in 1966.

<text>Sheldon Rampton is an American editor and author. He was editor of &quot;PR Watch&quot;, and is the author of several books that criticize the public relations industry.

==Career==
In 1995, Rampton teamed with John Stauber as co-editors of PR Watch, a publication of the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). They were described as liberal, and their writings are regarded by some members of the public relations industry as one-sided and hostile, but their work drew wide attention. ActivistCash, a website hosted by Washington lobbyist Richard Berman, has castigated them as &quot;self-anointed watchdogs,&quot; &quot;scare-mongers,&quot; &quot;reckless&quot; and &quot;left-leaning.&quot; Rampton and Stauber have in turn argued that the ActivistCash critique contains a number of &quot;demonstrably false&quot; claims. According to a review in &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, their 1995 book, &quot;Toxic Sludge Is Good for You,&quot; offered &quot;a sardonic, wide-ranging look at the public relations industry.&quot;

After leaving the Center for Media and Democracy in 2009, Rampton became a website developer, joining an open government initiative led by New York State Senate chief information officer Andrew Hoppin. In 2010, Hoppin and Rampton co-founded NuCivic, an open source software company, which they sold in December 2014 to GovDelivery, a software services company now known as Granicus. Rampton currently works as a software engineer at Granicus. He also serves on the board of directors of Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a non-governmental organization that catalogs fossil fuel and renewable energy projects worldwide in support of clean energy.

<text>The Miller test, also called the three-prong obscenity test, is the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s test for determining whether speech or expression can be labeled obscene, in which case it is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and can be prohibited.

==History and details==
The &quot;Miller&quot; test was developed in the 1973 case &quot;Miller v. California&quot;. It has three parts:
*Whether &quot;the average person, applying contemporary community standards&quot;, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the interest,
*Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions specifically defined by applicable state law,
*Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

The work is considered obscene only if &quot;all three&quot; conditions are satisfied.

The first two prongs of the &quot;Miller&quot; test are held to the standards of the community, and the third prong is based on &quot;whether a reasonable person would find such value in the material, taken as a whole&quot;.

For legal scholars, several issues are important. One is that the test allows for community standards rather than a national standard. What offends the average person in one community may differ from what offends the average person in another community. 

Another important issue is that the &quot;Miller&quot; test asks for an interpretation of what the &quot;average&quot; person finds offensive, rather than what the more sensitive persons in the community are offended by, as obscenity was defined by the previous test, the Hicklin test, stemming from the English precedent.

In practice, pornography showing genitalia and sexual acts is not &quot;ipso facto&quot; obscene according to the &quot;Miller&quot; test. For instance, in 2000, a jury in Provo, Utah, took only a few minutes to clear Larry Peterman, owner of a Movie Buffs video store, in Utah County, Utah. He had been charged with distributing obscene material for renting pornographic videos that were displayed in a screened-off area of the store clearly marked as adults-only. The Utah County region had often boasted of being one of the most socially conservative areas in the United States. However, researchers had shown that guests at the local Marriott Hotel were disproportionately large consumers of pay-per-view pornographic material, accessing far more material than the store was distributing.

==Criticism==

===&quot;Miller&quot; test may lead to greater censorship===
Because it allows for community standards and demands &quot;serious&quot; value, Justice Douglas worried in his dissent that this test would make it easier to suppress speech and expression. &quot;Miller&quot; replaced a previous test asking whether the speech or expression was &quot;utterly without redeeming social value&quot;. As used, however, the test generally makes it difficult to outlaw any form of expression. Many works decried as pornographic have been successfully argued to have some artistic or literary value, most publicly in the context of the National Endowment for the Arts in the 1990s.

The first two prongs of the &quot;Miller&quot; test – that material appeal to the prurient interest and be patently offensive – have been said to require the impossible: &quot;They require the audience to be turned on and grossed out at the same time&quot;.

===Problem of jurisdiction in the Internet age===
The advent of the Internet has made the &quot;community standards&quot; part of the test even more difficult to judge; as material published on a web server in one place can be read by a person residing anywhere else, there is a question as to which jurisdiction should apply. In &quot;United States v. Extreme Associates&quot;, a pornography distributor from North Hollywood, California, was judged to be held accountable to the community standards applying in western Pennsylvania, where the Third Circuit made its ruling, because the materials were available via Internet in that area. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ruled in &quot;United States v. Kilbride&quot; that a &quot;national community standard&quot; should be used for the Internet, but this has yet to be upheld at the national level.

<text>A set-top box (STB), also known as a [[cable converter box|cable box]], receiver, or simply box, and historically television decoder or a converter, is an information appliance device that generally contains a TV tuner input and displays output to a television set, turning the source signal into content in a form that can then be displayed on the television screen or other display device. It is designed to be placed alongside or &quot;on top&quot; (hence the name) of a television set.

Set-top boxes are used in cable television, satellite television, terrestrial television and Internet Protocol television systems, as well as other uses such as digital media players (&quot;streaming boxes&quot;). Alternatives to set-top boxes are the smaller dongles, and television sets with built-in TV tuners.

==TV signal sources==

The signal source might be an Ethernet cable, a satellite dish, a coaxial cable (see cable television), a telephone line (including DSL connections), broadband over power lines (BPL), or even an ordinary VHF or UHF antenna. Content, in this context, could mean any or all of video, audio, Internet web pages, interactive video games, or other possibilities. Satellite and microwave-based services also require specific external receiver hardware, so the use of set-top boxes of various formats has never completely disappeared. Set-top boxes can also enhance source signal quality.

===UHF converter===
Before the All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962 required US television receivers to be able to tune the entire VHF and UHF range (which in North America was NTSC-M channels 2 through 83 on 54 to 890MHz), a set-top box known as a UHF converter would be installed at the receiver to shift a portion of the UHF-TV spectrum onto low-VHF channels for viewing. As some 1960s-era 12-channel TV sets remained in use for many years, and Canada and Mexico were slower than the US to require UHF tuners to be factory-installed in new TVs, a market for these converters continued to exist for much of the 1970s.

===Cable converter===
Cable television represented a possible alternative to deployment of UHF converters as broadcasts could be frequency-shifted to VHF channels at the cable head-end instead of the final viewing location. However, most cable systems could not accommodate the full 54-to-890 MHz VHF/UHF frequency range and the twelve channels of VHF space were quickly exhausted on most systems. Adding any additional channels therefore needed to be done by inserting the extra signals into cable systems on nonstandard frequencies, typically either below VHF channel 7 (midband) or directly above VHF channel 13 (superband).

These frequencies corresponded to non-television services (such as two-way radio) over the air and were therefore not on standard TV receivers. Before cable-ready TV sets became common in the late 1980s, an electronic tuning device called a cable converter box was needed to receive the additional analogue cable TV channels and transpose or convert the selected channel to analogue radio frequency (RF) for viewing on a regular TV set on a single channel, usually VHF channel 3 or 4. The box allowed an analogue non–cable-ready television set to receive analogue encrypted cable channels and was a prototype topology for later date digital encryption devices. Newer televisions were then converted to be analogue cypher cable-ready, with the standard converter built-in for selling premium television (aka pay-per-view). Several years later and slowly marketed, the advent of digital cable continued and increased the need for various forms of these devices. Block conversion of the entire affected frequency band onto UHF, while less common, was used by some models to provide full VCR compatibility and the ability to drive multiple TV sets, albeit with a somewhat nonstandard channel numbering scheme.

Newer television receivers greatly reduced the need for external set-top boxes, although cable converter boxes continue to be used to descramble premium cable channels according to carrier-controlled access restrictions, and to receive digital cable channels, along with using interactive services like video on demand, pay per view, and home shopping through television.

===Closed captioning box===
Set-top boxes were also made to enable closed captioning on older sets in North America, before this became a mandated inclusion in new television sets. Some have also been produced to mute the audio (or replace it with noise) when profanity is detected in the captioning, where the offensive word is also blocked. Some also include a V-chip that allows only programs of some television content rating systems. A function that limits children&#x27;s time watching TV or playing video games may also be built in, though some work on main electricity rather than the video signal.

===Digital television adapter===

The transition to digital terrestrial television after the turn of the millennium left many existing television receivers unable to tune and display the new signal directly. In the United States, where the analogue shutdown was completed in 2009 for full-service broadcasters, a federal subsidy was offered for coupon-eligible converter boxes with deliberately limited capability which would restore signals lost to digital transition.

===Professional set-top box===

Professional set-top boxes are referred to as IRDs or integrated receiver/decoders in the professional broadcast audio/video industry. They are designed for more robust field handling and rack mounting environments. IRDs are capable of outputting uncompressed serial digital interface signals, unlike consumer STBs which usually do not, mostly because of copyright reasons.

===Hybrid box===

Hybrid set-top boxes, such as those used for Smart TV programming, enable viewers to access multiple TV delivery methods (including terrestrial, cable, internet, and satellite); like IPTV boxes, they include video on demand, time-shifting TV, Internet applications, videotelephony, surveillance, gaming, shopping, TV-centric electronic program guides, and e-government. By integrating varying delivery streams, hybrids (sometimes known as &quot;TV-centric&quot;) enable pay-TV operators more flexible application deployment, which decreases the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market, and limits disruption for consumers.

As examples, Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) set-top boxes allow traditional TV broadcasts, whether from terrestrial (DTT), satellite, or cable providers, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet and personal multimedia content. Advanced Digital Broadcast (ADB) launched its first hybrid DTT/IPTV set-top box in 2005, which provided Telefónica with the digital TV platform for its Movistar TV service by the end of that year. In 2009, ADB provided Europe&#x27;s first three-way hybrid digital TV platform to Polish digital satellite operator n, which enables subscribers to view integrated content whether delivered via satellite, terrestrial, or internet.

UK-based Inview Technology has over 8million STBs deployed in the UK for teletext and an original push VOD service for Top Up TV.

===IPTV receiver===

In IPTV networks, the set-top box is a small computer providing two-way communications on an IP network and decoding the video streaming media. IP set-top boxes have a built-in home network interface that can be Ethernet, Wireless (802.11g,n,ac), or one of the existing wire home networking technologies such as HomePNA or the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines, and coaxial cables).

In the US and Europe, telephone companies use IPTV (often on ADSL or optical fibre networks) as a means to compete with traditional local cable television monopolies.

This type of service is distinct from streaming television, which involves third-party content over the public Internet not controlled by the local system operator.

==Features==

===Programming features===
====Electronic program guide====
Electronic program guides and interactive program guides provide users of television, radio, and other media applications with continuously updated menus displaying broadcast programming or scheduling information for current and upcoming programming. Some guides, such as ITV, also feature backward scrolling to promote their catch-up content.

====Favorites====
This feature allows the user to choose preferred channels, making them easier and quicker to access; this is handy with the wide range of digital channels on offer. The concept of favourite channels is superficially similar to that of the &quot;bookmark&quot; function offered in many web browsers.

====Timer====
The timer allows the user to program and enable the box to switch between channels at certain times: this is handy to record from more than one channel while the user is out. The user still needs to program the VCR or DVD recorder.

===Convenience features===

====Controls on the box====
Some models have controls on the box, as well as on the remote control. This is useful should the user lose the remote or if the batteries age.

====Remote controls that work with other TVs====
Some remote controls can also control some basic functions of various brands of TVs. This allows the user to use just one remote to turn the TV on and off, adjust volume, or switch between digital and analogue TV channels or between terrestrial and internet channels.

====Parental locks====
The parental lock or content filters allow users over 18 years old to block access to channels that are not appropriate for children, using a personal identification number. Some boxes simply block all channels, while others allow the user to restrict access to chosen channels not suitable for children below certain ages.

===Software alternatives===
As complexity and potential programming faults of the set-top box increase, software such as MythTV, Select-TV and Microsoft&#x27;s Media Center have developed features comparable to those of set-top boxes, ranging from basic DVR-like functionality to DVD copying, home automation, and housewide music or video playback.

===Firmware update features===

Almost all modern set-top boxes feature automatic firmware update processes. The firmware update is typically provided by the service provider.

==Ambiguities in the definition==

With the advent of flat-panel televisions, set-top boxes are now deeper in profile than the tops of most modern TV sets. Because of this, set-top boxes are often placed beneath televisions, and the term set-top box has become something of a misnomer, possibly helping the adoption of the term &quot;digibox&quot;. Additionally, newer set-top boxes that sit at the edge of IP-based distribution networks are often called net-top boxes or NTBs, to differentiate between IP and RF inputs. The Roku LT is around the size of a pack of cards and delivers Smart TV to conventional sets.

The distinction between external tuner or demodulator boxes (traditionally considered to be &quot;set-top boxes&quot;) and storage devices (such as VCR, DVD, or disc-based PVR units) is also blurred by the increasing deployment of satellite and cable tuner boxes with a hard disk, network or USB interfaces built-in.

Devices with the capabilities of computer terminals, such as the WebTV thin client, also fall into the grey area that could invite the term &quot;NTB&quot;.

===Europe===
In Europe, a set-top box does not necessarily contain a tuner of its own. A box connected to a television (or VCR) SCART connector is fed with the baseband television signal from the set&#x27;s tuner, and can have the television display the returned processed signal instead.
This SCART feature had been used for connection to analogue decoding equipment by pay-TV operators in Europe, and in the past, it was used for connection to teletext equipment before the decoders became built-in. The outgoing signal could be of the same nature as the incoming signal, or RGB component video, or even an &quot;insert&quot; over the original signal, due to the &quot;fast switching&quot; feature of SCART.

In case of analogue pay-TV, this approach avoided the need for a second remote control. The use of digital television signals in more modern pay-TV schemes requires that decoding take place before the digital-to-analogue conversion step, rendering the video outputs of an analogue SCART connector no longer suitable for interconnection to decryption hardware. Standards such as DVB&#x27;s Common Interface and ATSC&#x27;s CableCARD therefore use a PCMCIA-like card inserted as part of the digital signal path as their alternative to a tuner-equipped set-top box.

== Costs ==
According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the cost to a cable provider in the United States for a set-top box is between $150 for a basic box to $250 for a more sophisticated box. In 2016, the average pay-TV subscriber paid $231 per year to lease their set-top box from a cable service provider.

==Energy use==
In June 2011, a report from the American National Resources Defense Council brought attention to the energy efficiency of set-top boxes, and the United States Department of Energy announced plans to consider the adoption of energy efficiency standards for set-top boxes. In November 2011, the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association announced a new energy efficiency initiative that commits the largest American cable operators to the purchase of set-top boxes that meet Energy Star standards and the development of sleep modes that will use less energy when the set-top box is not being used to watch or record video.

<text>In medicine and biology, scatology or coprology is the study of faeces.

Scatological studies allow one to determine a wide range of biological information about a creature, including its diet (and thus where it has been), health and diseases such as tapeworms.

A comprehensive study of scatology was documented by John Gregory Bourke under the title &quot; Rites of All Nations&quot; (1891), with a 1913 German translation including a foreword by Sigmund Freud. An abbreviated version of the work was published as &quot;The Portable Scatalog&quot; in 1994.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from the Greek ( ) meaning &quot;dung, feces&quot;; &quot;coprology&quot; derives from the Greek of similar meaning.

== Psychology ==
In psychology, a scatology is an obsession with excretion or excrement, or the study of such obsessions.

In sexual fetishism, scatology or scatophilia (usually abbreviated &quot;scat&quot;) refers to coprophilia, when someone is sexually aroused by fecal matter, whether in the use of feces in various sexual acts, watching someone defecating, or simply seeing the feces. Entire subcultures in sexuality are devoted to this fetish.

== Literature ==
In literature, &quot;scatological&quot; is a term to denote the literary trope of the grotesque body. It is used to describe works that make particular reference to excretion or excrement, as well as to toilet humor. Well known for his scatological tropes is the late medieval fictional character of Till Eulenspiegel. Another common example is John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot;, a poem that employs extensive scatological imagery to ridicule Dryden&#x27;s contemporary Thomas Shadwell. German literature is particularly rich in scatological texts and references, including such books as Collofino&#x27;s &quot;Non Olet&quot;. A case which has provoked an unusual amount of comment in the academic literature is Mozart&#x27;s scatological humour. Smith, in his review of English literature&#x27;s representations of scatology from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, notes two attitudes towards scatology. One of these emphasises the merry and the carnivalesque. This is found in Chaucer and Shakespeare. The other attitude is one of self-disgust and misanthropy. This is found in the works of the Earl of Rochester and Jonathan Swift.

<text>In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, a σ-algebra (&quot;sigma algebra&quot;; also σ-field, where the σ comes from the German &quot;Summe&quot;) on a set &quot;X&quot; is a nonempty collection Σ of subsets of &quot;X&quot; closed under complement, countable unions, and countable intersections. The ordered pair formula_1 is called a measurable space.

A σ-algebra of subsets is a set algebra of subsets; elements of the latter only need to be closed under the union or intersection of &quot;finitely&quot; many subsets, which is a weaker condition.

The main use of σ-algebras is in the definition of measures; specifically, the collection of those subsets for which a given measure is defined is necessarily a σ-algebra. This concept is important in mathematical analysis as the foundation for Lebesgue integration, and in probability theory, where it is interpreted as the collection of events which can be assigned probabilities. Also, in probability, σ-algebras are pivotal in the definition of conditional expectation.

In statistics, (sub) σ-algebras are needed for the formal mathematical definition of a sufficient statistic, particularly when the statistic is a function or a random process and the notion of conditional density is not applicable.

If formula_2 one possible σ-algebra on formula_3 is formula_4 where formula_5 is the empty set. In general, a finite algebra is always a σ-algebra.

If formula_6 is a countable partition of formula_3 then the collection of all unions of sets in the partition (including the empty set) is a σ-algebra.

A more useful example is the set of subsets of the real line formed by starting with all open intervals and adding in all countable unions, countable intersections, and relative complements and continuing this process (by transfinite iteration through all countable ordinals) until the relevant closure properties are achieved (a construction known as the Borel hierarchy).

==Motivation==
There are at least three key motivators for σ-algebras: defining measures, manipulating limits of sets, and managing partial information characterized by sets.

===Measure===
A measure on formula_3 is a function that assigns a non-negative real number to subsets of formula_9 this can be thought of as making precise a notion of &quot;size&quot; or &quot;volume&quot; for sets. We want the size of the union of disjoint sets to be the sum of their individual sizes, even for an infinite sequence of disjoint sets.

One would like to assign a size to subset of formula_10 but in many natural settings, this is not possible. For example, the axiom of choice implies that when the size under consideration is the ordinary notion of length for subsets of the real line, then there exist sets for which no size exists, for example, the Vitali sets. For this reason, one considers instead a smaller collection of privileged subsets of formula_11 These subsets will be called the measurable sets. They are closed under operations that one would expect for measurable sets, that is, the complement of a measurable set is a measurable set and the countable union of measurable sets is a measurable set. Non-empty collections of sets with these properties are called σ-algebras.

===Limits of sets===
Many uses of measure, such as the probability concept of almost sure convergence, involve limits of sequences of sets. For this, closure under countable unions and intersections is paramount. Set limits are defined as follows on σ-algebras.

* The or of a sequence formula_12 of subsets of formula_3 is formula_14 It consists of all points formula_15 that are in infinitely many of these sets (or equivalently, that are in many of them). That is, formula_16 if and only if there exists an infinite subsequence formula_17 (where formula_18) of sets that all contain formula_19 that is, such that formula_20
* The or of a sequence formula_12 of subsets of formula_3 is formula_23 It consists of all points that are in all but finitely many of these sets (or equivalently, that are in all of them). That is, formula_24 if and only if there exists an index formula_25 such that formula_26 all contain formula_19 that is, such that formula_28

The inner limit is always a subset of the outer limit: formula_29 
If these two sets are equal then their limit formula_30 exists and is equal to this common set: 
formula_31

===Sub σ-algebras===
In much of probability, especially when conditional expectation is involved, one is concerned with sets that represent only part of all the possible information that can be observed. This partial information can be characterized with a smaller σ-algebra which is a subset of the principal σ-algebra; it consists of the collection of subsets relevant only to and determined only by the partial information. Formally, if formula_32 are σ-algebras on formula_3, then formula_34 is a sub σ-algebra of formula_35 if formula_36. An example will illustrate how this idea arises.

Imagine two people are betting on a game that involves flipping a coin repeatedly and observing whether it comes up Heads (formula_37) or Tails (formula_38). Both players are assumed to be infinitely wealthy, so there is no limit to how long the game can last. This means the sample space Ω must consist of all possible infinite sequences of formula_37 or formula_40
formula_41

The observed information after formula_42 flips have occurred is one of the formula_43 possibilities describing the sequence of the first formula_42 flips. This is codified as the sub σ-algebra
formula_45

which locks down the first formula_42 flips and is agnostic about the result of the remaining ones. Observe that then
formula_47
where formula_48 is the smallest σ-algebra containing all the others.

==Definition and properties==

===Definition===
Let formula_3 be some set, and let formula_50 represent its power set, the set of all subsets of formula_3. Then a subset formula_52 is called a σ-algebra if and only if it satisfies the following three properties:

# formula_3 is in formula_54.
# formula_54 is &quot;closed under complementation&quot;: If some set formula_56 is in formula_57 then so is its complement, formula_58
# formula_54 is &quot;closed under countable unions&quot;: If formula_12 are in formula_57 then so is formula_62

From these properties, it follows that the σ-algebra is also closed under countable intersections (by applying De Morgan&#x27;s laws).

It also follows that the empty set formula_5 is in formula_57 since by (1) formula_3 is in formula_54 and (2) asserts that its complement, the empty set, is also in formula_67 Moreover, since formula_68 satisfies all 3 conditions, it follows that formula_68 is the smallest possible σ-algebra on formula_11 The largest possible σ-algebra on formula_3 is formula_72

Elements of the σ-algebra are called measurable sets. An ordered pair formula_73 where formula_3 is a set and formula_54 is a σ-algebra over formula_10 is called a measurable space. A function between two measurable spaces is called a measurable function if the preimage of every measurable set is measurable. The collection of measurable spaces forms a category, with the measurable functions as morphisms. Measures are defined as certain types of functions from a σ-algebra to formula_77
A σ-algebra is both a π-system and a Dynkin system (λ-system). The converse is true as well, by Dynkin&#x27;s theorem (see below).

===Dynkin&#x27;s π-λ theorem===
This theorem (or the related monotone class theorem) is an essential tool for proving many results about properties of specific σ-algebras. It capitalizes on the nature of two simpler classes of sets, namely the following.
* A π-system formula_78 is a collection of subsets of formula_3 that is closed under finitely many intersections, and
* A Dynkin system (or λ-system) formula_80 is a collection of subsets of formula_3 that contains formula_3 and is closed under complement and under countable unions of &quot;disjoint&quot; subsets.

Dynkin&#x27;s π-λ theorem says, if formula_78 is a π-system and formula_80 is a Dynkin system that contains formula_85 then the σ-algebra formula_86 generated by formula_78 is contained in formula_88 Since certain π-systems are relatively simple classes, it may not be hard to verify that all sets in formula_78 enjoy the property under consideration while, on the other hand, showing that the collection formula_80 of all subsets with the property is a Dynkin system can also be straightforward. Dynkin&#x27;s π-λ Theorem then implies that all sets in formula_86 enjoy the property, avoiding the task of checking it for an arbitrary set in formula_92

One of the most fundamental uses of the π-λ theorem is to show equivalence of separately defined measures or integrals. For example, it is used to equate a probability for a random variable formula_3 with the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral typically associated with computing the probability:
formula_94 for all formula_56 in the Borel σ-algebra on formula_96
where formula_97 is the cumulative distribution function for formula_10 defined on formula_96 while formula_100 is a probability measure, defined on a σ-algebra formula_54 of subsets of some sample space formula_102

===Combining σ-algebras===
Suppose formula_103 is a collection of σ-algebras on a space formula_11

Meet

The intersection of a collection of σ-algebras is a σ-algebra. To emphasize its character as a σ-algebra, it often is denoted by: 
formula_105

Sketch of Proof: Let formula_106 denote the intersection. Since formula_3 is in every formula_108 is not empty. Closure under complement and countable unions for every formula_109 implies the same must be true for formula_110 Therefore, formula_106 is a σ-algebra.

Join

The union of a collection of σ-algebras is not generally a σ-algebra, or even an algebra, but it generates a σ-algebra known as the join which typically is denoted 
formula_112
A π-system that generates the join is 
formula_113
Sketch of Proof: By the case formula_114 it is seen that each formula_115 so
formula_116
This implies
formula_117
by the definition of a σ-algebra generated by a collection of subsets. On the other hand,
formula_118
which, by Dynkin&#x27;s π-λ theorem, implies
formula_119

===σ-algebras for subspaces===
Suppose formula_120 is a subset of formula_3 and let formula_1 be a measurable space.
* The collection formula_123 is a σ-algebra of subsets of formula_124
* Suppose formula_125 is a measurable space. The collection formula_126 is a σ-algebra of subsets of formula_11

===Relation to σ-ring===
A &quot;σ&quot;-algebra formula_54 is just a &quot;σ&quot;-ring that contains the universal set formula_11 A &quot;σ&quot;-ring need not be a &quot;σ&quot;-algebra, as for example measurable subsets of zero Lebesgue measure in the real line are a &quot;σ&quot;-ring, but not a &quot;σ&quot;-algebra since the real line has infinite measure and thus cannot be obtained by their countable union. If, instead of zero measure, one takes measurable subsets of finite Lebesgue measure, those are a ring but not a &quot;σ&quot;-ring, since the real line can be obtained by their countable union yet its measure is not finite.

===Typographic note===
&quot;σ&quot;-algebras are sometimes denoted using calligraphic capital letters, or the Fraktur typeface. Thus formula_1 may be denoted as formula_131 or formula_132

==Particular cases and examples==

===Separable σ-algebras===
A separable formula_133-algebra (or separable formula_133-field) is a formula_133-algebra formula_136 that is a separable space when considered as a metric space with metric formula_137 for formula_138 and a given finite measure formula_139 (and with formula_140 being the symmetric difference operator). Any formula_133-algebra generated by a countable collection of sets is separable, but the converse need not hold. For example, the Lebesgue formula_133-algebra is separable (since every Lebesgue measurable set is equivalent to some Borel set) but not countably generated (since its cardinality is higher than continuum).

A separable measure space has a natural pseudometric that renders it separable as a pseudometric space. The distance between two sets is defined as the measure of the symmetric difference of the two sets. The symmetric difference of two distinct sets can have measure zero; hence the pseudometric as defined above need not to be a true metric. However, if sets whose symmetric difference has measure zero are identified into a single equivalence class, the resulting quotient set can be properly metrized by the induced metric. If the measure space is separable, it can be shown that the corresponding metric space is, too.

===Simple set-based examples===
Let formula_3 be any set.
* The family consisting only of the empty set and the set formula_10 called the minimal or trivial σ-algebra over formula_11
* The power set of formula_10 called the discrete σ-algebra.
* The collection formula_147 is a simple σ-algebra generated by the subset formula_148
* The collection of subsets of formula_3 which are countable or whose complements are countable is a σ-algebra (which is distinct from the power set of formula_3 if and only if formula_3 is uncountable). This is the σ-algebra generated by the singletons of formula_11 Note: &quot;countable&quot; includes finite or empty.
* The collection of all unions of sets in a countable partition of formula_3 is a σ-algebra.

===Stopping time sigma-algebras===
A stopping time formula_154 can define a formula_133-algebra formula_156 the
so-called stopping time sigma-algebra, which in a filtered probability space describes the information up to the random time formula_154 in the sense that, if the filtered probability space is interpreted as a random experiment, the maximum information that can be found out about the experiment from arbitrarily often repeating it until the time formula_154 is formula_159

==σ-algebras generated by families of sets==

===σ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family===

Let formula_160 be an arbitrary family of subsets of formula_11 Then there exists a unique smallest σ-algebra which contains every set in formula_160 (even though formula_160 may or may not itself be a σ-algebra). It is, in fact, the intersection of all σ-algebras containing formula_164 (See intersections of σ-algebras above.) This σ-algebra is denoted formula_165 and is called the σ-algebra generated by formula_164

If formula_160 is empty, then formula_168 Otherwise formula_165 consists of all the subsets of formula_3 that can be made from elements of formula_160 by a countable number of complement, union and intersection operations.

For a simple example, consider the set formula_172 Then the σ-algebra generated by the single subset formula_173 is 
formula_174 
By an abuse of notation, when a collection of subsets contains only one element, formula_175 formula_176 may be written instead of formula_177 in the prior example formula_178 instead of formula_179 Indeed, using formula_180 to mean formula_181 is also quite common.

There are many families of subsets that generate useful σ-algebras. Some of these are presented here.

===σ-algebra generated by a function===
If formula_182 is a function from a set formula_3 to a set formula_120 and formula_185 is a formula_133-algebra of subsets of formula_187 then the formula_133-algebra generated by the function formula_189 denoted by formula_190 is the collection of all inverse images formula_191 of the sets formula_192 in formula_193 That is,
formula_194

A function formula_182 from a set formula_3 to a set formula_120 is measurable with respect to a σ-algebra formula_54 of subsets of formula_3 if and only if formula_200 is a subset of formula_201

One common situation, and understood by default if formula_185 is not specified explicitly, is when formula_120 is a metric or topological space and formula_185 is the collection of Borel sets on formula_124

If formula_182 is a function from formula_3 to formula_208 then formula_200 is generated by the family of subsets which are inverse images of intervals/rectangles in formula_210
formula_211

A useful property is the following. Assume formula_182 is a measurable map from formula_213 to formula_214 and formula_215 is a measurable map from formula_213 to formula_217 If there exists a measurable map formula_218 from formula_219 to formula_214 such that formula_221 for all formula_222 then formula_223 If formula_192 is finite or countably infinite or, more generally, formula_214 is a standard Borel space (for example, a separable complete metric space with its associated Borel sets), then the converse is also true. Examples of standard Borel spaces include formula_208 with its Borel sets and formula_227 with the cylinder σ-algebra described below.

===Borel and Lebesgue σ-algebras===
An important example is the Borel algebra over any topological space: the σ-algebra generated by the open sets (or, equivalently, by the closed sets). This σ-algebra is not, in general, the whole power set. For a non-trivial example that is not a Borel set, see the Vitali set or Non-Borel sets.

On the Euclidean space formula_228 another σ-algebra is of importance: that of all Lebesgue measurable sets. This σ-algebra contains more sets than the Borel σ-algebra on formula_208 and is preferred in integration theory, as it gives a complete measure space.

===Product σ-algebra===
Let formula_230 and formula_231 be two measurable spaces. The σ-algebra for the corresponding product space formula_232 is called the product σ-algebra and is defined by
formula_233

Observe that formula_234 is a π-system.

The Borel σ-algebra for formula_208 is generated by half-infinite rectangles and by finite rectangles. For example,
formula_236

For each of these two examples, the generating family is a π-system.

===σ-algebra generated by cylinder sets===

Suppose
formula_237

is a set of real-valued functions. Let formula_238 denote the Borel subsets of formula_239 A cylinder subset of formula_3 is a finitely restricted set defined as
formula_241

Each
formula_242
is a π-system that generates a σ-algebra formula_243 Then the family of subsets
formula_244
is an algebra that generates the cylinder σ-algebra for formula_11 This σ-algebra is a subalgebra of the Borel σ-algebra determined by the product topology of formula_246 restricted to formula_11

An important special case is when formula_248 is the set of natural numbers and formula_3 is a set of real-valued sequences. In this case, it suffices to consider the cylinder sets
formula_250
for which
formula_251
is a non-decreasing sequence of σ-algebras.

===Ball σ-algebra===
The ball σ-algebra is the smallest σ-algebra containing all the open (and/or closed) balls. This is never larger than the Borel σ-algebra. Note that the two σ-algebra are equal for separable spaces. For some nonseparable spaces, some maps are ball measurable even though they are not Borel measurable, making use of the ball σ-algebra useful in the analysis of such maps.

===σ-algebra generated by random variable or vector===
Suppose formula_252 is a probability space. If formula_253 is measurable with respect to the Borel σ-algebra on formula_208 then formula_120 is called a random variable (formula_256) or random vector (formula_257). The σ-algebra generated by formula_120 is
formula_259

===σ-algebra generated by a stochastic process===
Suppose formula_260 is a probability space and formula_261 is the set of real-valued functions on formula_262 If formula_263 is measurable with respect to the cylinder σ-algebra formula_264 (see above) for formula_3 then formula_120 is called a stochastic process or random process. The σ-algebra generated by formula_120 is
formula_268
the σ-algebra generated by the inverse images of cylinder sets.

<text>The Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 11 November 1942) was a battle of the Second World War that took place near the Egyptian railway halt of El Alamein. The First Battle of El Alamein and the Battle of Alam el Halfa had prevented the Axis from advancing further into Egypt.

In October 1942 Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, commander of Eighth Army, opened his offensive against the Axis forces. In a 13-day battle the Axis &quot;Panzerarmee Afrika&quot; was crushed and forced to retreat from Egypt and Libya to the borders of Tunisia. The Allied victory at El Alamein was the beginning of the end of the Western Desert Campaign. 

The battle ended the Axis threat to the Middle East and Iran and revived the morale of the western Allies, being their first big success against the Axis since Operation Crusader in late 1941. The end of the battle coincided with the Allied invasion of French North Africa in Operation Torch on 8 November, which opened a second front in North Africa.

==Background==

Panzer Army Africa (/ &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel) composed of German and Italian tank and infantry units, subordinated to the new Italian command structure &quot;Delease&quot; (North African Command Delegation, Lieutenant-General Curio Barbasetti) had advanced into Egypt after its success at the Battle of Gazala (26 May – 21 June 1942). The Axis advance threatened British control of the Suez Canal, the Middle East and its oil resources. General Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Command and in tactical command of Eighth Army, withdrew the Eighth Army to within of Alexandria where the Qattara Depression was south of El Alamein on the coast. The depression was impassable and meant that any attack had to be frontal; Axis attacks in the First Battle of El Alamein (1–27 July) had been defeated.

Eighth Army counter-attacks in July also failed, as the Axis forces dug in and regrouped. Auchinleck called off the attacks at the end of July to rebuild the army. In early August, Winston Churchill and General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), visited Cairo and replaced Auchinleck as Commander-in-chief Middle East Command, with General Harold Alexander. Lieutenant-General William Gott was made commander of the Eighth Army but was killed when his transport aircraft was shot down by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters; Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery was flown from Britain to replace him.

Lacking reinforcements and depending on small, underdeveloped ports for supplies and aware of a huge Allied reinforcement operation for the Eighth Army, Rommel decided to attack first. The two armoured divisions of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; and the reconnaissance units of led the attack but were repulsed at the Alam el Halfa ridge and Point 102 on 30 August 1942, during the Battle of Alam el Halfa; the Axis forces retired to their start lines. The short front line and secure flanks favoured the defensive and Rommel had time to develop the Axis fortifications, sowing minefields with mines and miles of barbed wire. Alexander and Montgomery intended to establish a superiority of force sufficient to achieve a breakthrough and exploit it to destroy . Earlier in the Western Desert Campaign, neither side had been able to exploit a local victory sufficiently to defeat its opponent before it had withdrawn and transferred the problem of over-extended supply lines to the victor.

Until June 1942 Rommel had been receiving detailed information about the strength and movement of British forces from reports sent to Washington by Colonel Bonner Fellers, the U.S. military attaché in Cairo. The American code had been stolen following a covert operation by Italian military intelligence at the American Embassy in Rome the previous year. Despite British concerns, the Americans continued to use the code until the end of June. Suspicion that the code was compromised was confirmed when the 9th Australian Division captured the German 621st Signal Battalion in July 1942.

The British gained the intelligence advantage because Ultra and local sources exposed the Axis order of battle, its supply position and intentions. A reorganisation of military intelligence in Africa in July had also improved the integration of information received from all sources and the speed of its dissemination. With rare exceptions, intelligence identified the supply ships destined for North Africa, their location or routing and in most cases their cargoes, allowing them to be attacked. By 25 October, was down to three days&#x27; supply of fuel, only two days&#x27; of which were east of Tobruk. Harry Hinsley, the official historian of British intelligence, wrote in 1981 that &quot;The Panzer Army... did not possess the operational freedom of movement that was absolutely essential in consideration of the fact that the British offensive can be expected to start any day&quot;. Submarine and air transport somewhat eased the shortage of ammunition and by late October, there was sixteen days&#x27; supply at the front. After six more weeks, the Eighth Army was ready; and began the offensive against the and of the .

==Prelude==

===British plan===

====Operation Lightfoot====
Montgomery&#x27;s plan was for a main attack to the north of the line and a secondary attack to the south, involving XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese) and XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks), while X Corps (Lieutenant-General Herbert Lumsden) was to exploit the success. With Operation Lightfoot, Montgomery intended to cut two corridors through the Axis minefields in the north. One corridor was to run south-west through the 2nd New Zealand Division sector towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge, while the second was to run west, passing north of the west end of the Miteirya Ridge across the 9th Australian and 51st (Highland) Division sectors. Tanks would then pass through and defeat the German armour. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and also the south of the line would keep the rest of the Axis forces from moving northwards. Montgomery expected a 12-day battle in three stages: the break-in, the dogfight and the final breaking of the enemy.

For the first night of the offensive, Montgomery planned for four infantry divisions of XXX Corps to advance on a front to the Oxalic Line, over-running the forward Axis defences. Engineers would clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields, through which the armoured divisions from X Corps would pass to gain the Pierson Line. They would rally and consolidate their position just west of the infantry positions, blocking an Axis tank counter-attack. The British tanks would then advance to &quot;Skinflint&quot;, astride the north–south Rahman Track deep in the Axis defensive system, to challenge the Axis armour. The infantry battle would continue as the Eighth Army infantry &quot;crumbled&quot; the deep Axis defensive fortifications (three successive lines of fortification had been constructed) and destroy any tanks that attacked them.

====Operation Bertram====

Before the battle the Commonwealth forces practised deceptions, in Operation Bertram, to confuse the Axis command as to where and when the battle was to occur. In September, they dumped waste materials (discarded packing cases, etc.) under camouflage nets in the northern sector, making them appear to be ammunition or ration dumps. The Axis naturally noticed these but as no offensive action immediately followed and the &quot;dumps&quot; did not change in appearance, they were subsequently ignored. This allowed the Eighth Army to build up supplies in the forward area unnoticed by the Axis, by replacing the rubbish with ammunition, petrol and rations at night. A dummy pipeline was built, hopefully leading the Axis to believe the attack would occur much later than it did and much further south. Dummy tanks consisting of plywood frames placed over jeeps were built and deployed in the south. In a reverse feint, the tanks destined for battle in the north were disguised as supply trucks by placing removable plywood superstructures over them.

====Operation Braganza====

As a preliminary, the 131st (Queen&#x27;s) Infantry Brigade of the 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division, supported by tanks from the 4th Armoured Brigade, launched Operation Braganza attacking the paratroopers of the 185th Infantry Division &quot;Folgore&quot; on the night of 29/30 September in an attempt to capture the Deir el Munassib area. The Italian paratroopers repelled the attack, killing or capturing over 300 of the attackers. It was wrongly assumed that &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (German paratroopers) had manned the defences and been responsible for the British reverse. The &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; war diary notes that the Italian paratrooper unit &quot;bore the brunt of the attack. It fought well and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.&quot;

===Axis plan===

With the failure of their offensive at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, the Axis forces went onto the defensive but losses had not been excessive. The Axis supply line from Tripoli was extremely long and captured British supplies and equipment had been exhausted, but Rommel decided to advance into Egypt.

The Eighth Army was being supplied with men and materials from the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as with trucks and the new Sherman tanks from the United States. Rommel continued to request equipment, supplies and fuel but the priority of the German war effort was the Eastern Front and very limited supplies reached North Africa. Rommel was ill and in early September, arrangements were made for him to return to Germany on sick leave and for &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Georg Stumme to transfer from the Russian front to take his place. Before he left for Germany on 23 September, Rommel organised the defence and wrote a long appreciation of the situation to &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW armed forces high command), once again setting out the essential needs of the Panzer Army.
Rommel knew that the British and Commonwealth forces would soon be strong enough to attack. His only hope now relied on the German forces fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad quickly to defeat the Red Army, then move south through the Trans-Caucasus and threaten Iran (Persia) and the Middle East. If successful, large numbers of British and Commonwealth forces would have to be sent from the Egyptian front to reinforce the Ninth Army in Iran, leading to the postponement of any offensive against his army. Rommel hoped to convince OKW to reinforce his forces for the eventual link-up between and the German armies fighting in southern Russia, enabling them finally to defeat the British and Commonwealth armies in North Africa and the Middle East.

In the meantime, the dug in and waited for the attack by the Eighth Army or the defeat of the Red Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about apart, connected at intervals to create boxes (Devil&#x27;s gardens) which would restrict Allied penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts and the rest of the box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire. The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least behind the second mine belt. The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly Teller anti-tank mines with some smaller anti-personnel types such as the S-mine. (Many were British mines captured at Tobruk). To lure Allied vehicles into the minefields, the Italians dragged an axle and tyres through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.
Rommel did not want the British armour to break out into the open because he had neither the strength of numbers nor fuel to match them in a battle of manoeuvre. The battle had to be fought in the fortified zones; a breakthrough had to be defeated quickly. Rommel stiffened his forward lines by alternating German and Italian infantry formations. Because the British deception confused the Axis as to the point of attack, Rommel departed from his usual practice of holding his armoured strength in a concentrated reserve and split it into a northern group (15th Panzer Division and 133rd Armoured Division &quot;Littorio&quot;) and a southern group (21st Panzer Division and 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot;), each organised into battle groups to be able to make a quick armoured intervention wherever the blow fell and prevent narrow breakthroughs from being enlarged. A significant proportion of his armoured reserve was dispersed and held unusually far forward. The 15th Panzer Division had 125 operational tanks (16 Pz.IIs, 43 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 6 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F) while the 21st Panzer Division had 121 operational tanks (12 Pz.IIs, 38 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 2 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F).

Rommel held the 90th Light Division further back and kept the 101st Motorised Division &quot;Trieste&quot; in reserve near the coast. Rommel hoped to move his troops faster than the Allies, to concentrate his defences at the most important point () but lack of fuel meant that once the had concentrated, it would not be able to move again. The British were well aware that Rommel would be unable to mount a defence based on his usual manoeuvre tactics but no clear picture emerged of how he would fight the battle. British plans seriously underestimated the Axis defences and the fighting power of the .

==Battle==

===Phase one: the break-in===

Prior to the main barrage, there was a diversion by the 24th Australian Brigade, which involved the 15th Panzer Division being subjected to heavy fire for a few minutes. Then at 21:40 (Egyptian Summer Time) on 23 October on a calm, clear evening under the bright sky of a full moon, Operation Lightfoot began with a 1,000-gun barrage. The fire plan had been arranged so that the first rounds from the 882 guns from the field and medium batteries would land along the front at the same time. After twenty minutes of general bombardment, the guns switched to precision targets in support of the advancing infantry. The shelling plan continued for five and a half hours, by the end of which each gun had fired about 600 rounds, about 529,000 shells.

Operation Lightfoot alluded to the infantry attacking first. Anti-tank mines would not be tripped by soldiers stepping on them since they were too light. As the infantry advanced, engineers had to clear a path for the tanks coming behind. Each gap was to be wide, which was just enough to get tanks through in single file. The engineers had to clear a route through the Devil&#x27;s Gardens. It was a difficult task that was not achieved because of the depth of the Axis minefields.
At 22:00, the four infantry divisions of XXX Corps began to move. The objective was to establish a bridgehead before dawn at the imaginary line in the desert where the strongest enemy defences were situated, on the far side of the second mine belt. Once the infantry reached the first minefields, the mine sweepers, including Reconnaissance Corps troops and sappers, moved in to create a passage for the armoured divisions of X Corps. Progress was slower than planned but at 02:00, the first of the 500 tanks crawled forward. By 04:00, the lead tanks were in the minefields, where they stirred up so much dust that there was no visibility at all, traffic jams developed and tanks bogged down. Only about half of the infantry attained their objectives and none of the tanks broke through.

The 1st South African Division, on the left flank of XXX Corps, attacked on a two-brigade front to secure the southern end of Miteirya Ridge, with the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade on the right and the 3rd South African Infantry Brigade on the left. The 1st South African Infantry Brigade was deployed further south to create an anti-tank screen for the protection of the left flank of the attack. By 08:00 on 24 October, Miteirya Ridge was secured after a night of heavy fighting and a high number of casualties.
The 7th Armoured Division (with a Free French Brigade under command) from XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) made a secondary attack to the south. The main attack aimed to achieve a breakthrough, engage and pin down the 21st Panzer Division and the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division around Jebel Kalakh, while the Free French on the far left were to secure Qaret el Himeimat and the el Taqa plateau. The right flank of the attack was to be protected by 44th Infantry Division with the 131st Infantry Brigade. The attack met determined resistance, mainly from the 185th Infantry Division &quot;Folgore&quot;, part of the Ramcke Parachute Brigade and .

The minefields were deeper than anticipated and clearing paths through them was impeded by Axis defensive fire. By dawn on 24 October, paths still had not been cleared through the second minefield to release the 22nd and 4th Light Armoured Brigades into the open to make their planned turn north into the rear of enemy positions west of Deir el Munassib. Further north along the XIII Corps front, the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division achieved a limited and costly success against determined resistance from the 17th Infantry Division &quot;Pavia&quot;, 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot; and elements of the 185th Infantry Division &quot;Folgore&quot;. The 4th Indian Infantry Division, on the far left of the XXX Corps front at Ruweisat Ridge, made a mock attack and two small raids to deflect attention to the centre of the front.

===Phase two: the crumbling===

Dawn aerial reconnaissance showed little change in Axis dispositions and Montgomery ordered that the clearance of the northern corridor should be completed and the New Zealand Division supported by the 10th Armoured Division should push south from Miteirya Ridge. The 9th Australian Division, in the north, should plan a crumbling operation for that night, while in the southern sector, the 7th Armoured Division should continue to try to break through the minefields with support, if necessary, from the 44th Division. &quot;Panzer&quot; units counter-attacked the 51st Highland Division just after sunrise but were defeated.
The morning of Saturday 24 October brought disaster for the German headquarters. The Axis forces were stunned by British attack and their messages became confused and hysterical, with one Italian unit communicating to Germans that it had been wiped out by &quot;drunken negroes with tanks&quot;. The reports that Stumme had received that morning showed the attacks had been on a broad front but that such penetration as had occurred should be containable by local units. He went forward to see for himself, suffered a heart attack and died. Temporary command was given to Major-General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma. Hitler had already decided that Rommel should leave his sanatorium and return to North Africa. 

Pending complete clearance of paths through the minefields, the Allied armour was held at the Oxalic Line. In the 51st (Highland) Division sector, the Seaforth Highlanders, supported by tanks of the 2nd Armoured Brigade, attacked and captured the &quot;Stirling&quot; position. Artillery and the Desert Air Force, making over 1,000 sorties, bombarded Axis positions all day to aid the &#x27;crumbling&#x27; of the Axis forces. By 16:00 there was little progress beyond the Oxalic Line.

At dusk, with the sun at their backs, Axis tanks from the 15th Panzer Division and the &quot;Littorio&quot; Division advanced from the Kidney feature (also known to the Germans and Italians as Hill 28), often wrongly called a ridge as it was actually a depression, to engage the 1st Armoured Division and the first big tank engagement of El Alamein began. Over 100 tanks were involved and half were destroyed by dark; neither position was altered.
Lumsden wanted to call off the attack planned for the night of 24/25 September but Montgomery overruled him. The thrust that night by the 10th Armoured Division from Miteirya Ridge failed. The lifting of mines on the Miteirya Ridge and beyond took far longer than planned and the leading unit, the 8th Armoured Brigade, was caught on their start line at 22:00—zero hour—by an air attack and were scattered. Axis bombers destroyed a convoy of 25 British vehicles carrying petrol and ammunition, setting off a night-long blaze. By the time the 8th Armoured Brigade had reorganised they were well behind schedule and out of touch with the creeping artillery barrage. By daylight the brigade was caught in the open, suffering considerable fire from well sited tanks and anti-tank guns. The 24th Armoured Brigade had pushed forward and reported at dawn they were on the Pierson Line, although it turned out that, in the dust and confusion, they had mistaken their position and were well short.

The attack in the XIII Corps sector to the south fared no better. The 131st Infantry Brigade cleared a path through the mines but when the 22nd Armoured Brigade passed through, they came under fire and were repulsed, with 31 tanks disabled. British air activity that night focused on Rommel&#x27;s northern armoured group, where of bombs were dropped. To prevent a recurrence of the 8th Armoured Brigade&#x27;s experience from the air, attacks on Axis landing fields were also stepped up.

====D + 2: 25 October====
The first attack had ended by Sunday. The British had advanced through the minefields in the west to make a wide and deep inroad. They were on top of Miteirya Ridge in the south-east. Axis forces were firmly entrenched in most of their original battle positions and the attack had been contained. Montgomery decided that the planned advance southward from Miteirya Ridge by the New Zealanders would be too costly and instead decided that XXX Corps—while keeping firm hold of Miteirya—should strike northwards toward the coast with the 9th Australian Division. The 1st Armoured Division—on the Australian left—should continue to attack west and north-west; activity to the south on both corps fronts would be confined to patrolling. The battle would be concentrated at the Kidney feature and Tel el Eisa until a breakthrough occurred.
Rommel flew to Rome early on 25 October to press for more fuel and ammunition, then on to North Africa later in the day. Meanwhile, in the afternoon the Axis forces launched attacks using the 15th Panzer and &quot;Littorio&quot; divisions. The Panzer Army probed for a weakness but without success. The British and Commonwealth infantry attacked at dusk. Around midnight, the 51st (Highland) Division launched three attacks. These were hindered by navigational difficulties as no one knew quite where they were, and heavy casualties were suffered amidst the confusion. Nevertheless, most of the Oxalic Line was eventually secured excepting the Aberdeen position on the Kidney feature. While the 51st Highland Division was operating around the Kidney feature, the Australians were attacking Point 29 (sometimes shown on Axis maps as &quot;28&quot;) a high Axis artillery observation post south-west of Tel el Eisa, to surround the Axis coastal salient containing the German 164th Light Division and large numbers of Italian infantry.

This was the new northern thrust Montgomery had devised earlier in the day. The 26th Australian Brigade attacked at midnight, supported by artillery and 30 tanks of the 40th Royal Tank Regiment. The Australians took the position and 240 prisoners. Fighting continued in this area for the next week, as the Axis tried to recover the small hill that was so important to their defence. Night bombers dropped of bombs on targets in the battlefield and on the &quot;Stuka&quot; base at Sidi Haneish, while night fighters flew patrols over the battle area and the Axis forward landing grounds. In the south, the 4th Armoured Brigade and the 69th Infantry Brigade attacked the 187th Infantry Regiment &quot;Folgore&quot; at Deir Munassib, but lost about 20 tanks gaining only the forward positions.

Rommel arrived at El Alamein on the evening of the 25th to resume command of the Panzer Army Africa, which was renamed the German-Italian Panzer Army () that day. Rommel&#x27;s arrival boosted German morale, though there was little he could do to change the course of the battle.
On arrival at his headquarters, Rommel assessed the battle. Casualties, particularly in the north, as a result of incessant artillery and air attack, had been severe. The Italian 102nd Motorised Division &quot;Trento&quot; had lost 50 per cent of its infantry and most of its artillery and the 164th Light Division had lost two battalions. The 15th Panzer and &quot;Littorio&quot; divisions had prevented the British tanks from breaking through but this had been a costly defensive success, the 15th Panzer Division being reduced to 31 tanks. Most other units were also under strength, on half rations and many men were ill; had only enough fuel for three days.

===Phase three: the counter===

====D + 3: 26 October====
Rommel was convinced by this time that the main assault would come in the north and determined to retake Point 29. He ordered a counter-attack against it by the 15th Panzer Division and the 164th Light Division, with part of the Italian XX Corps to begin at 15:00 but under constant artillery and air attack this came to nothing. According to Rommel this attack did meet some success, with the Italians recapturing part of &quot;Hill 28&quot;,

The bulk of the 2/17th Australian Battalion, which defended the position, was forced to give some ground. Rommel reversed his policy of distributing his armour across the front, ordering the 90th Light Division forward from Ed Daba and 21st Panzer Division north along with one third of the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division and half the artillery from the southern sector to join the 15th Panzer Division and the &quot;Littorio&quot; Division. The move could not be reversed because of the fuel shortage. The &quot;Trieste&quot; Division was ordered from Fuka to replace the 90th Light Division at Ed Daba but the 21st Panzer Division and the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division made slow progress during the night under constant attack from DAF bombers.

At the Kidney feature, the British were unable to take advantage of the absent tanks; each time they tried to move forward they were stopped by anti-tank guns. Churchill railed, &quot;Is it really impossible to find a general who can win a battle?&quot; Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers of 42 Squadron, attached to 47 Squadron, sank the tanker &quot;Proserpina&quot; at Tobruk; three Vickers Wellington torpedo bombers of 38 Squadron destroyed the oil tanker &quot;Tergestea&quot; at Tobruk during the night, removing the last hope for refuelling the .

By 26 October, XXX Corps had completed the capture of the bridgehead west of the second mine belt. The British Forces had sustained 2000 casualties, the Australians 1000, the New Zealanders 1000 and the South Africans 600. The tanks of X Corps, established just beyond the infantry, had failed to break through the Axis anti-tank defences. Montgomery decided that over the next two days, while continuing the process of attrition, he would thin out his front line to create a reserve for another attack. The reserve was to include the 2nd New Zealand Division (with the 9th Armoured Brigade under command), the 10th Armoured Division and the 7th Armoured Division.

The attacks in the south, which lasted three days and caused considerable losses without achieving a breakthrough, were suspended.

====D + 4: 27 October====
The main battle was concentrated around Tel el Aqqaqir and the Kidney feature at the end of the 1st Armoured Division&#x27;s path through the minefield. A mile north-west of the feature was Outpost Woodcock and roughly the same distance south-west lay Outpost Snipe. An attack was planned on these areas using two battalions from 7th Motor Brigade. At 23:00 on 26 October 2 Battalion, The Rifle Brigade would attack Snipe and 2nd Battalion King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) would attack Woodcock. The plan was for 2nd Armoured Brigade to pass round the north of Woodcock the following dawn and 24th Armoured Brigade round the south of Snipe. The attack was to be supported by all the artillery of X and XXX Corps.

Both battalions had difficulty finding their way in the dark and dust. At dawn, the KRRC had not reached its objective and had to find cover and dig in some distance from Woodcock. The 2nd Rifle Brigade had been more fortunate and after following the shell bursts of the supporting artillery, dug in when they concluded they had reached their objective having encountered little opposition.

At 06:00, the 2nd Armoured Brigade commenced its advance and ran into such stiff opposition that, by noon, it had still not linked with the KRRC. The 24th Armoured Brigade started a little later and was soon in contact with the Rifle Brigade (having shelled them in error for a while). Some hours of confused fighting ensued involving tanks from the &quot;Littorio&quot; and troops and anti-tank guns from 15th Panzer which managed to keep the British armour at bay in spite of the support of the anti-tank guns of the Rifle Brigade battle group. Rommel had decided to make two counter-attacks using his fresh troops. 90th Light Division was to make a fresh attempt to capture Point 29 and 21st Panzer were targeted at Snipe (the &quot;Ariete&quot; detachment had returned south).

At Snipe, mortar and shellfire was constant all day. Lucas-Phillips, in his &quot;Alamein&quot; wrote:

At 16:00, Rommel launched his major attack. German and Italian tanks moved forward against the Rifle Brigade which had thirteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns along with six more from the 239th Anti-Tank Battery, RA. Although on the point of being overrun more than once they held their ground, destroying 22 German and 10 Italian tanks. The Germans gave up but in error the British battle group was withdrawn without being replaced that evening. Only one anti-tank gun—from 239 Battery—could be brought back. The action at Snipe was an episode of the Battle of El Alamein described by the regimental historian of the Rifle Brigade as the most famous day of the regiment&#x27;s war. Its CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Victor Buller Turner, was awarded the Victoria Cross.

When it was discovered that neither Woodcock nor Snipe was in Eighth Army hands, the 133rd Lorried Infantry Brigade was sent to capture them. By 01:30 on 28 October, the 4th battalion Royal Sussex Regiment judged they were on Woodcock and dug in. At dawn, the 2nd Armoured Brigade moved up in support but before contact could be made the 4th Royal Sussex were counter-attacked and overrun with many losses. The 133rd Lorried Brigade&#x27;s two other battalions had moved on Snipe and dug in, only to find out the next day that they were in fact well short of their objective.

Further north, the attack by the 90th Light Division attack on Point 29 during the afternoon of 27 October failed under heavy artillery and bombing which broke up the attack before it had closed with the Australians.

====D + 5–6: 28–29 October====

On 28 October, the 15th and 21st Panzer made a determined attack on the X Corps front but were halted by artillery, tank and anti-tank gun fire. In the afternoon, they paused to regroup to attack again but they were bombed for two and a half hours and were prevented from even forming up. This proved to be Rommel&#x27;s last attempt to take the initiative and as such his defeat here represented a turning point in the battle.

At this point, Montgomery ordered the X Corps formations in the area of Woodcock and Snipe to go over to the defensive while he concentrated the attack further to the north. Late on 27 October, the 133rd Brigade Lorried Infantry Brigade was sent forward to recover lost positions but the next day, a good part of this force was overrun by German and Italian tanks from the Littorio and supporting 12th Bersaglieri Regiment; several hundred British soldiers were captured. On the night of 28/29 October, the 9th Australian Division was ordered to make a second set-piece attack. The 20th Australian Infantry Brigade with the 40th R.T.R. in support would push north-west from Point 29 to form a base for the 26th Australian Infantry Brigade with the 46th R.T.R. in support, to attack north-east to an Axis position south of the railway known as Thompson&#x27;s Post. Once Thompson&#x27;s Post was captured, the Australians were to cross the railway to the coast road and advance south-east to close on the rear of the Axis troops in the coastal salient. An attack by the third brigade would then be launched on the salient from the south-east.

The 20th Brigade took its objectives with little trouble but 26th Brigade had difficulty. Because of the distances involved, the troops were riding on the Valentine tanks of the 46th R.T.R. and carriers, which mines and anti-tank guns soon brought to grief, forcing the infantry to dismount. The infantry and tanks lost touch, fighting with the 125th &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; Regiment and a battalion of the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment sent to reinforce the sector; the advance came to a halt. The Australians suffered 200 casualties in that attack and suffered 27 killed and 290 wounded. The German and Italian forces that had participated in the counter-attack formed an outpost and held on until the arrival of German reinforcements on 1 November.
It became clear that there were no longer enough hours of darkness left to reform, continue the attack and see it to its conclusion, so the operation was called off. By the end of these engagements in late October, the British still had 800 serviceable tanks and the &quot;Panzerarmee&quot; day report for 28 October (intercepted and read by Eighth Army the following evening) recorded 81 serviceable German tanks and 197 Italian. With the help of signals intelligence information the &quot;Proserpina&quot; (carrying 4,500 tonnes of fuel) and &quot;Tergestea&quot; (carrying 1,000 tonnes of fuel and 1,000 tonnes of ammunition) had been destroyed on 26 October and the tanker &quot;Luisiano&quot; (carrying 2,500 tonnes of fuel) had been sunk off the west coast of Greece by a torpedo from a Wellington bomber on 28 October. Rommel told his commanders, &quot;It will be quite impossible for us to disengage from the enemy. There is no gasoline for such a manoeuvre. We have only one choice and that is to fight to the end at Alamein&quot;.

The Australian and British attacks had alerted Montgomery that Rommel had committed his reserve, the 90th Light Division, to the front and that its presence in the coastal sector suggested that Rommel was expecting the next major Eighth Army offensive there. Montgomery decided to attack further south on a front south of Point 29. The attack was to take place on the night of 31 October/1 November, as soon as he had completed the reorganisation of his front line to create reserves for the offensive (although in the event it was postponed by 24 hours). To keep Rommel&#x27;s attention on the coastal sector, Montgomery ordered the renewal of the 9th Australian Division operation on the night of 30/31 October.

====D + 7–9: 30 October – 1 November====

The night of 30 October saw the third Australian attempt to reach the paved road and by the end of the night they were astride the road and the railway, making the position of the Axis troops in the salient precarious. A battlegroup from the 21st Panzer Division launched four attacks against Thompson&#x27;s Post on 31 October, all being repulsed. Sergeant William Kibby (2/48th Australian Infantry Battalion), for his actions from 23 October until his death on 31 October, including a lone attack on a machine-gun position at his own initiative, was awarded the Victoria Cross (posthumous). On 1 November, contact with 125 in the nose of the salient was restored; the supporting X Bersaglieri Battalion of the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment resisted several Australian attacks.

On 1 November, the tankers &quot;Tripolino&quot; and &quot;Ostia&quot; were torpedoed and sunk by aircraft, north-west of Tobruk. The shortage forced Rommel to rely increasingly on fuel flown in from Crete on the orders of Albert Kesselring, (OB , Supreme Commander South), despite the restrictions imposed by the bombing of the airfields in Crete and Desert Air Force interceptions of the transport aircraft. Rommel began to plan a retirement to Fuka, some to the west, as he had only 90 tanks remaining, against 800 British tanks. Large amounts of fuel arrived at Benghazi after the German forces had started to retreat but little of it reached the front, a fact Kesselring tried to change by delivering it more closely to the fighting forces. Barbasetti insisted to Rommel that the &quot;Deutsche-Italienlische Panzerarmee&quot; must hold at El Alamein as supplies would arrive for them.

===Phase four: Operation Supercharge===

====D + 10: 2 November====

This phase of the battle began at 01:00 on 2 November, with the objective of destroying enemy armour, forcing the enemy to fight in the open, reducing the Axis stock of petrol, attacking and occupying enemy supply routes, and causing the disintegration of the enemy army. The intensity and the destruction in Supercharge were greater than anything witnessed so far during this battle. The objective of this operation was Tel el Aqqaqir, the base of the Axis defence roughly north-west of the Kidney feature and situated on the Rahman lateral track.

The initial thrust of Supercharge was to be carried out by the 2nd New Zealand Division. Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg had tried to free them of this task, as they had lost 1,405 men in just three days, at El Ruweisat Ridge in July. Along with the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and 28th (Maori) Infantry Battalion, the division was to have had placed under its command the 151st (Durham) Brigade from the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, the 152nd (Seaforth and Camerons) Brigade from the 51st (Highland) Division and the 133rd Royal Sussex Lorried Infantry Brigade and the 9th Armoured Brigade under command.

As in Operation Lightfoot, it was planned that two infantry brigades (the 151st on the right and 152nd on the left) each this time supported by a regiment of tanks—the 8th and 50th Royal Tank Regiments—would advance and clear a path through the mines. Once they reached their objectives, distant, 9th Armoured Brigade would pass through supported by a heavy artillery barrage and break open a gap in the Axis defences on and around the Rahman track, some further forward, which the 1st Armoured Division, following behind, would pass through into the open to take on Rommel&#x27;s armoured reserves. Rommel had ordered 21st Panzer Division from the front line on 31 October to form a mobile counterattacking force. The division had left behind a &quot;panzergrenadier&quot; regiment which would bolster the &quot;Trieste&quot; Division which had been ordered forward to replace it. Rommel had also interspersed formations from the &quot;Trieste&quot; and 15th Panzer Divisions to &quot;corset&quot; his weaker forces in the front line. On 1 November the two German armoured divisions had 102 effective tanks to face Supercharge and the &quot;Littorio&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot; Divisions had 65 tanks between them.

Supercharge started with a seven-hour aerial bombardment focused on Tel el Aqqaqir and Sidi Abd el Rahman, followed by a four and a half-hour barrage of 360 guns firing 15,000 shells. The two assault brigades started their attack at 01:05 on 2 November and gained most of their objectives to schedule and with moderate losses. One battalion from the 90th Light Division along with another battalion from the 15th Panzer Division were soon overrun and at 04:45 it was reported that only one Bersaglieri infantry battalion was still manning the defensive line. On the right of the main attack 28th (Maori) battalion captured positions to protect the right flank of the newly formed salient and 133rd Lorried Infantry did the same on the left. New Zealand engineers cleared five lines through the mines allowing the Royal Dragoons armoured car regiment to slip out into the open and spend the day raiding the Axis communications.

The 9th Armoured Brigade had started its approach march at 20:00 on 1 November from El Alamein railway station with around 130 tanks and arrived at its start line with only 94 runners (operational tanks). The brigade was to have started its attack towards Tel el Aqqaqir at 05:45 behind a barrage; the attack was postponed for 30 minutes while the brigade regrouped on Currie&#x27;s orders. At 06:15, 30 minutes before dawn, the three regiments of the brigade advanced towards the gun line.

Brigadier Currie had tried to get the brigade out of doing this job, stating that he believed the brigade would be attacking on too wide a front with no reserves and that they would most likely have 50 per cent losses.

The reply came from Freyberg that Montgomery

The German and Italian anti-tank guns (mostly Pak38 and Italian 47 mm guns, along with 24 of the formidable 88 mm flak guns) opened fire upon the charging tanks silhouetted by the rising sun. German tanks, which had penetrated between the Warwickshire Yeomanry and Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, also caused many casualties. British tanks attacking the &quot;Folgore&quot; sector were fought off with petrol bombs and mortar fire as well as with the obsolete Italian 47 mm guns. The Axis gun screen started to inflict a steady amount of damage upon the advancing tanks but was unable to stop them; over the course of the next 30 minutes, around 35 guns were destroyed and several hundred prisoners taken. The 9th Armoured Brigade had started the attack with 94 tanks and was reduced to only 14 runners, of the 400 crews involved in the attack, 230 had been killed, wounded or captured.


After the Brigade&#x27;s action, Brigadier Gentry of 6th New Zealand Brigade went ahead to survey the scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he approached him saying, &quot;Sorry to wake you John, but I&#x27;d like to know where your tanks are?&quot; Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him and replied &quot;There they are&quot;. Gentry said &quot;I don&#x27;t mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?&quot; Currie waved his arm and again replied, &quot;There are my armoured regiments, Bill&quot;.

The brigade had sacrificed itself upon the gun line and caused great damage but had failed to create the gap for the 1st Armoured Division to pass through; however, soon after dawn 1st Armoured Division started to deploy and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade came under its command. 2nd Armoured Brigade came up behind the 9th, and by mid-morning 8th Armoured Brigade had come up on its left, ordered to advance to the south-west. In heavy fighting during the day the British armour made little further progress. At 11:00 on 2 November, the remains of 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer and &quot;Littorio&quot; divisions counter-attacked 1st Armoured Division and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade, which by that time had dug in with a screen of anti-tank guns and artillery together with intensive air support. The counter-attack failed under a blanket of shells and bombs, resulting in a loss of some 100 tanks.
Although X Corps had failed in its attempt to break out, it had succeeded in its objective of finding and destroying enemy tanks. Although tank losses were approximately equal, this represented only a portion of the total British armour, but most of Rommel&#x27;s tanks; the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; strength of tanks fit for battle fell by 70 while in addition to the losses of the 9th Armoured Brigade, the 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades lost 14 tanks in the fighting, with another 40 damaged or broken down. The fighting was later termed the &quot;Hammering of the Panzers&quot;. In the late afternoon and early evening, the 133rd Lorried and 151st Infantry Brigades—by this time back under command of 51st Infantry Division—attacked respectively the Snipe and Skinflint (about a mile west of Snipe) positions in order to form a base for future operations. The heavy artillery concentration which accompanied their advance suppressed the opposition from the &quot;Trieste&quot; Division and the operation succeeded with few casualties.

On the night of 2 November, Montgomery once again reshuffled his infantry in order to bring four brigades (5th Indian, 151st, 5th New Zealand and 154th) into reserve under XXX Corps to prepare for the next thrust. He also reinforced X Corps by moving 7th Armoured Division from army reserve and sending 4th Light Armoured Brigade from XIII Corps in the south. General von Thoma&#x27;s report to Rommel that night said he would have at most 35 tanks available to fight the next day and his artillery and anti-tank weapons had been reduced to ⅓ of their strength at the start of the battle. Rommel concluded that to forestall a breakthrough and the resulting destruction of his whole army he must start withdrawing to the planned position at Fuka. He called up &quot;Ariete&quot; from the south to join the mobile Italian XX Corps around Tel el Aqqaqir. His mobile forces (XX Corps, &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;, 90th Light Division and 19th &quot;Flak&quot; Division) were ordered to make a fighting withdrawal while his other formations were to withdraw as best they could with the limited transport available.

====D + 11: 3 November====
At 20:30 on 2 November, Lumsden decided that one more effort by X Corps would see the gun screen on the Rahman track defeated and ordered the 7th Motor Brigade to seize the track along a front north of Tel el Aqqaqir. The 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades would then pass through the infantry to a distance of about . On the morning of 3 November the 7th Armoured Division would pass through and swing north heading for the railway at Ghazal station. 7th Motor Brigade set off at 01:15 on 3 November, but having received its orders late, had not had the chance to reconnoitre the battle area in daylight. This combined with stiff resistance led to the failure of their attack. As a consequence, the orders for the armour were changed and 2nd Armoured Brigade was tasked to support the forward battalion of the 133rd Lorried Brigade (2nd King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps) and the 8th Armoured Brigade was to push south-west. Fighting continued throughout 3 November, but the 2nd Armoured Brigade was held off by elements of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; and tanks of the &quot;Littorio&quot; Division. Further south, the 8th Armoured Brigade was held off by anti-tank units helped later by tanks of the arriving &quot;Ariete&quot; Division.

===Phase five: the break-out===
On 2 November, Rommel signalled to Hitler that

and at 13.30 on 3 November Rommel received a reply,

Rommel thought the order (similar to one that had been given at the same time by Benito Mussolini through ),

Rommel ordered the Italian X and XXI Corps and the 90th Light Division to hold while the withdrew approximately west during the night of 3 November. The Italian XX Corps and the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division conformed to their position and Rommel replied to Hitler confirming his determination to hold the battlefield. The Desert Air Force continued its bombing and in its biggest day of the battle it flew 1,208 sorties and dropped of bombs.

On the night of 3/4 November, Montgomery ordered three of the infantry brigades in reserve to advance on the Rahman track as a prelude to an armoured break-out. At 17:45, the 152nd Infantry Brigade with the 8th RTR in support, attacked about south of Tel el Aqqaqir. The 5th Indian Infantry Brigade was to attack the track further south during the early hours of 4 November; at 06:15, the 154th Infantry Brigade was to attack Tel el Aqqaqir. The 152nd Infantry Brigade was mistakenly told the Axis had withdrawn from their objectives and unexpectedly met determined resistance. Communications failed and the forward infantry elements ended up digging in well short of their objective. By the time the 5th Indian Brigade set off, the defenders had begun to withdraw and their objective was taken virtually unopposed. By the time the 154th Brigade moved into some artillery-fire, the Axis had left.

====D + 12, 4 November====

On 4 November, the Eighth Army plan for pursuit began at dawn; no fresh units were available and the 1st and 7th Armoured divisions were to turn northwards to roll up the Axis units still in the forward lines. The 2nd New Zealand Division with two lorried infantry brigades and the 9th Armoured and 4th Light Armoured brigades under command, was to head west along desert tracks to the escarpment above Fuka, about away. The New Zealanders got off to a slow start because its units were dispersed after the recent fighting and took time to concentrate. Paths through the minefields were congested and had deteriorated, which caused more delays. By dark, the division was only west of the Rahman track, the 9th Armoured Brigade was still at the track and the 6th New Zealand Brigade even further back.

The plan to trap the 90th Light Division with the 1st and 7th Armoured divisions misfired. The 1st Armoured Division came into contact with the remnants of 21st Panzer Division and had to spend most of the day pushing them back . The 7th Armoured Division was held up by the &quot;Ariete&quot; Armoured Division, which was destroyed conducting a determined resistance. In his diary, Rommel wrote

The 133rd Armoured Division &quot;Littorio&quot; and the 101st Motorised Division &quot;Trieste&quot; were also destroyed. Berlin radio claimed that in this sector the &quot;British were made to pay for their penetration with enormous losses in men and material. The Italians fought to the last man.&quot; The British took many prisoners, since the remnants of Italian infantry divisions were not motorised and could not escape from encirclement. Private Sid Martindale, 1st Battalion Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders, wrote

The &quot;Bologna&quot; Division and the remnants of the &quot;Trento&quot; Division tried to fight their way out and marched into the desert without water, food or transport before surrendering, exhausted and dying from dehydration. It was reported that Colonel Arrigo Dall&#x27;Olio, commanding the 40th Infantry Regiment of the &quot;Bologna&quot; Division, surrendered saying, &quot;We have ceased firing not because we haven&#x27;t the desire but because we have spent every round&quot;. In a symbolic act of defiance, no one in the 40th Infantry Regiment &quot;Bologna&quot; raised their hands. Harry Zinder of &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that the Italians fought better than had been expected and commented that for the Italians

By late morning on 4 November, Rommel realised his situation was desperate,

Rommel telegraphed Hitler for permission to fall back on Fuka. As further British blows fell, Thoma was captured and reports came in from the &quot;Ariete&quot; and &quot;Trento&quot; divisions that they were encircled. At 17:30, unable to wait any longer for a reply from Hitler, Rommel gave orders to retreat.

Due to lack of transport, most of the Italian infantry formations were abandoned. Any chance of getting them away with an earlier move had been spoiled by Hitler&#x27;s insistence that Rommel hold his ground, obliging him to keep the non-motorised Italian units well forward until it was too late. To deepen the armoured thrusts, the 1st Armoured Division was directed at El Daba, down the coast and the 7th Armoured Division towards Galal, a further west along the railway. The New Zealand Division group had hoped to reach their objective by mid-morning on 5 November but was held up by artillery-fire when picking their way through what turned out to be a dummy minefield and the 15th Panzer Division got there first.

====D + 13, 5 November====
The 7th Armoured Division was ordered cross-country to cut the coast road at Sidi Haneish, west of the Rahman track, while the 1st Armoured Division, west of El Dada, was ordered to take a wide detour through the desert to Bir Khalda, west of the Rahman track, preparatory to turning north to cut the road at Mersa Matruh. Both moves failed, the 7th Armoured Division finished the day short of its objective. The 1st Armoured Division tried to make up time with a night march but in the darkness the armour became separated from their support vehicles and ran out of fuel at dawn on 6 November, short of Bir Khalda. The DAF continued to fly in support but because of the dispersion of X Corps, it was difficult to establish bomb lines, beyond which, aircraft were free to attack.

====D + 14, 6 November====
By 11:00 on 6 November, the &quot;B&quot; Echelon support vehicles began to reach the 1st Armoured Division but with only enough fuel to replenish two of the armoured regiments, which set off again hoping to be in time to cut off the Axis. The regiments ran out of fuel again, south-west of Mersa Matruh. A fuel convoy had set out from Alamein on the evening of 5 November but progress was slow as the tracks had become very cut up. By midday on 6 November, it began to rain and the convoy bogged from the rendezvous with the 1st Armoured Division &quot;B&quot;. The 2nd New Zealand Division advanced toward Sidi Haneish while the 8th Armoured Brigade, 10th Armoured Division, had moved west from Galal to occupy the landing fields at Fuka and the escarpment. Roughly south-west of Sidi Haneish, the 7th Armoured Division encountered the 21st Panzer Division and the &quot;Voss&quot; Reconnaissance Group that morning. In a running fight, the 21st Panzer Division lost 16 tanks and numerous guns, narrowly escaping encirclement and reached Mersa Matruh that evening. It was again difficult to define bomb lines but US heavy bombers attacked Tobruk, sinking [] and later attacked Benghazi, sinking and setting the tanker (6,572 GRT), alight.

====D + 15 onward, 7 to 11 November====

On 7 November, waterlogged ground and lack of fuel stranded the 1st and 7th Armoured divisions. The 10th Armoured Division, on the coast road and with ample fuel, advanced to Mersa Matruh while its infantry mopped up on the road west of Galal. Rommel intended to fight a delaying action at Sidi Barrani, west of Matruh, to gain time for Axis troops to get through the bottlenecks at Halfaya and Sollum. The last rearguards left Matruh on the night of 7/8 November but were only able to hold Sidi Barrani until the evening of 9 November. By the evening of 10 November, the 2nd New Zealand Division, heading for Sollum, had the 4th Light Armoured Brigade at the foot of the Halfaya Pass while 7th Armoured Division was conducting another detour to the south, to take Fort Capuzzo and Sidi Azeiz. On the morning of 11 November, the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade captured the pass, taking 600 Italian prisoners. By nightfall on 11 November, the Egyptian wall was clear but Montgomery was forced to order that the pursuit should temporarily be continued only by armoured cars and artillery, because of the difficulty in supplying larger formations west of Bardia.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
Despite his defeat at El Alamein, Rommel did not lose hope until the end of the Tunisia Campaign. Alexander contacted Churchill and suggested he &quot;Ring out the bells&quot;.

Churchill was due to address the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Banquet at the Mansion House on 10 November 1942. He spoke at length about the victory and made his famous claim that

Looking back in 1950, Churchill wrote in his memoirs that: &quot;It may almost be said, &#x27;Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat&#x27;&quot;.

The Allies frequently had numerical superiority in the Western Desert but never had it been so complete in quantity and quality. With the arrival of Sherman tanks, 6-pounder anti-tank guns and Spitfires in the Western Desert, the Allies gained a comprehensive superiority. Montgomery envisioned the battle as an attrition operation, similar to those fought in the First World War and accurately predicted the length of the battle and the number of British and Commonwealth casualties. British artillery was superbly handled and British air support was excellent, in contrast to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, which offered little or no support to ground forces, preferring to engage in air-to-air combat. Air supremacy had a huge effect on the battle. Montgomery wrote,

Historians debate the reasons Rommel decided to advance into Egypt. In 1997, Martin van Creveld wrote that Rommel had been advised by the German and Italian staffs that his army could not properly be supplied so far from the ports of Tripoli and Benghazi. Rommel pressed ahead with his advance to Alamein and as predicted, supply difficulties limited the attacking potential of the Axis forces. According to Maurice Remy (2002), Hitler and Mussolini put pressure on Rommel to advance, the importance to them being the need to capture the Suez Canal and seize the Middle East and Persian oil fields. Rommel had been very pessimistic, especially after the First Battle of El Alamein and knew that as US supplies were en route to Africa and Axis ships were being sunk in the Mediterranean, the Axis was losing a race against time. On 27 August, Kesselring promised Rommel that supplies would arrive in time but Siegfried Westphal pointed out that such an expectation would be unrealistic and the offensive should not begin until they had arrived. After a conversation with Kesselring on 30 August, Rommel decided to attack, &quot;the hardest [decision] in my life&quot;.

===Casualties===

In 2005, Niall Barr wrote that the casualties, was an estimate because of the chaos of the Axis retreat. British figures, based on Ultra intercepts, gave German casualties as and captured. Italian losses were and captured. By 11 November, the number of Axis prisoners had risen to In a note to &quot;The Rommel Papers&quot;, Fritz Bayerlein (quoting figures obtained from ) instead estimated German losses in the battle as 1,100 killed, 3,900 wounded and 7,900 prisoners and Italian losses as 1,200 killed, 1,600 wounded and 20,000 prisoners.

According to the Italian official history, Axis losses during the battle were 4,000 to 5,000 killed or missing, 7,000 to 8,000 wounded and 17,000 prisoners; during the retreat the losses rose to 9,000 killed or missing, 15,000 wounded and 35,000 prisoners. According to General Giuseppe Rizzo, total Axis casualties included 25,000 men killed or wounded (including 5,920 Italians killed) and 30,000 prisoners (20,000 Italians and 10,724 Germans), 510 tanks and 2,000 field guns, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns. Axis tank losses were on 4 November, only tanks were left out of the the beginning of the battle. About half of the tanks had been lost and most of the remainder were knocked out on the next day by the 7th Armoured Division. About guns were lost, along with and aircraft.

The Eighth Army had of whom had been killed, and missing; of the casualties were British, Australian, New Zealanders, South African, Indian and other nationalities. The Eighth Army lost from tanks, although by the end of the battle, had been repaired. The artillery lost and the DAF lost and aircraft.

===Subsequent operations===
The Eighth Army was surprised by the Axis withdrawal and confusion caused by redeployments between the three corps meant they were slow in pursuit, failing to cut off Rommel at Fuka and Mersa Matruh. The Desert Air Force failed to make a maximum effort to bomb a disorganised and retreating opponent, which on 5 November was within range and confined to the coast road. Supply shortages and a belief that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; were about to get strong reinforcements, led the DAF to be cautious, reduce the number of offensive sorties on 5 November and protect the Eighth Army.

====Battle of El Agheila====

The Axis made a fighting withdrawal to El Agheila but the Axis troops were exhausted and had received few replacements, while Montgomery had planned to transport material over great distances, to provide the Eighth Army with of supplies per day. Huge quantities of engineer stores had been collected to repair the coast road; the railway line from El Alamein to Fort Capuzzo, despite having been blown up in over 200 places, was quickly repaired. In the month after the Eighth Army reached Capuzzo, the railway carried of supplies. Benghazi handled a day by the end of December, rather than the expected .

Montgomery paused for three weeks to concentrate his forces and prepare an assault on El Agheila to deny the Axis the possibility of a counter-attack. On 11 December, the 51st (Highland) Division attacked along the line of the coast road with the 7th Armoured Division on the inland flank. On 12 December the 2nd New Zealand Division started a deeper flanking manoeuvre to cut the Axis line of retreat on the coast road in the rear of the Mersa Brega position. The Highland Division made a slow and costly advance and 7th Armoured Division met stiff resistance from the Combat Group &quot;Ariete&quot; (the remains of the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot;). The had lost roughly 75,000 men, 1,000 guns and 500 tanks since the Second Battle of Alamein and withdrew. By 15 December, the New Zealanders had reached the coast road but the firm terrain allowed Rommel to break his forces into smaller units and withdraw cross-country through the gaps between the New Zealand positions.

Rommel conducted a text-book retreat, destroying all equipment and infrastructure left behind and peppering the land behind him with mines and booby traps. The Eighth Army reached Sirte on 25 December but west of the port, were forced to pause to consolidate their strung out formations and to prepare an attack at Wadi Zemzem, near Buerat east of Tripoli. Rommel had, with the agreement of Field Marshal Bastico, sent a request to the Italian &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; in Rome to withdraw to Tunisia where the terrain would better suit a defensive action and where he could link with the Axis army forming there after the Operation Torch landings. Mussolini replied on 19 December that the must resist to the last man at Buerat.

====Tripoli====
On 15 January 1943, the 51st (Highland) Division made a frontal attack while the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 7th Armoured Division drove around the inland flank of the Axis line. Weakened by the withdrawal of 21st Panzer Division to Tunisia to strengthen the 5th Panzer Army (Hans-Jürgen von Arnim), Rommel conducted a fighting retreat. The port of Tripoli, further west, was taken on 23 January as Rommel continued to withdraw to the Mareth Line, the French southern defensive position in Tunisia.

====Tunisia====

Rommel was by this time in contact with the Fifth Panzer Army, which had been fighting against the multi-national First Army in northern Tunisia, since shortly after Operation Torch. Hitler was determined to retain Tunisia and Rommel finally started to receive replacement men and materials. The Axis faced a war on two fronts, with the Eighth Army approaching from the east and the British, French and Americans from the west. The German-Italian Panzer Army was renamed the Italian First Army (General Giovanni Messe) and Rommel assumed command of the new Army Group Africa, responsible for both fronts. The two British armies were commanded by the 18th Army Group (General Harold Alexander). The failure of the Run for Tunis by the First Army in December 1942, led the North African campaign to last longer, ending when the Italian-German forces in North Africa capitulated in May 1943.

<doc id="29588" wikidata="Q179430" url="?curid=29588" title="Sextant">
<text>A sextant is a doubly reflecting navigation instrument that measures the angular distance between two visible objects. The primary use of a sextant is to measure the angle between an astronomical object and the horizon for the purposes of celestial navigation.

The estimation of this angle, the altitude, is known as &quot;sighting&quot; or &quot;shooting&quot; the object, or &quot;taking a sight&quot;. The angle, and the time when it was measured, can be used to calculate a position line on a nautical or aeronautical chart—for example, sighting the Sun at noon or Polaris at night (in the Northern Hemisphere) to estimate latitude (with sight reduction). Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of &quot;distance off&quot; and, held horizontally, a sextant can measure angles between objects for a position on a chart. A sextant can also be used to measure the lunar distance between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine Greenwich Mean Time and hence longitude.

The principle of the instrument was first implemented around 1731 by John Hadley (1682–1744) and Thomas Godfrey (1704–1749), but it was also found later in the unpublished writings of Isaac Newton (1643–1727).

In 1922, it was modified for aeronautical navigation by Portuguese navigator and naval officer .

==Navigational sextants==
Like the Davis quadrant, the sextant allows celestial objects to be measured relative to the horizon, rather than relative to the instrument. This allows excellent precision. Also, unlike the backstaff, the sextant allows direct observations of stars. This permits the use of the sextant at night when a backstaff is difficult to use. For solar observations, filters allow direct observation of the Sun.

Since the measurement is relative to the horizon, the measuring pointer is a beam of light that reaches to the horizon. The measurement is thus limited by the angular accuracy of the instrument and not the sine error of the length of an alidade, as it is in a mariner&#x27;s astrolabe or similar older instrument.

A sextant does not require a completely steady aim, because it measures a relative angle. For example, when a sextant is used on a moving ship, the image of both horizon and celestial object will move around in the field of view. However, the relative position of the two images will remain steady, and as long as the user can determine when the celestial object touches the horizon, the accuracy of the measurement will remain high compared to the magnitude of the movement.

The sextant is not dependent upon electricity (unlike many forms of modern navigation) or any human-controlled signals (such as GPS). For these reasons it is considered to be an eminently practical back-up navigation tool for ships.

==Design==
The frame of a sextant is in the shape of a sector which is approximately of a circle (60°), hence its name (&quot;sextāns, sextantis&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;one sixth&quot;). Both smaller and larger instruments are (or were) in use: the octant, quintant (or pentant) and the (doubly reflecting) quadrant span sectors of approximately of a circle (45°), of a circle (72°) and of a circle (90°), respectively. All of these instruments may be termed &quot;sextants&quot;.

Attached to the frame are the &quot;horizon mirror&quot;, an &quot;index arm&quot; which moves the &quot;index mirror&quot;, a sighting telescope, Sun shades, a graduated scale and a micrometer drum gauge for accurate measurements. The scale must be graduated so that the marked degree divisions register twice the angle through which the index arm turns. The scales of the octant, sextant, quintant and quadrant are graduated from below zero to 90°, 120°, 140° and 180° respectively. For example, the sextant illustrated has a scale graduated from −10° to 142°, which is basically a quintant: the frame is a sector of a circle subtending an angle of 76° at the pivot of the index arm.

The necessity for the doubled scale reading follows from consideration of the relations of the fixed ray (between the mirrors), the object ray (from the sighted object) and the direction of the normal perpendicular to the index mirror. When the index arm moves by an angle, say 20°, the angle between the fixed ray and the normal also increases by 20°. But the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection so the angle between the object ray and the normal must also increase by 20°. The angle between the fixed ray and the object ray must therefore increase by 40°. This is the case shown in the graphic.

There are two types of horizon mirrors on the market today. Both types give good results.

Traditional sextants have a half-horizon mirror, which divides the field of view in two. On one side, there is a view of the horizon; on the other side, a view of the celestial object. The advantage of this type is that both the horizon and celestial object are bright and as clear as possible. This is superior at night and in haze, when the horizon and/or a star being sighted can be difficult to see. However, one has to sweep the celestial object to ensure that the lowest limb of the celestial object touches the horizon.

Whole-horizon sextants use a half-silvered horizon mirror to provide a full view of the horizon. This makes it easy to see when the bottom limb of a celestial object touches the horizon. Since most sights are of the Sun or Moon, and haze is rare without overcast, the low-light advantages of the half-horizon mirror are rarely important in practice.

In both types, larger mirrors give a larger field of view, and thus make it easier to find a celestial object. Modern sextants often have 5 cm or larger mirrors, while 19th-century sextants rarely had a mirror larger than 2.5 cm (one inch). In large part, this is because precision flat mirrors have grown less expensive to manufacture and to silver.

An artificial horizon is useful when the horizon is invisible, as occurs in fog, on moonless nights, in a calm, when sighting through a window or on land surrounded by trees or buildings. There are two common designs of artificial horizon. An artificial horizon can consist simply of a pool of water shielded from the wind, allowing the user to measure the distance between the body and its reflection, and divide by two. Another design allows the mounting of a fluid-filled tube with bubble directly to the sextant.

Most sextants also have filters for use when viewing the Sun and reducing the effects of haze. The filters usually consist of a series of progressively darker glasses that can be used singly or in combination to reduce haze and the Sun&#x27;s brightness. However, sextants with adjustable polarizing filters have also been manufactured, where the degree of darkness is adjusted by twisting the frame of the filter.

Most sextants mount a 1 or 3-power monocular for viewing. Many users prefer a simple sighting tube, which has a wider, brighter field of view and is easier to use at night. Some navigators mount a light-amplifying monocular to help see the horizon on moonless nights. Others prefer to use a lit artificial horizon.

Professional sextants use a click-stop degree measure and a worm adjustment that reads to a minute, 1/60 of a degree. Most sextants also include a vernier on the worm dial that reads to 0.1 minute. Since 1 minute of error is about a nautical mile, the best possible accuracy of celestial navigation is about . At sea, results within several nautical miles, well within visual range, are acceptable. A highly skilled and experienced navigator can determine position to an accuracy of about .

A change in temperature can warp the arc, creating inaccuracies. Many navigators purchase weatherproof cases so that their sextant can be placed outside the cabin to come to equilibrium with outside temperatures. The standard frame designs (see illustration) are supposed to equalise differential angular error from temperature changes. The handle is separated from the arc and frame so that body heat does not warp the frame. Sextants for tropical use are often painted white to reflect sunlight and remain relatively cool. High-precision sextants have an invar (a special low-expansion steel) frame and arc. Some scientific sextants have been constructed of quartz or ceramics with even lower expansions. Many commercial sextants use low-expansion brass or aluminium. Brass is lower-expansion than aluminium, but aluminium sextants are lighter and less tiring to use. Some say they are more accurate because one&#x27;s hand trembles less. Solid brass frame sextants are less susceptible to wobbling in high winds or when the vessel is working in heavy seas, but as noted are substantially heavier. Sextants with aluminum frames and brass arcs have also been manufactured. Essentially, a sextant is intensely personal to each navigator, and they will choose whichever model has the features which suit them best.

Aircraft sextants are now out of production, but had special features. Most had artificial horizons to permit taking a sight through a flush overhead window. Some also had mechanical averagers to make hundreds of measurements per sight for compensation of random accelerations in the artificial horizon&#x27;s fluid. Older aircraft sextants had two visual paths, one standard and the other designed for use in open-cockpit aircraft that let one view from directly over the sextant in one&#x27;s lap. More modern aircraft sextants were periscopic with only a small projection above the fuselage. With these, the navigator pre-computed their sight and then noted the difference in observed versus predicted height of the body to determine their position.

==Taking a sight==
A &quot;sight&quot; (or &quot;measure&quot;) of the angle between the Sun, a star, or a planet, and the horizon is done with the &#x27;star telescope&#x27; fitted to the sextant using a visible horizon. On a vessel at sea even on misty days a sight may be done from a low height above the water to give a more definite, better horizon. Navigators hold the sextant by its handle in the right hand, avoiding touching the arc with the fingers.

For a Sun sight, a filter is used to overcome the glare such as &quot;shades&quot; covering both index mirror and the horizon mirror designed to prevent eye damage. Initially, with the index bar set to zero and the shades covering both mirrors, the sextant is aimed at the sun until it can be viewed on both mirrors through the telescope, then lowered vertically until the portion of the horizon directly below it is viewed on both mirrors. It is necessary to flip back the horizon mirror shade to be able to see the horizon more clearly on it. Releasing the index bar (either by releasing a clamping screw, or on modern instruments, using the quick-release button), and moving it towards higher values of the scale, eventually the image of the Sun will reappear on the index mirror and can be aligned to about the level of the horizon on the horizon mirror. Then the fine adjustment screw on the end of the index bar is turned until the bottom curve (the &quot;lower limb&quot;) of the Sun just touches the horizon. &quot;Swinging&quot; the sextant about the axis of the telescope ensures that the reading is being taken with the instrument held vertically. The angle of the sight is then read from the scale on the arc, making use of the micrometer or vernier scale provided. The exact time of the sight must also be noted simultaneously, and the height of the eye above sea-level recorded.

An alternative method is to estimate the current altitude (angle) of the Sun from navigation tables, then set the index bar to that angle on the arc, apply suitable shades only to the index mirror, and point the instrument directly at the horizon, sweeping it from side to side until a flash of the Sun&#x27;s rays are seen in the telescope. Fine adjustments are then made as above. This method is less likely to be successful for sighting stars and planets.

Star and planet sights are normally taken during nautical twilight at dawn or dusk, while both the heavenly bodies and the sea horizon are visible. There is no need to use shades or to distinguish the lower limb as the body appears as a mere point in the telescope. The Moon can be sighted, but it appears to move very fast, appears to have different sizes at different times, and sometimes only the lower or upper limb can be distinguished due to its phase.

After a sight is taken, it is reduced to a position by looking at several mathematical procedures. The simplest sight reduction is to draw the equal-altitude circle of the sighted celestial object on a globe. The intersection of that circle with a dead-reckoning track, or another sighting, gives a more precise location.

Sextants can be used very accurately to measure other visible angles, for example between one heavenly body and another and between landmarks ashore. Used horizontally, a sextant can measure the apparent angle between two landmarks such as a lighthouse and a church spire, which can then be used to find the distance &quot;off&quot; or out to sea (provided the distance between the two landmarks is known). Used vertically, a measurement of the angle between the lantern of a lighthouse of known height and the sea level at its base can also be used for distance off.

==Adjustment==
Due to the sensitivity of the instrument it is easy to knock the mirrors out of adjustment. For this reason a sextant should be checked frequently for errors and adjusted accordingly.

There are four errors that can be adjusted by the navigator, and they should be removed in the following order.

;Perpendicularity error:This is when the index mirror is not perpendicular to the frame of the sextant. To test for this, place the index arm at about 60° on the arc and hold the sextant horizontally with the arc away from you at arm&#x27;s length and look into the index mirror. The arc of the sextant should appear to continue unbroken into the mirror. If there is an error, then the two views will appear to be broken. Adjust the mirror until the reflection and direct view of the arc appear to be continuous.
;Side error:This occurs when the horizon glass/mirror is not perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. To test for this, first zero the index arm then observe a star through the sextant. Then rotate the tangent screw back and forth so that the reflected image passes alternately above and below the direct view. If in changing from one position to another, the reflected image passes directly over the unreflected image, no side error exists. If it passes to one side, side error exists. Alternatively, the user can hold the sextant on its side and observe the horizon to check the sextant during the day. If there are two horizons there is side error. In both cases, adjust the horizon glass/mirror until respectively the star or the horizon dual images merge into one. Side error is generally inconsequential for observations and can be ignored or reduced to a level that is merely inconvenient.
;Collimation error:This is when the telescope or monocular is not parallel to the plane of the sextant. To check for this you need to observe two stars 90° or more apart. Bring the two stars into coincidence either to the left or the right of the field of view. Move the sextant slightly so that the stars move to the other side of the field of view. If they separate there is collimation error. As modern sextants rarely use adjustable telescopes, they do not need to be corrected for collimation error.
;Index error:This occurs when the index and horizon mirrors are not parallel to each other when the index arm is set to zero. To test for index error, zero the index arm and observe the horizon. If the reflected and direct image of the horizon are in line there is no index error. If one is above the other adjust the index mirror until the two horizons merge. Alternatively, the same procedure can be done at night using a star or the Moon instead of the horizon.

<text>The single transferable vote (STV) or proportional-ranked choice voting (P-RCV) is a multi-winner electoral system in which each voter casts a single vote in the form of a ranked ballot. Voters have the option to rank candidates, and their vote may be transferred according to alternative preferences if their preferred candidate is eliminated or elected with surplus votes, so that their vote is used to elect someone they prefer over others in the running. STV aims to approach proportional representation based on votes cast in the district where it is used, so that each vote is worth about the same as another.

STV is a family of proportional multi-winner electoral systems whose results are equivalent to those produced by proportional representation election systems based on lists. STV systems can be thought of as a variation on the largest remainders method that uses candidate-based solid coalitions, rather than party lists. Surplus votes belonging to winning candidates (those in excess of an electoral quota) may be thought of as remainder votes. As a remainder under the largest remainder system, they are used to possibly obtain another seat for the party. As a remainder under STV, they are transferred to a voter&#x27;s subsequent preferences if necessary, and thus a vote may be transferred across party lines, to a candidate on a different party slate, if that is how the voter marked their preferences.

Under STV, no one party or voting bloc can take all the seats in a district unless the number of seats in the district is very small or almost all the votes cast are cast for one party&#x27;s candidates (which is seldom the case). This makes it different from other commonly used candidate-based systems. In winner-take-all or plurality systemssuch as first-past-the-post (FPTP), instant-runoff voting (IRV), and block votingone party or voting bloc can take all seats in a district.

The key to STV&#x27;s approximation of proportionality is that each voter effectively only casts a single vote in a district contest electing multiple winners, while the ranked ballots (and sufficiently large districts) allow the results to achieve a high degree of proportionality with respect to partisan affiliation within the district, as well as representation by gender and other descriptive characteristics. The use of a quota means that, for the most part, each successful candidate is elected with the same number of votes. This equality produces fairness in the particular sense that a party taking twice as many votes as another party will generally take twice the number of seats compared to that other party.

Under STV, winners are elected in a multi-member constituency (district) or at-large, also in a multiple-winner contest. Every sizeable group within the district wins at least one seat: the more seats the district has, the smaller the size of the group needed to elect a member. In this way, STV provides approximately proportional representation overall, ensuring that substantial minority factions have some representation.

There are several STV variants. Two common distinguishing characteristics are whether or not ticket voting is allowed and the manner in which surplus votes are transferred. In Australia, lower house elections do not allow ticket voting; some but not all state upper house systems do allow ticket voting. In Ireland and Malta, surplus votes are transferred as whole votes (there may be some randomness) and neither allows ticket voting. In Hare–Clark, used in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, there is no ticket voting and surplus votes are fractionally transferred based on the last parcel of votes received by winners in accordance with the Gregory method. Systems that use the Gregory method for surplus vote transfers are strictly non-random. Other distinguishing features include District Magnitude (number of members in the district) (with all districts having the same DM or varying DM), how to fill casual vacancies (by-elections or other), and the number of preferences that the voter must mark (optional-preferential voting or other).

== Process ==

In a single transferable vote (STV) system, the voter ranks candidates in order of preference on their ballot. A vote is initially allocated to the voter&#x27;s first preference.

A quota (the minimum number of votes that guarantees election) is calculated by a specified method (STV generally uses the Hare or Droop quota), and candidates who accumulate that many votes are declared elected. In many STV systems, the quota is also used to determine surplus votes, the number of votes received by successful candidates over and above the quota. Surplus votes are transferred to candidates ranked lower in the voters&#x27; preferences, if possible, so they are not wasted by remaining with a candidate who does not need them.

If seats remain open after the first count, any surplus votes are transferred. This may generate the necessary winners. As well, least popular candidates may be eliminated as a way to generate winners. 

The specific method of transferring votes varies in different systems (see ). Transfer of any existing surplus votes is done before eliminations of candidates. This prevents a party from losing a candidate in the early stage who might be elected later through transfers. When surplus votes are transferred under some systems, some or all of the votes held by the winner are apportioned fractionally to the next marked preference on the ballot. In others, the transfers to the next available marked preference is done using whole votes.

When seats still remain to be filled and there are no surplus votes to transfer (none of the remaining candidates&#x27; votes have surplus votes needing to be transferred), the least popular candidate is eliminated. The eliminated candidate&#x27;s votes are transferred to the next-preferred candidate rather than being discarded; if the next-preferred choice has already been eliminated or elected, the procedure is iterated to lower-ranked candidates.

Counting, eliminations, and vote transfers continue until enough candidates are declared elected (all seats are filled by candidates reaching the quota) or until there are only as many remaining candidates as there are unfilled seats, at which point the remaining candidates are declared elected.

=== Example for a non-partisan election ===
Suppose an election is conducted to determine what three foods to serve at a party. There are seven choices: Oranges, Pears, Strawberries, Cake (of the strawberry/chocolate variety), Chocolate, Hamburgers and Chicken. Only three of these may be served to the 23 guests. STV is chosen to make the decision, with the whole-vote method used to transfer surplus votes. The hope is that each guest will be served at least one food that they are happy with.

To select the three foods, each guest is given one votethey each mark their first preference and are also allowed to cast two back-up preferences to be used only if their first-preference food cannot be selected or to direct a transfer if the first-preference food is chosen with a surplus of votes. The 23 guests at the party mark their ballots: some mark first, second and third preferences; some mark only two preferences.

When the ballots are counted, it is found that the ballots are marked in seven distinct combinations, as shown in the table below:
The table is read as columns: the left-most column shows that there were three ballots with Orange as the first choice and Pear as second, while the right-most column shows there were three ballots with Chicken as first choice, Chocolate as second, and Hamburger as third.

The election step-by-step:


Setting the quota: The Droop quota formula is used to produce the quota (the number of votes required to be automatically declared elected) = floor(valid votes / (seats to fill + 1)) + 1 = floor(23 / (3 + 1)) + 1 = floor(5.75) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6

Step 1: First-preference votes are counted. Pears reaches the quota with 8 votes and is therefore elected on the first count, with 2 surplus votes. 

Step 2: All of the voters who gave first preference to Pears preferred Strawberry next, so the surplus votes are awarded to Strawberry.

No other option has reached the quota, and there are still two to elect with six options in the race, so elimination of lower-scoring options starts.

Step 3: Chocolate has the fewest votes and is eliminated. According to their only voter&#x27;s next preference, this vote is transferred to Cake. No option has reached the quota, and there are still two to elect with five in the race, so elimination of options will continue next round.

Step 4: Of the remaining options, Oranges, Strawberry and Chicken now are tied for the fewest votes. Strawberry had the fewest first preference votes so is eliminated. In accordance with the next preference marked on the vote cast by the voter who voted Strawberry as first preference, that vote is transferred to Oranges. In accordance with the next preference marked on the two votes cast by the Pear–Strawberry–Cake voters (which had been transferred to Strawberry in step 2), the two votes are transferred to Cake. (The Cake preference had been &quot;piggy-backed&quot; along with the transfer to Strawberry.) Cake reaches the quota and is elected.

Cake has no surplus votes, no other option has reached the quota, and there is still one choice to select with three in the race, so the vote count proceeds, with the elimination of the least popular candidate.

Step 5: Chicken has the fewest votes and is eliminated. The Chicken voters&#x27; next preference is Chocolate but Chocolate has already been eliminated. The next usable preference is Hamburgers, so the three votes are transferred to Hamburgers.

Hamburgers is elected with 7 votes in total. Hamburgers now has a surplus vote, but this does not matter since the election is over. There are no more foods needing to be chosenthree have been chosen.

Result: The winners are Pears, Cake, and Hamburgers.

Orange ends up being neither elected nor eliminated.

STV in this case produced a large number of effective votes19 votes were used to elect the successful candidates. (Only the votes for Oranges at the end were not used to select a food. The Orange voters have satisfaction of seeing their second choice – Pears – selected, even if their votes were not used to select any food.)

As well, there was general satisfaction with the choices selected. Nineteen voters saw either their first or second choice elected, although four of them did not actually have their vote used to achieve the result. Four saw their third choice elected. Fifteen voters saw their first preference chosen; eight of these 15 saw their first and third choices selected. Four others saw their second preference chosen, with one of them having their second and third choice selected.

Note that if Hamburger had received only one vote when Chicken was eliminated, it still would have won because the only other remaining candidate, Oranges, had fewer votes so would have been declared defeated in the next round. This would have left Hamburger as the last remaining candidate to fill the last open seat, even if it did not have quota.

As in many STV elections most of the candidates in winning position in the first round went on to be elected in the end. The leading front runners were Pears and Hamburgers, both of whom were elected. There was a three-way tie for third between Cake, Chicken and Oranges, Cake coming out on top in the end. Transfers seldom affect the election of more than one or two of the initial front runners and sometimes none at all.

==== Compared to other systems ====
This result differs from the one that would have occurred if the voting system used had been non-PR, such as single non-transferable vote (SNTV), first-past-the-post (FPTP) in three districts, first-past-the-post at-large group ticket voting as used to elect members of the US electoral college, or a single-winner winner-take-all system in three districts.

Single non-transferable vote would have seen a three-way tie for third place with Oranges, Cake and Chicken tied. The tie would have been resolved by the flip of a coin or the choice of an election official. Possibly Oranges or Chicken would have been determined to be the winner among the three, even though Cake was seen in the vote count process to have more general support. Under SNTV, 15 voters would have seen their first preference winOranges (or Chicken or Cake), Pears and Hamburgers. Eight voters would have not seen their first-preference food served. The pro-Oranges voter, if Oranges was not chosen, may have been consoled by their second choice, Pears, being served, but the others would not be served any of the foods they like, except maybe the voter who likes Strawberry and the one who likes Chocolate whose third choice, Hamburgers, was a winner. At least three voters would not be served any of their favorites.

Under first-past-the-post, the guests would have been split into three groups with one food chosen by each group based on just the most popular food in each group. The result in this case would have been dependent on how the groups are formed (gerrymandering of the groups to bias the election toward a particular result could occur). It might have been Strawberry cake, Pears and Hamburgers, but also the foods chosen might have been Pears in two groups (districts) and Hamburgers in the other. Or even just Pears alone might have won in each of the three &quot;districts&quot;, in which case only 8 guests out of 23 would have seen their first choice served, a very unrepresentative outcome, given that three different foods could have been served.

Using FPTP, it could happen that under any three-district single-winner system, none of the groups elect Pears, if the 7 votes for it are split and in each &quot;district&quot; there is another food that beats it (e.g. Oranges, Hamburgers and Chicken).

Similar problems arise to a lesser degree if all districts use a majority system instead of plurality (for instance, two-round or instant-runoff voting) as at least in all districts the majority would have been quite happy, but that still leaves the minority unrepresented.

If the voters had been able to choose only one food to serve such as in the ticket voting system used in the US electoral college (first-past-the-post but without &quot;districts&quot;), it is likely that Pears, the choice of less than a third of the 23 party-goers, would have won, meaning Pears would be the only food served at the party. 

Even if they held two rounds of voting (as in the two-round system), the bare majority that prefers some other kind of fruit (Oranges, Pears, Strawberries) would have dominated all other choices.

Giving electors a transferable vote is very different from simply having more seats to fill and giving each voter more votes to cast. Plurality block voting is such a system. Under it, each voter is given as many votes as there can be winners. This system can produce very unrepresentative results. In the example above, if every voter voted for three options, the small majority of voters who chose a fruit could easily force all three outcomes to be fruit of some kind: an outcome that is unlikely to be more representative than simply choosing only one winner. In an extreme example, where no faction can command an absolute majority, the largest of the minority groups can force a one-outcome result by running clone candidates. For example, the seven supporters of Pears could arrange in advance to have three types of Pears included on the ballot, then vote for all three, and if no other option reaches more than 7 votes, all three foods served would be a type of Pear. The only way this could be avoided would be for those who do not want Pears to vote tactically, by not voting for their preferred option but instead voting for whatever they consider to be the least bad outcome that is still likely to gain the required number of votes.

=== Example for an election with parties ===
Elections with parties are conducted in very similar manner to the non-partisan STV election presented above. Parties actually play no role in STV elections – each voter marks preferences for individual candidates and the voter&#x27;s secondary preferences may be of a different party.

This example shows election of five members in a district. Party A runs five candidates, Party B runs three, and there is one independent in the race. The election is conducted under STV with the Hare quota, which for five seats is 20% (100% divided by five).

==== First round ====

In the first round, the vote tally of the most popular candidate of Party A, Candidate A3, is more than quota, so they win a seat.

==== Second, third and fourth rounds ====
Surplus votes are distributed; the voters of Candidate A3 have marked their second preference for another politician of the same party, Candidate A4, so A4 now receives Candidate A3&#x27;s surplus votes. This transfer of 5 percent of the votes leaves A3 with the quota (20 percent) and A4 with 13 percent.

In the third and fourth rounds, the least popular candidates are eliminated (Candidates A1 and A5) and their votes transferred to their next preferences. Voters of Candidate A5 are not very partisan, preferring the independent candidate over the other candidates of Party A.

==== Fifth and sixth rounds ====
In the fifth round, Candidate A2 is eliminated with all their votes going to the candidate A4, the last remaining candidate from Party A, who is elected. The surplus votes of Candidate A4 are transferred. All the voters who helped elect Candidate A4 prefer the independent candidate to the candidates of the other party so their 3% surplus votes will go to Candidate I in the sixth round.
==== Seventh round ====
There are now only four candidates remaining and three seats remaining open. The least popular candidate (Candidate B1) is declared defeated. The remaining three are declared elected regardless of whether they reached the quota.

If there is no reason to establish relative popularity of the elected members, the count ends there when the last seats are declared filled. If the ranking of the candidates is important, the votes belonging to the eliminated Candidate B1 might be transferred as per below, assuming voters&#x27; alternate preferences are marked that way.
Under STV, candidates A3, A4, I, B2 and B3 were elected.

This vote count varies from the reality of many STV systems because there were no &quot;exhausted&quot; non-transferable votes. In most real-life STV elections, some votes that are set to be transferred cannot be and the number of votes still in play at the end is lower than the number of votes cast and counted in the 1st round. As well, the Droop quota is usually used in real-life STV elections. With the Droop quota in effect and five seats, it would have taken 17 percent to be elected with quota, not 20 percent as under the Hare quota. However, if B2&#x27;s surplus votes under the Droop quota are transferred to any non–Party A candidate, the same five candidates are elected each time, albeit in a slightly different order.

In the first round, 74 percent of votes were cast for candidates who were successful in the end. In this case, as in all STV elections, about 80 percent or more of the votes were used to actually elect someone. Only the 11 percent of votes cast in the end for B1 were not used to elect someone. The members elected in the district represent the sentiments of a large majority of the voters. Due to the diversity of members elected, each voter has someone elected who shares the party label that they voted for in the first place, even if not the individual candidate they preferred, or has seen the election of the independent candidate that they prefer.

==== Compared to other systems ====
This result differs from the one that would have occurred if the voting system used had been non-PR, such as single non-transferable vote (SNTV), first-past-the-post (FPTP) in five districts, first-past-the-post at-large general ticket voting (as used to elect members of the US electoral college), or a single-winner winner-take-all system in five districts

This result is different from if all voters could only vote for their first preference but still all seats were filled in a single contest, which is called the single non-transferable vote. Under SNTV, the five candidates most popular when only first preferences are considered were candidates A2, A3, B1, B2 and B3. This means even though Party B&#x27;s candidates had less support together, they would have received 60% of seats, and Party A only 40%. In this case, Party A overextended themselves by fielding too many candidates, but even if they had strategically nominated only three, they would not necessarily have been successful in gaining three seats instead of two seats, because one or two of their candidates might have taken the lion share of their party votes, leaving not enough votes for the other(s) to be elected. This could be addressed under SNTV if the party voters used coordinated strategic voting.

If voters could vote for five candidates (but not cast ranked votes)) as under the plurality block voting system, a type of multiple non-transferable vote, Party A could have won all seats, leaving Party B and voters of the independent candidate without representation. This is because if all those who voted for A3 marked their votes for all five of the Party A candidates, every Party A candidate would be among the five candidates with the most votes and would be declared elected. That would mean that a voting block of only 25 percent of the electorate would have all the representation.

Under majority block voting, if voters voted along party lines, every Party A candidate would receive a vote from 48 percent of the voters, and some even up to 55% if voters of Candidate I also vote for some Party A candidates with their 4 other votes. At the same time, Party B&#x27;s candidates could only get up to 52% of the votes with the same tactics. If the voters are partisan enough, the likely outcome is that party A would take all the seats although Party A took less than half the votes (minority representation) and all other votes are wasted.

In single-winner First past the post, the outcome is uncertain. It likely would be that Party A, with 48 percent of the votes, would achieve a clean sweep of all five seats or that Party A might easily take four of the five seats, with Party B taking just one. (The first case would be achieved by Party B votes being cracked by the district boundaries; the second case would be achieved by Party B voters being mostly packed into just one district, leaving Party A with easy victories in the other four districts.) On the other hand, if districts were drawn in a different fashion, Party A and Party B might divide the seats in a three-to-two ratio. Even under certain circumstances, the independent candidate might take a seat if their supporters are sufficiently concentrated in one district.

STV election results are roughly proportional (as much as the number of seats allows) and take into account more than the first preferences of voters. However, it could happen that the independent candidate is eliminated in an early round and so is unable to receive transfers from party voters. If that happens, the supporters of the independent candidate might aid one or another of the main parties. The five seats would be divided among the two main parties, in a more or less fair fashion.

However, under STV (as seen in the example above), the final result may be modulated by cross-party transfers, say from a party A or B candidate to a candidate of the other party or to the independent candidate. When secondary preferences are applied, some voters who gave their first preference to a candidate from a certain party, if that person cannot be elected, might prefer an independent (or even a rival party candidate) before other candidates of their first choice&#x27;s party. This means that even if it seems that the outcome over-represents or under-represents some faction (based on first preferences), the outcome actually closely adheres to a combination of the first preferences of many voters and secondary preferences of most of the other voters. Under STV, about 80 percent of voters see their vote used to elect someone they prefer (and even more than that portion see someone they prefer elected, even if their vote itself was not used to elect anyone), while under FPTP, often less than half of the votes are used to elect anyone and only the largest group in each district is represented.

==Related voting systems==
Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is the single-winner analogue of STV. It is also called &quot;single-winner ranked-choice voting&quot; (and &quot;preferential voting&quot;). Its goal is representation of a majority of the voters in a district by a single official, as opposed to STV&#x27;s goals of not only the representation of a majority of voters through the election of multiple officials but also of proportional representation of all the substantial voting blocks in the district.

Single non-transferable vote (SNTV) produces much the same representation as STV, without the work and complication of preferential ballots and vote transfers. Single voting in a multiple-member district produces mixed roughly proportional representation, which STV&#x27;s vote transfers sometimes does not alter. (An example was the election of Edmonton, Alberta, MLAs through STV in 1930. The winners were the same under STV as would have been elected under SNTV.)

The spare vote is a version of single transferable voting applied to the ranking of parties, first proposed for elections in Germany in 2013. The spare vote system includes the step of transferring the votes of eliminated choices to the next-indicated choice, but it does not transfer surplus votes.

The mixed ballot transferable vote (MBTV) is a mixed version of STV, where voters may rank both candidates and parties, even both interchangeably, depending on the ballot type, but must choose at least a local (district) candidate (1st preference) and a national list (2nd preference). The list preferences are used if the vote is unused in the district election, which may use FPTP, IRV or STV rules; in the STV case, the vote is transferred to another tier in favour of the chosen party list. (This is in contrast to the mixed single vote, which is currently used in Hungary, where voters may not define a separate party-list preference and do not cast preferential votes.)

Indirect single transferable voting is a non-ranked-vote version of STV. Single voting in a multi-seat district is retained. Voters do not mark their ballots with rankings, but votes are transferred, as needed, based on the eliminated or elected candidate&#x27;s pre-set instructions. This is a useful system to achieve many of the benefits of STV in districts where it is difficult to collect all the ballots in one central place to conduct STV transfers or where X voting is preferred over ranked voting due to voters&#x27; inability or disinterest in ranking candidates. Once known as the Gove system, or the schedule system of PR, it was invented by Massachusetts legislator William H. Gove of Salem and Archibald E. Dobbs of Ireland, author of &quot;Representative Reform for Ireland&quot; (1879). In 1884, Charles L. Dodgson (Lewis Caroll) argued for a proportional representation system based on multi-member districts similar to indirect STV, with each voter casting only a single vote, quotas as minimum requirements to take seats, and votes transferable by candidates through what is now called liquid democracy. The difference from &quot;indirect STV&quot; is that under liquid democracy, candidates, elected members and sometimes voters may transfer votes after the votes are cast to build coalitions; candidates do not have to publish their list beforehand.

The modified d&#x27;Hondt electoral system is a variant of STV, where an electoral threshold for parties is applied.

Two-vote MMP and additional member system systems may also be interpreted as a related, effectively preferential mixed system. Votes are not transferred, but a voter may vote differently for the local election and the overall party vote, with one, both or neither of those votes electing someone.

There are also several proportional multiwinner approval voting rules behaving similarly to STV, for instance the method of equal shares, which also sequentially selects candidates and reweights the voters approving these selected candidates.

==Balloting==
In STV, each voter casts just one vote although multiple seats are to be filled in the district. Voters mark first preference and can provide alternate preferences, to be used if needed.

Alternate (secondary) preferences may be required or strictly optional depending on the system used. Some systems declare a ballot spoiled if it is not marked with at least a set number or minimum number of preferences. Rules vary. Sometimes a voter is allowed to mark just their first preference (plump) and not mark any more. In Australian Capital Territory elections, voters are told they must mark at least five preferences if the ballot is to be counted. Even where second and subsequent preferences are marked, in some cases they may not be consulted at all, such as if the first preference candidate is elected at the end of the count to fill the last seat.

Under full-preferential voting, a voter must rank all candidates. Under &quot;optional preferential voting,&quot; a voter can mark as many preferences as they desire. Under semi-optional preferential voting, the voter is required to rank some number of candidates greater than one but less than the total number of candidates in the running. A vote not fully marked as per requirement under full-preferential voting or semi-optional preferential voting may be declared rejected altogether or declared rejected when, in the course of the vote count process, the vote&#x27;s insufficiency has an effect on the count. Under some full-preferential voting systems, it is impossible to have many votes declared exhausted and thus, in systems that use the Droop quota and sometimes under systems that use the Hare, all, or almost all, winners will receive quota. But where there are many exhausted votes, as happens often under optional or semi-optional preferential voting systems, it is possible to have three winners in a district elected with partial quota, even if the Droop quota is used.

In practice, the candidates&#x27; names are usually organized in columns so that voters are informed of the candidates&#x27; party affiliations or whether they are standing as independents. Voters indicate their preferences by ranking the candidates in order of preference. They usually use numbers (1, 2, 3 etc.) to show this, with 1 representing the voter&#x27;s first preference.

An alternative way to mark preferences for candidates is to use columns for the voters&#x27; preference with the name of each candidate appearing in each column. A marking in the first column indicates the most preferred candidate. A marking in the second column indicates the second-preference candidate, etc.

Some balloting systems allow ticket voting, where a voter simply indicates preference for a party slate, sometimes even ranking party slates, instead of marking preferences for individual candidates.

==Seat filling by quota==

In most STV elections, a quota is established to ensure that all elected candidates are elected with approximately equal numbers of votes. In some STV varieties, votes are totalled, and a quota (the minimum number of votes that guarantees election) is derived. Those who are elected are the most popular, and attainment of quota is the benchmark of that popularity. Some say that the importance of quota is to set the number of votes that are surplus; that is, the number that should be transferred away from successful candidates.

A common formula sets quota as a fraction of the votes cast. A four-seat district using the Hare quota sets quota as one-fourth of the valid votes; a four-seat district using the Droop quota sets the quota as one more than one-fifth of the valid votes.

In some implementations, a &quot;uniform quota&quot; is simply set by lawany candidate receiving that set number of votes is declared elected, with surplus transferred away. Something like this system was used in New York City from 1937 to 1947, where seats were allocated to each borough based on voter turnout. Under such a system, the number of representatives elected varied from election to election depending on voter turnout. In the 1937 New York City Council election, 26 councillors were elected; in the 1939 New York City Council election, newspapers reported that it was expected that the number of councillors would drop to 17 due to lower voter turnout. Under NYC&#x27;s STV, total seats on council varied: 1937 New York City Council election 26 seats, 1939 New York City Council election 21 seats, 1941 26 seats, 1943 17 seats, and 1945 23 seats.

Once a quota is determined, candidates&#x27; vote tallies are consulted. If at any time a candidate achieves the quota, they are declared elected. Then if there are still unfilled seats, in some STV systems, any surplus votes (those over and above the quota) are transferred to other candidates in proportion to the next-highest preference marked on the ballots received by that candidate, if any.

Usually one or more candidates achieve quota in the first count. If there are still unfilled seats after the surplus is transferred, the count would proceed with the candidate with the fewest votes being eliminated. Their votes would be transferred to other candidates as determined by those voters&#x27; next preference, if any. Elections and eliminations, and vote transfers where applicable, continue until enough candidates are declared elected to fill the open seats or until there are only as many remaining candidates as there are unfilled seats, at which point the remaining candidates are declared elected. These last candidates may be elected without surpassing quota, but their survival until the end is taken as proof of their general acceptability by the voters.

===Election===

An STV election count starts with a count of each voter&#x27;s first choice, recording how many for each candidate, calculation of the total number of votes and the quota and then taking the following steps:

# A candidate who has reached or exceeded the quota is declared elected.
# If any such elected candidate has more votes than the quota, surplus votes are then transferred to other candidates proportionally based on their next-indicated choice on all the ballots that had been received by that candidate. There are several different ways to do this. (see ).
# If there are still seats to be filled after the surplus votes of all candidates elected in the first count have been transferred, if any new candidates have been elected, their surplus votes are transferred proportionally.
# If there are still seats to be filled after all surplus votes have been transferred, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are transferred to the next candidate marked on each ballot. Candidates already elected or eliminated cannot receive votes in most systems.
# This process repeats until either every seat has been filled by candidates surpassing quota or until there are only as many remaining candidates as there are remaining seats, at which point the remaining candidates are declared elected.

There are variations in conducting transfers (see ).

When the number of votes transferred from the losing candidate with the fewest votes is too small to change the ordering of remaining candidates, no transfer is made or more than one candidate is eliminated simultaneously. In most systems, once a candidate has been eliminated or elected, they do not receive any more votes.

===Vote transfers and quota===

STV systems primarily differ in how they transfer surplus votes and in the size of the quota. For this reason, it has been suggested that STV can be considered a family of voting systems rather than a single system.

If fair results are to be produced and the number of candidates is fixed, a quota must be set such that any candidate who receives that many votes is elected. The quota, if used, must be set at a level where no more candidates can reach quota than there are seats to be filled. It cannot be so small that more candidates can be elected than the number of open seats, but the smaller it is, the fairer the result. There are several ways to specify quotas.

The Droop quota is the one most commonly used. It is generally considered to be the absolute lowest number that elects the correct number of candidates to fill the available seats, at least based on the original number of votes cast.

The Droop quota is given by the floor function formula:

formula_1

The Droop quota is an extension of the majoritarian principle of successful candidate having to get at least 50% + 1 in single-winner elections. No one else can get as much. In a three-seat contest 25% plus 1 is the Droop quota because no more than three people can each have 25% of the vote + 1; using Droop means 10% of the vote + 1 is the quota in a nine-seat district because no more than nine people can each have 10% of the vote + 1, and so on.

Droop being relatively low means that the largest party, if it has the majority of votes, is likely to take the majority of the seats in a district. And as well, a small party may have a chance to take a seat.
The Hare quota was used in the original proposals by Thomas Hare. It is larger than the Droop and sometimes ensures greater representation to less-popular parties within a district. But also, being larger than Droop, Hare presents more of an obstacle to small parties that hope to take just one seat. Being smaller than Hare, the Droop quota may give a seat to a small party that does not have the votes to take a seat under Hare.

Surplus votes cast for a winning candidate are sometimes transferred to the voter&#x27;s next choice candidate, who is also preferred by the voter. (Any vote is only used once but may be allocated to different candidates along the way until it finds its final place.) Most first-count votes cast for a candidate who wins in the end are never transferred – just the surplus votes are transferred (unless all seats are already filled). Alternate preferences are only consulted if the candidate is unpopular or elected, and not always then. Votes lie where they are when the last seats filled so even under STV not all votes are used to elect someone.

There are variations in the conduct of transfers in different variations of STV, such as how to transfer surplus votes from winning candidates and whether to transfer votes to already-elected candidates.

It can happen that a vote is eligible to be transferred but cannot be because it bears no subsequent preference for any remaining candidate. In the case of transfers of surplus votes, an &quot;exhausted&quot; vote remains with the victorious candidates and only transferable votes (votes bearing a usable alternate preference) are used to determine the transfer of the surplus. If the number of transferable votes is less than the number of the surplus, no calculations are needed to make the transfer. Transfer of the transferable votes is done simply by reference to subsequent preference on the votes. Not all the surplus will be transferred if there are not enough transferable votes.

If the variation of STV used allows transfers to candidates already elected, when a candidate is eliminated and the next preference on the ballot shows preference for a candidate already elected, votes are transferred to already victorious candidate, forming a new surplus. The new surplus votes for the victorious candidate (transferred from the eliminated candidate) are then transferred to the next preference of the victorious candidate, as happened with their initial surplus, but just using the recently transferred votes as guide. Vote transfers from the victorious candidate to a candidate who has been eliminated are impossible, and reference must be made to the next marked preference, if any. See for details.

A different quota, one set lower than Droop, is sometimes workable. If fractional votes are used in an STV method, a quota smaller than the Droop quota may be used, where less than a whole number is added to votes/(seats plus 1).

The use of an even smaller quota is sometimes defended, although under such a quota, it is theoretically possible to have more candidates receive quota than the number of empty seats. Frank Britton, of the Election Ballot Services at the Electoral Reform Society, stated that the final &quot;plus one&quot; of the Droop quota is not needed; the quota he proposed was simply formula_2. The equivalent integer quota may be written:

formula_3

So, the quota for one seat is 50 of 100 votes, not 51.

In any case, in most STV elections the appearance of non-transferable votes means that the quota could be lowered significantly below Droop during the counting of the vote with no danger of having too many elected.

In STV, vote transfers are of two typestransfers of votes of eliminated candidates and transfers of surplus votes of elected candidates. The first type happens more often than the second type. Surplus votes are transferred only after a candidate is elected and then only if there are still open seats to be filled and if the transfers may affect the ranking of the remaining candidates.

===Transfers of votes of eliminated candidates===
Transfers of votes of eliminated candidates is done simply, without the use of complex math. The next usable preference on the vote gives the destination for the transfer of the vote. If there is no usable preference on the ballot, the vote goes to the &quot;exhausted&quot; or non-transferable pile.

===Transfers of surplus votes===
Various methods are used in STV systems to transfer surplus votes held by elected candidates. The transfer of surplus votes of an elected candidate may be very simply done or may be done more intricately, depending on the circumstances and the choice of the government or election officials.

It can happen that a vote is set to be transferred but cannot be because it bears no subsequent preference for any remaining candidate. In transfers of surplus votes, any non-transferable votes are left with the elected candidate.

If the number of transferable votes is less than the surplus, the transfer of surplus votes can be performed just as it is done in the case of transfer of votes of eliminated candidates, the only difference being that non-transferable votes remain with the elected candidate. They do not go to the exhausted pile. Transfer of the transferable votes is done in these cases simply by reference to the next usable preference on the vote.

In cases where the number of transferable votes is more than the surplus, a more-involved method may be used to make the transfer proportional and to ensure that the quota left with the successful candidate is proportional as well. But election officials here have a choice of using simpler methods or more involved methods.

Votes to the number of the surplus can be drawn at random from the candidate&#x27;s votes. Choosing the votes at random from the pile means that each transfer should be mixed and will likely closely resemble the composition of the entire pile. (This is the system used in Cambridge, Massachusetts, city elections.) 

In the STV systems used in the Republic of Ireland (except Senate elections) and Malta, the next preference is examined and then surplus votes are transferred as whole votes in proportion to the proportions of votes marked for each of the other candidates. This is called the &quot;exact method&quot;. Randomness may arise from the later preferences, if any, if they have to be used later. But if they do have to be used later, choosing the votes at random to compose each transfer means that the votes that make up each transfer should carry back-up preferences in approximately true proportion to the whole.

The basic formula for how to transfer surplus votes when there are more transferable votes than the surplus to be transferred is:

formula_4

This can produce fractional votes, which are handled differently under different counting methods.

Transferring votes without considering later preferences may influence later transfers and such systems are sometimes thought of as being random. Alternatively, some jurisdictions use systems that break down the elected candidate&#x27;s votes into many separate piles, separating the various combinations of marked preferences on the ballots, or do the same by transferring part of each vote at the transfer value rate. The vote is transferred in the form of the ballot paper, carrying its own back-up preferences with it for possible later use. This is the Gregory method.

The Gregory method (also known as Newland–Britain or Senatorial rules) eliminates randomness by examining all the preferences marked on the last parcel of ballots received by the elected candidate. The later preferences dictate how later transfers, if any, will go. Votes are transferred as fractions of votes. Gregory is in use in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland (Senate elections) and in some electoral systems used in Australia.

As well, there are variants named the inclusive Gregory method (IGM) and the weighted inclusive Gregory method (WIGM). WIGM is used in the Scottish local government elections. Unlike the ordinary Gregory method, these systems look at secondary preferences on all the votes held by the elected candidate, not just the votes that make up the last parcel of votes received.

Both Gregory and earlier methods have the problem that, in some circumstances, they do not treat all votes equally. For this reason, Meek&#x27;s method, Warren&#x27;s method and the Wright system were invented.

Meek, in 1969, was the first to realize that computers make it possible to count votes in a way that is conceptually simpler and closer to the original concept of STV. One advantage of Meek&#x27;s method is that the quota is adjusted at each stage of counting when the number of votes decreases because some become non-transferable. Meek also considered a variant of his system which allows for equal preferences to be expressed. This has subsequently (since 1998) been used by the John Muir Trust for electing its trustees.

== District magnitudes and proportionality ==
Formally, STV satisfies a fairness criterion known as proportionality for solid coalitions.

Historically, the district magnitude under STV elections has ranged from two (the absolute minimum) to 21 (currently being used in New South Wales, Australia to elect the Legislative Council, half at a time). In higher-level government elections district magnitude is usually in the 3 to 5 or 7 range, with NSW being an obvious exception. In local government elections such as city councils, STV elections are often held citywide with district magnitudes in the 6 to 13 range, or wards may be used, usually electing 2 to 5 members in each ward.

If the Droop quota is used, for example, in a nine-seat district, the quota is 10% (plus one vote); in a three-seat district, it is 25% (plus one vote). The quota acts in some ways as an electoral threshold and the Droop quota in a district is a significantly higher proportion of district votes than the usual electoral threshold in use for most party-list PR systems, but the Droop quota in a district covering just part of a jurisdiction may be set at as few votes as a smaller proportion of the votes cast across a whole jurisdiction.

District elections grow more proportionally representative in direct relation to the increase in the number of seats to be elected in a constituencythe more seats, the more the distribution of the seats in a district will be proportional. For example, in a three-seat STV election using the Hare quota of formula_5, a candidate or party with at least one-third of the votes is guaranteed to win a seat. In a seven-seat STV contest using the Hare quota, any candidate with one-seventh of the vote (either first preferences alone, or a combination of first preferences and lower-ranked preferences transferred from other candidates) will win a seat. Many systems use the Droop quota, which is even smaller than the Hare for the same number of seats, as it produces more proportional results.

Because of this quota-based fairness, under STV it is extremely rare for a party to take a majority of the seats in a district without the support of a majority of the district&#x27;s voters. Additionally, a large majority of voters (generally around 80 percent or more) see their vote used to elect someone. Thus under STV, the candidates who make up a majority of the district&#x27;s elected members are supported directly by a majority of the voters in the district.

== History ==


=== Origin ===

The concept of transferable voting was first proposed by Thomas Wright Hill in 1819. The system remained unused in public elections until 1855, when Carl Andræ proposed a transferable vote system for elections in Denmark, and his system was used in 1856 to elect the Rigsraad and from 1866 it was also adapted for indirect elections to the second chamber, the Landsting, until 1915.

Although he was not the first to propose transferable votes, the British barrister Thomas Hare is generally credited with the conception of STV, and he may have independently developed the idea in 1857. Hare&#x27;s view was that STV should be a means of &quot;making the exercise of the suffrage a step in the elevation of the individual character, whether it be found in the majority or the minority.&quot; In Hare&#x27;s original system, he further proposed that electors should have the opportunity of discovering which candidate their vote had ultimately counted for, to improve their personal connection with voting. At the time of Hare&#x27;s original proposal, the UK did not use the secret ballot, so not only could the voter determine the ultimate role of their vote in the election, the elected MPs would have been able to determine who had voted for them. As Hare envisaged that the whole House of Commons be elected &quot;at large&quot; this would have replaced geographical constituencies with what Hare called &quot;constituencies of interest&quot; – those people who had actually voted for each MP.

In the 1890s in Australia, Catherine Helen Spence amended Hare&#x27;s proposal by adding multi-member districts instead of at-large voting. Instead of a single member being said to represent a whole district of varied sentiment, as under first-past-the-post, under STV multiple members represent the range of sentiments of the district, each one representing a &quot;constituency of interest&quot; made up of only those who voted for the elected member.

In modern elections, held by secret ballot, a voter may discover how their vote was distributed by viewing detailed election results (or at least trace the routes along which their vote, or other votes identical to the one they cast, may have been transferred and see to whom it may have been used to elect). This is particularly easy to do using Meek&#x27;s method, where only the final weightings of each candidate need to be published. However, the elected member cannot verify who their supporters are.

The political essayist John Stuart Mill was a friend of Hare&#x27;s and an early proponent of STV, praising it at length in his essay &quot;Considerations on Representative Government&quot;, in which he writes: &quot;Of all modes in which a national representation can possibly be constituted, this one affords the best security for the intellectual qualifications desirable in the representatives. At present... the only persons who can get elected are those who possess local influence, or make their way by lavish expenditure...&quot; His contemporary, Walter Bagehot, also praised the Hare system for allowing everyone to elect an MP, even ideological minorities, but also argued that the Hare system would create more problems than it solved: &quot;[the Hare system] is inconsistent with the extrinsic independence as well as the inherent moderation of a Parliament – two of the conditions we have seen, are essential to the bare possibility of parliamentary government.&quot;

Advocacy of STV spread throughout the British Empire, leading it to be sometimes known as &quot;British Proportional Representation&quot;. In 1896, Andrew Inglis Clark was successful in persuading the Tasmanian House of Assembly to be the first parliament in the world to be at least partially elected by a form of STV, specifically the &quot;Hare-Clark electoral system&quot;, named after himself and Thomas Hare. H. G. Wells was a strong advocate, calling it &quot;Proportional Representation&quot;. The HG Wells formula for scientific voting, repeated, over many years, in his PR writings, to avoid misunderstanding, is Proportional Representation by the single transferable vote in large constituencies.

STV in large constituencies and multiple-member districts permits an approach to the Hare-Mill-Wells ideal of mirror representation. The UK National Health Service previously used the first-past-the-post system in local or regional elections, and only white male general practitioners were elected to the General Medical Council. In 1979, the UK National Health Service used STV to proportionally elect women and immigrant GPs, and specialists, to the General Medical Council.

=== Australia ===
Tasmania first used STV for election of members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1896 to 1902. In 1909, it began to be used on a permanent basis for House of Assembly elections and to elect all House of Assembly members. (Instant-runoff voting was used for elections to the Tasmania Legislative Council (its upper house), with some of the members elected through STV prior to 1946.)

In 1948, single transferable vote proportional representation on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing Senators to the Australian Senate. This change has led to the rise of a number of minor parties such as the Democratic Labor Party, Australian Democrats and Australian Greens who have taken advantage of this system to achieve parliamentary representation and the balance of power. From the 1984 election, group ticket voting was introduced to reduce a high rate of informal voting but in 2016, group tickets were abolished to avoid undue influence of preference deals amongst parties that were seen as distorting election results and a form of optional preferential voting was introduced.

Beginning in the 1970s, Australian states began to reform their upper houses to introduce proportional representation in line with the Federal Senate. The first was the South Australian Legislative Council in 1973, which initially used a party list system (replaced with STV in 1982), followed by the single transferable vote being introduced for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1978, the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1987 and the Victorian Legislative Council in 2003. The single transferable vote was also introduced for the elections to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly after a 1992 referendum.

The term &quot;STV&quot; in Australia refers to the Senate electoral system, a variant of &quot;Hare-Clark&quot; characterized by the &quot;above the line&quot; group voting ticket, a party list option. It is used in the Australian upper house, the Senate, most state upper houses, the Tasmanian lower house and the Capital Territory assembly. There is a compulsory number of preferences for a vote for candidates (below-the-line) to be valid: for the Senate a minimum of 90% of candidates must be scored, in 2013 in New South Wales that meant writing 99 preferences on the ballot. Therefore, 95% and more of voters use the above-the-line option, making the system, in all but name, a party list system. Parties determine the order in which candidates are elected and also control transfers to other lists and this has led to anomalies: preference deals between parties, and &quot;micro parties&quot; which rely entirely on these deals. Additionally, independent candidates are unelectable unless they form, or join, a group above-the-line. Concerning the development of STV in Australia researchers have observed: &quot;... we see real evidence of the extent to which Australian politicians, particularly at national levels, are prone to fiddle with the electoral system&quot;.

As a result of a parliamentary commission investigating the 2013 election, from 2016 the system has been considerably reformed, with group voting tickets (GVTs) abolished and voters no longer required to fill all boxes.

In 2023, the single transferable vote was also chosen as the electoral method in South Australia for the state&#x27;s First Nation&#x27;s Voice to Parliament as part of Schedule 1 of the Act.

=== Canada ===

STV was used to elect legislators in two Canadian provinces between 1920 and 1955. The cities of Edmonton and Calgary elected their MLAs through STV from 1924 to 1956, when the Alberta provincial government changed those elections to use the first-past-the-post system. The city of Winnipeg elected its MLAs through STV from 1920 to 1955, when the Manitoba provincial government changed those elections to use first-past-the-post.

Less well known is STV use at the municipal level in western Canada. Calgary and Winnipeg used STV for more than 50 years before city elections were changed to use the first-past-the-post system. Nineteen other municipalities, including the capital cities of the other three western provinces, also used STV For elections in about 100 elections during the 1918 to 1931 period.

In British Columbia, Canada, a type of STV called BC-STV was recommended for provincial elections by the British Columbia Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform in 2004. In a 2005 provincial referendum, it received 58 percent support and achieved a simple majority in 77 of 79 electoral districts. It was rejected for falling short of the 60 percent threshold that had been set by the BC Liberal provincial government. In a second referendum, on 12 May 2009, BC-STV was defeated 61 percent to 39 percent.

=== United States ===

In the United States, the Proportional Representation League was founded in 1893 to promote STV, and their efforts resulted in its adoption by many city councils in the first half of the 20th century. More than twenty cities have used STV, including Cleveland, Cincinnati and New York City. As of January 2010, it is used to elect the city council and school committee in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the park board in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the board of assessors in Arden, Delaware. STV has also been adopted for student government elections at several American universities, including Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Oberlin, Reed, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Vassar, UCLA, Whitman, and UT Austin. The Fair Representation Act, introduced in the US Congress in June 2017, would have established STV for US House elections starting in 2022.

==Use==

STV has seen its widest adoption in the English-speaking world. In the Commonwealth, two countries Malta and Australia use STV at the federal level. Australia also uses it at the state level, and some Australian cities use it as well. Ireland uses STV at local and national levels. Estonia and Denmark used a form of STV previously, for national elections. Nepal uses STV to elect some of each state&#x27;s electoral college, which in turn is used to elect members of the National Assembly.

More than 80 countries in the world use a form of party-list proportional representation for their national legislature. Few use STV.

===National legislatures===
The table below lists countries that use STV to fill a nationally elected legislative body by direct elections.

===Historic use of STV for election of legislative bodies===

== Benefits ==
Advocates for STV argue it is an improvement over winner-take-all non-proportional voting systems such as first-past-the-post, where vote splits commonly result in a majority of voters electing no one and the successful candidate having support from just a minority of the district voters. STV prevents in most cases one party taking all the seats and in its thinning out of the candidates in the field prevents the election of an extreme candidate or party if it does not have enough overall general appeal.

STV is the system of choice of the Proportional Representation Society of Australia (which calls it quota-preferential proportional representation), the Electoral Reform Society in the United Kingdom and FairVote in the United States (which refers to STV as proportional ranked choice voting and instant-runoff voting as &quot;ranked choice voting&quot;, although there are other preferential voting methods that use ranked-choice ballots).

==Issues==
===Degree of proportionality===
The degree of proportionality of STV election results depends directly on the district magnitude (i.e. the number of seats in each district). While Ireland originally had a median district magnitude of five (ranging from three to nine) in 1923, successive governments lowered this. Systematically lowering the number of representatives from a given district directly benefits larger parties at the expense of smaller ones.

Supposing that the Droop quota is used: in a nine-seat district, the Droop quota is 10% (plus one vote); in a three-seat district, it would be 25% (plus one vote). This electoral threshold seems significantly higher than for most party-list PR systems, based on percentage points. However, the Droop quota in a district covering just part of a jurisdiction may be set at as few votes as an list PR system&#x27;s electoral threshold set at a lower percentage but based on the votes cast across a whole jurisdiction. For instance, in the 2022 Danish election, the main electoral threshold of 2 percent in use meant 71,000 of the 3.5million votes cast overall were required to be eligible for leveling seats, while in the 10-seat North Zealand Folketing constituency, the Droop quota (set at 9 percent) would have been 26,500 (1/11th of 292,000 valid votes). In the North Zealand constituency in the 2022 election, held using list PR (where the theoretical threshold is ten percent of district votes), the Conservative People&#x27;s partywith just 22,000 voteswon one out of ten seats in the district. When levelling seats were allocated, the Independent Greenswith almost 32,000 votes overallwere not allocated any seats.

A parliamentary committee in 2010 discussed the &quot;increasing trend towards the creation of three-seat constituencies in Ireland&quot; and recommended not less than four-seaters, except where the geographic size of such a constituency would be disproportionately large.

STV provides proportionality by transferring votes to minimize waste, and therefore also minimizes the number of unrepresented or disenfranchised voters.

=== Difficulty of implementation ===
A frequent concern about STV is its complexity compared with single-mark voting methods, such as plurality voting or party-list proportional representation. Before the advent of computers, this complexity made ballot-counting more difficult than in other methods, though Winnipeg used it to elect ten MLAs in seven elections (1920–1945).

The algorithm is complicated, particularly if Gregory or another fractional-vote method is used. In large elections with many candidates, a computer may be required. (This is because after several rounds of counting, there may be many different categories of previously transferred votes, each with a different permutation of early preferences and thus each with a different carried-forward weighting, all of which have to be kept track of.)

===Role of political parties===
STV differs from other proportional representation systems in that candidates of one party can be elected on transfers from voters for other parties, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as vote &quot;leakage&quot;. Hence, STV may reduce the role of political parties in the electoral process and corresponding partisanship in the resulting government.

===By-elections===
As STV is a multi-member system, filling vacancies between elections can be problematic, and a variety of methods have been devised:
* The countback method is used in the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania, Victoria, Malta, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Casual vacancies can be filled by re-examining the ballot papers data from the previous election. Officials determine the next-ranked candidate for those voters who supported the official who seat was vacated.
* A head official or remaining members of the elected body appoint a new member to fulfill the vacancy. This may change the ideology of the seat.
* Hold a single-winner by-election (effectively instant-runoff voting); this allows each party to choose a new candidate and all voters to participate. This is the method used in the Republic of Ireland in national elections, and in Scotland&#x27;s local elections. This is likely to produce a winner from the majority, which would be non-proportional if the seat was vacated by someone from a minority faction.
* The party of the vacant member nominates a successor, possibly subject to the approval of the voting population or the rest of the government. This is the method used in the Republic of Ireland in local elections.
* Officeholders create an ordered list of successors before leaving their seats. In the European Parliament, a departing member from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland is replaced with the top eligible name from a replacement list submitted by the candidate at the time of the original election. This method was also used in the Northern Ireland Assembly, until 2009, when the practice was changed to allow political parties to nominate new MLAs in the event of vacancies. Independent MLAs may still draw up lists of potential replacements.
* Elect the candidate eliminated last, which may represent a smaller minority than any of the candidates successfully elected. Malta did this as a one-off for its 2009 European elections, to fill the prospective vacancy for the extra seat that arose from the Lisbon Treaty.

===Tactics===

If there are not enough candidates to represent one of the priorities the electorate vote for (such as a party), all of them may be elected in the early stages, with votes being transferred to candidates with other views. On the other hand, putting up too many candidates might result in first-preference votes being spread too thinly among them, and consequently several potential winners with broad second-preference appeal may be eliminated before others are elected and their second-preference votes distributed. In practice, the majority of voters express preference for candidates from the same party in order, which minimizes the impact of this potential effect of STV.

The outcome of voting under STV is proportional within a single election to the collective preference of voters, assuming voters have ranked their real preferences. Due to other voting mechanisms usually used in conjunction with STV, such as a district or constituency system, an election by STV does not guarantee proportionality across all districts. If proportionality is measured by looking at first preference votes, the final result may vary from that proportionality due to some votes being transferred from one party to another during the vote count procedure.

Accordingly, in many elections, each party has their vote spread over the party&#x27;s slate (if the party runs multiple candidates so that all the large parties&#x27; votes are spread somewhat equally), and candidates of popular parties are mostly all more popular than candidates of less-popular parties. This happened in Cavan-Monaghan in the 2020 Irish general election, where Labour, PBP, Green and Aontu parties were the least popular. Their candidates were four of the five least-popular candidates in the first count and were eliminated quickly. SF, FG and FF parties were more populartheir candidates took the five seatsand candidates of those parties were already leading in the first count.

A number of methods of tactical or strategic voting exist that can be used in STV elections but much less so than with first-past-the-post elections. In STV elections, most constituencies will be marginal, at least with regard to the allocation of a final seat. Manipulating STV requires knowledge of the contents of all the ballots, effectively only being possible after the ballots are counted; and discovering the correct votes to cast to manipulate the outcome strategically is NP-complete.

The difficulty of manipulating results under STV is credited with why it is chosen for use in part of the process of allocating the Academy Awards. As part of the process of selecting winners for the Academy Awards, STV is used to choose nominees within each category. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences claims that STV is preferred because &quot;[a]lthough there are always instances in which an election procedure can be manipulated, an advantage of STV procedures is that the computations are too complex to be manipulated by a voter attempting to rank competitors of its most preferred candidate at the bottom of its preference list.&quot;

STV satisfies the majority-rule principle in that the winners taken together are supported by a majority of the valid votes cast in the district. Variants like Schulze STV and CPO-STV also do.

===Elector confusion===
Critics contend that some voters find the mechanisms behind STV difficult to understand, but this does not make it more difficult for voters to rank the list of candidates in order of preference on an STV ballot paper (see ).

STV systems vary, both in ballot design and in whether or not voters are obliged to provide a full list of preferences.

In jurisdictions such as Malta, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, voters may rank as many or as few candidates as they wish. Consequently, voters sometimes, for example, rank only the candidates of a single party, or of their most preferred parties. Voters who do not fully understand the system may only vote for as many candidates as the instruction on the ballot gives before &quot;and so on&quot;, and may even &quot;bullet vote&quot;, only expressing a first preference, or indicate a first preference for multiple candidates, especially when both STV and plurality are being used in concurrent elections.

Allowing voters to rank only as many candidates as they wish grants them greater freedom, but can also lead to some voters ranking so few candidates that their vote eventually becomes exhausted – that is, at a certain point during the count, it can no longer be transferred and influence the result. Some are non-transferable because the choices marked have already been elected, so the voter may be pleased with the overall election result even though their first preference was not elected and their vote itself was not used to elect anyone. Even if a voter marks many preferences, the vote may still be found to be non-transferable, if at any point the vote needs to be transferred and all the preferences ranked lower have already been eliminated or elected. But the number of non-transferable votes is fewer than the number of ignored votes under first-past-the-post and the number of effective votes, votes actually used to elect someone, is higher than under all but the most landslide first-past-the-post election contests.

The STV method may be confusing to some and may cause some people to vote incorrectly with respect to their actual preferences.

STV ballots can also be long; having multiple pages increases the chances of people not marking multiple preferences and thus missing later opportunities to have their vote transferred. After a vote is transferred twice, is at the end of the count and three candidates remain in the running for the last seat, the voter may have little interest in the choice. None of them were the voter&#x27;s first choice, nor their second or third preference. And perhaps the voter has already seen one or two of their earlier choices already elected. Many votes up for transfer are found to be non-transferable in the last vote transfers. One to three members at the end are often elected with partial quotas, due to the number of exhausted votes. In STV elections, a majority of votes are used to elect the members who are elected.

===Other===
Some opponents argue that larger, multi-seat districts would require more campaign funds to reach the voters. Proponents argue that STV can lower campaign costs because like-minded candidates can share some expenses. Proponents reason that negative advertising is disincentivized in such a system, as its effect is diluted among a larger pool of candidates.

In addition, candidates do not have to secure the support of the largest voting block to be elected as under FPTP. STV ensures that each substantial group gets at least one seat, allowing candidates to focus campaign spending primarily on supportive voters. Under STV, it is not necessary to be the most popular candidate in the district to be elected; it is only necessary to have quota (or survive to the end when the remaining candidates are declared elected). To have quota, you do not need support from across the district necessarily. If a corner of the district has a quota worth of votes and the voters there support a candidate, that candidate will be elected and there is nothing the others elsewhere in the district can do about it. So, at least theoretically, you would not need to campaign across the district.

The larger, multi-member constituencies can result in less, rather than more, representation of local communities within the electoral district. The representatives could potentially all be from one part of the region, leaving other communities without representation.

Furthermore, STV requires multi-member districts (MMDs). It is thus impossible to use MMDs in the Scottish Highlands to elect member of the UK Parliament because only one member is elected in that area. To create an MMD in a sparsely-settled area, an electoral district would have to cover a large area just to capture the required population to be represented by multiple members. There can be a greater disconnect between the voter, or community, and their representatives. If areas with low population density were using multi-member districts to elect the relatively few high-level members of Parliament in Scotland or of the UK Parliament, constituencies could become so large as to seem to be impractical. However, Scotland successfully uses multiple-member regions in its Scottish Parliament elections and STV in its Local Authority elections. The large number of Local Authority or Scottish Parliament members allows the creation of MMDs without having each district cover too large an area. Meanwhile, MMDs even of immense size can be used successfully. In New South Wales, Australia, the whole state elects 21 members of the upper house in one single STV contest and has done so since 1991.

==Analysis of results==

===Migration of preferences===
The relative performance of political parties in STV systems is sometimes analysed in a different fashion from that used in other electoral schemes. For example, seeing which candidates are declared elected on first-preference votes alone in the 2012 Scottish local elections, where 1223 members were elected, can be shown as follows:

The data can also be analysed to find the proportion of voters who express only a single preference, or those who express a minimum number of preferences, to assess party strength. Where parties nominate multiple candidates in an electoral district, analysis can also be done to assess their relative strength.

Other useful information can be found by analysing terminal transfersi.e., when the votes of a candidate are transferred and no other candidate from that party remains in the countespecially with respect to the first instance in which that occurs:

The transfers of votes under STV mean that candidates who did well on first-preference votes in the first count (but not well enough to be immediately declared elected) may not be elected in the end, and those who did poorly on the first count may be elected in the end. This is due to transfers made according to second and later preferences. This can also be analysed, again using the 1223 members elected in the Scottish local elections. Some of the leading candidates in the first count were not elected but, comparing the number to the total number of members elected in these elections, the successful candidates were mostly set in the first count (through the simple mechanics of single voting in multi-member districts), before any vote transfers are done. Only about ten percent or less of the front runners in the first count were not elected in the end.

Only 68 of the elected members, of the overall 1,223 successful candidates, were not already in a winning position in the first count, thus showing that vote transfers merely put a polish on the first-count ranking of candidates established through single voting in multi-seat districts.

Thus, of 1223 seats filled in 2012, only 68 were filled by candidates who were not in top three or four spots in the first count. Therefore, transfers changed the outcome of only about 6 percent of the spots. Single non-transferable vote would have provided the same results in a great majority of cases.

===Effective votes===
In the 2020 Irish election where members of Dáil Éireann, known as TDs (Dáil deputies), were elected by single transferable vote from 39 constituencies, each with between three and five seats, members were elected under STV with about the same number of votes and a large proportion of votes cast in each district were used to actually elect someone.

Most elected members were elected by achieving the quota. Thus they were elected by receiving approximately the same number of votes. The few elected without quota received a number of votes close to quota as well. A large proportion of the votes were used to elect someone, with relatively few being wasted. Perhaps one full quota or less is not used to elect someone.

In Cambridge, Massachusetts, under STV in 2021, 90 percent of voters saw their vote help to elect a candidate, more than 65 percent of voters saw their first choice candidate elected, and more than 95 percent of voters saw at least one of their top three choices elected.
