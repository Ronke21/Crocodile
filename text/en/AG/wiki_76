<text>The United Methodist Church (UMC) is a worldwide mainline Protestant denomination based in the United States, and a major part of Methodism. In the 19th century, its main predecessor, the Methodist Episcopal Church, was a leader in evangelicalism. The present denomination was founded in 1968 in Dallas, Texas, by union of the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church. The UMC traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley in England, as well as the Great Awakening in the United States. As such, the church&#x27;s theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan. It embraces liturgical worship, holiness, and evangelical elements.

The United Methodist Church has a connectional polity, a typical feature of a number of Methodist denominations. It is organized into conferences. The highest level is called the General Conference and is the only organization which may speak officially for the UMC. The church is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and other religious associations.

As of 2022, the UMC had 5,424,175 members and 29,746 churches in the United States. As of 2022, it had 9,984,925 members and 39,460 churches worldwide. In 2015, the Pew Research Center estimated that 3.6 percent of the U.S. population, or nine million adult adherents, identified with the United Methodist Church, revealing a much larger number of adherents than registered members.

On January 3, 2020, a group of Methodist leaders proposed a plan to split the United Methodist Church over issues of sexual orientation (particularly same-sex marriage) and create a new traditionalist Methodist denomination; the Global Methodist Church was formed in 2022. Prior to the establishment of the Global Methodist Church, some Methodist congregations had already left the UMC to join the Free Methodist Church, a traditionalist Methodist denomination aligned with the Wesleyan-Holiness movement. Other former United Methodist congregations joined various conservative Methodist denominations, such as the Congregational Methodist Church, or became members of the Association of Independent Methodists. As of December 30, 2023, the number of UMC churches in the United States that were approved for disaffiliation stood at 7,660. This figure represented approximately one-quarter of the UMC churches in the United States. In May 2024, the United Methodist Church General Conference repealed bans on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriage.
==History==
===Church origins===

The movement which would become the United Methodist Church began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England. A small group of students, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield, met at Oxford University. They focused on Bible study, methodical study of scripture, and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the &quot;Holy Club&quot; and &quot;the Methodists&quot;, being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions, and disciplined lifestyle. Eventually, the so-called Methodists started individual societies or classes for members of the Church of England who wanted to live a more religious life.

In 1735, John and Charles Wesley went to America, hoping to teach the gospel to the Native Americans in the colony of Georgia. Instead, John became vicar of Christ Church in Savannah. His preaching was legalistic and full of harsh rules, and the congregation rejected him. After two years in America, he returned to England dejected and confused. While sailing on his original journey to America, he had been impressed with the faith of the German Moravians on board, and when he returned to England he spent time with Peter Böhler, a German Moravian who was passing through England and who believed that a person is saved solely through the grace of God and not by works. John had many conversations with Böhler about this topic. On May 25, 1738, after listening to a reading of Martin Luther&#x27;s preface to the Epistle to the Romans, John came to the understanding that his good works could not save him and he could rest in God&#x27;s grace for salvation. For the first time in his life, he felt peace and the assurance of salvation.

In less than two years, the &quot;Holy Club&quot; disbanded. John Wesley met with a group of clergy, and afterwards said &quot;they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible-Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity.&quot; The ministers nonetheless retained their membership in the Church of England. Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God&#x27;s grace, acquired through faith in Christ. Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:

# People are all by nature &quot;dead in sin&quot; and, consequently, &quot;children of wrath&quot;.
# They are &quot;justified by faith alone&quot;.
# Faith produces inward and outward &quot;holiness&quot;.

These clergymen quickly became popular, attracting large congregations. The nickname students had used against the Wesleys was revived; they and their followers subsequently became known as &quot;Methodists&quot;.

===Predecessors===
The English preacher Francis Asbury arrived in America in 1771. He became a &quot;circuit rider&quot;, taking the gospel to the furthest reaches of the new frontier as he had done as a preacher in England . The first official organization in the United States occurred in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1784, with the formation of the Methodist Episcopal Church at the Christmas Conference with Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke as the leaders.
Though John Wesley originally wanted the Methodists to stay within the Church of England, the American Revolution decisively separated the Methodists in the American colonies from the life and sacraments of the English Church. In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as Superintendent (the equivalent of a bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Together with Coke, Wesley sent The Sunday Service of the Methodists, Methodism&#x27;s first liturgical text and the Articles of Religion, which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the mother church of American Methodism.

The new church grew rapidly in the young country as it employed circuit riders, many of whom were laymen, to travel the mostly rural nation by horseback to preach the Gospel and to establish churches until there was scarcely any village in the United States without a Methodist presence. With 4,000 circuit riders by 1844, the Methodist Episcopal Church rapidly became the largest Protestant denomination in the country.

St. George&#x27;s United Methodist Church, located at the corner of 4th and New Streets, in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia, is the oldest Methodist church in continuous use in the United States, beginning in 1769. The congregation was founded in 1767, meeting initially in a sail loft on Dock Street, and in 1769 it purchased the shell of a building which had been erected in 1763 by a German Reformed congregation. At this time, Methodists had not yet broken away from the Anglican Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784.
Richard Allen and Absalom Jones became the first African Americans ordained by the Methodist Church. They were licensed by Saint George&#x27;s Church in 1784. Three years later, protesting racial segregation in worship services, Allen led most of the black members out of St. George&#x27;s; eventually they founded the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Absalom Jones became an Episcopal priest. In 1836, the church&#x27;s basement was excavated to make room for a Sunday school. In the 1920s, a court case saved the church from being demolished to make way for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. The case resulted in the bridge being relocated. Historic Saint George&#x27;s welcomes visitors and is home to archives and a museum on Methodism.

In the more than 220 years since 1784, Methodism in the United States, like many other Protestant denominations, has seen a number of divisions and mergers. In 1830, the Methodist Protestant Church split from the Methodist Episcopal Church over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church, insisting that clergy should not be the only ones to have any determination in how the church was to be operated. In 1844, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.

The two general conferences, Methodist Episcopal Church (the northern faction) and Methodist Episcopal Church, South remained separate until 1939. That year, the northern and southern Methodist Episcopal Churches and the majority of the Methodist Protestant Church merged to create The Methodist Church. The uniting conference took place at First Methodist Church (now First United Methodist Church) of Marion, Indiana.

===1968 merger===
On April 23, 1968, the United Methodist Church was created when the Evangelical United Brethren Church (represented by Bishop Reuben H. Mueller) and The Methodist Church (represented by Bishop Lloyd Christ Wicke) joined hands at the constituting General Conference in Dallas, Texas. With the words, &quot;Lord of the Church, we are united in Thee, in Thy Church and now in The United Methodist Church&quot; the new denomination was given birth by both churches which had distinguished histories and influential ministries in various parts of the world.

===2020–2024 schisms===
Prior to the United Methodist Church&#x27;s May 2024 General Conference, the UMC had rules, found in the Book of Discipline, that prohibited same-sex unions and the ordination of noncelibate homosexuals. Many progressive UMC leaders and churches, especially in the United States, are supportive of gay marriage and ignored the injunctions in the Book of Discipline. Many conservative members of the UMC did not like the trend of the UMC trending towards endorsing gay marriage and, hence, have initiated movements to split-off from the UMC.

On January 3, 2020, the denomination&#x27;s leadership released a proposal to split the Church over what it described as &quot;fundamental differences&quot; over homosexuality, particularly same-sex marriage (see § Homosexuality below). The United Methodist Church would hold a special session to repeal the ban on same-sex marriage. The proposal would need to be approved by the General Conference in order to take effect. The 2020 General Conference, originally scheduled to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In November 2020, a small group of the progressive wing announced their intention to create a new denomination, the Liberation Methodist Connexion. It was launched on the First Sunday in Advent through an online service. However, organizers of the Liberation Methodist Connexion announced on 18 December 2021 that no progress has been made to set up a separate denomination.

In March 2021, conservative leaders of the UMC unveiled the name Global Methodist Church for the new traditionalist denomination, along with a new website and logo. The next General Conference was set for 2024. At that time, delegates were expected to vote on the Protocol for Reconciliation and Grace through Separation. The conservative Transitional Leadership Council said the Global Methodist Church would be officially started, with individual churches or conferences able to join, when the General Conference adopted legislation implementing the Protocol, although the Council intended to &quot;consider bringing the new church into existence without delay&quot; &quot;if it becomes apparent&quot; that leaders &quot;who covenanted to support the Protocol no longer do so.&quot; Not wanting to wait for the General Conference to occur, some conservative United Methodist congregations left the United Methodist Church to become a part of the Free Methodist Church, a traditionalist Methodist denomination aligned with the holiness movement. After the launch of the Global Methodist Church on May 1, 2022, a number of traditionalist United Methodist churches entered into the Global Methodist Church. Other former United Methodist churches that disaffiliated joined various Methodist denominations, such as the Congregational Methodist Church and Methodist Protestant Church, or became members of the Association of Independent Methodists.

On May 10, 2022, the Judicial Council of the United Methodist Church ruled that annual UMC conferences in the United States cannot leave the church for the Global Methodist Church; only individual churches may do so. The Romania-Bulgaria Conference has left the UMC. As of May 2022, the South Georgia and Northwest Texas conferences were making preparations to leave the UMC; however, these proposed transitions would require UMC General conference legislation.

Early in 2022, according to the United Methodist News Service, the United Methodist Church approved 300 requests by individual churches to leave the denomination. The Wesleyan Covenant Association, which was helping congregations join the Global Methodist Church, said that 1,000 more churches were expected to hold votes on proposed departures from the UMC later in the year and that 300 of 800 Western Pennsylvania Annual Conference churches were considering leaving. Methodist churches and congregations in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Croatia or Romania also expressed dissent and intentions to disaffiliate from the UMC due to progressive tendencies in the American leadership of the UMC. Over 100 churches in Florida and North Carolina had filed or were considering lawsuits. Some of the largest churches in Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas were planning to leave. As of 2022, any church that disaffiliated would be responsible for paying two years of apportionments and unfunded pension liabilities. Fifty-eight churches belonging to the Louisiana Annual Conference left the United Methodist Church, with seven congregations being from Baton Rouge and six from New Orleans. The disaffiliations from the conference were scheduled to take effect after December 31, 2022. St. Timothy, one of the largest Methodist churches in Louisiana, voted for disaffiliation on November 1, 2022. To prevent certain congregations from disaffiliating, the UMC ordered that certain churches be closed before disaffiliation votes could occur. Several annual conferences designated certain remaining congregations as &quot;lighthouse congregations&quot;, which offer support to UMC parishioners who objected to their former congregations&#x27; disaffiliation.

As of December 30, 2023, the number of UMC churches in the United States that were approved for disaffiliation stood at 7,660. This figure represented approximately one-quarter of the UMC churches in the United States.

The 2024 General Conference, the first since the delayed 2020 conference ran from April 23 to May 3 in Charlotte, North Carolina. With no debate since many of the more conservative congregations had left, proposals approved included having separate regions outside the United States in order to allow each region to have its own policies, removing language stating &quot;the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching&quot;, and ending bans on same-sex weddings and gay clergy.

On May 28, 2024, the Côte d’Ivoire Conference voted to leave the UMC in response to the General Conference decision to allow same-sex marriages and gay clergy. With 1.2 million members, the Côte d’Ivoire Conference was the UMC&#x27;s largest single presence outside the United States.

==Beliefs==

The United Methodist Church seeks to create disciples for Christ through outreach, evangelism, and through seeking holiness, also called sanctification, by the power of the Holy Spirit. The flame in the church logo represents the work of the Holy Spirit in the world, and the two parts of the flame also represent the predecessor denominations, the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren, united at the base symbolizing the 1968 merger.

The United Methodist Church understands itself to be part of the holy catholic (or universal) church and it recognizes the historic ecumenical creeds, the Apostles&#x27; Creed and the Nicene Creed; which are used frequently in services of worship. The Book of Discipline also recognizes the importance of the Chalcedonian Creed of the Council of Chalcedon. It upholds the concept of the &quot;visible and invisible Church,&quot; meaning that all who are truly believers in every age belong to the holy Church invisible, while the United Methodist Church is a branch of the Church visible, to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the Word of God is preached and the Sacraments are administered.

Some argue that the United Methodist Church can lay a claim to apostolic succession, as understood in the traditional sense. As a result of the American Revolution, John Wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters, Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat. Thomas Coke, already an Anglican priest, assisted Wesley in this action. Coke was then &quot;set apart&quot; as a Superintendent (bishop) by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there. In defense of his action to ordain, Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria, which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore, bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate. He knew that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by the Early Church. Methodists today who would argue for apostolic succession would do so on these grounds.

While many United Methodist congregations operate in the evangelical tradition, others reflect the mainline Protestant traditions. Although United Methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time, these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church&#x27;s founders, especially John Wesley and Charles Wesley (Anglicans), but also Philip William Otterbein and Martin Boehm (United Brethren), and Jacob Albright (Evangelical Association). With the formation of the United Methodist Church in 1968, theologian Albert C. Outler led the team which systematized denominational doctrine. Outler&#x27;s work proved pivotal in the work of union, and he is largely considered the first United Methodist theologian.

===Doctrine===
The officially established Doctrinal Standards of United Methodism are:
* The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church;
* The Confessions of Faith of the Evangelical United Brethren Church;
* The &quot;General Rules&quot; of the Methodist Societies;
* The Standard Sermons of John Wesley;
* John Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Explanatory Notes on the New Testament&quot;.

These Doctrinal Standards are constitutionally protected and nearly impossible to change or remove. Other doctrines of the United Methodist Church are found in the &quot;Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church&quot;.

===Summary of basic beliefs===
The basic beliefs of the United Methodist Church include:
* Triune God. God is one God in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
* The Bible. The Bible is the inspired word of God. F. Belton Joyner argues that there is a deep division within Methodism today about what exactly this means. Questions include whether the Bible was inspired when written (and the text today is always true and without error), or if it is inspired when actually read by a Christian (and therefore dependent on the interaction with the reader.) In the first case, says Joyner, the Christian is concerned only with the precise wording of the original manuscript, without regard to historical setting. In the other case, the reader tries to read the biblical text in terms of all of the influences of modern thought, with little regard for the meaning offered in the ancient texts. In that Wesleyan tradition, United Methodists balance these two extremes, aware that the same Holy Spirit who inspired the Scriptures is alive and well to bring the written Word alive for the present. United Methodists take seriously both the original inspiration and today&#x27;s contemporary inspiration. &quot;...In this way, the Bible itself becomes the balancing, clarifying, even correcting tool for understanding the Scripture. God&#x27;s gifts in the written Word are so rich that they can continue to give light and life as one digs again and again into the same Scriptures.&quot;
* Sin. While human beings were intended to bear the image of God, all humans are sinners for whom that image is distorted. Sin estranges people from God and corrupts human nature such that we cannot heal or save ourselves.
* Salvation through Jesus Christ. God&#x27;s redeeming love is active to save sinners through Jesus&#x27; incarnate life and teachings, through his atoning death, his resurrection, his sovereign presence through history, and his promised return.
* Sanctification. The grace of sanctification draws one toward the gift of Christian perfection, which Wesley described as a heart &quot;habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor&quot; and as &quot;having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked.&quot; This emphasis in Methodism has led to the heralding of the motto &quot;Holiness unto the Lord&quot;.
* Sacraments. United Methodists recognize two sacraments: Holy Baptism and Holy Communion. Other rites such as Confirmation, Ordination, Holy Matrimony, Funerals, and Anointing of the Sick are performed but not considered sacraments. In Holy Baptism, the Church believes that &quot;Baptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized; but it is also a sign of regeneration or the new birth. It believes that Baptism is a sacrament in which God initiates a covenant with individuals, people become a part of the Church, is not to be repeated, and is a means of grace. The United Methodist Church generally practices Baptism by sprinkling, pouring, or immersion and uses the Trinitarian formula. United Methodists also recognize as valid baptisms performed in several other Christian denominations. The Church practices and encourages infant baptism; when persons baptized as infants mature, they may confirm (or reject) the baptismal vows made on their behalf as infants by families, guardians, and congregations through a process of Christian education called Confirmation. The United Methodist Church affirms the real presence of Christ in Holy Communion, but does not hold to the Catholic dogma of transubstantiation. The Church believes that the bread is an effectual sign of His body crucified on the cross and the cup is an effectual sign of His blood shed for humanity. Through the outward and visible signs of bread and wine, the inward and spiritual reality of the Body and Blood of Christ are offered to believers. The Church holds that the celebration of the Eucharist is an anamnesis of Jesus&#x27; death, and believes the sacrament to be a means of grace, and practices open communion.
* Free will. The UMC believes that people, while corrupted by sin, are free to make their own choices because of God&#x27;s divine grace enabling them, and that people are truly accountable before God for their choices.
* Social Justice. The Church opposes evils such as slavery, inhumane prison conditions, capital punishment, economic injustice, child labor, racism, and inequality.

===Distinctive Wesleyan emphases===
The key emphasis of Wesley&#x27;s theology relates to how divine grace operates within the individual. Wesley defined the Way of Salvation as the operation of grace in at least three parts: Prevenient Grace, Justifying Grace, and Sanctifying Grace.

Prevenient grace, or the grace that &quot;goes before&quot; us, is given to all people. It is that power which enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. This grace is the present work of God to turn us from our sin-corrupted human will to the loving will of the Father. In this work, God desires that we might sense both our sinfulness before God and God&#x27;s offer of salvation. Prevenient grace allows those tainted by sin to nevertheless make a truly free choice to accept or reject God&#x27;s salvation in Christ.

Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace is that grace, offered by God to all people, that we receive by faith and trust in Christ, through which God pardons the believer of sin. It is in justifying grace we are received by God, in spite of our sin. In this reception, we are forgiven through the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the cross. The justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love God and neighbor. Today, justifying grace is also known as conversion, &quot;accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior,&quot; or being &quot;born again.&quot; John Wesley originally called this experience the New Birth. This experience can occur in different ways; it can be one transforming moment, such as an altar call experience, or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time.

Sanctifying Grace is that grace of God which sustains the believers in the journey toward Christian Perfection: a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and a genuine love of our neighbors as ourselves. Sanctifying grace enables us to respond to God by leading a Spirit-filled and Christ-like life aimed toward love. Wesley never claimed this state of perfection for himself but instead insisted the attainment of perfection was possible for all Christians. Here the English Reformer parted company with both Luther and Calvin, who denied that a man would ever reach a state in this life in which he could not fall into sin. Such a man can lose all inclination to evil and can gain perfection in this life.

Wesleyan theology maintains that salvation is the act of God&#x27;s grace entirely, from invitation, to pardon, to growth in holiness. Furthermore, God&#x27;s prevenient, justifying, and sanctifying grace interact dynamically in the lives of Christians from birth to death.

According to Wesleyan understanding, good works are the fruit of one&#x27;s salvation, not the way in which that salvation was earned. Faith and good works go hand in hand in Methodist theology: a living tree naturally and inevitably bears fruit. Wesleyan theology rejects the doctrine of eternal security, believing that salvation can be rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber/Kalberg-Conditional preservation of the saints&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley emphasized that believers must continue to grow in their relationship with Christ, through the process of Sanctification.

A key outgrowth of this theology is the United Methodist dedication not only to the Evangelical Gospel of repentance and a personal relationship with God, but also to the Social Gospel and a commitment to social justice issues that have included abolition, women&#x27;s suffrage, labor rights, civil rights, and ministry with the poor. 

===Characterization of Wesleyan theology===

Methodist theology stands at a unique crossroads between evangelical, holiness and sacramental, as well as between liturgical and charismatic, and between Anglo-Catholic and Reformed worship. It has been characterized as Wesleyan–Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer. The United Methodist Church believes in &quot;prima scriptura&quot;, seeing the Bible as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred tradition, reason, and experience to interpret it, with the aid of the Holy Spirit (see Wesleyan Quadrilateral). Therefore, according to &quot;The Book of Discipline,&quot; United Methodist theology is at once &quot;catholic, evangelical, and reformed.&quot;

Today, the UMC is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race, gender, and ideology, though the denomination itself includes a wide spectrum of attitudes. Comparatively, the UMC stands to the right of liberal and progressive Protestant groups such as the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church on certain issues (especially regarding sexuality), but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the Southern Baptists and Pentecostalism, in regard to theological matters such as social justice and Biblical interpretation. The UMC is made up of a broad diversity of thought, and so there are many clergy and laity within the UMC that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters.

===Diversity within beliefs===
In appealing for tolerance of diversity of theological opinions, John Wesley said, &quot;Though we may not think alike, may we not all love alike?&quot; The phrase &quot;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity&quot; has also become a maxim among Methodists, who have always maintained a great diversity of opinion on many matters within the Church.

The United Methodist Church allows for a wide range of theological and political beliefs. For example, former President George W. Bush (R-TX), former First Lady Laura Bush and former Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions, are United Methodists, as are Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and former Senator Max Cleland (D-GA).

The Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2014 US Religious Landscape Study concluded that the political preferences of US adult members of the United Methodist Church was 54 percent Republican / lean Republican, 35 percent Democrat / lean Democrat, and 11 percent independent / no lean / other.

===Social issues===
====Abortion====

The topic of abortion is complex for the United Methodist Church. The United Methodist Church affirms these two sentences in The Social Principles: &quot;Our belief in the sanctity of unborn human life makes us reluctant to approve abortion. But we are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother and the unborn child.&quot; (Book of Discipline ¶161.J). The denomination is committed to &quot;assist[ing] the ministry of crisis pregnancy centers and pregnancy resource centers that compassionately help women find feasible alternatives to abortion.&quot; In 2016, the United Methodist General Conference voted to withdraw from the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC), an organization in which it formerly held membership. Annual Conferences could still choose whether to remain a part of the RCRC locally. At the same General Conference, delegates voted to delete a four-decade-old statement from the Book of Resolutions which affirmed the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; Supreme Court decision on the legality of abortion. A new resolution was re-adopted 56–2 in a resolutions subcommittee, decrying gender-selective abortion while also describing abortion as &quot;violent&quot; and opposing abortions done for &quot;trivial reasons.&quot; The resolution passed in the daily consent agenda with no debate. As an official organization, however, &quot;the General Board of Church and Society continues to be an advocate for a full range of safe and legal reproductive health care – including, in certain cases, the option to safely and legally end a pregnancy.&quot;

Nevertheless, the United Methodist Church holds that &quot;while we understand the need for women to have access to safe, legal abortions, we also &#x27;mourn and are committed to promoting the diminishment of high abortion rates&#x27;.&quot; and they &quot;are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother, for whom devastating damage may result from an unacceptable pregnancy. In continuity with past Christian teaching, we recognize tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion, (in the eyes of God) and in such cases we support the legal option of abortion under proper medical procedures.&quot; The Church cautions that &quot;Governmental laws and regulations do not provide all the guidance required by the informed Christian conscience.&quot; The Church emphasizes the need of a supportive ministry to women who have experienced abortions: &quot;We further encourage local churches to make available contact information for counseling agencies that offer programs to address post-abortion stress for all seeking help.&quot;

Members of the United Methodist Church who identify with the anti-abortion position come mostly from the Confessing Movement within the denomination and have organized into the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (TUMAS) to further their position within the denomination. On the other side, the Methodist Federation for Social Action and United Methodist Women continue to represent pro-choice views.

====Alcohol====
Historically, the Methodist Church has supported the temperance movement. John Wesley warned against the dangers of drinking in his famous sermon, &quot;The Use of Money&quot;, and in his letter to an alcoholic. Today the United Methodist Church states that it &quot;affirms our long-standing support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to God&#x27;s liberating and redeeming love for persons.&quot; In fact, the United Methodist Church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of Holy Communion, thus &quot;expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enabling the participation of children and youth, and supporting the church&#x27;s witness of abstinence.&quot; Moreover, in 2011 and 2012, the United Methodist Church&#x27;s General Board of Church and Society called on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for Lent.

====Capital punishment====
The United Methodist Church, along with some other Methodist churches, condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life. The Church also holds that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalized persons including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with mental and emotional illnesses. The United Methodist Church also believes that Jesus explicitly repudiated the &quot;lex talionis&quot; in Matthew 5:38–39 and abolished the death penalty in John 8:7. The General Conference of the United Methodist Church calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence.

====Creation====
The United Methodist Church, like many mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church, has determined that there is no conflict between faith and the theory of evolution. Some clergy have stated that &quot;it&#x27;s time for people of faith to accept evolution.&quot; Additionally, the UMC officially affirms the theory of evolution and &quot;opposes introducing theories such as Creationism or Intelligent Design into public school curriculum.&quot; In 2016, the denomination denied approval for a creationist group to be officially represented at the church&#x27;s General Conference.

====Euthanasia====
The United Methodist Church is opposed to euthanasia and assisted suicide. The official stance mentions that &quot;The church has an obligation to see that all persons have access to needed pastoral and medical care and therapy in those circumstances that lead to loss of self-worth, suicidal despair, and/or the desire to seek physician-assisted suicide.&quot; It also states that &quot;If death is deliberately sought as the means to relieve suffering, that must be understood as direct and intentional taking of life ... The United Methodist tradition opposes the taking of life as an offense against God&#x27;s sole dominion over life, and an abandonment of hope and humility before God.&quot;

The United Methodist Church, represented by Bishop Scott Jones of the Texas Annual Conference, on behalf of the Houston Methodist Research Institute, and the Roman Catholic Church, represented by Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, of the Pontifical Academy for Life, signed a &quot;Joint Declaration on the End of Life and Palliative Care&quot;, on 17 September 2018, reaffirming the common stance of both denominations in opposing euthanasia.

====Gambling====
The United Methodist Church opposes gambling, believing that it is a sin which feeds on human greed and which invites people to place their trust in possessions, rather than in God, whom Christians should &quot;love ... with all your heart.&quot; It quotes the Apostle Paul who states: The United Methodist Church therefore holds that:
* Gambling is a menace to society, deadly to the best interests of moral, social, economic, and spiritual life, and destructive of good government. As an act of faith and concern, Christians should abstain from gambling and should strive to minister to those victimized by the practice.
* Where gambling has become addictive, the Church will encourage such individuals to receive therapeutic assistance so that the individual&#x27;s energies may be redirected into positive and constructive ends.
* The Church should promote standards and personal lifestyles that would make unnecessary and undesirable the resort to commercial gambling—including public lotteries—as a recreation, as an escape, or as a means of producing public revenue or funds for support of charities or government.

====Gun control====
The United Methodist Church supports federal legislative efforts for strict gun control measures in the United States, and outright bans of most weapons in other nations.
The Church also declares all of its churches to be &quot;a weapon-free zone.&quot;

====Sexuality====
According to The United Methodist Book of Discipline (a new edition of which is usually approved by the United Methodist General Conference every four years), the Church &quot;affirm[s] that all persons are individuals of sacred worth, created in the image of God&quot; and encourages United Methodists to be in ministry with and for all people. During the 2024 General Conference, the United Methodist Church removed previous language prohibiting same-sex marriages and the ordination of partnered LGBTQ clergy. According to polling from Pew Research, the majority of United Methodists in the US support the inclusion of homosexual persons, 60 percent of United Methodists said &quot;homosexuality should be accepted by society&quot;, and 40 percent supported same-sex marriage.

The United Methodist Church previously prohibited same-sex unions. Jimmy Creech was defrocked after a highly publicized church trial in 1999 on account of his participation in same-sex union ceremonies. Other ministers have been defrocked for officiating at same-sex weddings and several trials of others are scheduled. Frank Schaefer, who was defrocked and penalized because he had officiated his son&#x27;s same-sex wedding, was in 2014, re-instated as &quot;the denomination&#x27;s top court upheld a June decision by a regional appeals committee to reinstate Schaefer&#x27;s ministerial credentials.&quot; Other clergy, who officiated at same-sex marriages, had avoided trials. In 2016, it was announced that Val Rosenquist &quot;will avoid a church trial and keep her job after she co-officiated with retired Bishop Melvin Talbert at the April same-gender wedding of two church members.&quot; In 1971, Gene Leggett was defrocked for being homosexual in southern Texas. In 1987, a United Methodist church court in New Hampshire defrocked Methodist minister Rose Mary Denman for openly living with a same-sex partner. In 2005, clergy credentials were removed from Irene Elizabeth Stroud after she was convicted in a church trial of violating church law by engaging in a lesbian relationship; this conviction was later upheld by the Judicial Council, the highest court in the denomination. The Judicial Council also affirmed that a Virginia pastor had the right to deny local church membership to a man in an openly gay relationship. This affirmation, however, was based upon a senior pastor&#x27;s right to judge the readiness of a congregant to join as a full member of the church.

On the other hand, hundreds of United Methodist ministers had openly defied the official position of the United Methodist Church and have publicly revealed their &quot;lesbian, gay or bisexual&quot; sexual orientation, an action that could result in their suspension. The New York body also ordained the first openly gay and lesbian clergy. In addition, the Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC approved the appointment of an openly partnered lesbian to the diaconate. In 2016, the Western Jurisdiction elected the denomination&#x27;s first openly and partnered lesbian bishop. While not elected, the UMC reported that the North Central Jurisdiction considered the nomination of an openly gay pastor for bishop.

Although there is no official policy, the Judicial Council of the UMC ruled, in 2008, that ordained transgender pastors could serve in congregations within the denomination. In particular, the first openly transgender pastor within the UMC received overwhelming support from his congregation. In 2016, the South Carolina Annual Conference passed a resolution urging support for non-discrimination protections for transgender people. In 2017, the Northern Illinois Conference commissioned M Barclay as a Deacon and became the first openly non-binary trans person commissioned in the denomination.

On April 28, 2017, the Judicial Council ruled that consecrating a bishop in a same-sex marriage or partnership is a violation of church law at the time and that public marriage records could be considered as evidence of self-avowed homosexuality. In regards to the specific case of Bishop Karen Oliveto, the denomination&#x27;s first openly gay bishop, the Judicial Council ruled that she &quot;remains in good standing&quot; pending the outcome of any administrative or judicial processes initiated within the Western Jurisdiction, since the Judicial Council itself does not have jurisdiction to review Bishop Oliveto&#x27;s status. The Judicial Council also ruled that Boards of Ordained Ministry must evaluate all candidates regarding issues of sexuality.

On May 7, 2018, the Council of Bishops in the United Methodist Church proposed allowing individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy and perform same-sex weddings. However, on February 26, 2019, a special session of the General Conference rejected this proposal, and voted to strengthen its official opposition to same-sex marriages and ordaining openly LGBT clergy. The vote was 53 percent in favor of the Traditional Plan, the plan maintaining and strengthening the official position, to 47 percent opposed. The Judicial Council had already ruled some parts of the Traditional Plan to be unconstitutional. The delegates also voted to send the plan for further review by the Judicial Council. In March 2019, the German Central Conference announced that it would not be imposing the Traditional Plan. While the US jurisdictions and regional bodies are unable to adapt the Book of Discipline like the Central Conferences, the Western Jurisdiction declared their disagreement with the Traditional Plan and vowed to maintain LGBTQ inclusive policies. In April 2019, the Judicial Council ruled on the 17 petitions of the Traditional Plan, upholding 10 as valid and rejecting 7 as unconstitutional.

On January 3, 2020, some denominational leaders along with various advocacy groups submitted a plan called, &quot;Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation,&quot; to split the church over what it described as &quot;fundamental differences&quot; over issues pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity, particularly same-sex marriage. The &quot;Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation&quot; plan would create a new traditionalist Methodist denomination (which came to be the Global Methodist Church), with the existing church moving to more acceptance of non-heterosexual and gender-nonconforming identities. The church&#x27;s General Conference was expected to vote on the plan in May 2020. The plan would have needed to be approved in May 2020 by the General Conference. It would grant the new denomination $25 million and would allow local churches to vote to affiliate with the new denomination and keep their assets if they leave. The vote was later postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Progressives too announced the creation of a new denomination in November 2020, the Liberation Methodist Connexion. In 2022, the Western Jurisdiction elected a second openly gay bishop, Cedrick Bridgeforth, who also is the denomination&#x27;s first Black gay Bishop.

During the 2024 General Conference, on April 25, 2024, the delegates passed a proposal to restructure the UMC, establishing regionalization that would allow each region to determine its own standards for same-sex marriage and the ordination of partnered LGBTQ clergy. Due to the proposal being a constitutional change, the proposal will need to be ratified by a two-thirds majority of votes cast during the local Annual Conferences. Multiple petitions were brought to amend statutory language regarding sexuality. On April 30, 2024, the UMC removed penalties for clergy performing same-sex marriages, removed the ban on funding for LGBTQ-affirming organizations, and removed the prohibition on considering openly LGBTQ candidates for ordained ministry. On May 1, 2024, the General Conference of the UMC voted to repeal the prior prohibitions against clergy performing same-sex marriages and the ordination of openly partnered LGBTQ clergy. On May 2, the General Conference voted to approve more petitions, which amended the UMC Social Principles to remove language stating that &quot;the practice of homosexuality ... is incompatible with Christian teaching&quot;; revises the language on marriage to state that it is &quot;a sacred lifelong covenant that brings two people of faith [adult man and woman of consenting age or two adult persons of consenting age] into union with one another and into deeper relationship with God and the religious community;&quot; states opposition to both child marriage and polygamy; and affirms support for consent in sexual relations. On May 3, during the final day of business, the General Conference removed language from church law imposing potential penalties for officiating at same-sex weddings, penalties for being in a same-sex relationship themselves, prohibitions against clergy from officiating or churches hosting same-sex weddings, and mandates that clergy practice celibacy in singleness. In addition, General Conference added language allowing clergy to abstain from officiating any weddings. The Conference maintained the chargeable offense of &quot;immorality&quot; but voted against defining the offense to include infidelity or non-celibacy.

====Military service====

According to &quot;The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church&quot;, &quot;The United Methodist Church calls upon all who choose to take up arms or who order others to do so to evaluate their actions in accordance with historic church teaching limiting resort to war, including questions of proportionality, legal authority, discrimination between combatants and noncombatants, just cause, and probability of success...&quot;

The United Methodist Church opposes conscription as incompatible with the teaching of Scripture. Therefore, the Church supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously oppose all war, or any particular war, and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription. However, the United Methodist Church also supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously choose to serve in the armed forces or to accept alternative service. The church also states that &quot;as Christians they are aware that neither the way of military action, nor the way of inaction is always righteous before God.&quot;

The United Methodist Church maintains that war is incompatible with Christ&#x27;s message and teachings. Therefore, the Church rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy, to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide, brutal suppression of human rights, and unprovoked international aggression. It insists that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve by peaceful means every dispute that arises between or among them; that human values must outweigh military claims as governments determine their priorities; that the militarization of society must be challenged and stopped; that the manufacture, sale, and deployment of armaments must be reduced and controlled; and that the production, possession, or use of nuclear weapons be condemned. Consequently, the United Methodist Church endorses general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.

The United Methodist Church, like many Mainline Protestant denominations in the U.S., has a long tradition of providing ordained military chaplains who serve in all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

====Pornography====
The United Methodist Church teaches that pornography is &quot;not only about sex; it is often about violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion,&quot; and their website states that the Church &quot;oppose[s] all forms of pornography.&quot; The &quot;Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church&quot; states that &quot;Research shows it [pornography] is not an &#x27;innocent activity.&#x27; It is harmful and is generally addictive. Persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered, as is their perspective, relationships with parishioners and family, and their perceptions of girls and women.&quot;

====Stem cell research====
The UMC supports federal funding for research on embryos created for &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization that remain after the procreative efforts have ceased, if the embryos were provided for research instead of being destroyed, were not obtained by sale, and those donating had given prior informed consent for the research purposes. The UMC stands in &quot;opposition to the creation of embryos for the sake of research&quot; as &quot;a human embryo, even at its earliest stages, commands our reverence.&quot; It supports research on stem cells retrieved from umbilical cords and adult stem cells, stating that there are &quot;few moral questions&quot; raised by this issue.

==Worship and liturgy==

The United Methodist Church includes a variety of approaches to public worship. The common pattern of worship is found in the official liturgies of the church, while the practices of congregations across the denomination are quite diverse.

The common pattern comes from John Wesley, who wrote that &quot;there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety, than the Common Prayer of the Church of England.&quot; When the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England, John Wesley himself provided a revised version of The Book of Common Prayer called &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists; With Other Occasional Services&quot;. Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Service&quot; has shaped the official liturgies of the Methodists ever since.

Like other historic Christian churches, the United Methodist Church has official liturgies for services of Holy Communion, baptism, weddings, funerals, ordination, anointing of the sick and daily office prayer services. Some clergy offer healing services, while exorcism is an occasional practice by some clergy in The United Methodist Church in Africa. These services involve the laying on of hands and anointing with oil. Along with these, there are also special services for holy days such as All Saints Day, Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Vigil. These services are contained in &quot;The United Methodist Hymnal&quot; and &quot;The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)&quot;. Many of these liturgies are derived from the Anglican tradition&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer. In most cases, congregations also use other elements of liturgical worship, such as candles, optional use of incense at evening prayer, vestments, paraments, banners, and liturgical art.

Typical worship services in United Methodism will include:
* Singing. Since the days of Charles Wesley, the hymn-writer and early Methodist leader, lively singing has been, and remains, an important aspect of United Methodist worship. The church publishes an official hymnal, &quot;The United Methodist Hymnal&quot;, for use in churches, and allows for music ranging from hymns to contemporary worship music to be played as part of the service.
* A Biblical Message. Listening to the reading of Scripture and a sermon based upon the Biblical text is virtually always included in United Methodist worship. Many United Methodist churches follow the Revised Common Lectionary for their Sunday Bible readings.
* Prayer. Many churches include a time of response or a prayer time in which people may share concerns or pray with ministers. This time of response may include celebrations of baptism, confirmation, or profession of faith.
* Holy Communion. Some congregations celebrate communion on the first Sunday of the month and a few celebrate it only quarterly. A growing number of congregations celebrate the sacrament of Holy Communion on a weekly basis, as John Wesley himself encouraged his followers to practice. In adopting the statement on Holy Communion entitled &quot;This Holy Mystery&quot; in 2004, the General Conference of the Church urged congregations to move toward weekly celebration of communion and to use the official liturgies of the church when doing so.
* Lovefeast. Many congregations celebrate the Lovefeast (also known as the Agape Feast) on a quarterly basis, which is accompanied by the partaking of bread and water, as well as the sharing of testimonies, Scripture readings and hymn singing.
* Giving. Almost every service has an opportunity for those gathered to give of their &quot;tithes and offerings&quot; to support the ministry of that particular congregation. Through apportionments, a portion of those gifts go to Christian ministries that have a national or global impact.

Many larger United Methodist congregations have incorporated more contemporary styles of music and audio-visual technology into some of their worship services, though these churches generally also offer more traditional services.

As John Wesley advocated outdoor evangelism, revival services are a traditional worship practice of Methodism that are often held in United Methodist churches, as well as at outdoor camp meetings and at tent revivals.

The chancel of United Methodist churches usually features a lectern and baptismal font on one side of the altar table and a pulpit on the other side. The chancel also features the Christian Flag and sometimes, a processional cross. The chancel is often delimited by chancel rails, sometimes with a mourner&#x27;s bench in front of it.

===Saints===
The United Methodist Church&#x27;s understanding of a &quot;saint&quot; is not unique among Protestants, yet differs significantly from the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran views. Methodists do not have a process for electing people to sainthood. They do not pray to saints, nor do they believe that saints serve as mediators to God. The denomination considers all faithful Christians to be saints.

Methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure (e.g., &quot;St. James UMC&quot;). Methodists also honor notable heroes and heroines of the Christian faith and look to these prominent saints as providing examples of holy living and commitment to Christ that are worthy of imitation. Such exemplary saints include martyrs, confessors of the Faith, evangelists, or important biblical figures such as Saint Matthew. Lutheran theologian and anti-Nazi martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Salvation Army founder William Booth, African missionary David Livingstone and Methodism&#x27;s revered founder John Wesley are among many cited as Protestant saints.

Article XIV of &quot;The United Methodist Articles of Religion&quot; explicitly rejects &quot;invocation of saints&quot; (praying to saints). The text reads &quot;—Of Purgatory—The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.&quot;

==Organization==
===Governance===
The church is decentralized with the General Conference being the official governing body. However, administratively the church has a governing structure that is similar to that of the United States government:
* General Conference—The legislative branch that makes all decisions as to doctrine and polity.
* Council of Bishops—When taken into consideration along with the various general agencies of the church, takes on a role similar to an executive branch. The Council of Bishops consists of all active and retired bishops and meets twice a year. According to the Book of Discipline 2000, &quot;The Church expects the Council of Bishops to speak to the Church and from the Church to the world, and to give leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships.&quot; The council is presided over by a President who serves a two-year term. The President has no official authority beyond presiding. Administrative work is handled by the secretary of the council.
* Judicial Council—The judicial branch consisting of nine persons elected by the General Conference to rule on questions of constitutionality in church law and practice.

===General Conference===
The United Methodist Church is organized into conferences. The highest level is called the &quot;General Conference&quot; and is the only organization which may speak officially for the church. The General Conference meets every four years (quadrennium). Legislative changes are recorded in &quot;The Book of Discipline&quot; which is revised after each General Conference. Non-legislative resolutions are recorded in the &quot;Book of Resolutions&quot;, which is published after each General Conference, and expire after eight years unless passed again by a subsequent session of General Conference. The most recent General Conferences were held in Portland, Oregon in 2016, and St. Louis, Missouri, in 2019. The event is currently rotated between the US jurisdictions of the church. Bishops, councils, committees, boards, elders, etc., are not permitted to speak on behalf of the United Methodist Church as this authority is reserved solely for the General Conference in accordance with the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot;.

The plenary session is presided over by an active bishop who has been selected by a committee of delegates to the conference. It is not uncommon for different bishops to preside on different days. The presiding officer is usually accompanied by parliamentarians.

The church had planned for a conference outside of the United States for the first time in history in 2024. These plans were established in 2015 for the first meeting. However, these plans were cancelled because organizers were unable to find a convention space that would be available for two weeks to host the global gathering. Sara Hotchkiss, business manager for the Commission on General Conference stated:&quot;No one has done anything wrong, or there&#x27;s no reason not to go. It&#x27;s just simply when we did a bid process, the facilities needed for the length of our conference were not available,&quot;

===Jurisdictional and central conferences===
Subordinate to the General Conference are the jurisdictional and central conferences which also meet every four years. The United States is divided into five jurisdictions: Northeastern, Southeastern, North Central, South Central and Western. Outside the United States the church is divided into seven central conferences: Africa, Congo, West Africa, Central &amp; Southern Europe, Germany, Northern Europe and Eurasia, and the Philippines. The main purpose of the jurisdictional and central conferences is to elect and appoint bishops, the chief administrators of the church. Additionally, central conferences may limitedly adapt the church law to the needs of their areas. Bishops thus elected serve &quot;episcopal areas&quot;, which consist of one or more &quot;annual conferences&quot;.

In the US, decisions in-between the four-year meetings are made by the Mission Council (usually consisting of church bishops). One of the most high-profile decisions in recent years by one of the councils was a decision by the Mission Council of the South Central Jurisdiction which in March 2007 approved a 99-year lease of at Southern Methodist University for the George W. Bush Presidential Library. The decision generated controversy in light of Bush&#x27;s support of the Iraq War which the church bishops have criticized. A debate over whether the decision should or could be submitted for approval by the Southern Jurisdictional Conference at its July 2008 meeting in Dallas, Texas, remains unresolved.

===Judicial Council===
The Judicial Council is the highest court in the denomination. It consists of nine members, who are elected by the General Conference for an eight-year term. Its membership consists of both laity and clergy: the ratio of laity to clergy alternates every eight years. The Judicial Council interprets the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; between sessions of General Conference, and during General Conference, the Judicial Council rules on the constitutionality of laws passed by General Conference. The Council also determines whether actions of local churches, annual conferences, church agencies, and bishops are in accordance with church law. The Council reviews all decisions of law made by bishops. The Judicial Council cannot create any legislation; it can only interpret existing legislation. The Council meets twice a year at various locations throughout the world. The Judicial Council also hears appeals from those who have been accused of chargeable offenses that can result in defrocking or revocation of membership.

===Annual conference===
The annual conference, roughly the equivalent of a diocese in the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church or a synod in some Lutheran denominations such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, is the basic unit of organization within the UMC. The term &quot;annual conference&quot; is often used to refer to the geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting. Clergy are members of their annual conference rather than of any local , and are appointed to a local church or other charge annually by the conference&#x27;s resident bishop at the meeting of the annual conference. In many ways, the United Methodist Church operates in a connectional organization of the annual conferences, and actions taken by one conference are not binding upon another.

===Districts===
Annual conferences are further divided into districts, each served by a district superintendent. The district superintendents are also appointed annually from the ordained elders of the annual conference by the bishop. District superintendents, upon completion of their service as superintendent, routinely return to serving local congregations. The annual conference cabinet is composed of the bishop and the district superintendents.

===Local churches===

&quot;The Book of Discipline&quot; is the guidebook for local churches and pastors and describes in considerable detail the organizational structure of local United Methodist churches. All UM churches must have a board of trustees with at least three members and no more than nine members and it is recommended that no gender should hold more than a 2/3 majority. All churches must also have a nominations committee, a finance committee and a church council or administrative council. Other committees are suggested but not required such as a missions committee, or evangelism or worship committee. Term limits are set for some committees but not for all. The church conference is an annual meeting of all the officers of the church and any interested members. This committee has the exclusive power to set pastors&#x27; salaries (compensation packages for tax purposes) and to elect officers to the committees.

===Administrative offices===

There is no official headquarters of the UMC although many of its biggest administrative offices are in Nashville, Tennessee, and are physically located near Vanderbilt University (which has historic Methodist ties but is no longer associated with the church).

While the General Conference is the only organization that can officially speak for the United Methodist Church as a whole, there are 13 agencies, boards and commissions of the general church. These organizations address specific topic areas of denomination-wide concern with administrative offices throughout the United States.
* Discipleship Ministries (Nashville, Tennessee)
* Wespath Benefits and Investments (Glenview, Illinois)
* General Board of Church and Society (Washington, D.C.)
* General Board of Global Ministries (Atlanta, Georgia) (GBGM)
** United Methodist Committee on Relief (Atlanta, GA)
* General Board of Higher Education and Ministry (GBHEM) (Nashville, TN) (GBHEM)
* General Commission on Archives and History (Madison, New Jersey) (GCAH)
* General Commission on Religion and Race (Washington, DC) (GCORR)
* General Commission on the Status and Role of Women (Chicago) (GCSRW)
* General Commission on United Methodist Men (Nashville, Tennessee) (GCUMM)
* General Council on Finance and Administration (Nashville, Tennessee) (GCFA)
* United Methodist Communications (Nashville, Tennessee) (UMCom)
* United Methodist Publishing House (Nashville, Tennessee)
* United Methodist Women (New York City, New York) (UMW)

=== United Methodist Volunteers in Mission ===
United Methodist Volunteers in Mission (UMVIM) is the short-term mission arm of the United Methodist Church. UMVIM coordinates mission projects for over 100,000 United Methodist volunteers every year. UMVIM coordinates over 400 international development projects.

==Education==
There are two separate pages describing this in more detail: United Methodist Church higher education and International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities.

Throughout its history, the United Methodist Church has placed great emphasis on the importance of education. As such, the United Methodist Church established and is affiliated with around one hundred colleges and universities in the United States, including American University, Syracuse University, Boston University, Emory University, Duke University, Drew University, University of Denver, University of Evansville, and Southern Methodist University. Most are members of the International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities. The church operates three hundred sixty schools and institutions overseas, notably Africa University in Zimbabwe.

There are 13 United Methodist seminaries. The United Methodist Church among Christian churches has a highly educated membership, with 37% of members holding graduate or post-graduate degrees. The church also claims a disproportionate share of high-income earners.

==Clergy==
United Methodist clergy consist of elders, local pastors, associate members and deacons. They hold membership in the annual conference and not in the local church. Additionally provisional clergy hold membership in the annual conference while they are under appointment to a local church or extension ministry. There are several offices of ministry within the United Methodist Church.

Certified lay ministers may also be appointed to serve a church but under the supervision and direction of an elder.

===History===
The first Methodist clergy were ordained by John Wesley, a priest of the Church of England, because of the crisis caused by the American Revolution which isolated the Methodists in the States from the Church of England and its sacraments. Today, the clergy includes men and women who are ordained by bishops as elders and deacons and are appointed to various ministries. Elders in the United Methodist Church itinerate and are subject to the authority and appointment of their bishops. They generally serve as pastors in local congregations. Deacons are in &quot;service&quot; ministry and may serve as musicians, liturgists, educators, business administrators, and a number of other areas. Elders and deacons are required to obtain a master&#x27;s degree (generally an M.Div.), or another equivalent degree, before &quot;commissioning&quot; and then ultimately ordination. Elders in full connection are each a member of their Annual Conference Order of Elders. Likewise each deacon in full connection is a member of their Annual Conference Order of Deacons.

===Ordination of women===

The Methodist Church has allowed ordination of women with full rights of clergy since 1956, when Maud K. Jensen was ordained and admitted into full connection in the Central Pennsylvania Annual Conference. This action was based upon its understanding of biblical principles. The United Methodist Church, along with some other Protestant churches, holds that when the historical contexts involved are understood, a coherent Biblical argument can be made in favor of women&#x27;s ordination. In 1972, Jeanne Audrey Powers became the first woman to be nominated for the office of a bishop in The United Methodist Church.

===Bishop===

All clergy appointments are made and fixed annually by the resident bishop on the advice of the Annual Conference Cabinet, which is composed of the Area Provost/Dean (if one is appointed) and the several district superintendents of the districts of the Annual Conference. Until the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference, no appointments are officially fixed. Many Annual Conferences try to avoid making appointment changes between sessions of Annual Conference. While an appointment is made one year at a time, it is most common for an appointment to be continued for multiple years. Appointment tenures in extension ministries, such as military chaplaincy, campus ministry, missions, higher education and other ministries beyond the local church are often even longer.

===Elder===

Elders are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church. They may be appointed to the local church, or to other valid extension ministries of the church. Elders are given the authority to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments of the church, to provide care and counseling, and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission. Elders may also be appointed to extension ministry to serve as district superintendents, and they are eligible for election to the episcopacy. Elders serve a term of two–three years as provisional elders prior to their ordination.

===Deacon===
Deacons are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to servant leadership within the church.They are ordained to ministries of word, service, compassion, and justice. They may be appointed to ministry within the local church or to an extension ministry that supports the mission of the church. Deacons give leadership, preach the Word, contribute in worship, conduct marriages, bury the dead, and aid the church in embodying its mission within the world. Deacons assist elders in the sacraments of Holy Communion and Baptism, and may be granted sacramental authority if they are appointed as the pastor in a local church or as their extension ministry requires, upon approval of the bishop. Deacons serve a term of 2–3 years as provisional deacons prior to their ordination.

===Provisional clergy===
At the 1996 General Conference, the ordination order of transitional deacon was abolished. This created new orders known as &quot;provisional elder&quot; or &quot;provisional deacon&quot; for those who seek to be ordained in the respective orders. The provisional elder/deacon is a seminary graduate who serves at least two years in full-time appointments after being commissioned. During this period, the provisional elder may be granted sacramental ministry in their local appointment. For the first time in its history non-ordained pastors became a normal expectation, rather than an extraordinary provision for ministry.

===Local pastors===
Local pastors are called by God, affirmed by the church, and appointed by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church. The local pastors are given the authority to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments of the church, to provide care and counseling, and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission, but are not ordained. When elders are not available to be appointed to a local church, either through shortage of personnel or financial hardship of a pastoral charge, the bishop may appoint a &quot;local pastor&quot; to serve the pastoral appointment. Local pastors are often bi-vocational, living out their ministerial call in the local church and in their field of employment. Full-time and part-time licensed local pastors under appointment are clergy and hold membership in the annual conference and not in the local church. A local pastor&#x27;s official title is licensed local pastor and is appointed as clergy to the local church where they preach, conduct divine worship and perform the regular duties of a pastor. The licensed local pastor has the authority of a pastor only within the context and during the time of the appointment and shall not extend beyond it. Local pastors are not required to have advanced degrees but are required to attend licensing school and continue education by attending an approved course of study at an approved United Methodist seminary or course of study school, or enroll in M.Div studies at an approved United Methodist seminary. To continue towards associate membership in the annual conference, they must successfully complete written and oral examinations, and appear before the District Committee on Ministry and the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, as well as meet certain age and service requirements. They also may continue towards ordination if they complete their bachelor&#x27;s degree, requirements of their particular Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, as well as an advanced course or study or prescribed seminary courses at an approved seminary. Upon retirement, or when no longer appointed to a local church, local pastors return to a charge conference as lay members.

==Laity==
There are two classes of lay membership in the UMC: &quot;Baptized Members&quot; and &quot;Professing Members&quot;.

The United Methodist Church (UMC) practices infant and adult baptism. Baptized Members are those who have been baptized as an infant or child, but who have not subsequently professed their own faith. These &quot;Baptized Members&quot; become &quot;Professing Members&quot; through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith. Individuals who were not previously baptized are baptized as part of their profession of faith and thus become &quot;Professing Members&quot; in this manner. Individuals may also become a &quot;Professing Member&quot; through transfer from another Christian denomination.

Unlike confirmation and profession of faith, Baptism is a sacrament in the UMC. The &quot;Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church&quot; directs the local church to offer membership preparation or confirmation classes to all people, including adults. The term confirmation is generally reserved for youth, while some variation on &quot;membership class&quot; is generally used for adults wishing to join the church. The &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; normally allows any youth at least completing sixth grade to participate, although the pastor has discretionary authority to allow a younger person to participate. In confirmation and membership preparation classes, students learn about Church and the Methodist-Christian theological tradition in order to profess their ultimate faith in Christ.

Lay members are extremely important in the UMC. The Professing Members are part of all major decisions in the church. General, Jurisdictional, Central, and Annual Conferences are all required to have an equal number of laity and clergy.

In a local church, many decisions are made by an administrative board or council. This council is made up of laity representing various other organizations within the local church. The elder or local pastor sits on the council as a voting member.

Additionally, Laity may serve the church in several distinct roles including:

===Lay servant===
Another position in the United Methodist Church is that of the lay servant. Although not considered clergy, lay servants often preach during services of worship when an ordained elder, Local Pastor, Associate Member or deacon is unavailable. There are two categories of lay servants: &quot;local church lay servant&quot;, who serve in and through their local churches, and &quot;certified lay servants&quot;, who serve in their own churches, in other churches, and through district or conference projects and programs. To be recognized as local church lay servant,
they must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, and complete the basic course for lay servant. Each year they must reapply, reporting how they have served and continued to learn during that year. To be recognized as certified lay servant, they must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, complete the basic course and one advanced lay servant course, and be interviewed by the District or Conference Committee on Lay Speaking. They must report and reapply annually; and they must complete at least one advanced course every three years.

===Certified lay ministers===
The 2004 General Conference created another class of ministry, the certified lay minister (CLM). CLMs are not considered clergy but instead remain lay members of the United Methodist Church. A Certified Lay Minister (CLM) is a qualified United Methodist layperson called to congregational leadership as part of a ministry team under the supervision an ordained minister. Paragraph 271 in the 2012 Book of Discipline explains Certified Lay Ministry, requirements, and service distinction.

A person wishing to become a CLM enters the certification process, which includes training, support, supervision, and accountability to the District Committee on Ordained Ministry. CLMs are laypeople serving out their call as disciples of Jesus Christ.

==Ecumenical relations==
Methodism is one tradition within the Christian Church. The United Methodist Church is active in ecumenical relations with other Christian groups and denominations. It is a member of the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, Churches Uniting in Christ, and Christian Churches Together. In addition, it voted to seek observer status in the National Association of Evangelicals and in the World Evangelical Fellowship. However, there are some in the United Methodist Church who feel that false ecumenism might result in the &quot;blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity.&quot;

In April 2005, the United Methodist Council of Bishops approved &quot;A Proposal for Interim Eucharistic Sharing.&quot; This document was the first step toward full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). The ELCA approved this same document in August 2005. At the 2008 General Conference, the United Methodist Church approved full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The ELCA approved this document on August 20, 2009, at its annual churchwide assembly.

The United Methodist Church has since 1985 been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American Methodist denominations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. A &quot;Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union&quot; formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger. In May 2012, The United Methodist Church entered into full communion with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church, in which these Churches agreed to &quot;recognize each other&#x27;s churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries.&quot;

There are also a number of churches such as the Evangelical Methodist Church in Argentina, Evangelical Church of Uruguay, and Methodist Church in India (MCI), that are &quot;autonomous affiliated&quot; churches in relation to the United Methodist Church.

The UMC is a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium, which seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today&#x27;s Church, and many United Methodist congregations are members of the Christian Holiness Partnership, with ten percent of local church membership in the Christian Holiness Partnership being from the United Methodist connexion. It is also active in the World Methodist Council, an interdenominational group composed of various churches in the tradition of John Wesley to promote the Gospel throughout the world. On July 18, 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Council voted unanimously to adopt the &quot;Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification&quot;, which was approved in 1999 by the Vatican and the Lutheran World Federation.

==Membership trends==

Like many other mainline Protestant denominations in the United States, the United Methodist Church has experienced significant membership losses in recent decades. At the time of its formation, the UMC had about 11 million members in nearly 42,000 congregations. In 1975, membership dropped below 10 million for the first time. In 2005, there were about 8 million members in over 34,000 congregations. Membership is concentrated primarily in the Midwest and in the South. Texas has the largest number of members, with about 1 million. The states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma, Iowa, Mississippi, West Virginia, and North Carolina.

By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the US and 3.5 million overseas. Significantly, about 20 percent of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10 percent. During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the Methodist Church of the Ivory Coast and its 700,000 members into the denomination. Given current trends in the UMC—with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and US churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week—it has been estimated that Africans will make up at least 30 percent of the delegates at the 2012 General Conference, and it is also possible that 40 percent of the delegates will be from outside the US. One Congolese bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States.

In 2018, outside of the United States, it had 6,464,127 members and 12,866 churches.

In 2020, it had 6,268,310 members and 30,543 churches in the United States.

==Churchwide giving==
Contributions to the local church not only benefit the local congregation, but also have regional, national, and international impact through the United Methodist Church&#x27;s connectional giving system. The power of this collective giving enables the church to educate clergy, encourage cooperation with other faith communions, fund General Conference, nurture historically black colleges and Africa University, and support bishops.

Individuals may also choose to give to the church by naming the Permanent Fund for the United Methodist Church as beneficiary in their estate plans. The Permanent Fund provides a permanent source of funding for the ministries of the United Methodist Church.

<text>The United Paramount Network (UPN) was an American broadcast television network that operated from 1995 to 2006. It was originally a joint venture between Chris-Craft Industries&#x27;s subsidiary, United Television, and Viacom&#x27;s subsidiary, Paramount Television (which produced most of UPN&#x27;s programming), then became solely owned by Viacom in 2000 after subsequently purchasing Chris-Craft&#x27;s remaining stake. On December 31, 2005, UPN was kept by CBS Corporation, which was the new name for Viacom when it split into two separate companies. On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner jointly announced that the companies would shut down UPN and competitor The WB to launch a new joint venture network later that year. UPN ceased broadcasting on September 15, 2006, with The WB following two days later. Select programs from both networks moved to the new network, The CW, when it launched on September 18, 2006.

== History ==
=== 1948–1994: Origins of the network ===
Paramount Pictures had played a pivotal role in the development of network television. It was a partner in the DuMont Television Network, and the Paramount Theaters chain, which was spun off from the corporate/studio parent and merged with ABC in a deal that helped cement that network&#x27;s status as a major network. The Paramount Television Network was launched in 1948, but dissolved in the 1950s.

Paramount had long had plans for its own television network with the Paramount Television Service. Set to launch in early 1978, it would have run its programming for only one night a week. Thirty &quot;Movies of the Week&quot; would have followed &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot; on Saturday nights. Plans for the new network were scrapped when sufficient advertising slots could not be sold, though Paramount would contribute some programs to Operation Prime Time, such as the mini-series &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot;, and the weekly pop music program, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot; was reworked as the theatrical film, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, absorbing the costs already incurred from the aborted television series.

Paramount, and its eventual parent Viacom (which bought the studio&#x27;s then-parent, Paramount Communications, in 1994), continued to consider launching their own television network. Independent stations, even more than network affiliates, were feeling the growing pressure of audience erosion to cable television in the 1980s and 1990s; there were unaffiliated commercial television stations in most of the major television markets, even after the foundation of Fox in 1986. Meanwhile, Paramount, which had long been successful in syndication with repeats of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, launched several first-run syndicated series by the 1990s, including &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

In 1993, Time Warner and Chris-Craft Industries entered into a joint venture to distribute programs via a prime time programming service, the Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN), which is UPN&#x27;s partial parent. Chris-Craft later became a partner in UPN, and Time Warner launched The WB in a joint venture with the Tribune Company at roughly the same time.

=== 1994–1999: Launch and early years ===

Paramount formed the Paramount Stations Group in 1991 when it purchased the assets of the TVX Broadcast Group, which owned several independent stations in major markets. This was not unlike the purchase of the Metromedia stations by News Corporation five years earlier, which were used as the nucleus for Fox. In another parallel, 20th Century Fox (the News Corporation subsidiary behind the Fox network, which was spun off with the company&#x27;s other entertainment assets to 21st Century Fox on June 28, 2013 before Disney acquired them on March 20, 2019), like Paramount, had long been a powerhouse in television syndication. All indicators suggested that Paramount was about to launch a network of its own.

On October 27, 1993, Viacom and Chris-Craft announced the formation of a new television network, later to be named the United Paramount Network, with initial plans to run two hours of programming in prime time for two nights per week. The new network would be co-owned by United &amp; Paramount Television, while most of its shows were to be produced by Paramount Television.

Initially, the network was to simply be called &quot;U&quot;, but the &quot;U Network&quot; trademark was held by the now-defunct National Association of College Broadcasters (NACB), which had been operating a satellite television programming network featuring programs largely produced by college students since 1991. The founder and first head of UPN, Lucie Salhany, approached NACB with an offer of US$50,000 to transfer the name. Due to the costs related to rebranding the student network, and under the advice of its then-volunteer legal counsel, Cary Tepper, the non-profit association countered with a request of $100,000, which Salhany refused. At one point, the network was set to be titled the U/P Network before its current name was decided. Ultimately, the &quot;U&quot; in UPN stood for Chris-Craft subsidiary United Television, which owned the network&#x27;s two largest stations, WWOR-TV in New York City and KCOP-TV in Los Angeles; the &quot;P&quot; represented Paramount Television, the studio that formed a programming partnership with Chris-Craft to create the network. Chris-Craft and Paramount/Viacom each owned independent stations in several large and mid-sized U.S. cities, and these stations formed the nuclei of the new network.

Warner Bros. announced plans to launch a similar network, which would become known as The WB, in close proximity to UPN. The belief that a new broadcast network could grow to be competitive was predicated on the idea that the network in question would not have a fledgling rival to contend with. With the change in landscape, the joint understanding of assured defeat prompted executives from Viacom and Time Warner (at the time, UPN and The WB&#x27;s respective owners, with the latter owning most of The WB) to discuss the prospect of merging the networks together. Both sides reached an agreement on the division of affiliates, but Chris-Craft expressed extreme skepticism and declined to proceed with the merger. A merger would ultimately come in 2006 with the creation of The CW.

UPN launched on January 16, 1995, initially carrying programming only on Monday and Tuesday nights from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The first telecast, the two-hour pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, was an auspicious start, with 21.3 million viewers; however, &quot;Voyager&quot; would neither achieve such viewership levels again, nor would any of the series premiering on UPN&#x27;s second night of broadcasting survive the season. In contrast, The WB debuted one week earlier, on January 11, with four series – only one of which, &quot;Muscle&quot;, would not survive its first season. The first comedy series to premiere on UPN were &quot;Platypus Man&quot;, starring Richard Jeni, and &quot;Pig Sty&quot;, with both shows airing Monday nights in the 9:00 p.m. hour; both received mixed reviews. Neither lasted long. 

Other early UPN programs included the action series &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, starring Bruce Greenwood and &quot;Marker&quot;, starring Richard Grieco; the comic western &quot;Legend&quot; starring Richard Dean Anderson; the sci-fi themed action series, &quot;The Sentinel&quot;; and &quot;Moesha&quot;, a sitcom starring R&amp;B musician Brandy Norwood. Of the network&#x27;s early offerings, only &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot; and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; would last longer than one season. As a result of the lack of viewership, UPN operated on a loss and had lost $800 million by 2000.

Within nearly two years of the network&#x27;s launch, on December 8, 1996, Paramount/Viacom purchased a 50% stake in UPN from Chris-Craft for approximately $160 million. Like Fox had done nine years earlier, UPN started with a few nights of programming each week, with additional nights of primetime shows gradually being added over the course of several seasons. Because of this, UPN&#x27;s affiliates were basically independent stations for all intents and purposes during the network&#x27;s early years, with these stations airing either syndicated programs or movies during primetime on nights when the network did not provide programming. The first expansion of its primetime lineup came with the addition of programming on Wednesday nights on March 6, 1996 (during the second half of the 1995–96 season); that expansion also saw UPN assume the broadcast rights to the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, which aired its inaugural broadcast on CBS the year before.

UPN ordered 36 sci-fi films to air as part of its weekly movie presentations beginning in 1998; the films were supplied by four production companies, with most of the titles coming from Paramount. Some titles would be shown on Showtime first, which allowed the premium cable channel to cooperate in advertising the movies.

UPN completed its prime time expansion in the 1998–99 season, with Thursdays and Fridays as the last nights of programming to be added to the network&#x27;s evening slate. That season saw the debut of &quot;The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer&quot;, a sitcom set during the Civil War that centered on a black English nobleman who becomes the valet to Abraham Lincoln; even before its premiere, the series was riddled by controversy and protests from several African American activist groups (including the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP, who picketed outside Paramount Studios one week before the originally scheduled pilot episode) and some advertisers for its perceived lighthearted take on American slavery in the 19th century. Despite the publicity &quot;Desmond&quot; received from the controversial approach it applied to its topic, the series suffered from low ratings (with the first episode on October 5, 1998, placing 116th out of 125 programs aired that week on network television) and was canceled after four episodes.

=== 1999–2005: Viacom era and decline ===

Six months before Viacom announced its $36 billion merger with (the original) CBS Corporation, in March 1999, Viacom applied a contractual clause that would – within a 45-day grace period – force Chris-Craft to either buy Viacom out of UPN, or have Chris-Craft sell its ownership stake in UPN to Viacom. Three days later on February 8, Chris-Craft subsequently filed a lawsuit against Viacom in the New York Supreme Court to block Viacom&#x27;s merger with CBS, claiming that a pact signed between the two partners in 1997 had prevented either from owning &quot;any interest, financial or otherwise&quot; in &quot;any competing network,&quot; including CBS, for a four-year period through January 2001. On March 17, New York Supreme Court judge Herman Cahn ruled against Chris-Craft&#x27;s move for a permanent injunction to curtail the Viacom-CBS merger and the enforcement of Viacom&#x27;s ultimatum.

Unable to find a suitable partner, on March 20, Chris-Craft allowed Viacom to buy out its 50% stake for $5 million, giving Viacom full control of UPN. This gave UPN the rare distinction of being one of the only broadcast networks to not have had owned-and-operated stations (O&amp;O) in the three largest media markets, New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago (with The WB – the only network that never have had an O&amp;O – being the only other, as minority owner Tribune Broadcasting owned most of its charter affiliates including those in all three markets, while majority owner Time Warner only owned WTBS-TV, an independent station that originated then-superstation TBS). With Viacom taking full ownership control of UPN, KCOP-TV and WWOR-TV lost their statuses as O&amp;Os and automatically became affiliates of UPN, with UPN&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; owned-and-operated flagship stations becoming Philadelphia outlet WPSG (now an independent station) and San Francisco outlet KBHK-TV (now KPYX, also an independent). In addition, neither Chris-Craft or Viacom had ever held ownership of Chicago affiliate WPWR-TV, which had been the largest UPN station that was not owned-and-operated by UPN before the Viacom buyout.

Shortly afterward, Viacom shortened UPN&#x27;s official name from the &quot;United Paramount Network&quot; to the three-letter initialism, &quot;UPN&quot;. Viacom also proposed a rebranding of UPN into the &quot;Paramount Network&quot;, using a prototype logo based on Paramount&#x27;s mountain logo, which served as the basis for the &quot;P&quot; triangle in UPN&#x27;s original logo that was used until September 2002. This idea was abandoned after many affiliates protested, citing that the rebranding might confuse viewers and result in ratings declines, alongside the costs of rebranding their stations with a new image and new network (and possible call sign changes). Several years later, cable television network Spike (part of Viacom) rebranded as Paramount Network.

Viacom&#x27;s purchase of CBS a few months before (which resulted in the merger of that network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations into Viacom&#x27;s Paramount Stations Group unit), created duopolies between CBS and UPN stations in Philadelphia (KYW-TV and WPSG), Boston (WBZ-TV and WSBK-TV), Miami (WFOR-TV and WBFS-TV), Dallas–Fort Worth (KTVT and KTXA), Detroit (WWJ-TV and WKBD-TV), and Pittsburgh (KDKA-TV and WNPA). Viacom&#x27;s purchase of CBS was said to be the &quot;death knell&quot; for the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s longtime ban on television station duopolies. Further transactions added San Francisco (KPIX-TV and KBHK-TV, the latter of which was traded to Viacom/CBS by Fox Television Stations) and Sacramento (KOVR and KMAX-TV, the former of which was sold to Viacom/CBS by the Sinclair Broadcast Group) to the mix.

At the time of UPN&#x27;s launch, the network&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; flagship stations were Chris-Craft-owned WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey (which serves the New York City market) and KCOP-TV in Los Angeles (which serves the Los Angeles market). Even after Chris-Craft sold its share in the network to Viacom, WWOR and KCOP were still commonly regarded as the &quot;de jure&quot; flagship stations of the network since it had long been common practice for this status to be associated with a network&#x27;s station in the East Coast and West Coast. For this reason, some doubt was cast on UPN&#x27;s future after Fox Television Stations bought most of Chris-Craft&#x27;s television stations for $5.5 billion on August 12, 2000, which included several UPN affiliates (including WWOR and KCOP). Fox later bought the third-largest UPN affiliate, Chicago&#x27;s WPWR-TV, through a separate deal with Newsweb Corporation for $450 million in June 2002. Despite the uncertainty of the network&#x27;s future following the Fox purchases, UPN reached four-year affiliation agreements with Fox Television Stations&#x27; nine UPN affiliates on September 24, 2003.

In 2001, UPN entered into a public bidding war to acquire two series from The WB – &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Roswell&quot; – from producing studio 20th Century Fox Television. UPN eventually outbid The WB for the shows and aired them together on Tuesday nights until &quot;Roswell&quot; ended its run in 2002; &quot;Buffy&quot; ended its run the following year. In January 2002, Viacom President and COO, Mel Karmazin restructured UPN, resulting in UPN being taken out of the ownership of Paramount Television, and being placed under the oversight of CBS Television, with CBS President Leslie Moonves being given responsibility for UPN. Under CBS, new shows began to breathe life into UPN starting in Fall 2003 with &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; and sitcom &quot;All of Us&quot; (which was produced by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith), followed up by the Fall 2004 premiere of the mystery series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and the Fall 2005 premiere of the sitcom &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, produced and narrated by Chris Rock.

=== 2005–2006: CBS Corporation era and network closure ===

On June 14, 2005, Viacom announced that it would be split into two companies due to declining performance of the company&#x27;s stock; both the original Viacom – which was renamed CBS Corporation – and a new company that took the Viacom name would be controlled by the original Viacom&#x27;s parent National Amusements (controlled by Sumner Redstone). UPN was kept by CBS Corporation, while the new Viacom took Paramount Pictures among other holdings each company acquired in the deal. The split took effect on January 1, 2006.

On January 24, 2006, UPN parent CBS Corporation and Time Warner, the majority owner of The WB, announced that they would shut down the two respective networks and launch a new broadcast network that would be operated as a joint venture between both companies, The CW, which incorporated UPN and The WB&#x27;s higher-rated programs with newer series produced exclusively for The CW. The new network immediately signed 10-year affiliation agreements with 16 stations affiliated with The WB (out of 19 stations that were affiliated with the network) that were owned by that network&#x27;s part-owner, the Tribune Company – including stations in the coveted markets of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago – and 11 UPN stations that were owned by CBS Corporation. Fox Television Stations&#x27; nine UPN affiliates were passed over for affiliations as a result, and two days later, those stations removed all UPN branding from those stations and ceased promotion of the network&#x27;s programs. One month later on February 22, Fox announced the formation of MyNetworkTV, a new network that would also launch in September 2006 that would use the company&#x27;s soon-to-be former UPN affiliates as the nucleus. Over the next eight months, determinations were made as to which shows from the two networks would cross over to The CW, as well as which of UPN and The WB&#x27;s affiliate stations would be selected to become affiliates of the new network. Programming-wise, six UPN shows – &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; (which was the last surviving series from UPN that remained on The CW&#x27;s schedule until it moved to VH1 in 2016), &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, &quot;All of Us&quot;, and &quot;WWE SmackDown!&quot; – were chosen to move to The CW for its inaugural 2006–07 fall schedule.

With the exception of &quot;WWE SmackDown!&quot;, all of the programs that aired during the network&#x27;s final three months were reruns. Unlike The WB, which closed its operations two days later with &quot;The Night of Favorites and Farewells&quot; (a special night of programming paying tribute to the network&#x27;s most popular series), UPN closed with little to no fanfare on September 15, 2006, fading to black after that night&#x27;s &quot;WWE SmackDown!.&quot; The Fox-owned UPN stations had disaffiliated from the network on August 31; as a result, UPN&#x27;s last two weeks of programming did not air in 10 markets where Fox owned a UPN affiliate that was set to become an owned-and-operated station of MyNetworkTV, when that network launched on September 5, alongside other markets where the local UPN station affiliated with MyNetworkTV or terminated their UPN affiliation during the summer. Shortly after the network&#x27;s closure, UPN&#x27;s website was redirected to The CW&#x27;s website, and then to CBS&#x27;s website.

== Programming ==

At the time of its shutdown, UPN ran only two hours of primetime network programming on Monday through Fridays from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. ET (compared to the three primetime hours on Monday through Saturdays and four hours on Sundays offered by the Big Three networks, ABC, NBC and CBS). UPN never carried any weekend primetime programming throughout the network&#x27;s run (though it did offer children&#x27;s programming on weekend mornings until 2003, and a movie package to its affiliates on weekend afternoons until 2000, when the latter was replaced with a two-hour repeat block of UPN programs); as a result, affiliates held the responsibility of programming their Saturday and Sunday evening schedules with syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week due to special programming, in the 8:00–10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) time period. This primetime scheduling allowed for many of the network&#x27;s affiliates to air local newscasts during the 10:00–11:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) time period.

Most of UPN&#x27;s programming through the years was produced by Paramount Television or a Viacom-owned sister company (Viacom Productions, Big Ticket Television, Spelling Television or CBS Productions). UPN&#x27;s first official program was &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, with the first comedy shows to debut being two short-lived series: the Richard Jeni starring vehicle &quot;Platypus Man&quot; and &quot;Pig Sty&quot;.

Other notable UPN programs during the network&#x27;s existence included &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, the &quot;Moesha&quot; spin-off &quot;The Parkers&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, and the animated adaptation of &quot;Dilbert&quot;. In Summer 2005, UPN aired &quot;R U the Girl&quot;, in which R&amp;B group TLC (not with Left Eye) searched for a woman to join them on a new song. The network also produced some special programs, including 2001&#x27;s &quot;Iron Chef USA&quot;. Much of UPN&#x27;s comedy programming between 1996 and 2006 (particularly those that aired as part of the network&#x27;s Monday evening lineup) was largely aimed at African American audiences, with minor exceptions in shows such as &quot;Clueless&quot;, &quot;Realitycheck&quot; and &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;.

UPN occasionally acquired series canceled by the other broadcast networks, including former WB series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Roswell&quot; (both of which moved to UPN in 2001, &quot;Buffy&quot; was picked up after The WB chose not to renew it due to issues with license fees while &quot;Roswell&quot; joined UPN after that same network also canceled the series), and former ABC series &quot;Clueless&quot; and &quot;The Hughleys&quot;. The first program that UPN acquired from another network was &quot;In the House&quot;, which moved to the network from NBC (which canceled the LL Cool J sitcom after its second season) in 1996. In its later years, as part of the network&#x27;s desire to maintain its own identity with its own unique shows, UPN instituted a policy of &quot;not picking up other networks&#x27; scraps&quot;, which was a strong argument when fan pressure was generated in 2004 for them to pick up &quot;Angel&quot;, the spin-off of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; which had been dropped from The WB.

UPN aired only one regular sports event program: the much-hyped XFL in 2001, airing Sunday evening games as part of a package from co-creator and WWE founder Vince McMahon, which also included what was then &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, and the only time the network carried programming officially outside of weeknights. UPN had planned to air a second season of the XFL in 2002, but it also demanded that &quot;SmackDown!&quot; be reduced by 30 minutes; McMahon did not agree to the change and the football league folded not long afterward.

=== News programming ===
Like Fox and The WB, UPN never aired national morning or evening newscasts; however, several of its affiliates and owned-and-operated stations did produce their own local news programs. Several UPN affiliates ran a local newscast in the 10:00–11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific (9:00–10:00 p.m. Central and Mountain Time) timeslot at some point during or throughout their affiliations with the network; there were also a few stations that produced a weekday morning newscast, although early evening newscasts were largely absent on most of these stations. The UPN affiliate body had fewer news-producing stations in comparison to stations aligned with the Big Three television networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) and considerably fewer than Fox and especially The WB. In several markets, the local UPN affiliate either outsourced news programming to an NBC, ABC or CBS station in the market (either due to insufficient funds or studio space for production of their own newscasts, or in later years after the FCC permitted duopolies in markets with at least eight unique station owners in 2000, the station being operated through a legal duopoly or management agreement with a major network affiliate); other affiliates opted to carry syndicated programming in the hour following UPN&#x27;s primetime programming lineup. For example, one of the largest O&amp;O UPN affiliates in the country, WPWR-TV, never aired news programming in its 11-year run. This is mainly due to Viacom and Chris Craft&#x27;s non-affiliation with the Chicago station.

When the network launched in January 1995, UPN automatically added six affiliates with functioning news departments through Chris-Craft/United Television and Viacom&#x27;s respective affiliation deals with the network; all of those stations started their news operations as either independent stations or during prior affiliations with other networks: WWOR-TV/Secaucus, New Jersey (New York City), KCOP-TV/Los Angeles, WKBD-TV/Detroit, KPTV/Portland, Oregon, KMSP-TV/Minneapolis and WTOG/Tampa, Florida. Two more stations would join them later on: KSTW/Seattle, also owned by Viacom at the time, after it affiliated with UPN in 1997 through the reversal of a 1995 affiliation switch with CBS affiliate KIRO-TV (which also kept its news department as a UPN affiliate), and KMAX-TV/Sacramento, which joined UPN after being acquired by Viacom in 1998 and began producing newscasts shortly after its 1995 affiliation with The WB. KSTW and WTOG&#x27;s news departments were shut down in 1998 due to cost-cutting measures mandated by Viacom; newscasts would briefly return to KSTW via a news sharing agreement with KIRO-TV between 2003 and 2005.

Not all of UPN&#x27;s news-producing stations were owned by the two companies that formed the nuclei of the network&#x27;s affiliate group; WUAB/Cleveland, which started its news department in 1988, also continued its 10:00 p.m. newscast as a UPN affiliate (it would begin producing newscasts for sister station WOIO-TV in February 1995, after that station became a CBS affiliate; though WOIO eventually took over production of the newscast by 2002). Harrisburg affiliate WLYH-TV briefly continued its newscasts after switching to UPN from CBS in 1995, until WHP-TV began operating the station under a local marketing agreement that fall. WFTC/Minneapolis continued to produce a late evening newscast after Fox Television Stations (which acquired KMSP-TV through the Chris-Craft purchase, and converted it into a Fox O&amp;O) acquired the station from Clear Channel Communications and switched the station to UPN – it was moved to 10:00 p.m. to avoid competing with KMSP&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. newscast until the WFTC newscast was canceled in June 2006.

With the exception of KPTV and KMSP, both of which are now Fox stations, none of the former UPN affiliates that produced newscasts during their affiliation with the network continue to maintain an independent news department – despite license requirements imposed by the station&#x27;s 1983 transfer of its license to Secaucus, New Jersey from New York City to cover New Jersey issues, WWOR-TV, which continued to produce news programming after coming under common ownership with Fox O&amp;O WNYW, shut down its news department in July 2013 and replaced its lone 10:00 p.m. newscast with an outside produced program called &quot;Chasing New Jersey&quot;, a move that resulted in calls by state politicians for the FCC to revoke Fox&#x27;s license to operate the station. KTTV took over production of sister station KCOP&#x27;s newscasts in 2007, before discontinuing news programming on that station in 2013. KMAX&#x27;s news department has since been merged with that of KOVR although it still produces a morning newscast separate from that station. WKBD shut down its news department (which was later shared with WWJ-TV) in December 2002, with its 10:00 p.m. newscast continuing to be produced by ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV until its eventual cancellation in 2005. CBS re-launched a news operation for both WWJ and WKBD under the umbrella title of &quot;CBS News Detroit&quot; in January 2023.

=== Children&#x27;s programming ===

When the network launched in January 1995, UPN introduced a weekend morning cartoon block called &quot;UPN Kids&quot; (later called &quot;The UPN Kids Action Zone&quot; during the 1998–99 season). In 1997, UPN added two teen-oriented series to the lineup with reruns of the syndicated &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; (based on the young adult book series by Francine Pascal) and a new series, &quot;Breaker High&quot; (which co-starred a then-unknown Ryan Gosling); both shows filled the weekday morning block for the 1997–98 season, while they were also included alongside the animated series on Sunday mornings. Unlike other networks, UPN gave its affiliates the option of running its weekend children&#x27;s program block on either Saturdays or Sundays. In January 1998, the network entered into a deal with Saban Entertainment to program the Sunday morning block (with shows such as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; joining the lineup).

There were rumors that UPN then entered into discussions with then-corporate sister Nickelodeon (both networks were owned by Viacom) to produce a new block.

In 1999, UPN contracted the rights to the network&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming lineup to The Walt Disney Company; as a result, the teen-oriented and animated series were replaced with a new block called &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot;, which debuted on September 6, 1999, and featured select programs seen on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning&quot; lineup (such as &quot;Recess&quot; and &quot;&quot;). Many UPN affiliates at the network&#x27;s launch were already airing The Disney Afternoon, a block supplied by Disney-owned syndication distributor Buena Vista Television; however, that block would be discontinued in August 1997. The addition of &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot; expanded UPN&#x27;s children&#x27;s program block back to two hours, running on Sunday mornings and weekday afternoons. In September 2002, &quot;&quot; moved to UPN from Fox Kids, due to Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s program inventory as well as the Fox Family Channel, which was renamed ABC Family (now Freeform) the past year. At the same time, the &quot;One Too&quot; branding was dropped from on-air usage due to the rebranding of ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup from &quot;One Saturday Morning&quot; to &quot;ABC Kids&quot; (although the block was unofficially referred to as &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animation Weekdays&quot; outside the network). UPN subsequently chose not to renew its contract with Disney, with the network dropping all children&#x27;s programming after August 31, 2003. This left UPN as one of only two major broadcast networks that did not air a children&#x27;s programming block, the other being Pax TV, which discontinued its &quot;Pax Kids&quot; lineup in 2000, before returning children&#x27;s programming as Ion Television through the 2006 launch of Qubo (as a 24/7 network, it was pulled off the air in 2021). Incidentally, UPN&#x27;s successor The CW carried over the Kids&#x27; WB Saturday morning lineup from fellow predecessor The WB, resulting in UPN affiliates that joined The CW in September 2006 carrying network-supplied children&#x27;s programming for the first time since the &quot;One Too&quot; block ended.

Some Fox stations that declined to carry 4Kids TV passed on that block to an affiliate of UPN or The WB, or an independent station, in order for the Fox affiliate to air general entertainment programming or local newscasts on Saturday mornings (for example, WFLD in Chicago moved the 4Kids TV schedule to co-owned then-UPN affiliate WPWR-TV, while WFLD aired infomercials).

=== Television films ===

During the late 1990s, UPN produced a number of television films under the umbrella brand &quot;Blockbuster Shockwave Cinema&quot;, in conjunction with sponsor (and then-sister company) Blockbuster Video, almost all of which were sci-fi films.

From UPN&#x27;s inception until 2000, the network also offered a hosted movie series called the &quot;UPN Movie Trailer&quot; to its stations. The weekend block featured mostly older theatrically released action and comedy films, often those from the Paramount film library. The &quot;Movie Trailer&quot; block was discontinued in 2000 to give stations that opted for them room for a two-hour block of select UPN series that aired in primetime during the past week. There were also three Paramount-branded blocks that aired on Viacom&#x27;s UPN owned-and-operated stations between 1995 and 2000: the &quot;Paramount Teleplex&quot; as the main brand for movies at any given timeslot, the &quot;Paramount Prime Movie&quot; for primetime features, and the &quot;Paramount Late Movie&quot; for films airing in late night timeslots. From 2002 to 2006, UPN offered a movie block (airing on Saturdays or Sundays depending on the affiliates) called &quot;Hot Weekend Movie&quot;, which carried movies (theatrical, made-for-TV and direct-to-video) from the Metro-Goldwyn Mayer library.

== Affiliates ==

UPN had approximately 143 full-power owned-and-operated or primary affiliate stations in the United States, and another 65 stations aired some UPN programming as secondary affiliates. Although it was considered a major network by Nielsen for ratings purposes, UPN was not available in every American television market. In some areas, UPN programming was shown off-pattern by affiliates of other networks (airing immediately after programming from their primary network on some Fox and WB stations, or during overnight timeslots on major network affiliates) or by otherwise independent stations, such as in the case of KIKU-TV in Honolulu, Hawaii. Some affiliates were also known to extensively preempt network programming in order to broadcast local sporting events.

By 2003, UPN had an estimated audience reach of 85.98% of all U.S. households (equivalent to 91,689,290 households with at least one television set). In contrast, The WB was viewable in 91.66% of all U.S. television homes. This is mainly because UPN did not have wide distribution in areas ranked below the top 100 Nielsen-designated media markets, whereas The WB operated The WB 100+ Station Group – a cable-only station group that was launched by the network in September 1998 – to provide broad coverage to those markets (from January 1995 to October 1999, The WB&#x27;s programming was carried over the superstation feed of the network&#x27;s Chicago affiliate WGN-TV through a programming agreement with its owner Tribune Broadcasting). Despite the fact that UPN would not be able to have extensive small-market coverage at launch due to a lack of commercial television stations in those areas, Paramount Television denied Advance Entertainment Corporation permission from distributing the network&#x27;s programming over the WWOR EMI Service, the superstation feed of New York City affiliate WWOR-TV, preventing the network from reaching markets without an exclusive or secondary UPN affiliate. The network proposed launching a cable-originated service to increase its distribution to markets without an over-the-air affiliate in July 1998; however, the service, which was to have been named UPN Plus, ultimately never launched. UPN did have one cable-only affiliate in its station form, WNFM-TV in Fort Myers, Florida, which joined the network in 1998.

In markets where Viacom had a CBS/UPN duopoly after its 2000 merger with CBS, the UPN station was used to air CBS network programs if local sporting events or extended breaking news coverage would air on the CBS station, sometimes resulting in UPN programs being pre-empted outright, as the CBS-owned outlets were usually the senior partner in the duopolies (an exception being Detroit, where WKBD-TV is considered the senior partner to WWJ-TV due to WKBD being longer-established). One such event occurred on September 26, 2004, when Hurricane Jeanne forced a scheduled NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins in Miami to be postponed from its scheduled start time of 1:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. ET; the game aired locally on KDKA-TV and WFOR-TV while their respective UPN sister stations, WNPA-TV and WBFS-TV, aired CBS&#x27;s regular Sunday night programming instead.

These factors led to the network struggling in the ratings over much of UPN&#x27;s existence, with its later &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, perhaps suffering the most and ultimately being canceled by the network in a controversial decision in February 2005. The most consistent ratings performer for the network was &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot;. During the 2004–2005 season, the network was getting consistently better ratings than The WB, much of this thanks to its carriage of the WWE.

=== Station standardization ===
When the network launched, UPN began having most of its stations branded using a combination of &quot;UPN&quot; or &quot;Paramount&quot; (the latter having been used only by the network&#x27;s Viacom-owned stations, some of whom adopted the &quot;Paramount&quot; branding prior to UPN&#x27;s launch), and the affiliated station&#x27;s channel number. By the late 1990s, affiliates were simply branded under the &quot;UPN (channel number or city)&quot; scheme (for example, Chicago affiliate WPWR-TV called itself &quot;UPN Chicago&quot; and New York City O&amp;O-turned-affiliate WWOR-TV was referred to as &quot;UPN 9&quot;, until The CW&#x27;s launch was announced in January 2006).

However, most of the UPN owned-and-operated stations under Viacom/CBS Corporation branded themselves by the network/city conventions (for example, KBHK-TV/San Francisco was branded as &quot;UPN Bay Area&quot;, WKBD/Detroit was branded as &quot;UPN Detroit&quot;, WUPA was branded as &quot;UPN Atlanta&quot; and WUPL/New Orleans was branded as &quot;UPN New Orleans&quot;). That type of branding did not always apply though, as for example, WSBK-TV/Boston was branded &quot;UPN 38&quot; and KMAX-TV/Sacramento was branded &quot;UPN 31&quot;. WNPA/Pittsburgh originally branded itself as &quot;UPN 19&quot;, but rebranded itself as &quot;UPN Pittsburgh&quot; soon after the network introduced its second and final logo in September 2002, making it one of the few that had carried both standardization styles. Many UPN-affiliated stations followed the same branding scheme (for example, KFVE/Honolulu used the brand &quot;UPN Hawaii&quot;).

This would be a continuation of the trend of networks using such naming schemes, which originated at Fox (and even earlier by the Canadian CBC), and was also predominately used at CBS (which has most of its owned-and-operated stations, with a few exceptions, brand using a combination of the network&#x27;s name and over-the-air channel number) and The WB (with the exception of its Tribune Broadcasting-owned affiliates in Los Angeles and Chicago, and certain other stations); NBC and ABC also use similar branding schemes, but not to the same broad level outside their O&amp;Os. While the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks do not require their affiliates to have such naming schemes (though some affiliates choose to adopt it anyway) and only on the network&#x27;s O&amp;Os is the style required, UPN mandated it on all stations – though in one case, Milwaukee affiliate WCGV branded as &quot;Channel 24&quot; from 1998 to 2001, excluding UPN imagery from its station branding (WCGV, which previously branded as &quot;UPN 24&quot;, had disaffiliated from the network for eight months in 1998 due to a compensation dispute; it received a rare waiver from the network to air a marathon of the last half of season four of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; which it had not aired in August 1998, before the fifth season&#x27;s premiere in September.).

One Chris-Craft/United Television-owned station, KMSP-TV in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, only branded as &quot;UPN 9&quot; for its entertainment and network programming. Due to the station&#x27;s circumstances of holding full cable carriage across the state of Minnesota and into The Dakotas as a superstation, local management preferred to retain their pre-UPN &quot;Minnesota 9&quot; branding in some manner, as most of the UPN schedule was of low appeal to the station&#x27;s rural viewers, and it was building a successful and competitive news department that did not depend on the success or failure of UPN. KMSP&#x27;s news division success despite UPN affiliation was one of the pushes for Fox Television Stations to acquire United Television overall, then convert KMSP-TV to a Fox owned-and-operated station in Fall 2002. The UPN affiliation thus moved to new sister station WFTC, which followed all UPN branding guidelines until Fox pulled their support for the network in January 2006.

<doc id="32307" wikidata="Q174769" url="?curid=32307" title="United Airlines">
<text>United Airlines, Inc. is a major airline in the United States headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. United operates an extensive domestic and international route network across the United States and six continents with more destinations than any airline. Regional service operated by independent carriers under the brand name United Express feeds its seven U. S. hubs and the Star Alliance, of which United was one of the five founding airlines, extends its network throughout the world.

United was formed by the amalgamation of several airlines beginning in the late 1920s, the oldest of these being Varney Air Lines, created in 1926 by Walter Varney who later co-founded the predecessor to Continental Airlines. United has ranked among the largest airlines in the world since its founding, often as a result of mergers and acquisitions.

== History ==

United Airlines was the creation of aviation pioneer William Boeing, who started in the airplane business in 1916. His Boeing Airplane Company achieved the first international postal delivery in 1919, and he went on to establish Boeing Air Transport in 1927. In 1928 his company acquired mail and passenger service operator, Pacific Air Transport, and was renamed the Boeing Airplane &amp; Transport Corporation. In early 1929 the name was changed again to United Aircraft &amp; Transport Corporation (UATC) and merged with Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. UATC acquired America&#x27;s first scheduled passenger services carrier, Stout Air Services, on April 29, 1929, the nation&#x27;s first scheduled service (mail only) operator Varney Air Lines in early 1930, and finally National Air Transport (a large Chicago-based mail-only carrier) on May 7, 1930. On March 28, 1931, UATC formed United Air Lines, Inc. to manage its airline subsidiaries.

Varney Air Lines was founded by Walter Varney who ended up playing an interesting role in both aviation and United&#x27;s history. Varney flew the first contract air mail flight in a Swallow biplane from their Boise headquarters to the railroad mail hub at Pasco, Washington on April 6, 1926. And Continental Airlines is the successor to Speed Lines, which Varney also founded by 1932 and whose name changed to Varney Speed Lines in 1934.

Following the Air Mail scandal of 1930, the Air Mail Act of 1934 banned the common ownership of manufacturers and airlines. UATC&#x27;s President Philip G. Johnson was forced to resign and moved to Trans-Canada Airlines, the future Air Canada. UATC was broken into three separate companies. UATC&#x27;s manufacturing interests east of the Mississippi River became United Aircraft (the future United Technologies), while its manufacturing interests west of the Mississippi became Boeing Airplane Company. The airline interests became United Air Lines. The airline company&#x27;s new president, hired to make a fresh start as airmail contracts were re-awarded in 1934, was William A. Patterson, who remained as president until 1963.

In 1961, United Airlines completed its merger with Capital Airlines absorbing 7,000 employees and all of Capital’s routes and aircraft to become the world’s largest commercial airline. 

On February 11, 1986 United Airlines began service to 13 Pacific cities after the purchase of Pan American World Airways’ Pacific Division for $715 million. After experiencing continued financial losses, Pan Am sold its London Heathrow slots to United for $290 million in October of 1990. On December 9, 1991, Pan American ceased operations after 64 years. United Airlines acquired its Latin American operations for $135 million.

In December 2002, due largely to the post-9/11 drop-off in air travel, a failed merger attempt with US Airways and poor relations between the corporation and its employees, United Airlines filed for bankruptcy. It remained under court protection for more than three years enabling it to cut costs ruthlessly. Finally, in early 2006, it emerged from court protection.

In late 2006, Continental Airlines and United began merger discussions, which concluded successfully after a second try in 2010. The merged airline began operating under a single air operator&#x27;s certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration on November 30, 2011. On March 3, 2012, United and Continental merged their passenger service systems, frequent-flier programs, and websites, which virtually eliminated the Continental brand with the exception of its logo. On June 27, 2019, the parent company&#x27;s name changed from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings.

United Polaris is the airline&#x27;s international business class product. The Polaris seat converts into a flatbed and has multiple storage areas, multiple charging ports, lumbar support, and improved dining and amenities.

Polaris seats can be found on all Boeing 757-200s, 767s, 777-300ERs, 787s, and internationally configured 777-200ERs. On the 757s, Polaris is configured in a 2-2 seat configuration, so window passengers do not have direct aisle access. On widebody aircraft, the cabins are configured to provide aisle access to every passenger, with 767s featuring a 1-1-1 seat configuration while 777s and 787s have a 1-2-1 seat configuration.

Polaris passengers can check in at separate counters and use priority security screening lanes where available.

Passengers receive priority boarding and baggage handling, free alcoholic beverages, complimentary meals on longer flights and may use separate check-in desks.

In 2015, United introduced its new domestic first-class seat design. The new leather seats feature cradling headrests, granite cocktail tables, and a tablet stand. These seats debuted on Airbus A320 family aircraft and were eventually rolled out on all domestic aircraft.

In 2019, it was announced that United was increasing first and business class seats &quot;by 1,600&quot; across all their aircraft in their fleet, in part by introducing the Bombardier CRJ550, a premium-heavy 50-seat regional jet, for which United is the launch customer of.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Ownership and structure ===
United Airlines, Inc., is publicly traded through its parent company, United Airlines Holdings, Inc., which is a Delaware corporation, on the , with a market capitalization of over US$35 billion as of January 2025. United&#x27;s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of the holding company&#x27;s revenues and operating expenses.

=== Headquarters and other facilities ===
United Airlines headquarters are located at the Willis Tower, 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois.

In 2007, United had moved its headquarters from Elk Grove Township, a suburb of Chicago, to 77 West Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop after receiving US$5.5 million in incentives from the City of Chicago.
Then in 2010, United accepted the City of Chicago&#x27;s offer of US$35 million in incentives, including a US$10 million grant, for United to move its remaining 2,500 employees out of Elk Grove Township to the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in the Chicago Loop. On May 31, 2012, United opened its operations center, which occupied twelve floors there.
In 2019 United renewed its lease at Willis Tower, originally ending in 2028 and now set to expire in 2033, and plans to construct a roof deck and a dining hall on the fourth floor.

The former headquarters campus at Elk Grove Township was gradually annexed into the Village of Mount Prospect, and serves as an IT operations facility, with a new data center constructed in 2013.

United maintains a large presence in downtown Houston, having leased of space (seven floors) for occupancy in 2017.

United has training facilities for its flight crews in Denver and Houston, a major aircraft maintenance center in San Francisco, and call centers in Houston and Chicago.

=== Corporate identity ===
==== Brand image ====

The pre-merger United logo, commonly nicknamed the &quot;tulip&quot;, was developed in the early 1970s by the designer Saul Bass as part of a new brand image. The logo represented the airline&#x27;s monogram as well as a modernized version of the airline&#x27;s shield logo which had been adopted in the 1930s, but fell out of use by the late 1960s. The ribbon-like rendering has also been said to symbolize the motion of flight. In 2010, United announced they would be merging with Continental Airlines and as a result, the combined airline would keep the United name but discontinue using the tulip logo and use the Continental Airlines &quot;globe&quot; identity and livery instead, designed in 1991 by the Lippincott company.

==== Marketing themes ====

United&#x27;s earliest slogan, &quot;The Main Line Airway&quot;, emphasized its signature New York-Chicago-San Francisco route, and was replaced in 1965 with &quot;Fly the Friendly Skies&quot;, which was in use until 1996 in its first iteration. The &quot;It&#x27;s time to fly&quot; slogan was created in 2004. After the merger of United and Continental in October 2010, the slogan changed to &quot;Let&#x27;s fly together&quot; until September 2013, when United announced a return of the &quot;Fly the Friendly Skies&quot; slogan in an ad campaign to start the following day. The resurrected slogan would be accompanied by the 1924 George Gershwin song &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; as its theme song, and a voiceover provided by Matt Damon.

United had licensed its theme song, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, from Gershwin&#x27;s estate for in 1976. &quot;Rhapsody&quot; would have entered the public domain in 2000, but the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 extended its copyright another 20 years until January 1, 2020, when it officially entered on the Public Domain.
United announced that it would continue to use &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; as its theme song following the merger with Continental.

=== Environmental initiatives ===
Because over 98 percent of United&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions are from jet fuel, its environmental strategy has focused on operational fuel efficiency initiatives and investments in sustainably produced, low-carbon alternative fuels.

On August 23, 2011, United Continental Holdings, Inc., announced a conversion to paperless flight decks and projected that by the end of the year, 11,000 iPads will have been deployed to all United and Continental pilots. Each iPad, which weighs less than , will replace approximately of paper operating manuals, navigation charts, reference handbooks, flight checklists, logbooks, and weather information. The green benefits include reductions in paper use, printing, and fuel consumption. The shift to a paperless system not only streamlines the flight process but also significantly enhances operational efficiency by ensuring pilots have the most up-to-date information readily available.

On November 7, 2011, United flew the world&#x27;s first commercial aviation flight on a microbially-derived biofuel. The aircraft was fueled with 40 percent Solajet, which is Solazyme&#x27;s algae-derived renewable jet fuel, and 60 percent petroleum-derived jet fuel. This flight was operated by the Eco-Skies Boeing 737-800 aircraft from Houston to Chicago-O&#x27;Hare.

On January 15, 2013, Aviation Partners Boeing (APB), a joint venture between Aviation Partners Inc. and Boeing, announced that United had agreed to replace the Blended Winglets on its Boeing Next Generation 737 aircraft with APB&#x27;s Split Scimitar Winglet (SSW), significantly reducing drag. Once the SSWs are installed, it is estimated that APB&#x27;s winglet technology will save United more than $250 million annually in fuel costs.

On June 30, 2015, United invested US$30 million in Fulcrum BioEnergy, an alternative fuel company. Fulcrum&#x27;s alternative fuel is produced through a clean and efficient thermochemical process and reduces lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80 percent. As part of its investment, United will work with Fulcrum to develop up to five alternative fuel refineries near its U.S. hubs. These refineries will produce up to of sustainable aviation alternative fuel per year, and United will have the opportunity to purchase at least per year for a minimum of 10 years, making it the largest aviation alternative fuel commitment to date.

On March 11, 2016, United became the first airline in the world to fly on commercial-scale quantities of such fuels on a continuous basis, which were procured from AltAir Fuels. This fuel was produced from sustainable feedstocks such as non-edible natural oils and agricultural wastes and is expected to provide a greater than 60 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions on a lifecycle basis when compared to traditional jet fuel. United has agreed to purchase up to of sustainable alternative fuel from AltAir Fuels for use in Los Angeles over a three-year period.

In 2016, United began partnering with Clean the World to repurpose items from the airline&#x27;s international premium class amenity kits and donate the hygiene products to those in critical need. Clean the World provides hygiene education and soap to promote handwashing, which helps prevent hygiene-related deaths. During the first year of this partnership, United expected to divert of material that otherwise would have gone to landfills.

In 2017 United started a partnership with Audubon International to protect raptors—including hawks, ospreys and owls—in and around New York-area airports and resettle the birds-of-prey at suitable golf course habitats where the species are more likely to thrive.

=== Employee relations ===
United Airlines was the first airline to see a successful unionization of flight attendants when the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) was founded in 1945 by five United Airlines flight attendants. The AFA has represented flight attendants from United Airlines since. Their contract became amendable in August of 2021 and 99.9% of the flight attendants who voted were in favor of authorizing a strike on August 28, 2024.

United Airlines maintenance technicians are represented by the International International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Their contract became amendable on December 5, 2024.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 141 represents approximately 34,000 Fleet Service, Passenger Service, Reservations, Stockroom, Central Load Planner, Maintenance Instructor, Fleet Technical Instructor, Emergency Procedures Instructor and Security Officer workers. Their contract becomes amendable on May 1, 2025.

With over 17,500 members the United Airlines pilots are the largest pilot group in the world and represented by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). ALPA was founded by United Air Lines Captain David L. Behncke and 23 other key figures in Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1931. In the 1930s, flying was a perilous occupation; thus, from the time of its formation to today, one of ALPA&#x27;s main goals is to improve air safety. The United pilots&#x27; current contract becomes amendable on September 30, 2027.

== Controversies and passenger incidents ==
=== Flight 976 ===

United Airlines Flight 976 was a regularly scheduled flight from Ministro Pistarini International Airport, Buenos Aires to John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City on October 19, 1995. Prior to takeoff, an investment banker became disruptive after consuming two glasses of champagne, began threatening crew members and attempted to pour his own drinks, against airline and federal regulations. After takeoff, the banker was served two more glasses of red wine, after which the crew refused to serve him more alcohol due to his apparent intoxication. When his requests for more alcohol were denied, he pushed over a female flight attendant, climbed onto a service trolley, took off his pants and defecated, used linen napkins as toilet paper, wiped his hands on various service counters and tracked feces throughout the aircraft, after which he entered a lavatory and locked himself in.
A request to divert to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was denied due to the security risks created by the presence of the President of Portugal Mário Soares, Argentinian foreign minister Guido di Tella and their security details on the flight. The disruptive passenger was arrested by the FBI after landing in New York and charged with interfering with a flight crew and threatening a flight attendant. He later pleaded guilty to the latter charge and was fined $5,000 (having previously agreed to reimburse the airline for its cleanup costs and all the other passengers their airfare, which amounted to nearly $50,000) and given two years&#x27; probation. The incident was later dubbed the worst ever case of air rage.

=== Animal transport ===
In 2013, after pressure from PETA, United announced that it would no longer transport monkeys to laboratories. United was the last North American passenger airline to transport these animals to laboratories. United flies more animals and has longer flight stage length than any other US airline, and accounted for one third of animal deaths of US airlines between 2012 and 2017.

Effective March 20, 2018, the PetSafe program was suspended with no new reservations for cargo transport of pets accepted. This came after United announced plans to mark pet carriers in the passenger cabin with bright tags and legislation was introduced in the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate banning the placement of pets in overhead compartments. This was in response to a dog death after a passenger placed it in the overhead compartment following flight attendant instructions, but the flight attendant denied knowing that the luggage contained a dog.

=== Cyber security issues ===
United awarded airline miles as &quot;bug bounties&quot; to hackers who could identify gaps in the carrier&#x27;s web security. Two hackers have each been rewarded with 1 million miles of air travel as of July 15, 2015. This cybersecurity program was announced a few weeks after the company experienced two software glitches. The first incident delayed 150 United flights on June 2 due to a problem with its flight dispatching system. Six days later, United&#x27;s reservation system delayed flights by not allowing passengers to check-in. In addition to the &quot;bug bounty&quot; program, United said it tests systems internally and engages cybersecurity firms.

In July 2019, security researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii, involving clickstream data provider DDMR and marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics (NA). NA granted its members access to real-time data, including the ability to observe United Airlines passengers checking into their flights through the United website. The Washington Post highlighted how DataSpii resulted in the dissemination United passenger information including last names and flight confirmation numbers. The disseminated data also enabled the viewing of United customers&#x27; current geographic locations as they checked into their flights via the United website. DataSpii harvested data from millions of Chrome and Firefox users through compromised browser extensions, exploiting United&#x27;s method of embedding personally identifiable information (PII) directly within the URLs. Jadali&#x27;s investigation revealed that DDMR facilitated rapid dissemination of this data to additional third parties, often within minutes of acquisition, endangering the privacy of the sensitive data collected.

=== 2017 passenger removal ===
On the evening of April 9, 2017, a passenger was forcibly removed by law enforcement from United Airlines flight 3411 at Chicago-O&#x27;Hare, bound for Louisville. United announced that it needed four seats for airline staff on the sold-out flight. When no passengers volunteered after being offered vouchers worth $800, United staff selected four passengers to leave. Three of them did so, but the fourth, a doctor named David Dao, declined as he said that he had patients to treat the following morning. He was pulled from his seat by Chicago Department of Aviation security officers and dragged by his arms down the aisle. Dao sustained a concussion, broken teeth and a broken nose among other injuries. The incident was captured on smartphone cameras and posted on social media, triggering angry public backlash. Afterwards, United&#x27;s then-chief executive officer, Oscar Munoz, described Dao as &quot;disruptive and belligerent&quot;, apologized for &quot;re-accommodating&quot; the paying customers, and defended and praised staff for &quot;following established procedures&quot;. He was widely criticized as &quot;tone-deaf&quot;. Munoz later issued a second statement calling what happened a &quot;truly horrific event&quot; and accepting &quot;full responsibility&quot; for it. After a lawsuit, Dao reached an undisclosed settlement with United and airport police. In the aftermath, United&#x27;s board of directors decided that Munoz would not become its chairman and that executive compensation would be tied to customer satisfaction. Following this incident, passenger complaints increased by 70 percent.

=== Mail-scan fraud ===
In February 2021, United Airlines was fined $49 million by the United States Department of Justice on charges of fraud on postal service contracts for transportation of international mail. According to investigators, between 2012 and 2015 United submitted delivery scan data to make it appear that United and its partner airlines complied with International Commercial Air requirements with accurate delivery times when in fact they were automated delivery scans with aspirational delivery time. Some employees within United worked to hide this fact from the United States Postal Service.

<text>United States customary units form a system of measurement units commonly used in the United States and most U.S. territories since being standardized and adopted in 1832. The United States customary system developed from English units that were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country. The United Kingdom&#x27;s system of measures evolved by 1824 to create the imperial system (with imperial units), which was officially adopted in 1826, changing the definitions of some of its units. Consequently, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their imperial counterparts, there are noticeable differences between the systems.

The majority of U.S. customary units were redefined in terms of the meter and kilogram with the Mendenhall Order of 1893 and, in practice, for many years before. These definitions were refined by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959.

The United States uses customary units in commercial activities, as well as for personal and social use. In science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some government and military areas, metric units are used. The International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system, is preferred for many uses by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). For newer types of measurement where there is no traditional customary unit, international units are used, sometimes mixed with customary units: for example, electrical resistance of wire expressed in ohms (SI) per thousand feet.

==History==
The United States customary system of units of 1832 is based on the system in use in the United Kingdom prior to the introduction to the British imperial system on January 1, 1826. Both systems are derived from English units, an older system of units which had evolved over the millennia before American independence, and which had its roots in both Roman and Anglo-Saxon units.

The customary system was championed by the U.S.-based International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures in the late 19th century. Some advocates of the customary system saw the French Revolutionary, or metric, system as atheistic. The president of an Ohio auxiliary of the Institute wrote that the traditional units were &quot;a just weight and a just measure, which alone are acceptable to the Lord&quot;. His organization later went so far as to publish music for a song proclaiming &quot;down with every &#x27;metric&#x27; scheme&quot;.

The U.S. government passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which made the metric system &quot;the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce&quot;. The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry as it &quot;voluntarily&quot; converts to the metric system, i.e., metrification. This is most evident in U.S. labeling requirements on food products, where SI units are almost always presented alongside customary units. According to the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, the United States is one of three nations (along with Liberia and Myanmar (Burma)) that have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures.

, signed by President George H. W. Bush on July 25, 1991, citing the Metric Conversion Act, directed departments and agencies within the executive branch of the United States Government to &quot;take all appropriate measures within their authority&quot; to use the metric system &quot;as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce&quot; and authorized the Secretary of Commerce &quot;to charter an Interagency Council on Metric Policy (&#x27;ICMP&#x27;), which will assist the Secretary in coordinating Federal Government-wide implementation of this order.&quot;

U.S. customary units are widely used on consumer products and in industrial manufacturing. Metric units are standard in the fields of science, medicine, and engineering, as well as many sectors of industry and government, including the military. There are anecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building trades, on the basis that it is easier to remember an integer number of inches plus a fraction, rather than a measurement in millimeters, or that foot-inch measurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into halves, thirds, and quarters, often in parallel. The metric system also lacks a parallel measurement to the foot.

The term &quot;United States customary units&quot; was used by the former United States National Bureau of Standards, although &quot;English units&quot; is sometimes used in colloquial speech.

==Length==
For measuring length, the U.S. customary system uses the inch, foot, yard, and mile, which are the only four customary length measurements in everyday use. From 1893, the foot was legally defined as exactly (approximately ). Since July 1, 1959, the units of length have been defined on the basis of = . The U.S., the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries agreed on this definition per the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1958. At the time of the agreement, the basic geodetic datum in North America was the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27), which had been constructed by triangulation based on the definition of the foot in the Mendenhall Order of 1893, that is = : this definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the &quot;US survey foot&quot; to distinguish it from the international foot. For most applications, the difference between the two definitions is insignificant – one international foot is exactly of a US survey foot, for a difference of about per mile – but it affects the definition of the State Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles.

The NAD27 was replaced in the 1980s by the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which is defined in meters. The SPCSs were also updated, but the U.S. National Geodetic Survey left the decision of which (if any) definition of the foot to use to the individual states (and other jurisdictions). All SPCS 1983 systems are defined in meters, but forty jurisdictions also use the survey foot, six use the international foot, and ten do not specify which, if any, foot type should be used.

In 2019, the NIST, working with the National Geodetic Survey (NGS), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Department of Commerce (DOC), issued a Federal Register Notice (FRN) indicating the deprecation of the U.S. survey foot and U.S. survey mile units from December 31, 2022.

In the following tables in this and subsequent sections, the most common measures are shown in &quot;italics&quot;, and approximate values are shown in parentheses; values not in parentheses are exact.

===International units===
===International nautical units===
===US survey units===
Note that as announced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the US survey foot, and other units defined in terms of it, have been deprecated since 2023, &quot;except for historic and legacy applications&quot;.

==Area==
The most widely used area unit with a name unrelated to any length unit is the acre. The National Institute of Standards and Technology formerly contended that customary area units are defined in terms of the square survey foot, not the square international foot, but from 2023 it states that &quot;although historically defined using the U.S. survey foot, the statute mile can be defined using either definition of the foot, as is the case for all other units listed in this table. However, use of definitions based on the U.S. survey foot should be avoided after December 31, 2022 except for historic and legacy applications.&quot;
==Volume==

The cubic inch, cubic foot and cubic yard are commonly used for measuring volume. In addition, there is one group of units for measuring volumes of liquids (based on the wine gallon and subdivisions of the fluid ounce), and one for measuring volumes of dry material, each with their own names and sub-units.

Although the units and their names are similar to the units in the imperial system, and many units are shared between the two systems as a whole; with respect to volume, however, this is quite the contrary. The independence of the U.S. from the British Empire decades prior to the reformation of units in 1824—most notably the gallon, its subdivisions, and (in mass) higher combinations above the pound—is the cause of the differences in values.

As a non-participant in that reform, the U.S. retained the separate systems for measuring the volumes of liquids and dry material, whereas the imperial system had unified the units for both under a new imperial gallon. The U.S. uses the pre-1824 gallon () and Winchester bushel (), as opposed to British 1824 definition of of water and the bushel as . 
===Fluid volume===
One US fluid ounce is of a US pint, of a US quart, and of a US gallon. The teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup are defined in terms of a fluid ounce as , , and 8 fluid ounces respectively. The fluid ounce derives its name originally from being the volume of one ounce avoirdupois of water, but in the US it is defined as of a US gallon. Consequently, a fluid ounce of water weighs about 1.041 ounces avoirdupois.

For nutritional labeling and medicine in the US, the teaspoon and tablespoon are defined as a metric teaspoon and tablespoonprecisely and respectively.

The saying, &quot;a pint&#x27;s a pound the world around&quot;, refers to 16 US fluid ounces of water weighing approximately (about 4% more than) one pound avoirdupois. An imperial pint of water weighs a pound and a quarter ().
There are varying standards for barrel for some specific commodities, including 31 gallons for beer, 40 gallons for whiskey or kerosene, and 42 gallons for petroleum. The general standard for liquids is 31.5 gal or half a hogshead. The common 55-gallon size of drum for storing and transporting various products and wastes is sometimes confused with a barrel, though it is not a standard measure.

In the U.S., single servings of beverages are usually measured in fluid ounces. Milk is usually sold in half-pints (8 fluid ounces), pints, quarts, half gallons, and gallons. Water volume for sinks, bathtubs, ponds, swimming pools, etc., is usually stated in gallons or cubic feet. Quantities of gases are usually given in cubic feet (at one atmosphere).

Minims, drams, gill, and pottle are rarely used currently. The gill is often referred to as a &quot;half-cup&quot;. The &quot;pottle&quot; is often referred to as a &quot;half-gallon&quot;.
===Dry volume===
Dry volume is measured on a separate system, although many of the names remain the same. Small fruits and vegetables are often sold in dry pints and dry quarts. The US dry gallon is less commonly used, and was not included in the handbook that many states recognize as the authority on measurement law. However pecks, or bushels are sometimes used—particularly for grapes, apples and similar fruits in agricultural regions.
==Mass and weight==

There have historically been five different English systems of mass: tower, apothecaries&#x27;, troy, avoirdupois, and metric. Of these, the avoirdupois weight is the most common system used in the U.S., although Troy weight is still used to weigh precious metals. Apothecaries&#x27; weight—once used by pharmacies—has been largely replaced by metric measurements. Tower weight fell out of use in England (due to legal prohibition in 1527) centuries ago, and was never used in the U.S. The imperial system, which is still used for some measures in the United Kingdom and other countries, is based on avoirdupois, with variations from U.S. customary units larger than a pound.

The pound avoirdupois, which forms the basis of the U.S. customary system of mass, is defined as exactly by agreement between the U.S., the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking countries in 1959. Other units of mass are defined in terms of it.

The avoirdupois pound is legally defined as a measure of mass, but the name pound is also applied to measures of force. For instance, in many contexts, the pound avoirdupois is used as a unit of mass, but in some contexts, the term &quot;pound&quot; is used to refer to &quot;pound-force&quot;. The slug is another unit of mass derived from pound-force.

Troy weight, avoirdupois weight, and apothecaries&#x27; weight are all built from the same basic unit, the grain, which is the same in all three systems. However, while each system has some overlap in the names of their units of measure (all have ounces and pounds), the relationship between the grain and these other units within each system varies. For example, in apothecary and troy weight, the pound and ounce are the same, but are different from the pound and ounce in avoirdupois in terms of their relationships to grains and to each other. The systems also have different units between the grain and ounce (apothecaries&#x27; has scruple and dram, troy has pennyweight, and avoirdupois has just dram, sometimes spelled &quot;drachm&quot;). The dram in avoirdupois weighs just under half of the dram in apothecaries&#x27;. The fluid dram unit of volume is based on the weight of 1 dram of water in the apothecaries&#x27; system.

To alleviate confusion, it is typical when publishing non-avoirdupois weights to mention the name of the system along with the unit. Precious metals, for example, are often weighed in &quot;troy ounces&quot;, because just &quot;ounce&quot; would be more likely to be assumed to mean an avoirdupois ounce.

For the pound and smaller units, the U.S. customary system and the British imperial system are identical. However, they differ when dealing with units larger than the pound. The definition of the pound avoirdupois in the imperial system is identical to that in the U.S. customary system.

In the U.S., only the ounce, pound and short ton known in the country simply as the ton are commonly used, though the hundredweight is still used in agriculture and shipping. The grain is used to describe the mass of propellant and projectiles in small arms ammunition. It was also used to measure medicine and other very small masses.

===Grain measures===
In agricultural practice, a bushel is a fixed volume of . The mass of grain will therefore vary according to density. Some nominal weight examples are:
* 1 bushel (corn) = 
* 1 bushel (wheat) = 
* 1 bushel (barley) = 
==Cooking measures==

The most common practical cooking measures for both liquid and dry ingredients in the U.S. are &quot;teaspoon&quot;, &quot;tablespoon&quot;, and &quot;cup&quot;, along with halves, thirds, quarters, and eighths of each. Units used are &quot;pounds&quot;, &quot;ounces&quot;, and &quot;fluid ounces&quot;. Common sizes are also used, such as &quot;can&quot; (presumed size varies depending on product), &quot;jar&quot;, &quot;square&quot; (e.g. of chocolate), &quot;stick&quot; (e.g. of butter), or portion of fruit or vegetable (e.g. a half lemon, two medium onions).
==Temperature==
Degrees Fahrenheit are used in the U.S. to measure temperatures in most non-scientific contexts. The Rankine scale of absolute temperature also saw some use in thermodynamics. Scientists worldwide use the kelvin and degree Celsius. Several U.S. technical standards are expressed in Fahrenheit temperatures, and some American medical practitioners use degrees Fahrenheit for body temperature.

The relationship between the different temperature scales is linear but the scales have different zero points, so conversion is not simply multiplication by a factor. Pure water freezes at and boils at at 1 atm. The conversion formula is:
formula_1

or inversely as
formula_2
==Other units==
Length
* 1 hand = 4 in = 
* 1 U (rack unit) = 1.75 in = 
Volume
* 1 board-foot = 1 ft × 1 ft × 1 in = 
Mass
* 1 slug = 1 lbf⋅s2/ft ≈ 14.59390 kg
Force
* 1 poundal = force to accelerate 1 pound mass 1 foot/second/second ≈ .
* 1 kip = 1000 lbf ≈ 
Energy
* 1 foot-pound ≈ 
* 1 British thermal unit (Btu) ≈ (1,054–1,060 J, depending on which of several definitions of BTU is used)
* 1 Quad 1015 BTU, one quadrillion BTU (short-scale) or 1.055×1018 joule (1.055 exajoules or EJ)
Power
* 1 horsepower ≈ 
* 1 ton of refrigeration (12,000 Btu/h) = 
Pressure
* 1 inch of mercury = the pressure produced by 1 inch height of mercury = (33.8639 hPa, millibars)
* 1 pound per square inch (psi) ≈ 
Torque
* 1 pound-foot ≈ 
Insulation
* 1 &quot;R&quot;-value (ft2⋅°F⋅h/Btu) ≈ 0.1761 &quot;R&quot;SI (K⋅m2/W)

Various combination units are in common use; these are straightforwardly defined based on the above basic units.

Sizing systems are used for various items in commerce, several of which are U.S.-specific:
* US standard clothing size
* American wire gauge is used for most metal wire.
* Scoop (utensil) sizes, numbered by scoops per quart
* Thickness of leather is measured in ounces, 1 oz equals .
* Bolts and screws follow the Unified Thread Standard rather than the ISO metric screw thread standard.
* Knitting needles in the United States are measured according to a non-linear unitless numerical system.
* Thickness of aluminum foil is measured in &quot;mils&quot; ( inch, or 0.0254 mm) in the United States.
* Cross-sectional area of electrical wire is measured in circular mils in the U.S. and Canada, one circular mil (cmil) being equal to (or ). Since this is so small, actual wire is commonly measured in thousands of a cmil, called either kcmil or MCM.
* The &quot;mil&quot; or &quot;thou&quot; is also sometimes used to mean thousandth of an inch.
* Sheet metal in the U.S. is commonly measured in gauge (not to be confused with the American wire gauge), which is derived from weight and thus differs by material.
* Nominal Pipe Size is used for the outside diameter of pipes. Below NPS14, the NPS number is not consistent with the pipe diameter in inches.
* Copper tubing, however, is measured in nominal size, inch less than the outside diameter.
* The Schedule system is used for standard pipe thicknesses.
* Alcohol content is frequently given in proof, 2 × percent alcohol by volume
* The cord is used for volume of firewood.
* The square is used to mean 100 square feet in construction.
* Heat flux in the U.S. is measured in langleys.

==Other names for U.S. customary units==
The United States Code refers to these units as &quot;traditional systems of weights and measures&quot;.

Other common ways of referring to the system are: &quot;customary&quot;, &quot;standard&quot;, &quot;English&quot;, or &quot;imperial&quot; (which refers to the post-1824 reform measures used throughout the British Empire &amp; Commonwealth countries). Another term is the foot–pound–second (FPS) system, as opposed to centimeter–gram–second (CGS) and meter–kilogram–second (MKS) systems.

Tools and fasteners with sizes measured in inches are sometimes called &quot;SAE bolts&quot; or &quot;SAE wrenches&quot; to differentiate them from their metric counterparts. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) originally developed fasteners standards using U.S. units for the U.S. auto industry; the organization now uses metric units.

<text>The Lockheed U-2, nicknamed &quot;Dragon Lady&quot;, is an American single-engine, high altitude reconnaissance aircraft operated since the 1950s by the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It provides day and night, high-altitude (), all-weather intelligence gathering.

Lockheed Corporation originally proposed the aircraft in 1953. It was approved in 1954, and its first test flight was in 1955. It was flown during the Cold War over the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and Cuba. In 1960, Gary Powers was shot down in a CIA U-2C over the Soviet Union by a surface-to-air missile (SAM). Major Rudolf Anderson Jr. was shot down in a U-2 during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

U-2s have taken part in post-Cold War conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and supported several multinational NATO operations. The U-2 has also been used for electronic sensor research, satellite calibration, scientific research, and communications purposes. The U-2 is one of a handful of aircraft types to have served the USAF for over 50 years, along with the Boeing B-52, Boeing KC-135, Lockheed C-130 and Lockheed C-5. The newest models (TR-1, U-2R, U-2S) entered service in the 1980s, and the latest model, the U-2S, had a technical upgrade in 2012. The U-2 is currently operated by the USAF and NASA.

==Development==

===Background===
After World War II, the U.S. military desired better strategic aerial reconnaissance to help determine Soviet capabilities and intentions, and to prevent being caught off-guard as it had been in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Air Force commissioned the &#x27;Beacon Hill Report&#x27; from Project Lincoln at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was researched in 1951–1952 and delivered in 1952. The committee was led by Carl F. P. Overhage and was overseen by the Air Force&#x27;s Gordon P. Saville, and included James Gilbert Baker and Edwin H. Land, who would design the specialized optics in the U-2.

During the early 1950s, the best intelligence the American government had on facilities deep inside the Soviet Union were World War II German Luftwaffe photographs taken during the war of territory west of the Ural Mountains, so overflights to take aerial photographs of the Soviet Union would be necessary. The committee suggested a plane with advanced optics, flying above .

After 1950, Soviet air defenses consistently intercepted all aircraft near the country&#x27;s borders—sometimes even those in Japanese airspace. Existing US reconnaissance aircraft, primarily bombers converted for reconnaissance duty such as the Boeing RB-47, were vulnerable to anti-aircraft artillery, missiles, and fighters. Richard Leghorn of the United States Air Force suggested that an aircraft that could fly at should be safe from the MiG-17, the Soviet Union&#x27;s best interceptor aircraft, which could barely reach . He and others believed that Soviet radar, which used American equipment provided during the war, could not track aircraft above .

At the time, the highest-flying aircraft available to the US and its allies was the English Electric Canberra, which could reach . The British had already produced the PR3 photo-reconnaissance variant, but the USAF asked for English Electric&#x27;s help to further modify the American-licensed version of the Canberra, the Martin B-57, with long, narrow wings, new engines, and a lighter airframe to reach . The U.S. Air Research and Development Command mandated design changes that made the aircraft more durable for combat, but the resulting RB-57D aircraft of 1955 could only reach . The Soviet Union, unlike the United States and Britain, had improved radar technology after the war, and could track aircraft above .

===Lockheed proposal===
It was thought that an aircraft that could fly at would be beyond the reach of Soviet fighters, missiles, and radar. Another Air Force officer, John Seaberg, wrote a request for proposal in 1953 for an aircraft that could reach over a target with of operational radius. The USAF decided to solicit designs only from smaller aircraft companies that could give the project more attention. Under the code name &quot;Bald Eagle&quot;, it gave contracts to Bell Aircraft, Martin Aircraft, and Fairchild Engine and Airplane to develop proposals for the new reconnaissance aircraft. Officials at Lockheed Aircraft Corporation heard about the project and decided to submit an unsolicited proposal. To save weight and increase altitude, Lockheed executive John Carter suggested that the design eliminate landing gear and not attempt to meet combat load factors for the airframe. The company asked Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson to come up with such a design. Johnson was Lockheed&#x27;s best aeronautical engineer, responsible for the P-38 and the P-80. He was also known for completing projects ahead of schedule, working in a separate division of the company, informally called the &quot;Skunk Works&quot;.
Johnson&#x27;s design, named CL-282, was based on the Lockheed XF-104 with long, slender wings and a shortened fuselage. The design was powered by the General Electric J73 engine and took off from a special cart and landed on its belly. It could reach an altitude of and had a radius. The reconnaissance aircraft was essentially a jet-powered glider. In June 1954, the USAF rejected the design in favor of the Bell X-16 and the modified B-57. Reasons included the lack of landing gear, use of the J73 engine instead of the more proven Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 used by the competing designs, and not using multiple engines, which the USAF believed to be more reliable. General Curtis LeMay of Strategic Air Command (SAC) walked out during a CL-282 presentation, saying that he was not interested in an airplane without wheels or guns.

===Approval===
Civilian officials including Trevor Gardner, an aide to Secretary of the Air Force Harold E. Talbott, were more positive about the CL-282 because of its higher potential altitude and smaller radar cross-section, and recommended the design to the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Office of Scientific Intelligence. At that time, the CIA depended on the military for overflights, and Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles favored human over technical intelligence-gathering methods. However, the Intelligence Systems Panel, a civilian group advising the USAF and CIA on aerial reconnaissance, had recognized by 1954 that the RB-57D would not meet the requirement that panel member Allen F. Donovan of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory believed was necessary for safety. The CIA told the panel about the CL-282. The design elements that the USAF considered to be flaws (the single-engine and light load factor) appealed to Donovan. He was a sailplane enthusiast who believed that a sailplane was the type of high-altitude aircraft the panel was seeking.

Edwin Land, the developer of instant photography and another member of the panel, proposed to Dulles through Dulles&#x27; aide, Richard M. Bissell Jr., that his agency should fund and operate this aircraft. Land believed that if the military, rather than the CIA, operated the CL-282 during peacetime, such action could provoke a war. Although Dulles remained reluctant to have the CIA conduct its own overflights, Land and James Killian of MIT told President Eisenhower about the aircraft; Eisenhower agreed that the CIA should be the operator. Dulles finally agreed, but some USAF officers opposed the project because they feared it would endanger the RB-57D and X-16.

The USAF&#x27;s Seaberg helped persuade his own agency to support the CL-282, albeit with the higher-performance J57 engine, and final approval for a joint USAF-CIA project (the first time the CIA dealt with sophisticated technology) came in November 1954. Lockheed had meanwhile become busy with other projects and had to be persuaded to accept the CL-282 contract after its approval.

===Manufacture===
Bissell became head of the project, which used covert funding; under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, the CIA&#x27;s director is the only federal government employee who can spend &quot;unvouchered&quot; government money. Lockheed received a $22.5 million contract (equivalent to $ million in ) in March 1955 for the first 20 aircraft, with the first $1.26 million ($ million in ) mailed to Johnson&#x27;s home in February 1955 to keep work going during negotiations. The company agreed to deliver the first aircraft by July of that year and the last by November 1956. It did so, and for $3.5 million ($ million in ) under budget. The Flight Test Engineer in charge was Joseph F. Ware Jr.

Initial design and manufacturing was done at Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works factory in Burbank, California, with engineers embedded in the manufacturing area to address problems quickly. Procurement of the aircraft&#x27;s components occurred secretly. When Johnson ordered altimeters calibrated to from a company whose instruments only went to , the CIA set up a cover story involving experimental rocket aircraft. Shell Oil developed a new low-volatility, low vapor pressure jet fuel that would not evaporate at high altitudes; the fuel became known as JP-7. Manufacturing several hundred thousand gallons for the aircraft in 1955 caused a nationwide shortage of Esso&#x27;s FLIT insecticide.

Realizing the plane could not be tested and flown out of Burbank Airport, they selected what would become Area 51. It was acquired and a paved runway constructed for the project. The planes were dismantled, loaded onto cargo planes, and flown to the facility for testing. The aircraft was renamed the U-2 in July 1955, the same month the first aircraft, Article 341, was delivered to Groom Lake. The &quot;U&quot; referred to the deliberately vague designation &quot;utility&quot; instead of &quot;R&quot; for &quot;reconnaissance&quot;, and the U-1 and U-3 aircraft already existed. The CIA assigned the cryptonym AQUATONE to the project, with the USAF using the name OILSTONE for their support to the CIA.
James Baker developed the optics for a large-format camera to be used in the U-2 while working for Perkin-Elmer. The new camera had a resolution of from an altitude of . The aircraft was so crowded that when Baker asked Johnson for of space for a lens with a focal length, Johnson replied &quot;I&#x27;d sell my grandmother for six more inches!&quot;; Baker instead used a f/13.85 lens in a format for his final design.

===Fuel===
The U-2 has used Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (JPTS) since the aircraft&#x27;s development in the 1950s. JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude fuel, created specifically for the U-2. JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard USAF fuels. In 1999, the Air Force spent approximately $11.3 million (equivalent to $20.58 million in 2023 dollars) on fuel for the U-2 aircraft and was looking for a lower-cost alternative. JPTS is a specialty fuel and as such has limited worldwide availability and costs over three times the unit volume price of USAF&#x27;s primary jet fuel, JP-8. Research was carried out to find a cheaper and easier alternative involving additives to generally used jet fuels. A JP-8 based alternative, JP-8+100LT, was being considered in 2001. JP-8+100 has increased thermal stability by over stock JP-8, and is only 0.5 cents per gallon more expensive; low-temperature additives can be blended to this stock to achieve desired cold performance.

The small landing gear made a perfect balance in the fuel tanks essential for a safe landing. Similarly to sailplanes, the U-2 has a yaw string on the canopy to detect slip or skid during the approach. A skid during flight with no bank is the hint of an imbalance around the longitudinal axis which could be resolved by moving the fuel to the left or right wing tank.

===Radar cross-section reduction===
When the first overflights of the Soviet Union were tracked by radar, the CIA initiated Project Rainbow to reduce the U-2&#x27;s radar cross-section. This effort ultimately proved unsuccessful, and work began on a follow-on aircraft, which resulted in the Lockheed A-12 &quot;Oxcart&quot;.

===Possible successor===
In August 2015, the 60th anniversary of the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Skunk Works revealed they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, referred to as the UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and improving upon them. Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to the USAF several times, but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics. The USAF has no requirement or schedule for a next-generation High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early. The company&#x27;s last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the RQ-3 DarkStar, which never made it past flight testing and was canceled. Plans for a U-2 replacement would not conflict with the development of the SR-72, another project by the company to create a hypersonic unmanned surveillance plane, as it would be suited for missions that require greater speed for time-sensitive targets.

The company released a notional artist&#x27;s impression of the TR-X aircraft at an Air Force Association conference in Washington on 14 September 2015. Its name was changed to mean &quot;tactical reconnaissance&quot; to reflect its purpose as an affordable peace and wartime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, distinguishing it from strategic, penetrating SR-71-class platforms; TR is a reference to the short-lived rebranding of the U-2 as the TR-1 in the 1980s. Size, and thus cost, is kept down by having less endurance than the Global Hawk at around 20 hours, which is still about the same time as a normal RQ-4 sortie even though it is capable of flying for 34 hours. The TR-X concept is aimed squarely at USAF needs and is not currently being marketed to the CIA or other government agencies. It would have increased power and cooling to accommodate new sensors, communication equipment, electronic warfare suites, and perhaps offensive or defensive laser weapons. TR-X could be ready for service in the 2025 timeframe, with a fleet of 25–30 aircraft proposed to replace the nearly 40-aircraft mix of U-2s and RQ-4s.

Lockheed Martin revealed more specifications about the TR-X concept at a 15 March 2016 media day, confirming the aircraft would be unmanned and air refuelable. Its maximum takeoff weight would be greater than either the U-2&#x27;s or RQ-4&#x27;s at around , with a payload and wingspan. It will use the same F118-101 turbofan and generator as the U-2, but thrust could increase to and power increased to 65–75 kVA; service ceiling would increase to with a second engine. The TR-X is meant to be &quot;survivable, not unnoticeable&quot;, operating outside of enemy air defense bubbles rather than penetrating into them.

===Avionics Tech Refresh===
In 2020, the US Air Force awarded the Avionics Tech Refresh contract to Lockheed Martin for upgrading the U-2. In February 2020, the flight tests and the installation of new electro-optical reconnaissance systems were completed. SYERS-2C cameras manufactured by Collins Aerospace equip the entire U-2S fleet. The contract is valued at $50 million. The U-2S&#x27;s ISR very high altitude mission requires changes for avionics suite for the U-2&#x27;s onboard systems, a new mission computer designed to the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s open mission systems standard and a new and modern cockpit displays (Primary Flight Display or PFD).

The avionics upgrades are scheduled to be completed by 2022. Lockheed Martin then plans to refresh the U-2&#x27;s sensors and other electronic systems., to act as a node in the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) now under development.

==Design==
The design that gives the U-2 its remarkable performance also makes it a difficult aircraft to fly. Martin Knutson said that it &quot;was the highest workload air plane I believe ever designed and built … you&#x27;re wrestling with the airplane and operating the camera systems at all times&quot;, leaving no time to &quot;worry about whether you&#x27;re over Russia or you&#x27;re flying over Southern California&quot;. The U-2 was designed and manufactured for minimum airframe weight, which results in an aircraft with little margin for error. Most aircraft were single-seat versions, with only five two-seat trainer versions known to exist. Early U-2 variants were powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojet engines. The U-2C and TR-1A variants used the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 turbojet. The U-2S and TU-2S variants incorporated the more powerful General Electric F118 turbofan engine.

High aspect ratio wings give the U-2 glider-like characteristics, with an engine out glide ratio of about 23:1, comparable to gliders of the time. To maintain their operational ceiling of , the early U-2A and U-2C models had to fly very near their never-exceed speed (VNE). The margin between that maximum speed and the stall speed at that altitude was only . This narrow window is called the &quot;coffin corner&quot;, because breaching either limit was likely to cause airflow separation at the wings or tail. For most of the time on a typical mission the U-2 was flying less than above stall speed. A stall would cause a loss of altitude, possibly leading to detection and overstress of the airframe.

The U-2&#x27;s flight controls are designed for high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes the higher air density and lack of a power-assisted control system make the aircraft very difficult to fly: control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, and a great deal of physical strength is needed to operate the controls. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wings are fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car, which is driven by a second U-2 pilot who assists the landing U-2 by reporting the aircraft&#x27;s altitude. In practice, once the aircraft has descended to an altitude of above the runway the pilot initiates a stall and the aircraft falls from this height. Chase cars and live calling of aircraft altitude are necessary because the landing gear is not designed to absorb the weight of the aircraft when falling from altitudes much above .

Instead of the typical tricycle landing gear, the U-2 uses a bicycle configuration with a forward set of main wheels located just behind the cockpit and a rear set of main wheels located behind the engine. The rear wheels are coupled to the rudder to provide steering during taxiing. To maintain balance while taxiing and take-off, two auxiliary wheels called &quot;pogos&quot; are attached under the wings. These fit into sockets underneath each wing at about mid-span and fall off at takeoff. To protect the wings during landing, each wingtip has a titanium skid. After the U-2 comes to a halt, the ground crew re-installs the pogos, then the aircraft taxis to parking.

Because of the high operating altitude and the cockpit&#x27;s partial pressurization, equivalent to pressure altitude, the pilot wears a partially pressurized space suit, which delivers the pilot&#x27;s oxygen supply and provides emergency protection in case cabin pressure is lost. While pilots can drink water and eat various liquid foods in squeezable containers through a self-sealing hole in the face mask, they typically lose up to 5% of their body mass on an eight-hour mission. 

Initially, pilots had the option of carrying a suicide pill, although most chose not to. If put in the mouth and bitten, the &quot;L-pill&quot;—containing liquid potassium cyanide—would cause death in 10–15 seconds. After a pilot almost accidentally ingested an L-pill instead of candy during a December 1956 flight, the suicide pills were put into boxes to avoid confusion. When in 1960 the CIA realized that a pill breaking inside the cockpit would kill the pilot, it destroyed the L-pills, and as a replacement, its Technical Services Division developed a needle poisoned with a powerful shellfish toxin and hidden in a silver dollar. Only one was made because the agency decided if any pilot needed to use it the program would probably be canceled. Like the suicide pill, not all pilots carried the coin, and Knutson did not know of any that intended to commit suicide; he carried it as a weapon to escape in the event of capture.

To decrease the risk of developing decompression sickness, pilots breathe 100% oxygen for an hour prior to taking off to remove nitrogen from the blood. A portable oxygen supply is used during transport to the aircraft. Since 2001, more than a dozen pilots have reportedly suffered the effects of decompression sickness, including permanent brain damage in nine cases; initial symptoms include disorientation and becoming unable to read. Factors increasing the risk of illness since 2001 include longer mission durations and more cockpit activity. Conventional reconnaissance missions would limit pilot duties to maintaining flight paths for camera photography. Operations over Afghanistan included more real-time activities, such as communication with ground troops, increasing their bodies&#x27; oxygen requirements and the risk of nitrogen bubble formation. U-2 pilots now exercise during oxygen pre-breathing. In 2012, modifications were initiated under the Cockpit Altitude Reduction Effort (CARE), increasing the cabin pressure from 3.88 psi to 7.65 psi, a altitude equivalent. The urine collection device also was rebuilt to eliminate leakage.

===Sensors===
Existing cameras had ground resolution down to from an altitude of , and were inadequate for the altitude. Ground resolution of was required, at a maximum payload weight of . The U-2&#x27;s camera was specially designed by James G. Baker of Harvard and Richard Scott Perkin of the Perkin-Elmer Company, initially in collaboration and later separately.

Initial missions were flown with the trimetrogon &quot;A&quot; camera, consisting of three cameras, with F/8 resolving 60 lines per mm, and the ground resolution can be inferred by calculation to be . This was followed by the &quot;B&quot; camera with a lens with F/10 and image motion compensation, resolving 100 lines per mm, and the ground resolution can be inferred by calculation to be . It was a panoramic camera which took pictures of an extremely large area of the earth&#x27;s surface. The lens design consisted of a single aspheric singlet lens. reels of film were used, with the emulsion being coated on a polyester (PET) base that offered significantly improved dimensional stability over extremes of temperature and humidity compared to conventional cellulose acetate.

In addition, the U-2 also carried a low-resolution Perkin-Elmer tracking camera using a 3-inch lens, which made continuous horizon-to-horizon photographs. This is common practice in high resolution cameras in later systems also, where the large image helps localize the small high-resolution images.

The aircraft carries a variety of sensors in the nose, Q-bay (behind the cockpit, also known as the camera bay), and wing pods. The U-2 is capable of simultaneously collecting signals, imagery intelligence and air samples. Imagery intelligence sensors include either wet film photography, electro-optic, or radar imagery—the latter from the Raytheon ASARS-2 system. It can use both line-of-sight and over-horizon data links.
==Operational history==

===United States===
====Pilot selection and training====
Though the USAF and the Navy would eventually fly the U-2, the CIA had majority control over the project, code-named Project DRAGON LADY. Despite SAC chief LeMay&#x27;s early dismissal of the CL-282, the USAF in 1955 sought to take over the project and put it under SAC until Eisenhower repeated his opposition to military personnel flying the aircraft. Nonetheless, the USAF substantially participated in the project; Bissell described it as a &quot;49 percent&quot; partner. The USAF agreed to select and train pilots and plot missions, while the CIA would handle cameras and project security, process film, and arrange foreign bases.

Beyond not using American military personnel to fly the U-2, Eisenhower preferred to use non-U.S. citizens. Seven Greek pilots and a Polish expatriate were added to the U-2 trainees although only two of the Greek pilots were subsequently allowed to fly the aircraft. Their flight proficiency was poor. The language barrier and a lack of appropriate flying experience proved problematic; by late 1955, foreign pilots had been dropped from the program. USAF pilots had to resign their military commissions before joining the agency as civilians, a process referred to as &quot;sheep dipping&quot;, and were always called &quot;drivers&quot;, not pilots. The program only recruited fighter pilots with reserve USAF commissions, as regular commissions complicated the resignation process. The program offered high salaries and the USAF promised that pilots could return at the same rank as their peers. The CIA&#x27;s standards for selection were higher than the USAF&#x27;s once the latter began its own U-2 flights; although more candidates were rejected, the CIA&#x27;s program had a much lower accident rate. Test pilot Tony LeVier trained other Lockheed pilots to fly the U-2. By September 1955 he had trained six USAF pilots, who in turn trained other &quot;sheep-dipped&quot; pilots. As no two-seat trainer model was available for the program&#x27;s first 15 years, training was done before the trainee&#x27;s first solo flight and via radio. Pilots had to adjust to the U-2&#x27;s unusual combination of jet engines and enormous, high-lift glider wings; because of the &quot;coffin corner&quot; they learned of the need to pay complete attention to flying when not using the autopilot.

====Test flights====

After AQUATONE was funded and security handled by the CIA, the agency referred to all its high altitude aircraft as &quot;articles&quot;. This was intended to reduce the chances of a security breach as part of a compartmented security system. These three-digit &quot;article&quot; numbers were factory assigned. Article 341 was the original U-2 prototype, and it never received a USAF serial. The first flight took place at Groom Lake on 1 August 1955, during what was intended to be only a high-speed taxi test. The sailplane-like wings were so efficient that the aircraft jumped into the air at , amazing LeVier who, as he later said, &quot;had no intentions whatsoever of flying&quot;. The lake bed had no markings, making it difficult for LeVier to judge the distance to the ground, and the brakes proved too weak; he bounced the U-2 once before it stopped rolling, but the aircraft suffered only minor damage. LeVier again found landing the U-2 difficult during the first intentional test flight three days later. On his sixth try, he found that landing the aircraft by touching down on the rear wheel first was better than making the initial touchdown with the front wheel. Pilots continued to have difficulty during landing because the ground effect held the aircraft off the runway for long distances. On a test flight on 8 August, the U-2 reached , proving that Johnson had met his promised specifications and deadline. By 16 August, the prototype flew at , an altitude never before reached in sustained flight; by 8 September, it reached .

By January 1956, the U-2 had so impressed the USAF that it decided to obtain its own aircraft. The USAF purchased a total of 31 U-2s through the CIA; the transaction&#x27;s code name, Project DRAGON LADY, was the origin of the aircraft&#x27;s nickname. Meanwhile, U-2s conducted eight overflights of the U.S. in April 1956, convincing project overseers that the aircraft was ready for deployment. As often happens with new aircraft designs, there were several operational accidents. One occurred during these test flights when a U-2 suffered a flameout over Tennessee; the pilot calculated that he could reach New Mexico. Every air base in the continental U.S. had sealed orders to carry out if a U-2 landed. The commander of Kirtland Air Force Base near Albuquerque, New Mexico, was told to open his orders, prepare for the arrival of an unusual aircraft making a deadstick landing, and get it inside a hangar as soon as possible. The U-2 successfully landed after gliding for more than , and its strange, glider-like appearance and the space-suited pilot startled the base commander and other witnesses.
Not all U-2 incidents were so benign, with three fatal accidents in 1956 alone. The first was on 15 May 1956, when the pilot stalled the aircraft during a post-takeoff maneuver that was intended to drop off the wingtip outrigger wheels. The second occurred on 31 August, when the pilot stalled the aircraft immediately after takeoff. On 17 September, a third aircraft disintegrated during ascent in Germany, also killing the pilot. There were other non-fatal incidents, including at least one that resulted in the loss of the aircraft.

====Cover story====
A committee of Army, Navy, USAF, CIA, NSA, and State Department representatives created lists of priority targets for U-2 and other intelligence-gathering methods. The U-2 project received the list and drew up flight plans, and the committee provided a detailed rationale for each plan for the president to consider as he decided whether to approve it. The CIA&#x27;s Photo Intelligence Division grew in size to prepare for the expected flood of U-2 photographs. Before the aircraft became operational, however, USAF&#x27;s Project Genetrix, which used high-altitude balloons to photograph the Soviet Union, China, and eastern Europe, led to many diplomatic protests from those countries and for a while, CIA officials feared that the U-2 project was at risk. While Genetrix was also a technical failure—only 34 of the 516 balloons returned usable photographs—the balloon flights gave the United States many clues on how the Communist countries used radar to track overflights, which benefited the U-2 program.

With approval from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)&#x27;s director Hugh Dryden, Bissell&#x27;s team at the CIA developed a cover story for the U-2 that described the aircraft as used by NACA for high-altitude weather research; the cover story would be used if the aircraft were lost over hostile territory. U-2s flew some real weather-related missions, taking photographs that appeared in the press, and sometimes had civilian government decals, but few believed in the cover story; in May 1957 the UK&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper reported the U-2 operating east of the Iron Curtain.

The civilian advisers Land and Killian disagreed with the cover story, advising that in case of an aircraft loss, the United States forthrightly acknowledge its use of U-2 overflights &quot;to guard against surprise attack&quot;. Their advice was not followed, and the weather cover story led to the disaster that followed the May 1960 U-2 loss.

====Initial overflights of Communist territory====
The British government in January 1956 approved the U-2&#x27;s deployment from RAF Lakenheath. NACA announced that the USAF Air Weather Service would use a Lockheed-developed aircraft to study the weather and cosmic rays at altitudes up to 55,000 feet; accordingly, the first CIA detachment of U-2s (&quot;Detachment A&quot;) was known publicly as the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Provisional (WRSP-1). The death in April 1956, however, of British agent Lionel Crabb while examining Soviet ships in Portsmouth harbor embarrassed the British government, which asked the United States to postpone the Lakenheath flights. To avoid delays, in June 1956, Detachment A moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, without approval from the German government, while Giebelstadt Army Airfield was prepared as a more permanent base.

Eisenhower remained concerned that despite their great intelligence value, overflights of the Soviet Union might cause a war. While the U-2 was under development, at the 1955 Geneva Summit he proposed to Nikita Khrushchev that the Soviet Union and the United States would each grant the other country airfields to use to photograph military installations. Khrushchev rejected the &quot;Open Skies&quot; proposal.

The CIA told the president that the Soviets could not track high-altitude U-2 flights; this belief was based on studies using old Soviet radar systems and American systems that were not as effective at high altitudes as current Soviet systems, of which the U.S. was not aware. Knutson later said that &quot;the U-2 was really quite invisible to American radar, but Russian radar were a little different—better, you might say&quot;. Although the Office of Scientific Intelligence issued a more cautious report in May 1956 that stated that detection was possible, it believed that the Soviets could not consistently track the aircraft. Dulles further told Eisenhower, according to presidential aide Andrew Goodpaster, that in any aircraft loss the pilot would almost certainly not survive. With such assurances and the growing demand for accurate intelligence regarding the alleged &quot;bomber gap&quot; between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, in June 1956 Eisenhower approved 10 days of overflights.

The first U-2 overflight had already occurred, using the existing authorization of air force overflights over Eastern Europe. On 20 June 1956, a U-2 flew over Poland and East Germany, with more flights on 2 July. When Eisenhower refused to approve the U-2&#x27;s flight over Soviet airspace, the CIA turned to a foreign power, MI6, the British Secret Intelligence Service, to request authorization from Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Macmillan, who approved the flights. The fact that radar had—contrary to the CIA&#x27;s expectations—successfully tracked the aircraft worried Eisenhower, but he approved the first Soviet overflight, Mission 2013 on 4 July. U-2 Article 347&#x27;s main targets were the Soviet submarine construction program in Leningrad, and counting the numbers of the new Myasishchev M-4 &quot;Bison&quot; bomber.

Soviet radar monitored the U-2 incursion into Soviet airspace in real-time, with radar tracking starting from the time the aircraft crossed into East German airspace. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was informed immediately.. While contemplating appropriate retaliatory steps, he ordered Soviet Ambassador to Washington, Georgy Zarubin, to protest vehemently to the U.S. State Department that very day, explaining that the recent trust-building to ease tensions between the two countries was undermined by the overflight provocations.

A second flight on 5 July continued searching for Bisons, took photographs of Moscow (the only ones taken by the program), and flew over cloud-covered rocket factories at Kaliningrad and Khimki. Eisenhower knew from the earlier overflights that his hope of no Soviet detection was unrealistic, but ordered that the overflights stop if the aircraft could be tracked. The CIA found that the Soviets could not consistently track the U-2s and therefore did not know that Moscow and Leningrad had been overflown. The aircraft&#x27;s photographs showed tiny images of MiG-15s and MiG-17s attempting and failing to intercept the aircraft, proving that the Soviets could not shoot down an operational U-2. Knutson recalled that the &quot;constant stream of Russian fighters&quot; trying to shoot down the U-2 during overflights was sometimes &quot;so thick&quot; that they interfered with photographs. Repeatedly failing for years to stop the aircraft embarrassed the USSR, which made diplomatic protests against the flights but did not publicize the penetration of Soviet territory.

U-2 missions from Wiesbaden would depart westward in order to gain altitude over friendly territory before turning eastward at operational altitudes. The NATO Air Defence mission in that area included No. 1 Air Division RCAF (Europe), which operated the Canadair Sabre Mark 6 from bases in northeastern France. This aircraft had a service ceiling of 54,000 feet and numerous encounters between the U-2 and RCAF &#x27;ZULU&#x27; alert flights have been recorded for posterity.

====&quot;Bomber gap&quot; disproven====
On 10 July, the Soviets protested what they described as overflights by a USAF &quot;twin-engine medium bomber&quot;, apparently believing that it was a B-57 Canberra. The U.S. replied on 19 July that no American &quot;military planes&quot; had overflown the Soviet Union, but the fact that the Soviets&#x27; report showed that they could track the U-2s for extended periods caused Eisenhower to immediately halt overflights over eastern Europe. Beyond the Soviet protests, the president was concerned about the American public&#x27;s reaction to the news that the U.S. had violated international law. To avoid project cancellation, the CIA began Project Rainbow to make the U-2 less detectable. The eight overflights over communist territory, however, had already shown that the bomber gap did not exist; the U-2s had not found any Myasishchev M-4 Bison bombers at the nine bases they had visited. Because the Eisenhower administration could not disclose the source of its intelligence, however, Congressional and public debate over the bomber gap continued.

====Suez Crisis and aftermath====
The presidential order did not restrict U-2 flights outside eastern Europe. In May 1956, Turkey approved the deployment of Detachment B at Incirlik Air Base, near Adana, Turkey. Before the new detachment was ready, however, Detachment A in late August used Adana as a refueling base to photograph the Mediterranean. The aircraft found evidence of many British troops on Malta and Cyprus as the United Kingdom prepared for its forthcoming intervention in Suez. The U.S. released some of the photographs to the British government. As the crisis grew in seriousness, the project converted from a source of strategic reconnaissance, which prioritized high quality over speed (the film was processed by its maker, then analyzed in Washington), to a tactical reconnaissance unit that provided immediate analysis. The Photo Intelligence Division set up a lab at Wiesbaden; as Detachment B took over from A and flew over targets that remain classified , the Wiesbaden lab&#x27;s rapid reports helped the U.S. government to predict the Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt three days before it began on 29 October. On 1 November a flight flew over the Egyptian air base at Almaza twice, 10 minutes apart; in between the British and French attacked the base, and the visible results of the attack in the &quot;10-minute reconnaissance&quot; impressed Eisenhower. Beginning on 5 November, flights over Syria showed that the Soviets had not sent aircraft there despite their threats against the British, French and Israelis, a cause of worry for the U.S.

In the four years following the Suez Crisis, repeated U-2 missions over the Middle East were launched, particularly in times of tension. The end of the 1958 Lebanon crisis saw a decline in U-2 operations, although Detachment B U-2s operating from Turkey still sometimes overflew the Middle East along with occasional missions over Albania to check for Soviet missile activity. Israel was a major target of U-2 missions during this period, with U-2 missions detecting the construction of the Negev Nuclear Research Center in 1958, first bringing Israel&#x27;s nuclear program to the attention of the US. The overflights drew the attention of the Israeli Air Force. Its radars detected and tracked the overflights, and on numerous occasions, Israeli fighter aircraft were scrambled to intercept them but were unable to reach their altitude. The Israeli government was baffled by the overflights. However, Israeli fighter pilots were twice able to spot the intruding aircraft. On 11 March 1959, two Israeli Super Mystère fighters were directed to intercept a U-2 detected over Israel by Israeli ground-based radar. Although the aircraft were unable to make an intercept, the formation leader, Major Yosef Alon, managed to get a good look at the aircraft. He subsequently identified it out of a book as a U-2, registered as a weather reconnaissance aircraft to the US Weather Service. On 22 July 1959, after an overflight was detected, an Israeli Air Force Vautour jet was deployed to photograph the mysterious aircraft. The Vautour came within visual range and the U-2 was successfully photographed. In spite of this, it was not until the 1960 shootdown of a U-2 over the Soviet Union and its subsequent public exposure as a spy plane that the Israeli government understood the identity of the mystery aircraft.

====Renewal of Eastern Bloc overflights====
Eisenhower refused CIA pleas in September 1956 to reauthorize overflights of Eastern Europe but the Hungarian Revolution in November, and his reelection that month, caused the president to permit flights over border areas. Soviet interceptors could still not reach the U-2s but, after the Soviets protested a December overflight of Vladivostok by RB-57Ds, Eisenhower again forbade communist overflights. Flights close to the border continued, now including the first ELINT-equipped U-2s. In May 1957, Eisenhower again authorized overflights over certain important Soviet missile and atomic facilities. He continued to personally authorize each flight, closely examining maps and sometimes making changes to the flight plan. By 1957, one of the European units was based at Giebelstadt, and the far eastern unit was based at the Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan.

Part of the reason for the May reauthorization was that the CIA promised that improvements from Project RAINBOW would make the majority of U-2 flights undetected. On 2 April 1957, a RAINBOW test flight crashed in Nevada, killing the pilot. The U-2&#x27;s large wingspan slowed its descent during crashes, often leaving its remains salvageable; Lockheed was able to rebuild the wreckage from the incident into a flyable airframe, but that it could do so should have been evidence to the CIA that its cover story might not be viable after a crash in hostile territory. The RAINBOW anti-radar modifications were not very successful, and their use ended in 1958.

Soviet overflights resumed in June 1957 from Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska to the Russian Far East, which had less effective radar systems. Others originated from Lahore, Pakistan. A Lahore flight on 5 August provided the first photographs of the Baikonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam: the CIA had been unaware of its existence until then. Other flights examined the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and the Saryshagan missile test site. After a few more overflights that year, only five more took place before the May 1960 incident because of Eisenhower&#x27;s increasing caution. The president sought to avoid angering the Soviets as he worked to achieve a nuclear test ban; meanwhile, the Soviets began trying to shoot down U-2 flights that never entered Soviet airspace, and the details in their diplomatic protests showed that Soviet radar operators were able to effectively track the aircraft. To reduce visibility Lockheed painted the aircraft in a blue-black color that helped them blend in against the darkness of space, and the CIA aircraft received the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J75-P-13 engine that increased maximum altitude by , to . In April 1958, CIA source Pyotr Semyonovich Popov told his handler George Kisevalter that a senior KGB official had boasted of having &quot;full technical details&quot; of the U-2, leading Bissell to conclude the project had a leak. The source of the leak was never identified, although there was speculation that it was Lee Harvey Oswald, then a radar operator at a U-2 base in Japan.

The Soviets developed their own overflight aircraft, variants of the Yak-25, which in addition to photographing various parts of the world through the early 1960s acted as a target for the new MiG-19 and MiG-21 interceptors to practice for the U-2.

====The &quot;missile gap&quot;====
The successful launch of Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957 gave credence to Soviet claims about the progress of its intercontinental ballistic missile program, and began the Sputnik crisis in the United States. The U-2 intelligence caused Eisenhower to state in a press conference on 9 October that the launch did &quot;not raise my apprehensions, not one iota&quot;, but he refused to disclose the U-2&#x27;s existence as he believed that the Soviets would demand the end of the flights. In December 1958 Khrushchev boasted that a Soviet missile could deliver a 5-megaton warhead . Although the Soviets&#x27; SS-6 Sapwood missile program was actually stalled by technical failures, subsequent boasts—and U.S. secretary of defense Neil McElroy&#x27;s statement in February 1959 to Congress that the Soviets might have a three-to-one temporary advantage in ICBMs during the early 1960s—caused widespread concern in the U.S. about the existence of a &quot;missile gap&quot;. The American intelligence community was divided, with the CIA suspecting technical delays but the USAF believing that the SS-6 was ready for deployment. Khrushchev continued to exaggerate the Soviet program&#x27;s success; the missile gap concerns, and CIA and State Department support, caused Eisenhower to reauthorize one Communist territory overflight in July 1959 after 16 months, as well as many ELINT flights along the Soviet border. British U-2 overflights were made in December and February 1960. The first one targeted a large segment of the railways in the Tyuratam test range area as ballistic missiles were expected to be deployed close to rail lines, as well as nuclear complexes and missile test sites. No sites were found. Neither flight proved or disproved the existence of a &quot;missile gap&quot;. The British flights&#x27; success contributed to Eisenhower&#x27;s authorization of one overflight in April.

By 1960 U-2 pilots were aware, Knutson recalled, that Soviet surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) had improved and that overflights had become much riskier, but did not worry because &quot;dumb fighter pilots always think it&#x27;s the other guy that&#x27;s going to get hit&quot;. By this time the CIA had also concluded internally that Soviet SAMs had &quot;a high probability of successful intercept at providing that detection is made in sufficient time to alert the site&quot;. Despite the much-increased risk, the CIA did not stop the overflights as they were overconfident following the years of successful missions, and because of the strong demand for more missile-site photographs, the U-2 was the major source of covert intelligence on the Soviet Union and had photographed about 15% of the country, producing almost 5,500 intelligence reports. The April flight was indeed tracked quickly, and Khrushchev said in his memoir that it should have been shot down by new SAMs, but the missile crews were slow to react.

====May 1960: U-2 shot down====

Eisenhower authorized one more overflight, which was to be made no later than 1 May because the important Paris Summit of the Big Four Conference would begin on 16 May. The CIA chose for the mission—the 24th deep-penetration Soviet overflight—Operation GRAND SLAM, an ambitious flight plan for the first crossing of the Soviet Union from Peshawar, Pakistan to Bodø, Norway; previous flights had always exited in the direction from which they had entered. The route would permit visits to Tyuratam, Sverdlovsk, Kirov, Kotlas, Severodvinsk, and Murmansk. It was expected, given good weather, to resolve missile, nuclear and nuclear submarine intelligence issues with one flight. Francis Gary Powers, the most experienced pilot with 27 missions, was chosen for the flight. After delays, the flight began on May Day, 1 May. This was a mistake because, as an important Soviet holiday, there was much less air traffic than usual. The Soviets began tracking the U-2 15 miles outside the border, and over Sverdlovsk, four and a half hours into the flight, one of three SA-2 missiles detonated behind the aircraft at 70,500 feet, near enough to cause it to crash; another hit a Soviet interceptor attempting to reach the American aircraft. Powers survived the near miss and was quickly captured; the crash did not destroy the U-2 and the Soviets were able to identify much of the equipment.
Bissell and other project officials believed that surviving a U-2 accident from above 70,000 feet was impossible, so they used the pre-existing cover story. On 3 May, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, the successor to NACA) announced that one of its aircraft, making a high-altitude research flight in Turkey, was missing; the government planned to say, if necessary, that the NASA aircraft had drifted with an incapacitated pilot across the Soviet border. By remaining silent, Khrushchev lured the Americans into reinforcing the cover story until he revealed on 7 May that Powers was alive and had confessed to spying on the Soviet Union. Eisenhower turned down Dulles&#x27; offer to resign and publicly took full responsibility for the incident on 11 May; by then all overflights had been canceled. The Paris Summit collapsed after Khrushchev, as the first speaker, demanded an apology from the U.S., which Eisenhower refused.

U-2 pilots were told, Knutson later said, if captured &quot;to tell them everything that they knew&quot;, because they were told little about their missions other than targets on maps. Otherwise, Powers had little instruction on what to do during an interrogation. Although he had been told that he could reveal everything about the aircraft since the Soviets could learn what they wanted from it, Powers did his best to conceal classified information while appearing to cooperate. His trial began on 17 August 1960. Powers—who apologized on the advice of his Soviet defense counsel—was sentenced to three years in prison, but on 10 February 1962 the USSR exchanged him and American student Frederic Pryor for Rudolf Abel at Glienicke Bridge between West Berlin and Potsdam, Germany. Two CIA investigations found that Powers had done well during the interrogation and had &quot;complied with his obligations as an American citizen during this period&quot;. Although the government was reluctant to reinstate him to the USAF because of its statements that the U-2 program was civilian, it had promised to do so after CIA employment ended; Powers resolved the dilemma by choosing to work for Lockheed as a U-2 pilot.

The debris of Powers&#x27;s aircraft was used to design a copy under the name Beriev S-13. That was then discarded in favor of the MiG-25R and reconnaissance satellites.

The search for operational ballistic missile sites continued focusing on the Soviet railway system using Corona satellite images, with a resolution of twenty to thirty feet compared to two to three feet from U-2 cameras.

====Restructuring====
The U-2 shootdown in 1960 paralyzed the U.S. reconnaissance community and forced changes in policy, procedures, and security protocol. The United States also had to move swiftly to protect its allies: for example after the Soviets announced that Powers was alive, the CIA evacuated the British pilots from Detachment B as Turkey did not know of their presence in the country. The end of Soviet overflights meant that Detachment B itself soon left Turkey, and in July Detachment C left Japan following a Japanese governmental request. Both detachments merged into Detachment G, under the command of Lt. Col. William Gregory, at Edwards Air Force Base, California where the CIA had relocated the U-2 program after nuclear testing forced it to abandon Groom Lake in 1957.

The CIA sought to determine if the U-2 could, from a fixed base at North Edwards, rapidly deploy to an advanced American base and complete reconnaissance flights on a largely self-sustaining basis. A proving exercise was arranged with Gregory and the new Detachment G unit to simulate deploying a U-2 unit overseas, taking two or three aircraft, and conducting three reconnaissance missions with no resupply. The exercise was critical to continued CIA operation of the U-2, since basing the aircraft in a foreign country was no longer an option. The exercise was completed with excellent results, and actual reconnaissance missions began to be scheduled immediately.

On 4 January 1961, the CIA U-2 reconnaissance effort, which was formerly known as CHALICE, was redesignated IDEALIST. This program codeword by the end of the decade was being used to describe the U.S. reconnaissance along the Chinese coastline, while Taiwanese missions into the Chinese country would be known as the IDEALIST program

By the next U-2 flight, in October 1960 over Cuba, the previously informal procedure in which the president personally approved or disapproved each flight after discussion with advisors was replaced by the National Security Council Special Group. The expansion of satellite intelligence partly compensated for the overflights&#x27; end but, because U-2 photographs remained superior to satellite imagery, future administrations considered resumption at times, such as during the Berlin Crisis of 1961.

====Cuba====
=====Bay of Pigs Invasion=====
As many as 15 U-2 sorties provided support for the April 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba by the United States. Scientists such as Edwin H. Land and James Rhyne Killian, who had originally conceived the U-2 and had advocated for its development and deployment as a tool of scientific reconnaissance, felt betrayed by the use of the U-2 for &quot;dirty tricks&quot; covert operations, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion. Richard M. Bissel, the CIA official in charge of both the U-2 program and CIA covert operations, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion, had been a good friend of Land and Killian, but such use of the U-2s strained their friendship.

From October 1960, Detachment G made many overflights of Cuba from Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. Although Lockheed modified six CIA aircraft into the aerial refueling-capable U-2F model in 1961, permitting some Cuba missions to originate from Edwards, pilot fatigue limited flights to about 10 hours. An August 1962 flight showed Soviet SA-2 SAM sites on the island; later overflights found more sites and MiG-21 interceptors. The increasing number of SAMs caused the United States to more cautiously plan Cuban overflights. USAF U-2s did not conduct overflights, but officials believed that it would be better for a military officer to be the pilot in case he was shot down. Following one last Cuba overflight that originated from Edwards and ended at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida, on 14 October 1962, all further U-2 operations over Cuba originated from a detachment operating location that was established at McCoy.

=====Cuban Missile Crisis=====
After receiving hasty training on the more powerful U-2F under the cognizance of the Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Provisional (WRSP-4) at Edwards AFB, Major Richard S. Heyser flew over western Cuba on 14 October 1962 in a U-2F; his aircraft was the first to photograph Soviet medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) in San Cristóbal before returning to McCoy AFB, Florida. Prior to the launch of all Cuban sorties, the two U-2F aircraft possessed by WSRP-4 and flown by 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing personnel had USAF insignia and tail numbers.

SAC received permission to fly as many Cuban overflights as necessary for the duration of the resulting Cuban Missile Crisis. On a 27 October sortie from McCoy AFB, one of the U-2Fs was shot down over Cuba by an SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile, killing the pilot, Major Rudolf Anderson; he posthumously received the first Air Force Cross.

Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was dismayed, warning President John F. Kennedy in a private message that U-2 overflights could inadvertently cause WWIII: &quot;Is it not a fact that an intruding American plane could be easily taken for a nuclear bomber, which might push us to a fateful step?&quot;

Fulfilling CIA officials&#x27; fears of a USAF takeover, CIA pilots never again flew over Cuba; SAC retained control over Cuban overflights, which continued until the 1970s under the code name &quot;OLYMPIC FIRE&quot;.

At the same time as the Cuban crisis, Royal Air Force (RAF) English Electric Lightnings of the Air Fighting Development Squadron made several practice interceptions against U-2s; guided by ground controllers and using energy climb profiles, the Lightning could intercept the U-2 at up to 65,000 ft.

=====Hickman incident=====
On 28 July 1966, a U-2 piloted by USAF Captain Robert Hickman departed from Barksdale Air Force Base to conduct a reconnaissance mission; Hickman&#x27;s orders included the requirement that he not enter Cuban airspace. As determined later by USAF investigators, trouble with the aircraft&#x27;s oxygen system caused Hickman to lose consciousness. U.S. Navy pilot John Newlin, flying an F-4B assigned to VF-74, was scrambled from Naval Air Station Key West, ordered to intercept Hickman before he violated Cuban airspace, and, if necessary, shoot him down. Newlin could not reach the U-2 before flying closer than 12 miles from the Cuban coastline and so had to turn back. Hickman&#x27;s U-2 flew across Cuba, ran out of fuel and crashed into a mountainside near Llanquera, Bolivia. Hickman died in the crash, with the Bolivian military giving his remains an honor guard at a nearby chapel. The US embassy to Bolivia sent a team to investigate the crash site.

From 1960 to 1965, U-2 flights originated or terminated on a nearly daily basis at Albrook USAF base. In 1966, elements of the USAF&#x27;s 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing flew U-2s from Albrook to perform atmospheric sampling as the French detonated a nuclear device in the South Pacific.

====Asia====
CIA overflights of Asian targets began in spring 1958 when Detachment C moved from Japan to Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines to overfly Indonesia during an uprising against Sukarno&#x27;s &quot;Guided Democracy&quot; government. The CIA&#x27;s Civil Air Transport, aiding the rebels, so badly needed pilots that it borrowed two CIA U-2 pilots despite the high risk to the U-2 program if one were captured. The Indonesian government soon defeated the rebels, however, and the U-2s returned to Japan. That year, Detachment C also flew over the Chinese coast near Quemoy during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis to see if Communist Chinese forces were preparing to invade, and in 1959 aided CIA operations during the Tibetan uprising. The unit was collecting high-altitude air samples to look for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests when it was withdrawn from Asia after the May 1960 U-2 incident.

On 24 September 1959, an unmarked U-2, Article 360, crash landed to of Japan. Armed American security forces in plainclothes soon arrived and moved away locals at gunpoint, increasing public interest in the crash. The unlawfulness of the was criticized in Japan&#x27;s House of Representatives. The same Article 360 was later shot down in the May 1960 U-2 incident. A month before the incident, another U-2 crash landed in rural Thailand. Locals helped the US remove the aircraft without publicity.

Detachment G pilots began using the unmarked Taiwanese &quot;Detachment H&quot; U-2 for North Vietnam overflights in February 1962, but as tactical intelligence became more important, after the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of August 1964 SAC took over all U-2 missions in Indochina. In late November 1962, Detachment G was deployed to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, to carry out overflights of the Chinese-Indian border area after Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru requested military aid following the Sino-Indian War in October–November 1962. In 1963, India agreed to an American request for a permanent U-2 base for Soviet and Chinese targets, offering Charbatia, although it was only briefly used and Takhli remained Department G&#x27;s main Asian base. After the Vietnamese ceasefire in January 1973 prohibited American military flights, CIA pilots again used the unmarked Detachment H U-2 over North Vietnam during 1973 and 1974. Several U-2s were lost over China.

In 1963, the CIA started project Whale Tale to develop carrier-based U-2Gs to overcome range limitations. During the development of the capability, CIA pilots took off and landed U-2Gs on the aircraft carrier and other ships. The U-2G was used only twice operationally. Both flights from &quot;Ranger&quot; occurred in May 1964 to observe France&#x27;s development of an atomic bomb test range at Moruroa in French Polynesia.

=====Vietnam War=====
In early 1964, SAC sent a detachment of U-2s from the 4080th to South Vietnam for high altitude reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam. On 5 April 1965, U-2s from the 4028th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (SRS) took photos of SAM-2 sites near Hanoi and Haiphong harbor. On 11 February 1966, the 4080th Wing was redesignated the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (100 SRW) and moved to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. The detachment at Bien Hoa AB, South Vietnam, was redesignated the 349th SRS.

The only loss of a U-2 during combat operations occurred on 9 October 1966, when Major Leo Stewart, flying with the 349th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, developed mechanical problems high over North Vietnam. The U-2 managed to return to South Vietnam where Stewart ejected safely. The U-2 crashed approximately east-northeast of Saigon in Viet Cong (VC) territory. A Special Forces team was later sent to destroy the wreckage. One member stated that they retrieved classified radar jammers from the wreckage before they could be captured by the VC and possibly transferred to the USSR. In July 1970, the 349th SRS at Bien Hoa moved to Thailand and was redesignated the 99th SRS in November 1972, remaining there until March 1976.

====U-2 carrier operations====
At one time, in an effort to extend the U-2&#x27;s operating range and to eliminate the need for foreign government approval for U-2 operations from USAF bases in foreign countries, it was suggested that the U-2 be operated from aircraft carriers. Three aircraft were converted for carrier operations by the installation of arrester hooks, and carrier-qualified naval aviators were recruited to fly them.

It turned out to be possible to take off and land a U-2 from a carrier. Testing in 1964 with the USS &quot;Ranger&quot; and in 1969 with the USS &quot;America&quot; proved the concept. The only operational carrier use occurred in May 1964 when a U-2, operating from USS &quot;Ranger&quot;, was used to spy on a French atomic test in the Pacific. The Lockheed C-130 was also tested for carrier use to support U-2 sea deployments.

In 1969, the larger U-2Rs were flown from the carrier . The U-2 carrier program is believed to have been halted after 1969.

====1970–2000====
In August 1970, two U-2Rs were deployed by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to cover the Israeli-Egypt conflict under the code name &quot;EVEN STEVEN&quot;.

In June 1976, the U-2s of the 100 SRW were transferred to the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (9 SRW) at Beale Air Force Base, California, and merged with SR-71 aircraft operations there. When the Strategic Air Command (SAC) was disbanded in 1992, the wing was transferred to the new Air Combat Command (ACC) and redesignated the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (9 RW).

In 1977, a U-2R was retrofitted with an upward-looking window so that it could be used for high altitude astronomical observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This experiment was the first to measure definitively the motion of the galaxy relative to the CMB and established an upper limit on the rotation of the universe as a whole.

In 1984, during a major NATO exercise, RAF Flight Lieutenant Mike Hale intercepted a U-2 at a height of , where the aircraft had previously been considered safe from interception. Hale climbed to in his Lightning F3.

In 1989, a U-2R of 9th Reconnaissance Wing (RW), Detachment 5, flying from Patrick Air Force Base, Florida successfully photographed a space shuttle launch for NASA to assist in identifying the cause of tile loss during launch, which had been discovered in the initial post-&quot;Challenger&quot; missions.

On 2 January 1993, an Iraqi MiG-25 Foxbat attempted to intercept a USAF U-2 taking part in UN operations over Iraq. The R-40 (AA-6 Acrid) missile missed the U-2 and the MiG was &#x27;chased off&#x27; by F-15 Eagles.

On 19 November 1998, a NASA ER-2 research aircraft set a world record for altitude of in horizontal flight in the weight class.

====21st century====
The U-2 remains in front-line service more than 60 years after its first flight, with the current U-2 beginning service in 1980. This is due primarily to its ability to change surveillance objectives on short notice, something that surveillance satellites cannot do. In the mid-1990s, it was converted from the U-2R to the U-2S, receiving the GE F118 turbofan engine. The U-2 outlasted its Mach 3 replacement, the SR-71, which was retired in 1998. A classified budget document approved by the Pentagon on 23 December 2005 called for the U-2&#x27;s termination no earlier than 2012, with some aircraft being retired by 2007. In January 2006, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the U-2&#x27;s pending retirement as a cost-cutting measure during a larger reorganization and redefinition of the USAF&#x27;s mission. Rumsfeld said that this would not impair the USAF&#x27;s ability to gather intelligence, which would be done by satellites and a growing supply of unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance aircraft.
In 2009, the USAF stated that it planned to extend the U-2 retirement from 2012 until 2014 or later to allow more time to field the RQ-4. Upgrades late in the War in Afghanistan gave the U-2 greater reconnaissance and threat-detection capability. By early 2010, U-2s from the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron had flown over 200 missions in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, as well as Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa.

A U-2 was stationed in Cyprus in March 2011 to help in the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Libya, and a U-2 stationed at Osan Air Base in South Korea was used to provide imagery of the Japanese nuclear reactor damaged by the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
In March 2011, it was projected that the fleet of 32 U-2s would be operated until 2015. In 2014, Lockheed Martin determined that the U-2S fleet had used only one-fifth of its design service life and was one of the youngest fleets within the USAF. In 2011 the USAF intended to replace the U-2 with the RQ-4 before fiscal year 2015; proposed legislation required any replacement to have lower operating costs. In January 2012 the USAF reportedly planned to end the RQ-4 Block 30 program and extend the U-2&#x27;s service life until 2023. The RQ-4 Block 30 was kept in service under political pressure despite USAF objections, stating that the U-2 cost $2,380 per flight hour compared to the RQ-4&#x27;s $6,710 as of early 2014. Critics have pointed out that the RQ-4&#x27;s cameras and sensors are less capable, and lack all-weather operating capability; however, some of the U-2&#x27;s sensors may be installed on the RQ-4. The RQ-4 Block 30&#x27;s capabilities were planned to match the U-2&#x27;s by FY 2016, the replacement effort is motivated by decreases in the RQ-4&#x27;s cost per flying hour.

The U-2&#x27;s retirement was calculated to save $2.2 billion. $1.77 billion will have to be spent over 10 years to enhance the RQ-4, including $500 million on a universal payload adapter to attach one U-2 sensor onto the RQ-4. USAF officials fear that retiring the U-2 amid RQ-4 upgrades will create a capability gap In the House Armed Services Committee&#x27;s markup of the FY 2015 budget, language was included prohibiting the use of funds to retire or store the U-2; it also requested a report outlining the transition capabilities from the U-2 to the RQ-4 Block 30 in light of capability gap concerns.

In late 2014, Lockheed Martin proposed an unmanned U-2 version with greater payload capability, but the concept did not gain traction with the USAF. In early 2015, the USAF was directed to restart modest funding for the U-2 for operations and research, development, and procurement through to FY 2018. The former head of the USAF Air Combat Command, Gen. Mike Hostage helped extend the U-2S to ensure commanders receive sufficient intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) coverage; stating &quot;it will take eight years before the RQ-4 Global Hawk fleet can support 90% of the coverage of the U-2 fleet.&quot; In 2015, the RQ-4 was planned to replace the U-2 by 2019, though Lockheed states the U-2 can remain viable until 2050. As of January 2018, the U.S. Air Force budget for 2018 had indefinitely postponed the retirement of the U-2. In February 2020, the U.S. Air Force submitted budget documents with confusing language suggesting that it could begin retiring U-2s in 2025 but clarified afterwards that no retirement is planned.

On 20 September 2016, a TU-2S trainer crashed upon takeoff from Beale Air Force Base, killing one pilot and injuring the other.

In early August 2018, NASA flew two missions using infrared sensors to map the Mendocino Complex Fire. The flights used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite instruments.
In 2020, the U-2 made history as the first military aircraft to integrate Artificial Intelligence on a mission. The AI program, code-named ARTUμ, was developed by the U-2 Federal Laboratory.

In the 2023 Chinese balloon incident, the U.S. Air Force used U-2 aircraft to monitor a Chinese balloon that crossed the United States and Canada. U-2 flights confirmed the balloon&#x27;s surveillance package was outfitted with multiple antennas capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations and that the craft had large solar panels to power them.

===United Kingdom===
Bissell suggested bringing the British into the program to increase the number of overflights. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan agreed with the plan, and four RAF officers were sent to Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas for training in May 1958. On 8 July, the senior British pilot, Squadron Leader Christopher H. Walker, was killed when his U-2 malfunctioned and crashed near Wayside, Texas. This was the first death involving the U-2, and the circumstances were not disclosed for over 50 years. Another pilot was quickly selected and sent to replace Walker. After training, the group of RAF U-2 pilots arrived in Turkey in November 1958, shortly after the CIA&#x27;s Detachment B from Adana provided valuable intelligence during the 1958 Lebanon crisis with both the United States and United Kingdom involvement. Since the September 1956 disclosure of Mediterranean photographs, the United Kingdom had received U-2 intelligence, except during the Suez Crisis. The CIA and Eisenhower viewed using British pilots as a way of increasing plausible deniability for the flights. The CIA also saw British participation as a way of obtaining additional Soviet overflights that the president would not authorize. The United Kingdom gained the ability to target flights toward areas of the world the United States was less interested in, and possibly avoid another Suez-like interruption of U-2 photographs.

Although the RAF unit operated as part of Detachment B, the UK formally received title to the U-2s their pilots would fly, and Eisenhower wrote to Macmillan that because of the separate lines of authority, the nations were conducting &quot;two complementary programs rather than a joint one&quot;. A secret MI6 bank account paid the RAF pilots, whose cover was employment with the Meteorological Office. While most British flights occurred over the Middle East during the two years the UK program existed, two missions over Soviet sites were very successful. The first targeted two missile test ranges, three nuclear complexes, and a large segment of railway in one of the test range areas. Operational ballistic missile sites were considered most likely close to railways but none were found. A second flight had as its main target the long-range bomber airfield at Saratov/Engels. The number of Bison long-range aircraft counted on the airfield settled the &quot;bomber gap&quot; controversy. Other targets were a missile test center and aircraft, aircraft engine and missile production plants. A new bomber with two engines at the base of the fin, the Tupolev Tu-22, was discovered at one of the aircraft plants. Like Eisenhower, Macmillan personally approved the Soviet overflights. The British direct involvement in overflights ended after the May 1960 U-2 downing incident; although four pilots remained stationed in California until 1974, the CIA&#x27;s official history of the program stated that &quot;RAF pilots never again conducted another overflight in an Agency U-2.&quot; In 1960 and 1961 the first four pilots received the Air Force Cross, but their U-2 experience remained secret.

===Taiwan===


Beginning in the 1950s, Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) used the RB-57D aircraft for reconnaissance missions over the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), but suffered two losses when MiG-17s and SA-2 surface-to-air missiles intercepted and downed the aircraft.

Taiwanese and American authorities reached an agreement in 1958 to create the 35th Squadron, nicknamed the Black Cat Squadron, composed of two U-2Cs in Taoyuan Air Base in northern Taiwan, at an isolated part of the air base. To create misdirection typical of the time, the unit was created under the cover of high altitude weather research missions for ROCAF. To the U.S. government, the 35th Squadron and any U.S. CIA/USAF personnel assigned to the unit were known as Detachment H on all documents. But instead of being under normal USAF control, the project was known as Project Razor, and was run directly by the CIA with USAF assistance. Each of the 35th Squadron&#x27;s operational missions had to be approved by both the U.S. and the ROC presidents beforehand. A further layer of security and secrecy was enforced by all U.S. military and CIA/government personnel stationed in Taoyuan assigned to Detachment H having been issued official documents and IDs with false names and cover titles as Lockheed employees/representatives in civilian clothes. The ROCAF personnel would never know their U.S. counterparts&#x27; real names and rank/titles, or which U.S. government agencies they were dealing with. A total of 26 of 28 ROC pilots sent to the U.S. completed training between 1959 and 1973, at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. On 3 August 1959, a U-2 on a training mission out of Laughlin AFB, piloted by ROCAF Major Mike Hua, made a successful unassisted nighttime emergency landing at Cortez, Colorado, that became known as the Miracle at Cortez. Major Hua was awarded the USAF Distinguished Flying Cross for saving the aircraft.

In January 1961, the CIA provided the ROC with its first two U-2Cs, and in April the squadron flew its first mission over mainland China. In the wake of the Gary Powers incident, the Taiwanese program of China overflights was redesignated TACKLE, a subset of the new IDEALIST program. Other countries were occasionally overflown by the 35th Squadron, including North Korea, North Vietnam and Laos; however, the main objective of the 35th Squadron was to conduct reconnaissance missions assessing the PRC&#x27;s nuclear capabilities. For this purpose, the ROC pilots flew as far as Gansu and other remote regions in northwest China. Some missions, to satisfy mission requirements including range, and to add some element of surprise, had the 35th Squadron&#x27;s U-2s flying from or recovered at other U.S. air bases in Southeast Asia and Eastern Asia, such as Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, or Takhli in Thailand. All U.S. airbases in the region were listed as emergency/alternate recovery airfields and could be used besides the 35th Squadron&#x27;s home base at Taoyuan Air Base in Taiwan. Initially, all film taken by the Black Cat Squadron would be flown to Okinawa or Guam for processing and development, and the U.S. forces would not share any mission photos with ROC. In the late 1960s, the USAF agreed to share complete sets of mission photos and help set up a photo development and interpretation unit at Taoyuan.

In 1968, the ROC U-2C/F/G fleet was replaced with the newer U-2R. However, with the overwhelming threats from SA-2 missiles and MiG-21 interceptors, along with the rapprochement between the U.S. and the PRC, the ROC U-2s stopped entering Chinese airspace, only conducting electronic intelligence-gathering and photo-reconnaissance missions using new Long Range Oblique Reconnaissance (LOROP) cameras on the U-2R from above international waters. The last U-2 mission over mainland China took place on 16 March 1968. After that, all missions had the U-2 fly outside a buffer zone at least around China.

During his visit to China in 1972, U.S. president Richard Nixon promised the Chinese to cease all reconnaissance missions near and over China, though this was also practical as by 1972 U.S. photo satellites could provide better overhead images without risking losing aircraft and pilots, or provoking international incidents. The last 35th Squadron mission was flown by Sungchou &quot;Mike&quot; Chiu on 24 May 1974.

By the end of the ROC&#x27;s U-2 operations, a total of 19 U-2C/F/G/R aircraft had been operated by the 35th Squadron from 1959 to 1974. The squadron flew some 220 missions, with about half over mainland China, resulting in five aircraft shot down, with three fatalities and two pilots captured; one aircraft lost while performing an operational mission off the Chinese coast, with the pilot killed; and another seven aircraft lost in training with six pilots killed. On 29 July 1974, the two remaining U-2R aircraft in ROC possession were flown from Taoyuan Air Base in Taiwan to Edwards AFB, California, US, and turned over to the USAF.

===U-2E/F/H details===
In May 1961, in an attempt to extend the U-2&#x27;s already considerable range, Lockheed modified six CIA U-2s and several USAF U-2s with aerial refueling equipment, which allowed the aircraft to receive fuel from either the KC-97 or from the KC-135. This extended the aircraft&#x27;s range from approximately and extended its endurance to more than 14 hours. The J57-powered U-2Bs were re-designated U-2E and the J75-powered U-2Cs were redesignated U-2F. Each modified U-2 also included an additional oxygen cylinder. However, pilot fatigue was not considered, and little use was made of the refueling capability. The only U-2H was both air refueling-capable and carrier-capable.

===U-2R/S details===
The U-2R, first flown in 1967, is significantly larger and more capable than the original aircraft. A tactical reconnaissance version, the &quot;TR-1A&quot;, first flew in August 1981. A distinguishing feature of these aircraft is the addition of a large instrumentation &quot;superpod&quot; under each wing. Designed for standoff tactical reconnaissance in Europe, the TR-1A was structurally identical to the U-2R. The 17th Reconnaissance Wing, RAF Alconbury, England used operational TR-1As from 1983 until 1991. The last U-2 and TR-1 aircraft were delivered to USAF in October 1989. In 1992 all TR-1s were re-designated to U-2R for uniformity across the fleet. The two-seat trainer variant of the TR-1, the &quot;TR-1B&quot;, was redesignated as the &quot;TU-2R&quot;. After upgrading with the GE F-118-101 engine, the former U-2Rs were designated the &quot;U-2S&quot; &quot;Senior Year&quot;.

===ER-2 details===
A derivative of the U-2 known as the ER-2 (Earth Resources 2), in NASA&#x27;s white livery, is based at the Dryden Flight Research Center (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) and is used for high-altitude civilian research including Earth resources, celestial observations, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes. Programs using the aircraft include the Airborne Science Program, ERAST and Earth Science Enterprise. Landings are assisted by another pilot at speeds exceeding in a chase car.

==Specifications (U-2S)==


==In popular culture==
The image of a U-2 was used on the cover of the band Negativland&#x27;s controversial 1991 EP titled &quot;U2&quot;.

The TV series &quot;MythBusters&quot; featured the U-2 in the &quot;Flights of Fantasy&quot; episode during the 2015 season. The myth tested was that the U-2 was the most difficult plane to fly. While not coming to a consensus, the myth was found to be &quot;plausible&quot; because, among other things, the extremely bad field of vision during landing required a chase car to follow the plane to give the pilot additional visual references on the ground.

<text>Dr. Esperanto&#x27;s International Language (), commonly referred to as (&quot;First Book&quot;), is an 1887 book by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof, in which he first introduced and described the constructed language Esperanto. First published in Russian on , the publication of &quot;Unua Libro&quot; marks the formal beginning of the Esperanto movement.

Writing under the pseudonym &quot;Dr. Esperanto&quot;, Zamenhof originally referred to the language as the &quot;international language&quot;; the use of &quot;Esperanto&quot; did not arise until 1889 when people began to use his pseudonym as the name of the language itself. Zamenhof reproduced a significant portion of the content of &quot;Unua Libro&quot; in the 1905 &quot;Fundamento de Esperanto&quot;, which he established as the sole obligatory authority over Esperanto in the Declaration of Boulogne, ratified by the first World Esperanto Congress later that year.

==History==

After many years of developing the language, Zamenhof completed &quot;Unua Libro&quot; by the spring of 1885 and spent the next two years looking for a publisher. In 1887, shortly after he married his wife Klara, his new father-in-law Aleksandr Silbernik advised him to use money from Klara&#x27;s dowry to find a publisher. Following his advice, Zamenhof found a publisher in Warsaw, Chaim Kelter. On , Kelter published the book in Russian as &quot;International Language&quot; (). Before the end of the year, Kelter published the Polish, French, and German editions of the book, as well.

In 1888, Zamenhof had Julian Steinhaus translate the book into English, and the translation was published under the title &quot;Dr. Esperanto&#x27;s International Tongue&quot;. However, when Richard Geoghegan pointed out that Steinhaus&#x27;s translation was very poor, Zamenhof destroyed his remaining copies and requested that Geoghegan produce a fresh translation. Geoghegan&#x27;s translation of the book, titled &quot;Dr. Esperanto&#x27;s International Language&quot;, was published on and became the standard English translation. Henry Phillips Jr., a secretary of the American Philosophical Society and early supporter of Esperanto, also produced a translation in 1889, titled &quot;An Attempt towards an International Language&quot;, but Geoghegan&#x27;s translation remains the preferred standard.

&quot;Unua Libro&quot; was also translated into Hebrew, Yiddish, Swedish, and Lithuanian in 1889 and then into Danish, Bulgarian, Italian, Spanish, and Czech in 1890.

The name &quot;Unua Libro&quot; was applied retroactively to the book in relation to the title of Zamenhof&#x27;s 1888 book &quot;Dua Libro&quot; (&quot;Second Book&quot;).

In 1905, Zamenhof reproduced much of the content of &quot;Unua Libro&quot; in &quot;Fundamento de Esperanto&quot;, which he established as the only obligatory authority over Esperanto in the Declaration of Boulogne at the first World Esperanto Congress later that year. However, in his 1888 &quot;Aldono al la Dua Libro&quot; (&quot;Supplement to the Second Book&quot;), he officially altered the spelling of the suffixes of the temporal correlatives (&quot;when&quot;, &quot;then&quot;, &quot;always&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;never&quot;) from &quot;-ian&quot; to &quot;-iam&quot;, which rendered the Esperanto of &quot;Unua Libro&quot; slightly outdated.

==Content==
The book consists of three parts, an introduction, a grammar section, and a dictionary.

Zamenhof begins by renouncing all rights to the language, putting it in the public domain.

In the introduction, Zamenhof lays out his case for the need for an international auxiliary language (IAL). He states that previous attempts, such as Volapük, have failed because they have not overcome the three main difficulties an IAL must overcome in order to succeed. Those difficulties are:

In the next three parts, he addresses each difficulty specifically and explains why he believes Esperanto is fit to overcome them.
In part I, he explains the simplicity and flexibility of Esperanto grammar, particularly due to its regularity and use of affixes.

In part II, he demonstrates the ease of using Esperanto for international communication due to a simple and clear vocabulary. To demonstrate this, he translates the Our Father and Genesis 1:1–9 and presents a fictional letter and a few poems in Esperanto—&quot;El Heine&#x27;&quot;, a translation, and &quot;Mia penso&quot; and &quot;Ho, mia kor&#x27;&quot;, both original.

In part III, he presents an idea called the &quot;universal vote&quot;, which is a campaign to allot 10 million signatures of people making the following pledge: &quot;I, the undersigned, promise to learn the international language, proposed by Dr. Esperanto, if it shall be shown that ten million similar promises have been publicly given.&quot; He argues that this will prevent anyone from wasting time on learning the language since, once 10 million signatures have been gathered, there will be a significant population obliged to learn the language, rendering the language useful. He also welcomes critical feedback for the next year and promises to consider criticism before publishing a special booklet that will give definitive form to the language the following year (which was to be &quot;Aldono al la Dua Libro&quot;). Additionally, he lays out guidelines for a language academy to guide the evolution of the language in the future (which was to be the Akademio de Esperanto).

In the grammar section, he explains the Esperanto alphabet and sixteen grammar rules.

In the dictionary section, he presents a dictionary with 917 roots of vocabulary.

==Reception and legacy==
Zamenhof received a wide range of reactions to &quot;Unua Libro&quot;, from mocking criticism to avid interest. In the hundreds of letters he received, he saw enough support to prompt him to publish &quot;Dua Libro&quot; in January 1888 and &quot;La Esperantisto&quot; in 1889, in order to provide more Esperanto reading material for those with interest. In 1889, he also published Russian–Esperanto and German–Esperanto dictionaries to increase Esperanto vocabulary, as well as &quot;Aldono al la Dua Libro&quot;, a supplement to &quot;Dua Libro&quot;, to establish the definitive form of the language, a document he promised in part III of &quot;Unua Libro&quot;.

By all measures, Zamenhof&#x27;s &quot;universal vote&quot; campaign failed. By 1889, he had only reached 1000 signatures, a mere 0.01% of his goal of 10 million. Nevertheless, the Esperanto movement continued onward. Among the early supporters were educated Russian and Polish Jews, Leo Tolstoy and his followers, Eastern European freemasons, and speakers of Volapük who had lost hope in their language.

<text>Unobtainium (or unobtanium) is a term used in fiction, engineering, and common situations for a material ideal for a particular application but impractically difficult or impossible to obtain. Unobtainium originally referred to materials that do not exist at all, but can also be used to describe real materials that are unavailable due to extreme rarity or cost. Less commonly, it can mean a device with desirable engineering properties for an application that are exceedingly difficult or impossible to achieve.

The properties of any particular example of unobtainium depend on the intended use. For example, a pulley made of unobtainium might be massless and frictionless. But for a nuclear rocket, unobtainium might have the needed qualities of lightness, strength at high temperatures, and resistance to radiation damage; a combination of all three qualities is impossible with today&#x27;s materials. The concept of unobtainium is often applied hand-wavingly, flippantly, or humorously.

The word &quot;unobtainium&quot; derives humorously from &quot;unobtainable&quot;, with &quot;&quot;, a suffix for chemical element names. It predates the similar-sounding systematic element names, such as ununennium, unbinilium, unbiunium, and unbiquadium. An alternative spelling, &quot;unobtanium&quot;, is sometimes used, by analogy to the names of real elements like titanium and uranium.

== Engineering origin ==
Since the late 1950s, aerospace engineers have used the term &quot;unobtainium&quot; when referring to unusual or costly materials, or when theoretically considering a material perfect for their needs in all respects, except that it does not exist.

By the 1990s, the term was in wide use, even in formal engineering papers such as &quot;Towards unobtainium [new composite materials for space applications].&quot;

The term may well have been coined in the aerospace industry to refer to materials capable of withstanding the extreme temperatures expected in re-entry. Aerospace engineers are frequently tempted to design aircraft which require parts with strength or resilience beyond that of currently available materials.

Later, unobtainium became an engineering term for practical materials that really exist, but are difficult to get. For example, during the development of the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, Lockheed engineers at the &quot;Skunk Works&quot; under Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson used unobtainium to refer to titanium. Titanium allowed a higher strength-to-weight ratio at the high temperatures the Blackbird would reach, but its availability was restricted because the Soviet Union controlled its supply. This created a problem for the U.S. during the Cold War because the Blackbird required huge amounts of titanium; subsequent U.S. military aircraft such as the B-1 Lancer, F-15 Eagle, F/A-18 Hornet, and F-22 Raptor required relatively large amounts of it as well.

== Contemporary popularization ==
Unobtainium began to be used among people who are neither science fiction fans nor engineers to denote an object that actually exists, but which is very hard to obtain either because of high price (sometimes referred to as &quot;unaffordium&quot;) or limited availability. It usually refers to a very high-end and desirable product. By the 1970s, the term had migrated from the aerospace industry to the Southern California automobile and motorcycle cultures and, began to appear in industry publications such as early advertisements for Oakley motorcycle handgrips.

Other examples are rear cassettes in the mountain biking community, parts that are no longer available for old-car enthusiasts, parts for reel-to-reel audio-tape recorders, and rare vacuum tubes such as the 1L6 or WD-11 that can now cost more than the equipment in which they were fitted. The eyewear and fashion wear company Oakley, Inc. also frequently denotes the material used for many of their eyeglass nosepieces and earpieces, which has the unusual property of increasing tackiness and thus grip when wet, as unobtanium.

By 2010, the term had been used in mainstream news reports to describe the commercially useful rare earth elements (particularly terbium, erbium, dysprosium, yttrium, and neodymium), which are essential to the performance of consumer electronics and green technology, but whose projected demand far outstrips their current supply.

There have been repeated attempts to attribute the name to a real material. Space elevator research has long used &quot;unobtainium&quot; to describe a material with the necessary characteristics, but carbon nanotubes might have these characteristics.

==Science fiction==

Unobtainium was mentioned briefly in David Brin&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;Startide Rising&quot;, as a material that could be used in making weapons and comprising 1% of the core of one of the exomoons of the Kthsemenee system.

Unobtainium is briefly mentioned in Wil McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;The Collapsium&quot; (2000), where a programmable quantum-technology material called &quot;wellstone&quot; can simulate any conceivable element, including &quot;imaginary substances like unobtainium, impossibilium, and rainbow kryptonite&quot;.

In the 2003 film &quot;The Core&quot;, &quot;Unobtainium&quot; is the nickname of a 37-syllable long tungsten-titanium crystal alloy developed by Dr. Edward &quot;Braz&quot; Brazzelton that is able to absorb the extreme pressure and heat of the Earth&#x27;s molten core and then convert these into usable energy; it&#x27;s used in building the super resistant outer shell of the ship &quot;Virgil&quot;.

In the 2009 film &quot;Avatar&quot;, Unobtanium is the common name of a rare-earth mineral found exclusively on the exomoon Pandora, highly prized (and priced) because of its application as a powerful superconductor material. Because of its unusual magnetic properties, entire mountains with high concentrations of unobtanium levitate in the atmosphere of Pandora.

== Similar terms ==
The term has been used to describe a material which has &quot;eluded&quot; attempts to develop it, with the variant spelling illudium derived from &quot;illusion&quot;. This was mentioned in several Looney Tunes cartoons, where Marvin the Martian tried (unsuccessfully) to use his &quot;Eludium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator&quot; to blow up the Earth.

Another largely synonymous term is wishalloy, although the sense is often subtly different in that a wishalloy usually does not exist at all, whereas unobtainium may merely be unavailable.

A similar conceptual material in alchemy is the philosopher&#x27;s stone, a mythical substance with the ability to turn lead into gold, or bestow immortality and youth. While the search to find such a substance was not successful, it did lead to discovery of a new element: phosphorus.

In architecture, the term &quot;renderite&quot; has been used to describe the use of unrealistic materials in concept renders.

<text>The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) (French: Organisation des Nations unies pour le développement industriel; French/Spanish acronym: ONUDI) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that assists countries in economic and industrial development. It is headquartered at the UN Office in Vienna, Austria, with a permanent presence in over 60 countries. As of October 4,2024, UNIDO comprises 173 member states, which together set the organization&#x27;s policies, programs, and principles through the biannual General Conference.

UNIDO was established in 1966 by the UN General Assembly to promote and accelerate the industrialization of developing countries, which were emerging from decolonization in record numbers and with little to no industrial base. In 1979 it became one of the 15 specialized agencies of the UN, with its new constitution coming into force in 1985. Since its founding, the organization has restructured and reformed several times; the 2013 Lima Declaration expanded its mission to include promoting &quot;inclusive and sustainable industrial development&quot; (ISID), defined as benefiting greater numbers of people while safeguarding the environment. UNIDO is a member of the United Nations Development Group, a coalition of UN entities aimed at fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals.

On 25 July 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/70/293, proclaiming the period 2016–2025 as the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa (IDDA III). UNIDO was called upon to lead the initiative in collaboration with a range of partners. These include the African Union Commission, the New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development, the Economic Commission for Africa, etc.

From 2018 to 2021, UNIDO&#x27;s strategic priorities include creating shared prosperity; advancing economic competitiveness; safeguarding the environment; and strengthening knowledge and institutions. Each of these goals is to be achieved through technical cooperation, policy advice, analysis and research, the development of uniform standards and quality control, and partnerships for knowledge transfer, networking and industrial cooperation.

UNIDO employs some 670 staff and draws on the services of some 2,800 international and national experts—approximately half from developing countries—annually, who work in project assignments throughout the world.

==Overview==
The relevance of ISID as an integrated approach to all three pillars of sustainable development is recognized by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will frame United Nations and country efforts towards sustainable development in the next fifteen years. UNIDO&#x27;s mandate is fully recognized in SDG-9, which calls to &quot;Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation&quot;. The relevance of ISID, however, applies in greater or lesser extent to all SDGs.

Accordingly, the Organization&#x27;s programmatic focus is structured, as detailed in the Organization&#x27;s Medium-Term Programme Framework 2018–2021, in four strategic priorities:

* Creating shared prosperity;
* Advancing economic competitiveness;
* Safeguarding the environment;
* Strengthening knowledge and institutions.

Each of these programmatic fields of activity contains a number of individual programmes, which are implemented in a holistic manner to achieve effective outcomes and impacts through UNIDO&#x27;s four enabling functions: 
* Technical cooperation;
* Analytical and research functions and policy advisory services; 
* Normative functions and standards and quality-related activities; 
* Convening and partnerships for knowledge transfer, networking and industrial cooperation.

In carrying out the core requirements of its mission, UNIDO has considerably increased its technical services over the past ten years. At the same time, it has also substantially increased its mobilization of financial resources, testifying to the growing international recognition of the Organization as an effective provider of catalytic industrial development services.

UNIDO was established as a UN programme in 1966 with headquarters in Vienna, Austria, and became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1985.

In 2004, UNIDO established the UNIDO Goodwill Ambassador programme.

In 2009, UNIDO created a new flagship publication, &quot;Making It: Industry for Development&quot; .

== Strategic priorities ==

===Creating shared prosperity===
UNIDO concentrates its efforts on the development of agro-industries, increasing the participation of women and youth in productive activities, and human security in post-crisis situations. The Organization&#x27;s services for the development of agro-industries focus on adding value to agricultural production by strengthening linkages between agriculture, industry and markets.

UNIDO supports the transformation of enterprises from the informal sector to the formal sector, with a special focus on simplifying and improving access to administrative company registration services. It also strives to improve women&#x27;s participation in entrepreneurial activities. Based on its experience in post-crisis and human security programmes and projects, UNIDO responds to complex emergencies through activities that contribute to socio-economic as well as environmental and energy security both at national and local level.

===Advancing economic competitiveness===
UNIDO supports programmes towards investment and technology promotion, SME development, trade capacity building, and entrepreneurship development.

UNIDO provides advisory services to improve the business and policy environment for the private sector, assisting with the creation of productive capacities. Its programmes support investment and technology opportunities to help enterprises, especially SMEs, improve productivity and innovation, and achieve systemic competitive advantages. Building on a robust global network aimed at fostering investment, technology and other partnership opportunities, UNIDO seeks to enable SMEs to capitalize on their unique dynamism and flexibility by strengthening synergies among enterprises and with support institutions.

In the context of trade capacity-building programmes, UNIDO strengthens international trade norms and standards by assisting developing countries and transition economies in upgrading production and processing systems to enhance the quality of local products, in particular through the adoption of improved technologies, and help them conform to the standards required by international markets. UNIDO builds capacities in both public and private institutions to formulate trade policies and strategies based on economic and statistical analysis, as well as benchmarking competitive performance at sectoral and product levels and supporting the establishment of trade-related databases such as inventories of technical barriers to trade (TBT), which are designed to expand exports from the industrial sector.

===Safeguarding the environment===

UNIDO supports countries in their environmental management efforts, including the implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and the provision of sustainable energy. It helps create new green industries, establishing national road maps for greening the supply chain, determining benchmarks and indicators, disseminating and sharing best practices, running clean technology programmes, undertaking various capacity-building exercises and contributing to international forums with the necessary research and expertise.

The Organization&#x27;s services include capacity building, direct technical support to enterprises and assistance to government institutions on Cleaner Production (CP) policy matters, as well as the promotion, adaptation and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the implementation of advanced CP business models, such as chemical leasing.

===Strengthening knowledge and institutions===
Strengthening knowledge and institutions is a prioritized outcome that is elevated over other high-level results. It describes the organization&#x27;s strategic direction towards strengthening the knowledge base for ISID at the project, programme, country and international level, as well as the institutional capacity at the technical, policy and normative level.

==Historical background==

===Origins===

The origins of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) can be traced to a series of studies on a programme of rapid industrialization of developing countries that the United Nations Secretariat carried out during the early 1950s at the request of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). These studies culminated in a programme of work on industrialization and productivity prepared by the United Nations Secretary-General in 1956 and endorsed the next year by ECOSOC and the General Assembly. At that time, it was first suggested that a special body to deal with the problems of industrialization be established, whose political organs could relieve ECOSOC and the General Assembly of the detailed consideration of those questions and whose secretariat could carry out more substantive work than the existing Industry Section of the Bureau of Economic Affairs within the Secretariat. The Industry Section of the Secretariat became a branch in 1959, and in 1962 it became the &quot;Industrial Development Centre&quot;, headed by a &quot;Commissioner for Industrial Development&quot;.

===Special organ of the United Nations===
In the aftermath, proposals for further institutionalizing industrial development-related issues within the UN were considered by various advisory groups and inter-organizational organs. Subsequently, the United Nations General Assembly created the UNIDO in November 1966 as a special organ of the United Nations. In January 1967, the Organization was formally established with headquarters in Vienna, Austria. Compared to the Industrial Development Centre, UNIDO&#x27;s creation was intended to broaden the work of its predecessor. Besides normative activities, such as acting as a forum for discussions, analytical functions and information dissemination, UNIDO became involved in operational activities, i.e. in technical co-operation activities.

===Conversion into a specialized agency===
The setting up of UNIDO as a special organ had nonetheless been a compromise solution. The developing countries (the Group of 77) had in the first instance promoted the idea of a specialized agency with its own political decision-making governing bodies and autonomy in budgetary matters. The same position was advocated by several high-level expert groups and intergovernmental committees during the following years. In the context of the General Assembly&#x27;s adoption of the &quot;Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States&quot;, UNIDO&#x27;s second General Conference, held in 1975 in Lima, Peru, adopted the &quot;Lima Declaration on Industrial Development and Cooperation&quot;. For the first time, industrial development objectives were quantified internationally – the Lima Target anticipated the developing countries to attain a twenty-five per cent share of world industrial production by the year of 2000. As part of the institutional arrangements of the Lima Plan of Action, and with a view to assisting in the establishment of a New International Economic Order, it was recommended to the General Assembly that UNIDO be converted into a specialized agency.

An intergovernmental committee prepared a draft constitution, which was adopted in Vienna in 1979. However, the objections and doubts of industrialized countries as to the necessity of a specialized agency contributed to delaying the ratification process. In order to ensure that the new organization would start up with a membership including substantially all significant States, the General Assembly, by resolutions adopted in 1982 and 1984, called for a series of formal consultations among prospective Member States, which eventually led to a general agreement that the new UNIDO Constitution should enter into force. All necessary formal requirements were fulfilled in 1985, and in December of the same year, UNIDO finally became the sixteenth Specialized Agency of the United Nations with headquarters in Vienna.

===Crisis and reform during the 1990s===
During the subsequent years, UNIDO continuously expanded particularly its operational activities. However, several developments outside and inside the Organization led to a crisis, which reached a breaking point in 1997 when UNIDO faced the risk of closure: After the end of the Cold War and the triumph of the market economic system over the command economic system, and in view of the Washington Consensus that limited the role of industrial policy in economic development processes, some Member States felt that industrial development could be supported more effectively and efficiently by the private sector. As a result, Canada, the United States (UNIDO&#x27;s then largest donor), and Australia subsequently withdrew from the Organization between 1993 and 1997. Simultaneously, the continued slowdown in the economies of some major industrialized countries as well as the financial turmoil of the 1997 Asian financial crisis caused multilateral development assistance to decline. In addition, a weak management structure and lack of focus and integration of UNIDO&#x27;s activities contributed to aggravating the crisis.

UNIDO&#x27;s Member States responded by adopting a stringent Business Plan on the Future Role and Functions of the Organization in June 1997. Activities laid out in the Business Plan are based on the clear comparative advantages of UNIDO, while avoiding overlap and duplication with other multilateral institutions. A key point was that activities should be integrated into packages of services, rather than being provided on a stand-alone basis. The Organization radically reformed itself on the basis of this business plan and streamlined its services, human and financial resources as well as internal processes during the following years.

===Post-reform role===
On the basis of sound finances and in a second wave of programmatic reforms in 2004, UNIDO further focused its activities and technical services directly responding to international development priorities. In an independent assessment of 23 international organizations against a large numbers of criteria, UNIDO was assessed 6th best overall and as best in the group of specialized agencies. In regard of the current UN Reform debate, it can be observed that UNIDO is actively contributing to UN system-wide coherence and cost efficiency.

===Membership===
Members of the UN, or of UN specialized agencies, or of the IAEA, are eligible for membership with UNIDO. The process of becoming a Member of the Organization is achieved by becoming a party to the Constitution. Observer status is open, upon request, to those enjoying such status in the General Assembly of the United Nations, unless the UNIDO General Conference decides otherwise. The Conference has the authority to invite other observers to participate in the work of the Organization in accordance with the relevant rules of procedure and the provisions of the Constitution.

As of 4 October 2024, 173 States are Members of UNIDO, all except State of Palestine of them being UN members. UNIDO Members are divided into four lists. List A consists of all UNIDO countries in the African + Asian Groups of UN (along with Israel, while excluding Cyprus and Japan). List B consists of all UNIDO countries in WEOG group of UN (along with Cyprus and Japan, and excluding Israel). List C consists of all UNIDO countries in GRULAC group of UN. List D consists of all UNIDO countries in the Eastern European group of UN.

The lists, originally defined in General Assembly resolution 2152 and the UNIDO Constitution serve to balance geographical distribution of member states&#x27; representation on the Industrial Development Board and the Programme and Budget Committee.

UNIDO is the one of the two UN specialized agencies where members are separated into groups while the other is IFAD. UNIDO List B, is similar to IFAD List A – which comprises primarily developed countries, while the set of the rest of UNIDO members is similar to the set of the rest of IFAD members – which comprise primarily developing countries.

The full lists are as follows:

Other UN member states that have never signed, ratified, or denounced the constitution are Andorra, Brunei, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Nauru, San Marino, and Singapore.

The Holy See and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta have observer status with UNIDO.

===Policy-making organs===
The policy-making organs (or governing bodies) of UNIDO are based on their predecessors that were effective prior to UNIDO becoming a specialized agency. Thus, the General Conference, the Industrial Development Board (IDB) and the Programme and Budget Committee (PBC) are anchored in the Constitution.

Substantive decisions of the policy-making organs are generally taken by consensus. A vote takes place when no consensus can be reached or on specific request of a member of the policy-making organ

====General Conference====
The Conference is the highest policy-making organ of the Organization and consists of all Member States of UNIDO. It meets every two years and approves the programme and budgets, establishes the scale assessments for regular budget expenditures for the forthcoming biennium and, every second time, appoints the Director-General for a period of four years.

====Industrial Development Board (IDB)====
The Board meets once in Conference years and twice in other years, and consists of 53 Member States of the Organization that are elected for a four-year term. It acts as a preparatory body for the Conference and reviews the implementation of the approved programme of work and of the corresponding regular and operational budgets for the forthcoming biennium. Among its other main functions, the Board recommends to the Conference a scale of assessments, as well as a candidate for the post of Director-General.

====Programme and Budget Committee (PBC)====
The Committee consists of 27 Member States of the Organization that are elected for a two-year term and meets at least once a year to consider, inter alia, the proposals of the Director-General for the programme of work and corresponding estimates for the regular and operational budgets.

===Secretariat===
The Secretariat of UNIDO is based in Vienna (Austria) and maintains representative offices in Brussels (Belgium), Geneva (Switzerland) and New York City (USA). As of 2013, UNIDO&#x27;s organizational structure comprises The Office of the Director-General (ODG), the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation Division (PTC), the Office of the Deputy to the Director General (DDG), the Programme Support and General Management Division (PSM) as well as offices of Internal Oversight and Legal Services.

The current Director-General of UNIDO is Gerd Müller (since December 2021).

==Country level representation==

===Field representation===
UNIDO&#x27;s system of field representation includes four categories of offices:
* Regional offices, which cover the country of their location as well as a number of countries in the same region, in which the Organization assumes the status of a non-resident agency
* Country Offices, which cover their host country
* Focal point offices maintained within national governments
* UNIDO Desks in UNDP offices.

===Technical offices at country level===
In order to provide additional support to UNIDO&#x27;s technical activities, different types of technical offices have been established. These include:
* &quot;Investment and Technology Promotion Offices (ITPOs)&quot;, which promote investment and technology flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, being financed by their host countries
* &quot;International Technology Centres&quot;, which act as catalysts for technology upgrading and assist in managing technology change
* In collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UNIDO set up a global network of &quot;National Cleaner Production Centres (NCPCs)&quot;, aiming at building national capacities in clean production technologies, fostering dialogue between industry and government and enhancing investments for transfer and development of environmentally sound technologies.
* UNIDO&#x27;s &quot;Industrial Subcontracting and Partnership Exchanges (SPX)&quot; facilitate production linkages between small, medium and large manufacturing firms and link up with global markets and supply chain networks.
* UNIDO &quot;Centres for South-South Cooperation&quot; as part of a major UNIDO South-South cooperation initiative in several of the more advanced developing countries.

<doc id="32316" wikidata="Q724775" url="?curid=32316" title="Unary numeral system">
<text>The unary numeral system is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers: to represent a number &quot;N&quot;, a symbol representing 1 is repeated &quot;N&quot; times.

In the unary system, the number 0 (zero) is represented by the empty string, that is, the absence of a symbol. Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... are represented in unary as 1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, ...

Unary is a bijective numeral system. However, although it has sometimes been described as &quot;base 1&quot;, it differs in some important ways from positional notations, in which the value of a digit depends on its position within a number. For instance, the unary form of a number can be exponentially longer than its representation in other bases.

The use of tally marks in counting is an application of the unary numeral system. For example, using the tally mark &#x27; (𝍷), the number 3 is represented as &#x27;. In East Asian cultures, the number 3 is represented as , a character drawn with three strokes. (One and two are represented similarly.) In China and Japan, the character 正, drawn with 5 strokes, is sometimes used to represent 5 as a tally.

Unary numbers should be distinguished from repunits, which are also written as sequences of ones but have their usual decimal numerical interpretation.

==Operations==
Addition and subtraction are particularly simple in the unary system, as they involve little more than string concatenation. The Hamming weight or population count operation that counts the number of nonzero bits in a sequence of binary values may also be interpreted as a conversion from unary to binary numbers. However, multiplication is more cumbersome and has often been used as a test case for the design of Turing machines.

==Complexity==
Compared to standard positional numeral systems, the unary system is inconvenient and hence is not used in practice for large calculations. It occurs in some decision problem descriptions in theoretical computer science (e.g. some P-complete problems), where it is used to &quot;artificially&quot; decrease the run-time or space requirements of a problem. For instance, the problem of integer factorization is suspected to require more than a polynomial function of the length of the input as run-time if the input is given in binary, but it only needs linear runtime if the input is presented in unary. However, this is potentially misleading. Using a unary input is slower for any given number, not faster; the distinction is that a binary (or larger base) input is proportional to the base 2 (or larger base) logarithm of the number while unary input is proportional to the number itself. Therefore, while the run-time and space requirement in unary looks better as function of the input size, it does not represent a more efficient solution.

In computational complexity theory, unary numbering is used to distinguish strongly NP-complete problems from problems that are NP-complete but not strongly NP-complete. A problem in which the input includes some numerical parameters is strongly NP-complete if it remains NP-complete even when the size of the input is made artificially larger by representing the parameters in unary. For such a problem, there exist hard instances for which all parameter values are at most polynomially large.

==Applications==
In addition to the application in tally marks, unary numbering is used as part of some data compression algorithms such as Golomb coding. It also forms the basis for the Peano axioms for formalizing arithmetic within mathematical logic.
A form of unary notation called Church encoding is used to represent numbers within lambda calculus.

Some email spam filters tag messages with a number of asterisks in an e-mail header such as &quot;X-Spam-Bar&quot; or &quot;X-SPAM-LEVEL&quot;. The larger the number, the more likely the email is considered spam. Using a unary representation instead of a decimal number lets the user search for messages with a given rating or higher. For example, searching for **** yield messages with a rating of at least 4.

<text>Universal Networking Language (UNL) is a declarative formal language specifically designed to represent semantic data extracted from natural language texts. It can be used as a pivot language in interlingual machine translation systems or as a knowledge representation language in information retrieval applications. 

== Structure ==
In UNL, the information conveyed by the natural language is represented sentence by sentence as a hypergraph composed of a set of directed binary labeled links between nodes or hypernodes. As an example, the English sentence &quot;The sky was blue?!&quot; can be represented in UNL as follows: 

In the example above, codice_1 and codice_2, which represent individual concepts, are UW&#x27;s attributes of an object directed to linking the semantic relation between the two UWs; &quot;@def&quot;, &quot;@interrogative&quot;, &quot;@past&quot;, &quot;@exclamation&quot; and &quot;@entry&quot; are attributes modifying UWs.

UWs are expressed in natural language to be humanly readable. They consist of a &quot;headword&quot; (the UW root) and a &quot;constraint list&quot; (the UW suffix between parentheses), where the constraints are used to disambiguate the general concept conveyed by the headword. The set of UWs is organized in the UNL Ontology. 

Relations are intended to represent semantic links between words in every existing language. They can be ontological (such as &quot;icl&quot; and &quot;iof&quot;), logical (such as &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot;), or thematic (such as &quot;agt&quot; = &quot;agent&quot;, &quot;ins&quot; = &quot;instrument&quot;, &quot;tim&quot; = &quot;time&quot;, &quot;plc&quot; = &quot;place&quot;, etc.). There are currently 46 relations in the UNL Specs that jointly define the UNL syntax.

Within the UNL program, the process of representing natural language sentences in UNL graphs is called &quot;UNLization&quot;, and the process of generating natural language sentences out of UNL graphs is called &quot;NLization&quot;. UNLization is intended to be carried out semi-automatically (i.e., by humans with computer aids), and NLization is intended to be carried out automatically.

== History ==
The UNL program started in 1996 as an initiative of the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) of the United Nations University (UNU) in Tokyo, Japan. In January 2001, the United Nations University set up an autonomous and non-profit organization, the UNDL Foundation, to be responsible for the development and management of the UNL program. It inherited from the UNU/IAS the mandate of implementing the UNL program.

The overall architecture of the UNL System has been developed with a set of basic software and tools. 

It was recognized by the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for the &quot;industrial applicability&quot; of the UNL, which was obtained in May 2002 through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO); the UNL acquired the US patents 6,704,700 and 7,107,206.

<doc id="32323" wikidata="Q186604" url="?curid=32323" title="Urea breath test">
<text>The urea breath test is a rapid diagnostic procedure used to identify infections by &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, a spiral bacterium implicated in gastritis, gastric ulcer, and peptic ulcer disease. It is based upon the ability of &quot;H. pylori&quot; to convert urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Urea breath tests are recommended in leading society guidelines as a preferred non-invasive choice for detecting &quot;H. pylori&quot; before and after treatment.

==Principles and mechanism==
Patients swallow urea labelled with an uncommon isotope, either radioactive carbon-14 (nowadays preferred in many countries) or non-radioactive carbon-13. In the subsequent 10–30 minutes, the detection of isotope-labelled carbon dioxide in exhaled breath indicates that the urea was split; this indicates that urease (the enzyme that &quot;H. pylori&quot; uses to metabolize urea to produce ammonia) is present in the stomach, and hence that &quot;H. pylori&quot; bacteria are present.

For the two different forms of urea, different instrumentation is required. Carbon-14 is normally measured by scintillation, whereas carbon-13 can be detected by isotope ratio mass spectrometry or simpler by nondispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometry. For each of these methods, a baseline breath sample is required before taking the isotope-labeled urea, for comparison with the post-urea sample, with a 15- to 30-minute duration between them. Samples may be sent to a reference laboratory for analysis. Alternatively, NDIR spectrometry can be performed by a table-top instrument as an office-based test, and results are provided immediately within minutes.

The difference between the pre- and post urea measurements is used to determine infection. This value is compared to a cut-off value. Results below the value are assumed to be negative, those above positive. The cut-off value itself is determined by comparing the results of patients with two or more different detection methods. The value is chosen that gives the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. Both carbon-14 and carbon-13 urea breath tests have high sensitivity and specificity, though the carbon-13 test is preferred in certain populations due to its non-radioactive nature.

The test measures active &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. If antibiotics are depressing the amount of &quot;H. pylori&quot; present, or the stomach conditions are less acidic than normal, the amount of urease present will be lessened.

Accordingly, the test should only be performed 14 days after stopping acid reducing medication (proton pump inhibitors, PPI) or 28 days after stopping antibiotic treatment. Some clinicians believe that a reservoir of &quot;H. pylori&quot; in dental plaque can affect the result.

The test is especially done accompanying an eradication therapy by antibiotics (to avoid overdosing) or to check the success of an ulcer operation. In both cases, immunological tests can give false positive results.

<text>United States naval reactors are nuclear reactors used by the United States Navy aboard certain ships to generate the steam used to produce power for propulsion, electric power, catapulting airplanes in aircraft carriers, and a few minor uses. Such naval nuclear reactors have a complete power plant associated with them. All commissioned U.S. Navy submarines and supercarriers built since 1975 are nuclear powered, with the last conventional carrier, , being decommissioned in May 2009. The U.S. Navy also had nine nuclear-powered cruisers with such reactors, but they have since been decommissioned also. 

Reactors are designed by a number of contractors, then developed and tested at one of several Department of Energy-owned and prime contractor-operated facilities: Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania and its associated Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho, and Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Niskayuna, New York and its associated Kesselring site in West Milton, New York, all under the management of the office of Naval Reactors. Sometimes there were full-scale nuclear-powered prototype plants built at the Naval Reactors Facility, Kesselring, and Windsor (in Connecticut) to test the nuclear plants, which were operated for years to train nuclear-qualified sailors.

== Reactor designations ==
Each reactor design is given a three-character designation consisting of:
* A letter for the type of ship the reactor is intended for (&quot;A&quot; for aircraft carrier, &quot;C&quot; for cruiser, &quot;D&quot; for destroyer, and &quot;S&quot; for submarine)
* A consecutive generation number
* A letter for the reactor&#x27;s designer (&quot;W&quot; for Westinghouse, &quot;G&quot; for General Electric, &quot;C&quot; for Combustion Engineering, and &quot;B&quot; for Bechtel)

For example, a S9G reactor represents a submarine (S), ninth-generation (9), General Electric designed reactor (G).

== History ==
Conceptual analysis of nuclear marine propulsion started in the 1940s. Research on developing nuclear reactors for the Navy was done at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania starting in 1948. Under the long-term leadership of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the first test reactor plant, a prototype referred to as S1W, started up in U.S. in 1953 at the Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho. Bettis Laboratory and Naval Reactors Facility were operated initially and for many decades afterwards by Westinghouse. The first nuclear-powered vessel, the submarine , put to sea in 1955. USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; marked the beginning of the transition of submarines from relatively slow and short-ranged conventional submarines to ones capable of sustaining submerged for weeks on end.

Much of the early development work on naval reactors was done at the Naval Reactors Facility on the campus of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL, previously INEL). USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; was powered by the S2W reactor, and crew were trained on the land-based S1W reactor at INL.

The second nuclear submarine was , which was initially powered by a sodium-cooled S2G reactor, and supported by the land-based S1G reactor at the Kesselring site under Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory operated by General Electric. A spare S2G was also built but never used.

USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; was plagued by superheater problems, with the result that USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; delivered far superior performance. This and the risks posed by liquid sodium in the event of an accident at sea led Admiral Rickover to select the pressurized water reactor (PWR) as the standard U.S. naval reactor type. The S2G was removed from USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; and replaced by the S2Wa reactor, using components from the spare S2W that was part of the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; program. All subsequent U.S. naval reactors have been PWRs, while the Soviet Navy used mainly PWRs, but also used lead-bismuth cooled liquid metal cooled reactors (LMFR) of three types in eight submarines: and the seven-member .

Experience with USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; led to the parallel development of further () submarines, powered by single reactors, and an aircraft carrier, , powered by eight A2W reactor units in 1960. A cruiser, , followed in 1961 and was powered by two C1W reactor units. USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; remained in service for over 50 years, and was inactivated in 2012.

Full-scale land-based prototype plants in Idaho, New York, and Connecticut preceded development of several types (generations) of U.S. naval nuclear reactors, although not all of them. After initial construction, some engineering testing was done and the prototypes were used to train nuclear-qualified sailors for many years afterwards. For example, the A1W prototype at Naval Reactors Facility led to development of A2W reactors used in USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. By 1962, the US Navy had 26 nuclear submarines operational and 30 under construction. Nuclear power had revolutionized the U.S. Navy.

The technology was shared with the United Kingdom, while technological development in France, China and the Soviet Union proceeded separately.

After the &quot;Skate&quot;-class vessels, reactor development proceeded and in the U.S. a single series of standardized designs was built by both Westinghouse and General Electric, with one reactor powering each vessel. Rolls-Royce built similar units as the PWR1 for Royal Navy submarines and then developed the design further to the PWR2. Numerous submarines with an S5W reactor plant were built.

At the end of the Cold War in 1989, there were over 400 nuclear-powered submarines operational or being built. Some 250 of these submarines have now been scrapped and some on order canceled, due to weapons reduction programs. The Russian Navy and United States Navy had over one hundred each, with the United Kingdom and France less than twenty each and China six. The total today is about 160.

The United States is the main navy with nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (10), while Russia has nuclear-powered cruisers. Russia has eight nuclear icebreakers in service or building. Since its inception in 1948, the U.S. Navy nuclear program has developed 27 different plant designs, installed them in 210 nuclear-powered ships, taken 500 reactor cores into operation, and accumulated over 5,400 reactor years of operation and 128,000,000 miles safely steamed. Additionally, 98 nuclear submarines and six nuclear cruisers have been recycled. The U.S. Navy has never disclosed a reactor accident, but has suffered at least one coolant loss accident, on the USS Guardfish.

All nine of the U.S. Navy nuclear-powered cruisers (CGN) have now been stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and those not already scrapped by recycling are scheduled to be recycled. While reactor accidents have not sunk any U.S. Navy ships or submarines, two nuclear-powered submarines, and were lost at sea. The condition of these reactors has not been publicly released, although both wrecks have been investigated by Robert Ballard on behalf of the Navy using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).

Congress has mandated that the U.S. Navy consider nuclear power as an option on all large surface combatants (cruisers, destroyers) and amphibious assault ships. If proven cost-effective in a life cycle cost analysis during the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) phase of preliminary ship design, new ship classes (e.g. CG(X)) could proceed with nuclear propulsion.

==Power plants==
Current U.S. naval reactors are all pressurized water reactors, which are identical to PWR commercial reactors producing electricity, except that:

* They have a high power density in a small volume and run either on low-enriched uranium (as do some French and Chinese submarines) or on highly enriched uranium (&gt;20% U-235, current U.S. submarines use fuel enriched to at least 93%)
* They have long core lives, so that refueling is needed only after 10 or more years, and new cores are designed to last 25 years in carriers and 10–33 years in submarines,
* The design enables a compact pressure vessel while maintaining safety.
Long core life is enabled by high uranium enrichment and by incorporating a &quot;burnable neutron poison&quot;, which is progressively depleted as non-burnable poisons like fission products and actinides accumulate. The loss of burnable poison counterbalances the creation of non-burnable poisons and result in stable long term fuel efficiency.

Long-term integrity of the compact reactor pressure vessel is maintained by providing an internal neutron shield. (This is in contrast to early Soviet civil PWR designs where embrittlement occurs due to neutron bombardment of a very narrow pressure vessel.)

Reactor sizes range up to ~500 MWt (about 165 MWe) in the larger submarines and surface ships. The French s have a 48 MW reactor that needs no refueling for 30 years.

The nuclear navies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation rely on steam turbine propulsion. Those of the French and Chinese use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion. Most Russian submarines as well as all U.S. surface ships since &quot;Enterprise&quot; are powered by two or more reactors. U.S., British, French, Chinese and Indian submarines are powered by one.

Decommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for American and Russian navies. After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste (see the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program).

<text>USS &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; (SSN-685) was a unique nuclear-powered attack submarine of the United States Navy.

The submarine was named after Glenard P. Lipscomb, who served as a representative from California&#x27;s 24th congressional district from 1953 until his death in 1970.

==Design==
&quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was developed under project SCB 302.68. She was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s second submarine design using a turbo-electric transmission; the first was the smaller . &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was intended to test the potential advantages of this propulsion system for providing quieter and safer operation for a full sized attack submarine (safer because reverse thrust would be instantaneous with reversal of the direct current engine&#x27;s electric polarity). The &quot;Tullibee&quot; plant had to be scaled up by a factor of six, which resulted in a displacement of 6,400 tons and a length of . &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb &quot; was thus larger than similar vessels with conventional drive trains, which resulted in slower speeds due to the greater displacement and wetted area. Her unique turbo-electric drive system was unreliable due to the decision to adopt a direct-current main motor. Subsequent U.S. submarine designs did not incorporate turbo-electric drive until the s. Other than the engine room, &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was generally similar to the , and although serving as a test platform she was a fully combat-capable attack submarine.

==Construction==
Construction of &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; began on 5 June 1971 at the Electric Boat Company shipyard in Groton, Connecticut. Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird, a long-time colleague and friend of Glenard Lipscomb, spoke at the keel-laying ceremony. &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was launched on 4 August 1973, sponsored by Mrs. Glenard P. Lipscomb, and was commissioned on 21 December 1974.

==Career==
&quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; deployed to the North Atlantic in the fall of 1976, followed immediately by a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in the winter and spring of 1977. The boat was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

The submarine deployed to the North Atlantic in the winter and spring of 1978. &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in the winter and spring of 1979.

&quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was awarded the Commander, Submarine Development Squadron Twelve, Battle Efficiency [White] &quot;E&quot; and Engineering Excellence [Red] &quot;E&quot; for Fiscal Years 1977, 1978 under the command of Commander Robert B. Wilkinson and 1979, and 1980 under the command of Commander Thomas Robertson.

In 1987, she was involved in a collision with a tugboat in the Cooper River at Naval Weapons Station Charleston. Suffering slight damage to her towed array housing and propeller, she was required to spend an extra week in drydock to facilitate repairs. There were no injuries aboard the submarine; however, the tugboat sank as a result of the collision.

&quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 July 1990 and disposed of under the submarine recycling program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 1 December 1997. Her active duty career of less than 16 years is one of the shortest for a nuclear submarine in the US Navy.

<text>The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA ; ; ) is one of six continental bodies of governance in association football. It governs football, futsal and beach football in Europe and the transcontinental countries of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kazakhstan, as well as the West Asian countries of Cyprus, Armenia and Israel. UEFA consists of 55 national association members. Since 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA and UEFA suspended all Russian national teams and clubs from any FIFA and UEFA competitions.

UEFA consists of the national football associations of Europe, and runs national and club competitions including the European Championship, Nations League, Champions League, Europa League, Conference League, and Super Cup, and also controls the prize money, regulations, as well as media rights to those competitions.

Henri Delaunay acted as the first general secretary and Ebbe Schwartz as the first president. The current president is Aleksander Čeferin, a former Football Association of Slovenia president, who was elected as UEFA&#x27;s seventh president at the 12th Extraordinary UEFA Congress in Athens in September 2016, and automatically became a vice-president of the world body FIFA.

== History and membership ==
UEFA was officially inaugurated on 15 June 1954 in Basel, Switzerland after consultation between the Italian, French, and Belgian associations. At the founding meeting, 25 members were present. However, six other associations which were not present were still recognised as founding members, bringing the total of founding associations to 31. UEFA grew to more than 50 members by the mid-1990s, as new associations were born out of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia into their constituent states. UEFA&#x27;s main headquarters after its foundation were located in Paris, but moved to Bern in 1960. Finally, they moved to Nyon, Switzerland, in 1995, opening the organisation&#x27;s current headquarters in 1999. 

;Current members
UEFA membership coincides for the most part with recognition as a sovereign country in Europe (48 out of 55 members are sovereign UN member states), although there are some exceptions. One UN member state (Monaco) and one UN General Assembly non-member observer state (Vatican City) are not members. Some UEFA members are not sovereign states, but form part of a larger recognised sovereign state in the context of international law. These include England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales (UK constituent countries), Gibraltar (UK overseas territory), Faroe Islands (Danish Realm), and Kosovo (state with limited recognition), however, in the context of these countries, government functions concerning sport tend to be carried at the territorial level coterminous with the UEFA member entity. UEFA have previously declined membership to those deemed as non-sovereign countries like Jersey.

Some UEFA members are transcontinental states (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) and others are considered part of Europe both culturally and politically (Turkey, Cyprus and Armenia). Countries which had been members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) were also admitted to the European football association, such as Israel (because it had been banned from the AFC group in 1974) and Kazakhstan. Involving clubs, some UEFA member associations allow teams from outside their association&#x27;s main territory to take part in their &quot;domestic&quot; competition, for example, AS Monaco in the French League, Welsh clubs Cardiff City or Swansea City in the English League, or Derry City, situated in Northern Ireland, plays in the Republic of Ireland-based League of Ireland.

On 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and in accordance with a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the UEFA suspended the participation of Russia. The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the UEFA ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the ban. On 26 September 2023 the ban was lifted for the Russia U-17 team enabling them to complete in the 2024 Euro U-17 with UEFA saying &quot;by banning children from our competitions, we not only fail to recognise and uphold a fundamental right for their holistic development but we directly discriminate against them&quot;. The lifting of the ban also applied to all teams, men and women, of underage players. This was rejected by the FA of Ukraine, England, and Sweden, with all three threatening to boycott matches against Russia.

;Europe&#x27;s Big Five
Five of the UEFA national teams, Germany, Italy, France, England and Spain, have won 12 out of 22 FIFA World Cups for Europe. These five nations also make up the so-called «Europe&#x27;s Big Five», consisting of Spain&#x27;s La Liga, England&#x27;s Premier League, Germany&#x27;s Bundesliga, Italy&#x27;s Serie A and France&#x27;s Ligue 1.

UEFA runs official international competitions in Europe and some countries of Northern, Southwestern and Central Asia for national teams and professional clubs, known as &quot;UEFA competitions&quot;, some of which are regarded as the world&#x27;s most prestigious tournaments.

UEFA is the organiser of two of the most prestigious competitions in international football: The UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. The main competition for men&#x27;s national teams is the UEFA European Championship (also known as the Euro), which started in 1958, with the first finals in 1960, and was known as the European Nations Cup until 1964. The UEFA Nations League is the second tournament of UEFA and was introduced in 2018. The tournament largely replaced the international friendly matches previously played on the FIFA International Match Calendar. It will be played every two years.

UEFA also runs national competitions at Under-21, Under-19 and Under-17 levels. For women&#x27;s national teams, UEFA operates the UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship for senior national sides as well as Women&#x27;s Under-19 and Women&#x27;s Under-17 Championships.

=== World, Olympic and intercontinental competitions ===
Intercontinental national teams:
*CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions
*Women&#x27;s Finalissima
*Futsal Finalissima
&quot;Defunct&quot;
*UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup

Intercontinental clubs:
*UEFA–CONMEBOL Club Challenge
*Under-20 Intercontinental Cup
&quot;Defunct&quot;
*Intercontinental Champions&#x27; Supercup
*Intercontinental Cup
Beside continental European competitions for national and their junior teams, the UEFA organizes various qualification male and female tournaments among European national and their junior teams for World Cups (organized by FIFA) and Olympics (organized by IOC).

UEFA also organised the UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup with CAF for youth teams in an effort to boost youth football. UEFA launched the UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup, for semi-professional teams representing their local region, in 1999. In futsal there is the UEFA Futsal Championship and UEFA Under-19 Futsal Championship. Despite the existence of UEFA&#x27;s Futsal &quot;and&quot; Beach soccer committee, UEFA does not organise any beach soccer competitions. International and club beach soccer competitions for UEFA members are organised externally by Beach Soccer Worldwide.

The Italian, German, Spanish, French and Russian men&#x27;s national teams are the only teams to have won the European football championship in all categories.

=== Club ===

The top-ranked UEFA competition is the UEFA Champions League, which started in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup (or simply the European Cup) and initially only gathered the top team of each country; this competition has since been expanded to gather the top 1–4 teams of each country&#x27;s league (the number of teams depend on that country&#x27;s ranking and can be upgraded or downgraded).

A second, lower-ranked competition is the UEFA Europa League. This competition, for national knockout cup winners and high-placed league teams, was launched by UEFA in 1971 as a successor of both the former UEFA Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (also began in 1955). A third competition, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, which started in 1960, was absorbed into the UEFA Cup (now UEFA Europa League) in 1999.

In December 2018, UEFA announced the creation of a third club competition, later named the UEFA Europa Conference League. The competition features 32 teams in 8 groups of 4, with a knockout round between the second placed teams in Europa Conference League and the third placed teams in the Europa League, leading to a final 16 knockout stage featuring the eight group winners. The first edition of the competition was played in 2021–2022.

In women&#x27;s football UEFA also conducts the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League for club teams. The competition was first held in 2001, and was known as the UEFA Women&#x27;s Cup until 2009.

The UEFA Super Cup pits the winners of the Champions League against the winners of the Europa League (previously the winners of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup), and came into being in 1973.

The UEFA Intertoto Cup was a summer competition, previously operated by several Central European football associations, which was relaunched and recognised as official UEFA club competition by UEFA in 1995. The last Intertoto Cup took place in 2008.

The European/South American Cup was jointly organised with CONMEBOL between the Champions League and the Copa Libertadores winners.

Only five teams (Juventus, Ajax, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea) have won each of the three main competitions (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup/UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League), a feat that is no longer possible for any team that did not win the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. There are currently eight teams throughout Europe that have won two of the three trophies; all but one have won the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, four require a win in the Champions League and four require a UEFA Europa League win.

Until the first staging of the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2022, Juventus of Italy was the only team in Europe to win all UEFA&#x27;s official championships and cups and, in commemoration of achieving that feat, have received &quot;The UEFA Plaque&quot; by the Union of European Football Associations on 12 July 1988.

UEFA&#x27;s premier futsal competition is the UEFA Futsal Cup, a tournament started in 2001 which replaced the former Futsal European Clubs Championship. This event, despite enjoying a long and well-established tradition in the European futsal community, dating back to 1984, was never recognised as official by UEFA.

There was an attempt to create a Europa League-style second tier women&#x27;s club competition, which began in discussion in 2021. In December 2023, the attempt came into a fruition, with the first edition of the competition to be played in 2025–26. In December 2024, the name of the competition, &quot;UEFA Women&#x27;s Europa Cup&quot;, was announced.

== Corruption and controversy ==
Dissatisfied fans across Europe have referred to the organisation as &quot;UEFA mafia&quot;, including in Russia&#x27;s top league, in Bulgaria&#x27;s top league, and in a Champions League group stage match held in Sweden. The term has also been covered for its use outside of stadiums, for example during a protest in Kosovo outside an EU building following the Serbia v Albania (UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying) match. F.C. Copenhagen supporters displayed banners around the city, with slogans such as &quot;UEFA MAFIA – THE PANDEMIC OF FOOTBALL&quot;, when UEFA ordered their 2019–20 Europa League round of 16 return leg be played behind closed doors, despite reduced capacity being allowed by the Danish government.

Following the 2015 FIFA corruption case, the then-president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was also involved in the case. Swiss prosecutors accused FIFA president Sepp Blatter of making a &quot;disloyal payment&quot; of $2m (£1.6m) to Mr Platini. Swiss attorney general, , stated: &quot;We didn&#x27;t interview Mr Platini as a witness, that&#x27;s not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person&quot;. Both Platini and Sepp Blatter were banned from football-related activity. Platini appealed to Court of Arbitration for Sports, which lowered the six-year ban to four years. He further appealed to Swiss courts and the European Court of Human Rights but the courts rejected his appeals.

In 2019 UEFA&#x27;s decision to host Europa League Cup final in Baku, Azerbaijan left one of the finalists, Arsenal, with a decision to withdraw their Armenian player Henrikh Mkhitaryan out of the competition due to safety concerns, and there has been long-standing debates about the extent to which the elite clubs or UEFA itself should exert the most influence on the game. UEFA&#x27;s decision to partner with blockchain company Chiliz in February 2022 was criticised and described as &#x27;incomprehensible&#x27; by fan groups across Europe.

<doc id="32333" wikidata="Q3253199" url="?curid=32333" title="Coins of the United States dollar">
<text>Coins of the United States dollar – aside from those of the earlier Continental currency – were first minted in 1792. New coins have been produced annually and they comprise a significant aspect of the United States currency system. Circulating coins exist in denominations of 1¢ (i.e. 1 cent or $0.01), 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢, and $1.00. Also minted are bullion, including gold, silver and platinum, and commemorative coins. All of these are produced by the United States Mint. The coins are then sold to Federal Reserve Banks which in turn put coins into circulation and withdraw them as demanded by the United States economy.

==Current coinage==
Four mints currently operate in the United States, producing billions of coins each year. The main mint is the Philadelphia Mint, which produces circulating coinage, mint sets and commemorative coins. The Denver Mint also produces circulating coinage, mint sets and commemoratives. The San Francisco Mint produces regular and silver proof coinage, and produced circulating coinage until the 1970s. The West Point Mint produces bullion coinage (including proofs). Philadelphia and Denver produce the dies used at all of the mints. The proof and mint sets are manufactured each year and contain examples of all of the year&#x27;s circulating coins.

The producing mint of each coin may be easily identified, as most coins bear a mint mark. The identifying letter of the mint can be found on the front side of most coins, and is often placed near the year. Unmarked coins are issued by the Philadelphia mint. Among marked coins, Philadelphia coins bear a letter P. Denver coins bear a letter D, San Francisco coins bear a letter S, and West Point coins bear a letter W. S and W coins are rarely found in general circulation, although S coins bearing dates prior to the mid-1970s are in circulation. The CC, O, C, and D mint marks were used on gold and silver coins for various periods from the mid-19th century until the early 20th century by temporary mints in Carson City, Nevada; New Orleans, Louisiana; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dahlonega, Georgia. Most such coins that still exist are now in the hands of collectors and museums.

===Coins in circulation===
====Remarks====


# The mass and composition of the cent changed to the current copper-plated zinc core in 1982. Both types were minted in 1982 with no distinguishing mark. Cents minted in 1943 were struck on planchets punched from zinc-coated steel which left the resulting edges uncoated. This caused many of these coins to rust. These &quot;steel pennies&quot; are not likely to be found in circulation today, as they were later intentionally removed from circulation for recycling the metal and by collectors. However, cents minted from 1944 to 1946 were made from salvaged WWII ammunition shells, making a special brass composition to replace the steel cents, but still save material for the war effort, and are more common in circulation than their 1943 counterparts.
# The wheat cent was mainstream and common during its time. Some dates are rare, but many can still be found in circulation. This is partially due to the fact that unlike the formerly silver denominations (dollar, half dollar, quarter, and dime), the composition of the pre-1982 cent, nearly pure copper, is not so much more valuable over face value for it to be hoarded to the extreme extent of the silver denominations.
# Nickels produced from mid-1942 through 1945 were manufactured from 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. This allowed the saved nickel metal to be shifted to industrial production of military supplies during World War II. Few of these are still found in circulation.
# Prior to 1965 and passage of the Coinage Act of 1965 the composition of the dime, quarter, half-dollar and dollar coins was 90% silver and 10% copper. The half-dollar continued to be minted in a 40% silver-clad composition between 1965 and 1970. Dimes and quarters from before 1965 and half-dollars from before 1971 are generally not in circulation due to being removed for their silver content. Some modern commemorative coins have been minted in the silver dollar denominations.
# In 1975 and 1976 U.S. Bicentennial coinage was minted. Regardless of date of coining, each coin bears the dual date &quot;1776-1976&quot;. The Quarter-Dollar, Half-Dollar and Dollar coins were issued in the copper 91.67% nickel 8.33% composition for general circulation and the Government issued six-coin Proof Set. A special three-coin set of 40% silver coins were also issued by the U.S. Mint in both Uncirculated and Proof.
# Use of the half-dollar is not as widespread as that of other coins in general circulation; most Americans use dollar coins, quarters, dimes, nickels and cents only, as these are the only coins most often found in general circulation. When found, many 50¢ coins are quickly hoarded, spent, or brought to banks. As large numbers of half dollars are typically held by banks or available to order, they are often sought after by coin roll hunters for the purpose of searching for silver coins, proofs, and coins not intended for circulation.
# The Presidential Dollar series features portraits of all deceased U.S. Presidents with four coin designs issued each year in the order of the president&#x27;s inauguration date. These coins began circulating on February 15, 2007. Starting 2012, these coins have been minted only for collectible sets because of a large stockpile.
# The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was minted from 1979 to 1981 and 1999. The 1999 minting was in response to Treasury supplies of the dollar becoming depleted and the inability to accelerate the minting of the Sacagawea dollars by a year. 1981 Anthony dollars can sometimes be found in circulation from proof sets that were broken open, but these dollars were not minted with the intent that they circulate.
# Although dollar coins have not been struck for circulation since the Sacagawea and Presidential dollar runs ending in 2011, the continuing Native American dollar series and the newer American Innovation dollar series are considered circulation coins by the US Mint.
# Since 2019, each American Innovation dollar coin features a different privy mark, changed annually, located just below &quot;IN GOD WE TRUST&quot;.

===Bullion coins===
Non-circulating bullion coins have been produced each year since 1986. They can be found in gold, silver, platinum (since 1997), and palladium (since 2017). The face value of these coins is legal as tender, but does not actually reflect the value of the precious metal contained therein. On May 11, 2011, Utah became the first state to accept these coins as the value of the precious metal in common transactions. The Utah State Treasurer assigns a numerical precious metal value to these coins each week based on the spot metal prices. The bullion coin types include &quot;S&quot; (San Francisco, 1986–1992), &quot;P&quot; (Philadelphia, 1993 – 2000), and &quot;W&quot; (West Point, New York, 2001–present).

===Commemorative coins===
Modern commemoratives have been minted since 1982. A list is available here.

Note: It is a common misconception that &quot;eagle&quot;-based nomenclature for gold U.S. coinage was merely slang. The &quot;eagle,&quot; &quot;half-eagle&quot; and &quot;quarter-eagle&quot; were specifically given these names in the Coinage Act of 1792. Likewise, the double eagle was specifically created as such by name (&quot;An Act to authorize the Coinage of Gold Dollars and Double Eagles&quot;, title and section 1, March 3, 1849).

==Mill coins==
Although the term mill (also mil or mille) was defined in the eighteenth century as of a dollar or 0.1¢, no coin smaller than 0.5¢ has ever been officially minted in the U.S. However, unofficial mill coins, also called &quot;tenth cent&quot; or &quot;tax-help coins&quot;, made of diverse materials—plastic, wood, tin, and others—were produced as late as the 1960s by some states, localities, and private businesses for tax payments and to render change for small purchases.

==Legal protections==

The alteration or lightening of U.S. coins for fraudulent purposes is illegal. It is generally legal to melt down coins for the use of their constituent metals, but the Treasury Department has occasionally prohibited melting down and mass exportation when the value of the metal exceeds the face value of the coin. This has happened from 1967 to 1969 for silver coins, from 1974 to 1978 for pennies, and since 2006 for pennies and nickels. The use of elongated coin presses is considered legal because it is not for fraudulent purposes.

<doc id="32336" wikidata="Q517439" url="?curid=32336" title="Unified Team at the Olympics">
<text>The Unified Team () was the name used for the sports team of the former Soviet Union 
(except the Baltic states) at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The IOC country code was EUN, after the French name, Équipe unifiée. The Unified Team was sometimes informally called the CIS Team (Commonwealth of Independent States, as a counterpart of CIS national football team taking part in Euro 1992 of the same year), although Georgia did not join the CIS until 1993.

The team finished second in the medal table at the 1992 Winter Games, and first at the 1992 Summer Games, edging its old rival the US in the latter.

==Ceremonies procedures==
At the 1992 Winter Olympics, the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the constituent countries had not yet been affiliated to the IOC due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union having only taken place little more than two months prior. During the opening ceremony, the team&#x27;s placard displayed &quot;Équipe unifiée&quot; in large print, with the names of the five participating countries displayed in smaller print below, and both the French and English announcers announced only the names of the participating countries without announcing the name &quot;Unified Team&quot;. Russian flagbearer Valeriy Medvedtsev followed, carrying the Olympic Flag, followed by the team&#x27;s athletes in no particular order, each carrying a small flag representing their individual country.

By the time of the 1992 Summer Olympics, the NOCs had affiliated separately, though they fielded a joint team with a standard uniform as Olympic qualifying rounds had been completed before the final demise of the Soviet Union. During the opening ceremony, the team&#x27;s four-sided placard displayed &quot;Unified Team&quot; in the four official languages (French, English, Spanish, and Catalan), followed by Russian flagbearer Aleksandr Karelin carrying the Olympic Flag, followed by three more four-sided placards displaying the 12 constituent countries in English, followed by 12 flagbearers carrying the national flags of the 12 countries, followed by the athletes, all in no particular order. The announcers announced the name &quot;Unified Team&quot; in multiple languages, followed by the Spanish announcer announcing all 12 countries. During medals ceremonies, where an EUN individual won a medal, the national flag of the medalist&#x27;s nation was raised rather than the Olympic flag, and a gold medalist&#x27;s national anthem was played rather than the Olympic Hymn. In team events, the EUN team continued to use the Olympic flag and the Olympic Hymn, as team members represented different nations.

== Participating countries ==
While only five of the EUN countries took part in the 1992 Winter Olympics, all twelve participated in the 1992 Summer Olympics. At the 1994 Winter Olympics and the 1996 Summer Olympics, the nations that were part of the Unified Team started to make their Olympic debuts as independent countries.

<text>In mathematics, a real function formula_1 of real numbers is said to be uniformly continuous if there is a positive real number formula_2 such that function values over any function domain interval of the size formula_2 are as close to each other as we want. In other words, for a uniformly continuous real function of real numbers, if we want function value differences to be less than any positive real number formula_4, then there is a positive real number formula_2 such that formula_6 for any formula_7 and formula_8 in any interval of length formula_2 within the domain of formula_1. 

The difference between uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is that, in uniform continuity there is a globally applicable formula_2 (the size of a function domain interval over which function value differences are less than formula_4) that depends on only formula_13, while in (ordinary) continuity there is a locally applicable formula_2 that depends on both formula_13 and formula_7. So uniform continuity is a stronger continuity condition than continuity; a function that is uniformly continuous is continuous but a function that is continuous is not necessarily uniformly continuous. The concepts of uniform continuity and continuity can be expanded to functions defined between metric spaces. 

Continuous functions can fail to be uniformly continuous if they are unbounded on a bounded domain, such as formula_17 on formula_18, or if their slopes become unbounded on an infinite domain, such as formula_19 on the real (number) line. However, any Lipschitz map between metric spaces is uniformly continuous, in particular any isometry (distance-preserving map). 

Although continuity can be defined for functions between general topological spaces, defining uniform continuity requires more structure. The concept relies on comparing the sizes of neighbourhoods of distinct points, so it requires a metric space, or more generally a uniform space.

== Definition for functions on metric spaces ==
For a function formula_20 with metric spaces formula_21 and formula_22, the following definitions of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity hold.

=== Definition of uniform continuity ===

* formula_1 is called uniformly continuous if for every real number formula_24 there exists a real number formula_25 such that for every formula_26 with formula_27, we have formula_28. The set formula_29 for each formula_30 is a neighbourhood of formula_30 and the set formula_32 for each formula_33 is a neighbourhood of formula_33 by the definition of a neighbourhood in a metric space.
** If formula_35 and formula_36 are subsets of the real line, then formula_37 and formula_38 can be the standard one-dimensional Euclidean distance, yielding the following definition: for every real number formula_24 there exists a real number formula_25 such that for every formula_26, formula_42 (where formula_43 is a material conditional statement saying &quot;if formula_44, then formula_45&quot;).
* Equivalently, formula_1 is said to be uniformly continuous if formula_47. Here quantifications (formula_48, formula_49, formula_50, and formula_51) are used.
* Equivalently, formula_1 is uniformly continuous if it admits a modulus of continuity.

=== Definition of (ordinary) continuity ===

* formula_1 is called continuous formula_54 if for every real number formula_24 there exists a real number formula_25 such that for every formula_57 with formula_27, we have formula_28. The set formula_29 is a neighbourhood of formula_30. Thus, (ordinary) continuity is a local property of the function at the point formula_30.
* Equivalently, a function formula_1 is said to be continuous if formula_64.
* Alternatively, a function formula_1 is said to be continuous if there is a function of all positive real numbers formula_13 and formula_67, formula_68 representing the maximum positive real number, such that at each formula_7 if formula_70 satisfies formula_71 then formula_28. At every formula_7, formula_68 is a monotonically non-decreasing function.

== Local continuity versus global uniform continuity ==
In the definitions, the difference between uniform continuity and continuity is that, in uniform continuity there is a globally applicable formula_2 (the size of a neighbourhood in formula_35 over which values of the metric for function values in formula_36 are less than formula_13) that depends on only formula_13 while in continuity there is a locally applicable formula_2 that depends on the both formula_13 and formula_7. Continuity is a &quot;local&quot; property of a function — that is, a function formula_1 is continuous, or not, at a particular point formula_7 of the function domain formula_85, and this can be determined by looking at only the values of the function in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of that point. When we speak of a function being continuous on an interval, we mean that the function is continuous at every point of the interval. In contrast, uniform continuity is a &quot;global&quot; property of formula_1, in the sense that the standard definition of uniform continuity refers to every point of formula_85. On the other hand, it is possible to give a definition that is &quot;local&quot; in terms of the natural extension formula_88(the characteristics of which at nonstandard points are determined by the global properties of formula_1), although it is not possible to give a local definition of uniform continuity for an arbitrary hyperreal-valued function, see below.

A mathematical definition that a function formula_1 is continuous on an interval formula_91 and a definition that formula_1 is uniformly continuous on formula_91 are structurally similar as shown in the following.

Continuity of a function formula_94 for metric spaces formula_21 and formula_22 at every point &quot;formula_7&quot; of an interval formula_98 (i.e., continuity of formula_1 on the interval formula_91) is expressed by a formula starting with quantifications
: formula_101,
(metrics formula_102 and formula_103 are formula_104 and formula_105 for formula_106 for the set of real numbers formula_107).

For uniform continuity, the order of the first, second, and third quantifications (formula_108, formula_109, and formula_110) are rotated:
: formula_111.
Thus for continuity on the interval, one takes an arbitrary point formula_7 of the interval&quot;,&quot; and then there must exist a distance formula_2,
: formula_114
while for uniform continuity, a single formula_2 must work uniformly for all points formula_7 of the interval,
: formula_117

== Properties ==

Every uniformly continuous function is continuous, but the converse does not hold. Consider for instance the continuous function formula_118 where formula_119 is the set of real numbers. Given a positive real number formula_13, uniform continuity requires the existence of a positive real number formula_2 such that for all formula_122 with formula_123, we have formula_124. But
: formula_125
and as formula_7 goes to be a higher and higher value, formula_2 needs to be lower and lower to satisfy formula_128 for positive real numbers formula_129 and the given formula_13. This means that there is no specifiable (no matter how small it is) positive real number formula_2 to satisfy the condition for formula_1 to be uniformly continuous so formula_1 is not uniformly continuous.

Any absolutely continuous function (over a compact interval) is uniformly continuous. On the other hand, the Cantor function is uniformly continuous but not absolutely continuous.

The image of a totally bounded subset under a uniformly continuous function is totally bounded. However, the image of a bounded subset of an arbitrary metric space under a uniformly continuous function need not be bounded: as a counterexample, consider the identity function from the integers endowed with the discrete metric to the integers endowed with the usual Euclidean metric.

The Heine–Cantor theorem asserts that &quot;every continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous&quot;. In particular, &quot;if a function is continuous on a closed bounded interval of the real line, it is uniformly continuous on that interval&quot;. The Darboux integrability of continuous functions follows almost immediately from this theorem.

If a real-valued function formula_1 is continuous on formula_135 and formula_136 exists (and is finite), then formula_1 is uniformly continuous. In particular, every element of formula_138, the space of continuous functions on formula_119 that vanish at infinity, is uniformly continuous. This is a generalization of the Heine-Cantor theorem mentioned above, since formula_140.

== Examples and nonexamples ==

=== Examples ===
* Linear functions formula_141 are the simplest examples of uniformly continuous functions.
* Any continuous function on the interval formula_142 is also uniformly continuous, since formula_142 is a compact set.
* If a function is differentiable on an open interval and its derivative is bounded, then the function is uniformly continuous on that interval.
* Every Lipschitz continuous map between two metric spaces is uniformly continuous. More generally, every Hölder continuous function is uniformly continuous.
* The absolute value function is uniformly continuous, despite not being differentiable at formula_144. This shows uniformly continuous functions are not always differentiable.
* Despite being nowhere differentiable, the Weierstrass function is uniformly continuous.
* Every member of a uniformly equicontinuous set of functions is uniformly continuous.

=== Nonexamples ===
* Functions that are unbounded on a bounded domain are not uniformly continuous. The tangent function is continuous on the interval formula_145 but is &quot;not&quot; uniformly continuous on that interval, as it goes to infinity as formula_146.
* Functions whose derivative tends to infinity as formula_7 grows large cannot be uniformly continuous. The exponential function formula_148 is continuous everywhere on the real line but is not uniformly continuous on the line, since its derivative is formula_149, and formula_150 as formula_151.

== Visualization ==
For a uniformly continuous function, for every positive real number formula_152 there is a positive real number formula_153 such that two function values formula_154 and formula_155 have the maximum distance formula_13 whenever formula_7 and formula_8 are within the maximum distance formula_2. Thus at each point formula_160 of the graph, if we draw a rectangle with a height slightly less than formula_161 and width a slightly less than formula_162 around that point, then the graph lies completely within the height of the rectangle, i.e., the graph do not pass through the top or the bottom side of the rectangle. For functions that are not uniformly continuous, this isn&#x27;t possible; for these functions, the graph might lie inside the height of the rectangle at some point on the graph but there is a point on the graph where the graph lies above or below the rectangle. (the graph penetrates the top or bottom side of the rectangle.)

== History ==
The first published definition of uniform continuity was by Heine in 1870, and in 1872 he published a proof that a continuous function on an open interval need not be uniformly continuous. The proofs are almost verbatim given by Dirichlet in his lectures on definite integrals in 1854. The definition of uniform continuity appears earlier in the work of Bolzano where he also proved that continuous functions on an open interval do not need to be uniformly continuous. In addition he also states that a continuous function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous, but he does not give a complete proof.

== Other characterizations ==

=== Non-standard analysis ===
In non-standard analysis, a real-valued function &quot;formula_1&quot; of a real variable is microcontinuous at a point &quot;formula_164&quot; precisely if the difference formula_165 is infinitesimal whenever &quot;formula_2&quot; is infinitesimal. Thus &quot;formula_1&quot; is continuous on a set &quot;formula_168&quot; in formula_119 precisely if formula_88 is microcontinuous at every real point formula_171. Uniform continuity can be expressed as the condition that (the natural extension of) formula_1 is microcontinuous not only at real points in formula_168, but at all points in its non-standard counterpart (natural extension) formula_174 in formula_175. Note that there exist hyperreal-valued functions which meet this criterion but are not uniformly continuous, as well as uniformly continuous hyperreal-valued functions which do not meet this criterion, however, such functions cannot be expressed in the form formula_88 for any real-valued function formula_1. (see non-standard calculus for more details and examples).

=== Cauchy continuity ===

For a function between metric spaces, uniform continuity implies Cauchy continuity . More specifically, let formula_168 be a subset of formula_179. If a function formula_180 is uniformly continuous then for every pair of sequences formula_181 and formula_182 such that

:formula_183

we have

:formula_184

== Relations with the extension problem ==

Let formula_85 be a metric space, formula_186 a subset of formula_85&quot;,&quot; formula_188 a complete metric space, and formula_189 a continuous function. A question to answer: &quot;When can formula_1 be extended to a continuous function on all of formula_85?&quot;

If &quot;formula_186&quot; is closed in formula_85, the answer is given by the Tietze extension theorem. So it is necessary and sufficient to extend &quot;formula_1&quot; to the closure of formula_186 in formula_85: that is, we may assume without loss of generality that &quot;formula_186&quot; is dense in formula_85, and this has the further pleasant consequence that if the extension exists, it is unique. A sufficient condition for formula_1 to extend to a continuous function formula_200 is that it is Cauchy-continuous, i.e., the image under &quot;formula_1&quot; of a Cauchy sequence remains Cauchy. If formula_85 is complete (and thus the completion of &quot;formula_186&quot;), then every continuous function from &quot;formula_85&quot; to a metric space &quot;formula_205&quot; is Cauchy-continuous. Therefore when &quot;formula_85&quot; is complete, &quot;formula_1&quot; extends to a continuous function formula_200 if and only if &quot;formula_1&quot; is Cauchy-continuous.

It is easy to see that every uniformly continuous function is Cauchy-continuous and thus extends to &quot;formula_85&quot;. The converse does not hold, since the function formula_211 is, as seen above, not uniformly continuous, but it is continuous and thus Cauchy continuous. In general, for functions defined on unbounded spaces like &quot;formula_188&quot;, uniform continuity is a rather strong condition. It is desirable to have a weaker condition from which to deduce extendability.

For example, suppose formula_213 is a real number. At the precalculus level, the function formula_214 can be given a precise definition only for rational values of &quot;formula_7&quot; (assuming the existence of qth roots of positive real numbers, an application of the Intermediate Value Theorem). One would like to extend formula_1 to a function defined on all of formula_188. The identity

: formula_218

shows that &quot;formula_1&quot; is not uniformly continuous on the set &quot;formula_220&quot; of all rational numbers; however for any bounded interval &quot;formula_91&quot; the restriction of &quot;formula_1&quot; to formula_223 is uniformly continuous, hence Cauchy-continuous, hence formula_1 extends to a continuous function on &quot;formula_91&quot;. But since this holds for every &quot;formula_91&quot;, there is then a unique extension of &quot;formula_1&quot; to a continuous function on all of &quot;formula_188&quot;.

More generally, a continuous function formula_189 whose restriction to every bounded subset of &quot;formula_186&quot; is uniformly continuous is extendable to &quot;formula_85&quot;, and the converse holds if &quot;formula_85&quot; is locally compact.

A typical application of the extendability of a uniformly continuous function is the proof of the inverse Fourier transformation formula. We first prove that the formula is true for test functions, there are densely many of them. We then extend the inverse map to the whole space using the fact that linear map is continuous; thus, uniformly continuous.

== Generalization to topological vector spaces ==

In the special case of two topological vector spaces formula_233 and formula_234, the notion of uniform continuity of a map formula_235 becomes: for any neighborhood formula_236 of zero in formula_234, there exists a neighborhood formula_168 of zero in formula_233 such that formula_240 implies formula_241

For linear transformations formula_235, uniform continuity is equivalent to continuity. This fact is frequently used implicitly in functional analysis to extend a linear map off a dense subspace of a Banach space.

== Generalization to uniform spaces ==
Just as the most natural and general setting for continuity is topological spaces, the most natural and general setting for the study of &quot;uniform&quot; continuity are the uniform spaces. A function formula_94 between uniform spaces is called &quot;uniformly continuous&quot; if for every entourage &quot;formula_233&quot; in &quot;formula_205&quot; there exists an entourage &quot;formula_246&quot; in &quot;formula_85&quot; such that for every formula_248 in formula_246 we have formula_250 in formula_233.

In this setting, it is also true that uniformly continuous maps transform Cauchy sequences into Cauchy sequences.

Each compact Hausdorff space possesses exactly one uniform structure compatible with the topology. A consequence is a generalization of the Heine-Cantor theorem: each continuous function from a compact Hausdorff space to a uniform space is uniformly continuous.

<text>In the mathematical field of topology, a uniform space is a set with additional structure that is used to define &quot;uniform properties&quot;, such as completeness, uniform continuity and uniform convergence. Uniform spaces generalize metric spaces and topological groups, but the concept is designed to formulate the weakest axioms needed for most proofs in analysis.

In addition to the usual properties of a topological structure, in a uniform space one formalizes the notions of relative closeness and closeness of points. In other words, ideas like &quot;&quot;x&quot; is closer to &quot;a&quot; than &quot;y&quot; is to &quot;b&quot;&quot; make sense in uniform spaces. By comparison, in a general topological space, given sets &quot;A,B&quot; it is meaningful to say that a point &quot;x&quot; is &quot;arbitrarily close&quot; to &quot;A&quot; (i.e., in the closure of &quot;A&quot;), or perhaps that &quot;A&quot; is a &quot;smaller neighborhood&quot; of &quot;x&quot; than &quot;B&quot;, but notions of closeness of points and relative closeness are not described well by topological structure alone.

==Definition==
There are three equivalent definitions for a uniform space. They all consist of a space equipped with a uniform structure.

===Entourage definition===

This definition adapts the presentation of a topological space in terms of neighborhood systems. A nonempty collection formula_1 of subsets of formula_2 is a &#x27; (or a &#x27;) if it satisfies the following axioms:
# If formula_3 then formula_4 where formula_5 is the diagonal on formula_6
# If formula_3 and formula_8 then formula_9
# If formula_3 and formula_11 then formula_12
# If formula_3 then there is some formula_14 such that formula_15, where formula_16 denotes the composite of formula_17 with itself. The composite of two subsets formula_17 and formula_19 of formula_2 is defined by formula_21
# If formula_3 then formula_23 where formula_24 is the inverse of formula_25

The non-emptiness of formula_1 taken together with (2) and (3) states that formula_1 is a filter on formula_6 If the last property is omitted we call the space &#x27;. An element formula_19 of formula_1 is called a &#x27; or from the French word for &quot;surroundings&quot;.

One usually writes formula_31 where formula_32 is the vertical cross section of formula_19 and formula_34 is the canonical projection onto the second coordinate. On a graph, a typical entourage is drawn as a blob surrounding the &quot;formula_35&quot; diagonal; all the different formula_36&#x27;s form the vertical cross-sections. If formula_37 then one says that formula_38 and formula_39 are &#x27;. Similarly, if all pairs of points in a subset formula_40 of formula_41 are formula_19-close (that is, if formula_43 is contained in formula_19), formula_40 is called &quot;formula_19-small&quot;. An entourage formula_19 is &#x27; if formula_37 precisely when formula_49 The first axiom states that each point is formula_19-close to itself for each entourage formula_25 The third axiom guarantees that being &quot;both formula_19-close and formula_17-close&quot; is also a closeness relation in the uniformity. The fourth axiom states that for each entourage formula_19 there is an entourage formula_17 that is &quot;not more than half as large&quot;. Finally, the last axiom states that the property &quot;closeness&quot; with respect to a uniform structure is symmetric in formula_38 and formula_57

A &#x27; or &#x27; (or vicinities) of a uniformity formula_1 is any set formula_59 of entourages of formula_1 such that every entourage of formula_1 contains a set belonging to formula_62 Thus, by property 2 above, a fundamental systems of entourages formula_59 is enough to specify the uniformity formula_1 unambiguously: formula_1 is the set of subsets of formula_2 that contain a set of formula_62 Every uniform space has a fundamental system of entourages consisting of symmetric entourages.

Intuition about uniformities is provided by the example of metric spaces: if formula_68 is a metric space, the sets
formula_69
form a fundamental system of entourages for the standard uniform structure of formula_70 Then formula_38 and formula_39 are formula_73-close precisely when the distance between formula_38 and formula_39 is at most formula_76

A uniformity formula_1 is &quot;finer&quot; than another uniformity formula_78 on the same set if formula_79 in that case formula_78 is said to be &quot;coarser&quot; than formula_81

===Pseudometrics definition===

Uniform spaces may be defined alternatively and equivalently using systems of pseudometrics, an approach that is particularly useful in functional analysis (with pseudometrics provided by seminorms). More precisely, let formula_82 be a pseudometric on a set formula_70 The inverse images formula_84 for formula_85 can be shown to form a fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity. The uniformity generated by the formula_73 is the uniformity defined by the single pseudometric formula_87 Certain authors call spaces the topology of which is defined in terms of pseudometrics &quot;gauge spaces&quot;.

For a &quot;family&quot; formula_88 of pseudometrics on formula_89 the uniform structure defined by the family is the &quot;least upper bound&quot; of the uniform structures defined by the individual pseudometrics formula_90 A fundamental system of entourages of this uniformity is provided by the set of &quot;finite&quot; intersections of entourages of the uniformities defined by the individual pseudometrics formula_90 If the family of pseudometrics is &quot;finite&quot;, it can be seen that the same uniform structure is defined by a &quot;single&quot; pseudometric, namely the upper envelope formula_92 of the family.

Less trivially, it can be shown that a uniform structure that admits a countable fundamental system of entourages (hence in particular a uniformity defined by a countable family of pseudometrics) can be defined by a single pseudometric. A consequence is that &quot;any&quot; uniform structure can be defined as above by a (possibly uncountable) family of pseudometrics (see Bourbaki: General Topology Chapter IX §1 no. 4).

===Uniform cover definition===

A uniform space formula_93 is a set formula_41 equipped with a distinguished family of coverings formula_95 called &quot;uniform covers&quot;, drawn from the set of coverings of formula_89 that form a filter when ordered by star refinement. One says that a cover formula_97 is a &quot;star refinement&quot; of cover formula_98 written formula_99 if for every formula_100 there is a formula_101 such that if formula_102 then formula_103 Axiomatically, the condition of being a filter reduces to:

# formula_104 is a uniform cover (that is, formula_105).
# If formula_106 with formula_97 a uniform cover and formula_108 a cover of formula_89 then formula_108 is also a uniform cover.
# If formula_97 and formula_108 are uniform covers then there is a uniform cover formula_113 that star-refines both formula_97 and formula_108

Given a point formula_38 and a uniform cover formula_117 one can consider the union of the members of formula_97 that contain formula_38 as a typical neighbourhood of formula_38 of &quot;size&quot; formula_117 and this intuitive measure applies uniformly over the space.

Given a uniform space in the entourage sense, define a cover formula_97 to be uniform if there is some entourage formula_19 such that for each formula_124 there is an formula_125 such that formula_126 These uniform covers form a uniform space as in the second definition. Conversely, given a uniform space in the uniform cover sense, the supersets of formula_127 as formula_97 ranges over the uniform covers, are the entourages for a uniform space as in the first definition. Moreover, these two transformations are inverses of each other. 

==Topology of uniform spaces==

Every uniform space formula_41 becomes a topological space by defining a nonempty subset formula_130 to be open if and only if for every formula_131 there exists an entourage formula_17 such that formula_133 is a subset of formula_134 In this topology, the neighbourhood filter of a point formula_38 is formula_136 This can be proved with a recursive use of the existence of a &quot;half-size&quot; entourage. Compared to a general topological space the existence of the uniform structure makes possible the comparison of sizes of neighbourhoods: formula_133 and formula_138 are considered to be of the &quot;same size&quot;.

The topology defined by a uniform structure is said to be . A uniform structure on a topological space is &quot;compatible&quot; with the topology if the topology defined by the uniform structure coincides with the original topology. In general several different uniform structures can be compatible with a given topology on formula_70

===Uniformizable spaces===

A topological space is called if there is a uniform structure compatible with the topology.

Every uniformizable space is a completely regular topological space. Moreover, for a uniformizable space formula_41 the following are equivalent: 
* formula_41 is a Kolmogorov space
* formula_41 is a Hausdorff space
* formula_41 is a Tychonoff space
* for any compatible uniform structure, the intersection of all entourages is the diagonal formula_144
Some authors (e.g. Engelking) add this last condition directly in the definition of a uniformizable space.

The topology of a uniformizable space is always a symmetric topology; that is, the space is an R0-space.

Conversely, each completely regular space is uniformizable. A uniformity compatible with the topology of a completely regular space formula_41 can be defined as the coarsest uniformity that makes all continuous real-valued functions on formula_41 uniformly continuous. A fundamental system of entourages for this uniformity is provided by all finite intersections of sets formula_147 where formula_148 is a continuous real-valued function on formula_41 and formula_17 is an entourage of the uniform space formula_151 This uniformity defines a topology, which is clearly coarser than the original topology of formula_152 that it is also finer than the original topology (hence coincides with it) is a simple consequence of complete regularity: for any formula_153 and a neighbourhood formula_41 of formula_155 there is a continuous real-valued function formula_148 with formula_157 and equal to 1 in the complement of formula_17

In particular, a compact Hausdorff space is uniformizable. In fact, for a compact Hausdorff space formula_41 the set of all neighbourhoods of the diagonal in formula_2 form the &quot;unique&quot; uniformity compatible with the topology.

A Hausdorff uniform space is metrizable if its uniformity can be defined by a &quot;countable&quot; family of pseudometrics. Indeed, as discussed above, such a uniformity can be defined by a &quot;single&quot; pseudometric, which is necessarily a metric if the space is Hausdorff. In particular, if the topology of a vector space is Hausdorff and definable by a countable family of seminorms, it is metrizable.

==Uniform continuity==
Similar to continuous functions between topological spaces, which preserve topological properties, are the uniformly continuous functions between uniform spaces, which preserve uniform properties. 

A uniformly continuous function is defined as one where inverse images of entourages are again entourages, or equivalently, one where the inverse images of uniform covers are again uniform covers. Explicitly, a function formula_161 between uniform spaces is called if for every entourage formula_17 in formula_163 there exists an entourage formula_19 in formula_41 such that if formula_166 then formula_167 or in other words, whenever formula_17 is an entourage in formula_163 then formula_170 is an entourage in formula_41, where formula_172 is defined by formula_173

All uniformly continuous functions are continuous with respect to the induced topologies. 

Uniform spaces with uniform maps form a category. An isomorphism between uniform spaces is called a ; explicitly, it is a uniformly continuous bijection whose inverse is also uniformly continuous. 
A is an injective uniformly continuous map formula_174 between uniform spaces whose inverse formula_175 is also uniformly continuous, where the image formula_176 has the subspace uniformity inherited from formula_177

==Completeness==

Generalizing the notion of complete metric space, one can also define completeness for uniform spaces. Instead of working with Cauchy sequences, one works with Cauchy filters (or Cauchy nets).

A &#x27; (respectively, a &#x27;) formula_178 on a uniform space formula_41 is a filter (respectively, a prefilter) formula_178 such that for every entourage formula_181 there exists formula_182 with formula_183 In other words, a filter is Cauchy if it contains &quot;arbitrarily small&quot; sets. It follows from the definitions that each filter that converges (with respect to the topology defined by the uniform structure) is a Cauchy filter.
A is a Cauchy filter that does not contain any smaller (that is, coarser) Cauchy filter (other than itself). It can be shown that every Cauchy filter contains a unique . The neighbourhood filter of each point (the filter consisting of all neighbourhoods of the point) is a minimal Cauchy filter.

Conversely, a uniform space is called if every Cauchy filter converges. Any compact Hausdorff space is a complete uniform space with respect to the unique uniformity compatible with the topology.

Complete uniform spaces enjoy the following important property: if formula_184 is a &quot;uniformly continuous&quot; function from a &quot;dense&quot; subset formula_40 of a uniform space formula_41 into a &quot;complete&quot; uniform space formula_187 then formula_148 can be extended (uniquely) into a uniformly continuous function on all of formula_70

A topological space that can be made into a complete uniform space, whose uniformity induces the original topology, is called a completely uniformizable space.

A formula_41 is a pair formula_191 consisting of a complete uniform space formula_192 and a uniform embedding formula_193 whose image formula_176 is a dense subset of formula_195 

===Hausdorff completion of a uniform space===

As with metric spaces, every uniform space formula_41 has a : that is, there exists a complete Hausdorff uniform space formula_163 and a uniformly continuous map formula_174 (if formula_41 is a Hausdorff uniform space then formula_200 is a topological embedding) with the following property:

: for any uniformly continuous mapping formula_148 of formula_41 into a complete Hausdorff uniform space formula_203 there is a unique uniformly continuous map formula_204 such that formula_205

The Hausdorff completion formula_163 is unique up to isomorphism. As a set, formula_163 can be taken to consist of the Cauchy filters on formula_70 As the neighbourhood filter formula_209 of each point formula_38 in formula_41 is a minimal Cauchy filter, the map formula_200 can be defined by mapping formula_38 to formula_214 The map formula_200 thus defined is in general not injective; in fact, the graph of the equivalence relation formula_216 is the intersection of all entourages of formula_89 and thus formula_200 is injective precisely when formula_41 is Hausdorff.

The uniform structure on formula_163 is defined as follows: for each formula_17 (that is, such that formula_222 implies formula_223), let formula_224 be the set of all pairs formula_225 of minimal Cauchy filters &quot;which have in common at least one formula_17-small set&quot;. The sets formula_224 can be shown to form a fundamental system of entourages; formula_163 is equipped with the uniform structure thus defined.

The set formula_176 is then a dense subset of formula_177 If formula_41 is Hausdorff, then formula_200 is an isomorphism onto formula_233 and thus formula_41 can be identified with a dense subset of its completion. Moreover, formula_176 is always Hausdorff; it is called the If formula_236 denotes the equivalence relation formula_237 then the quotient space formula_238 is homeomorphic to formula_239

==Examples==

# Every metric space formula_240 can be considered as a uniform space. Indeed, since a metric is &quot;a fortiori&quot; a pseudometric, the pseudometric definition furnishes formula_241 with a uniform structure. A fundamental system of entourages of this uniformity is provided by the setsformula_242This uniform structure on formula_241 generates the usual metric space topology on formula_244 However, different metric spaces can have the same uniform structure (trivial example is provided by a constant multiple of a metric). This uniform structure produces also equivalent definitions of uniform continuity and completeness for metric spaces.
# Using metrics, a simple example of distinct uniform structures with coinciding topologies can be constructed. For instance, let formula_245 be the usual metric on formula_246 and let formula_247 Then both metrics induce the usual topology on formula_248 yet the uniform structures are distinct, since formula_249 is an entourage in the uniform structure for formula_250 but not for formula_251 Informally, this example can be seen as taking the usual uniformity and distorting it through the action of a continuous yet non-uniformly continuous function.
# Every topological group formula_252 (in particular, every topological vector space) becomes a uniform space if we define a subset formula_253 to be an entourage if and only if it contains the set formula_254 for some neighborhood formula_19 of the identity element of formula_256 This uniform structure on formula_252 is called the &quot;right uniformity&quot; on formula_258 because for every formula_259 the right multiplication formula_260 is uniformly continuous with respect to this uniform structure. One may also define a left uniformity on formula_261 the two need not coincide, but they both generate the given topology on formula_256
# For every topological group formula_252 and its subgroup formula_264 the set of left cosets formula_265 is a uniform space with respect to the uniformity formula_1 defined as follows. The sets formula_267 where formula_19 runs over neighborhoods of the identity in formula_258 form a fundamental system of entourages for the uniformity formula_81 The corresponding induced topology on formula_265 is equal to the quotient topology defined by the natural map formula_272
# The trivial topology belongs to a uniform space in which the whole cartesian product formula_2 is the only entourage.

==History==

Before André Weil gave the first explicit definition of a uniform structure in 1937, uniform concepts, like completeness, were discussed using metric spaces. Nicolas Bourbaki provided the definition of uniform structure in terms of entourages in the book &quot;Topologie Générale&quot; and John Tukey gave the uniform cover definition. Weil also characterized uniform spaces in terms of a family of pseudometrics.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of a random variable. The standard deviation (SD) is obtained as the square root of the variance. Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. It is the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, or formula_5.

An advantage of variance as a measure of dispersion is that it is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than other measures of dispersion such as the expected absolute deviation; for example, the variance of a sum of uncorrelated random variables is equal to the sum of their variances. A disadvantage of the variance for practical applications is that, unlike the standard deviation, its units differ from the random variable, which is why the standard deviation is more commonly reported as a measure of dispersion once the calculation is finished. Another disadvantage is that the variance is not finite for many distributions.

There are two distinct concepts that are both called &quot;variance&quot;. One, as discussed above, is part of a theoretical probability distribution and is defined by an equation. The other variance is a characteristic of a set of observations. When variance is calculated from observations, those observations are typically measured from a real-world system. If all possible observations of the system are present, then the calculated variance is called the population variance. Normally, however, only a subset is available, and the variance calculated from this is called the sample variance. The variance calculated from a sample is considered an estimate of the full population variance. There are multiple ways to calculate an estimate of the population variance, as discussed in the section below.

The two kinds of variance are closely related. To see how, consider that a theoretical probability distribution can be used as a generator of hypothetical observations. If an infinite number of observations are generated using a distribution, then the sample variance calculated from that infinite set will match the value calculated using the distribution&#x27;s equation for variance. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling.

==Definition==
The variance of a random variable formula_6 is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of formula_6, formula_8:
formula_9
This definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are discrete, continuous, neither, or mixed. The variance can also be thought of as the covariance of a random variable with itself:

formula_10 
The variance is also equivalent to the second cumulant of a probability distribution that generates formula_6. The variance is typically designated as formula_3, or sometimes as formula_4 or formula_5, or symbolically as formula_15 or simply formula_1 (pronounced &quot;sigma squared&quot;). The expression for the variance can be expanded as follows:
formula_17

In other words, the variance of is equal to the mean of the square of minus the square of the mean of . This equation should not be used for computations using floating point arithmetic, because it suffers from catastrophic cancellation if the two components of the equation are similar in magnitude. For other numerically stable alternatives, see algorithms for calculating variance.

===Discrete random variable===

If the generator of random variable formula_6 is discrete with probability mass function formula_19, then

formula_20

where formula_21 is the expected value. That is,

formula_22

(When such a discrete weighted variance is specified by weights whose sum is not 1, then one divides by the sum of the weights.)

The variance of a collection of formula_23 equally likely values can be written as

formula_24

where formula_21 is the average value. That is,

formula_26

The variance of a set of formula_23 equally likely values can be equivalently expressed, without directly referring to the mean, in terms of squared deviations of all pairwise squared distances of points from each other:

formula_28

===Absolutely continuous random variable===

If the random variable formula_6 has a probability density function formula_30, and formula_31 is the corresponding cumulative distribution function, then

formula_32

or equivalently,

formula_33

where formula_21 is the expected value of formula_6 given by

formula_36

In these formulas, the integrals with respect to formula_37 and formula_38
are Lebesgue and Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrals, respectively.

If the function formula_39 is Riemann-integrable on every finite interval formula_40 then

formula_41

where the integral is an improper Riemann integral.

==Examples==

===Exponential distribution===
The exponential distribution with parameter is a continuous distribution whose probability density function is given by
formula_42
on the interval . Its mean can be shown to be
formula_43

Using integration by parts and making use of the expected value already calculated, we have:
formula_44

Thus, the variance of is given by
formula_45

===Fair die===
A fair six-sided die can be modeled as a discrete random variable, , with outcomes 1 through 6, each with equal probability 1/6. The expected value of is formula_46 Therefore, the variance of is
formula_47

The general formula for the variance of the outcome, , of an die is
formula_48

=== Commonly used probability distributions ===
The following table lists the variance for some commonly used probability distributions.
==Properties==

===Basic properties===
Variance is non-negative because the squares are positive or zero:
formula_49

The variance of a constant is zero.
formula_50

Conversely, if the variance of a random variable is 0, then it is almost surely a constant. That is, it always has the same value:
formula_51

===Issues of finiteness===
If a distribution does not have a finite expected value, as is the case for the Cauchy distribution, then the variance cannot be finite either. However, some distributions may not have a finite variance, despite their expected value being finite. An example is a Pareto distribution whose index formula_52 satisfies formula_53

===Decomposition===

The general formula for variance decomposition or the law of total variance is: If formula_6 and formula_55 are two random variables, and the variance of formula_6 exists, then

formula_57

The conditional expectation formula_58 of formula_6 given formula_55, and the conditional variance formula_61 may be understood as follows. Given any particular value &quot;y&quot; of the random variable &quot;Y&quot;, there is a conditional expectation formula_62 given the event &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;y&quot;. This quantity depends on the particular value &quot;y&quot;; it is a function formula_63. That same function evaluated at the random variable &quot;Y&quot; is the conditional expectation formula_64

In particular, if formula_55 is a discrete random variable assuming possible values formula_66 with corresponding probabilities formula_67, then in the formula for total variance, the first term on the right-hand side becomes

formula_68

where formula_69. Similarly, the second term on the right-hand side becomes

formula_70

where formula_71 and formula_72. Thus the total variance is given by

formula_73

A similar formula is applied in analysis of variance, where the corresponding formula is

formula_74

here formula_75 refers to the Mean of the Squares. In linear regression analysis the corresponding formula is

formula_76

This can also be derived from the additivity of variances, since the total (observed) score is the sum of the predicted score and the error score, where the latter two are uncorrelated.

Similar decompositions are possible for the sum of squared deviations (sum of squares, formula_77):
formula_78
formula_79

===Calculation from the CDF===

The population variance for a non-negative random variable can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function &quot;F&quot; using

formula_80

This expression can be used to calculate the variance in situations where the CDF, but not the density, can be conveniently expressed.

===Characteristic property===
The second moment of a random variable attains the minimum value when taken around the first moment (i.e., mean) of the random variable, i.e. formula_81. Conversely, if a continuous function formula_82 satisfies formula_83 for all random variables &quot;X&quot;, then it is necessarily of the form formula_84, where . This also holds in the multidimensional case.

===Units of measurement===

Unlike the expected absolute deviation, the variance of a variable has units that are the square of the units of the variable itself. For example, a variable measured in meters will have a variance measured in meters squared. For this reason, describing data sets via their standard deviation or root mean square deviation is often preferred over using the variance. In the dice example the standard deviation is , slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of 1.5.

The standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the &quot;spread&quot; of a distribution. The standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation, and, together with variance and its generalization covariance, is used frequently in theoretical statistics; however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more robust as it is less sensitive to outliers arising from measurement anomalies or an unduly heavy-tailed distribution.

==Propagation==

===Addition and multiplication by a constant===
Variance is invariant with respect to changes in a location parameter. That is, if a constant is added to all values of the variable, the variance is unchanged:
formula_85

If all values are scaled by a constant, the variance is scaled by the square of that constant:
formula_86

The variance of a sum of two random variables is given by
formula_87

where formula_88 is the covariance.

=== Linear combinations ===
In general, for the sum of formula_89 random variables formula_90, the variance becomes:
formula_91 
see also general Bienaymé&#x27;s identity.

These results lead to the variance of a linear combination as:

formula_92

If the random variables formula_93 are such that
formula_94
then they are said to be uncorrelated. It follows immediately from the expression given earlier that if the random variables formula_93 are uncorrelated, then the variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their variances, or, expressed symbolically:

formula_96

Since independent random variables are always uncorrelated (see ), the equation above holds in particular when the random variables formula_97 are independent. Thus, independence is sufficient but not necessary for the variance of the sum to equal the sum of the variances.

====Matrix notation for the variance of a linear combination====

Define formula_6 as a column vector of formula_23 random variables formula_100, and formula_101 as a column vector of formula_23 scalars formula_103. Therefore, formula_104 is a linear combination of these random variables, where formula_105 denotes the transpose of formula_101. Also let formula_107 be the covariance matrix of formula_6. The variance of formula_109 is then given by:

formula_110

This implies that the variance of the mean can be written as (with a column vector of ones)

formula_111

===Sum of variables===

====Sum of uncorrelated variables====
One reason for the use of the variance in preference to other measures of dispersion is that the variance of the sum (or the difference) of uncorrelated random variables is the sum of their variances:

formula_112

This statement is called the Bienaymé formula and was discovered in 1853. It is often made with the stronger condition that the variables are independent, but being uncorrelated suffices. So if all the variables have the same variance σ2, then, since division by &quot;n&quot; is a linear transformation, this formula immediately implies that the variance of their mean is

formula_113

That is, the variance of the mean decreases when &quot;n&quot; increases. This formula for the variance of the mean is used in the definition of the standard error of the sample mean, which is used in the central limit theorem.

To prove the initial statement, it suffices to show that

formula_114

The general result then follows by induction. Starting with the definition,

formula_115

Using the linearity of the expectation operator and the assumption of independence (or uncorrelatedness) of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, this further simplifies as follows:

formula_116

====Sum of correlated variables====

=====Sum of correlated variables with fixed sample size=====

In general, the variance of the sum of variables is the sum of their covariances:

formula_117

(Note: The second equality comes from the fact that .)

Here, formula_118 is the covariance, which is zero for independent random variables (if it exists). The formula states that the variance of a sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components. The next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements (or its lower triangular elements); this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric. This formula is used in the theory of Cronbach&#x27;s alpha in classical test theory.

So, if the variables have equal variance &quot;σ&quot;2 and the average correlation of distinct variables is &quot;ρ&quot;, then the variance of their mean is

formula_119

This implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations. In other words, additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the uncertainty of the mean. Moreover, if the variables have unit variance, for example if they are standardized, then this simplifies to

formula_120

This formula is used in the Spearman–Brown prediction formula of classical test theory. This converges to &quot;ρ&quot; if &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity, provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too. So for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have

formula_121

Therefore, the variance of the mean of a large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean, even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables.

=====Sum of uncorrelated variables with random sample size=====
There are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion. In such cases, the sample size is a random variable whose variation adds to the variation of , such that,
formula_122
which follows from the law of total variance.

If has a Poisson distribution, then formula_123 with estimator = . So, the estimator of formula_124 becomes formula_125, giving formula_126
(see standard error of the sample mean).

====Weighted sum of variables====

The scaling property and the Bienaymé formula, along with the property of the covariance jointly imply that

formula_127

This implies that in a weighted sum of variables, the variable with the largest weight will have a disproportionally large weight in the variance of the total. For example, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are uncorrelated and the weight of &quot;X&quot; is two times the weight of &quot;Y&quot;, then the weight of the variance of &quot;X&quot; will be four times the weight of the variance of &quot;Y&quot;.

The expression above can be extended to a weighted sum of multiple variables:

formula_128

===Product of variables===

====Product of independent variables====

If two variables X and Y are independent, the variance of their product is given by
formula_129

Equivalently, using the basic properties of expectation, it is given by

formula_130

====Product of statistically dependent variables====

In general, if two variables are statistically dependent, then the variance of their product is given by:
formula_131

===Arbitrary functions===
The delta method uses second-order Taylor expansions to approximate the variance of a function of one or more random variables: see Taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables. For example, the approximate variance of a function of one variable is given by

formula_132

provided that &quot;f&quot; is twice differentiable and that the mean and variance of &quot;X&quot; are finite.

==Population variance and sample variance==
Real-world observations such as the measurements of yesterday&#x27;s rain throughout the day typically cannot be complete sets of all possible observations that could be made. As such, the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations. This means that one estimates the mean and variance from a limited set of observations by using an estimator equation. The estimator is a function of the sample of &quot;n&quot; observations drawn without observational bias from the whole population of potential observations. In this example, the sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday&#x27;s rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest.

The simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample, the sample mean and (uncorrected) sample variance – these are consistent estimators (they converge to the value of the whole population as the number of samples increases) but can be improved. Most simply, the sample variance is computed as the sum of squared deviations about the (sample) mean, divided by &quot;n&quot; as the number of samples&quot;.&quot; However, using values other than &quot;n&quot; improves the estimator in various ways. Four common values for the denominator are &quot;n,&quot; &quot;n&quot; − 1, &quot;n&quot; + 1, and &quot;n&quot; − 1.5: &quot;n&quot; is the simplest (the variance of the sample), &quot;n&quot; − 1 eliminates bias, &quot;n&quot; + 1 minimizes mean squared error for the normal distribution, and &quot;n&quot; − 1.5 mostly eliminates bias in unbiased estimation of standard deviation for the normal distribution.

Firstly, if the true population mean is unknown, then the sample variance (which uses the sample mean in place of the true mean) is a biased estimator: it underestimates the variance by a factor of (&quot;n&quot; − 1) / &quot;n&quot;; correcting this factor, resulting in the sum of squared deviations about the sample mean divided by &quot;n&quot; -1 instead of &quot;n&quot;, is called &quot;Bessel&#x27;s correction&quot;. The resulting estimator is unbiased and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance, then this bias does not arise, and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.

Secondly, the sample variance does not generally minimize mean squared error between sample variance and population variance. Correcting for bias often makes this worse: one can always choose a scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance, though the optimal scale factor depends on the excess kurtosis of the population (see mean squared error: variance) and introduces bias. This always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator (dividing by a number larger than &quot;n&quot; − 1) and is a simple example of a shrinkage estimator: one &quot;shrinks&quot; the unbiased estimator towards zero. For the normal distribution, dividing by &quot;n&quot; + 1 (instead of &quot;n&quot; − 1 or &quot;n&quot;) minimizes mean squared error. The resulting estimator is biased, however, and is known as the biased sample variation.

===Population variance===
In general, the population variance of a &quot;finite&quot; population of size with values is given by
formula_133where the population mean is formula_134 and formula_135, where formula_136 is the expectation value operator.

The population variance can also be computed using

formula_137

(The right side has duplicate terms in the sum while the middle side has only unique terms to sum.) This is true because
formula_138
The population variance matches the variance of the generating probability distribution. In this sense, the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations.

===Sample variance===
========
In many practical situations, the true variance of a population is not known &quot;a priori&quot; and must be computed somehow. When dealing with extremely large populations, it is not possible to count every object in the population, so the computation must be performed on a sample of the population. This is generally referred to as sample variance or empirical variance. Sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of a continuous distribution from a sample of that distribution.

We take a sample with replacement of values from the population of size , where , and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample. Directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the squared deviations:

formula_139

(See the section Population variance for the derivation of this formula.) Here, formula_140 denotes the sample mean: 
formula_141

Since the are selected randomly, both formula_140 and formula_143 are random variables. Their expected values can be evaluated by averaging over the ensemble of all possible samples of size from the population. For formula_143 this gives:
formula_145

Here formula_146 derived in the section is population variance and formula_147 due to independency of formula_148 and formula_149.

Hence formula_150 gives an estimate of the population variance formula_151 that is biased by a factor of formula_152 because the expectation value of formula_150 is smaller than the population variance (true variance) by that factor. For this reason, formula_150 is referred to as the &quot;biased sample variance&quot;.
Correcting for this bias yields the &quot;unbiased sample variance&quot;, denoted formula_155:

formula_156

Either estimator may be simply referred to as the &quot;sample variance&quot; when the version can be determined by context. The same proof is also applicable for samples taken from a continuous probability distribution.

The use of the term is called Bessel&#x27;s correction, and it is also used in sample covariance and the sample standard deviation (the square root of variance). The square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen&#x27;s inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel&#x27;s correction) is biased. The unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term yields an almost unbiased estimator.

The unbiased sample variance is a U-statistic for the function , meaning that it is obtained by averaging a 2-sample statistic over 2-element subsets of the population.

===== Example =====
For a set of numbers {10, 15, 30, 45, 57, 52 63, 72, 81, 93, 102, 105}, if this set is the whole data population for some measurement, then variance is the population variance 932.743 as the sum of the squared deviations about the mean of this set, divided by 12 as the number of the set members. If the set is a sample from the whole population, then the unbiased sample variance can be calculated as 1017.538 that is the sum of the squared deviations about the mean of the sample, divided by 11 instead of 12. A function VAR.S in Microsoft Excel gives the unbiased sample variance while VAR.P is for population variance.

====Distribution of the sample variance====
Being a function of random variables, the sample variance is itself a random variable, and it is natural to study its distribution. In the case that &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; are independent observations from a normal distribution, Cochran&#x27;s theorem shows that the unbiased sample variance &quot;S&quot;2 follows a scaled chi-squared distribution (see also: asymptotic properties and an elementary proof):
formula_157

where is the population variance. As a direct consequence, it follows that 
formula_158

and

formula_159 where formula_160 and formula_161 is the transpose of , and so is a row vector. The result is a positive semi-definite square matrix, commonly referred to as the variance-covariance matrix (or simply as the &quot;covariance matrix&quot;).

If formula_6 is a vector- and complex-valued random variable, with values in formula_163 then the covariance matrix is formula_164 where formula_165 is the conjugate transpose of formula_166 This matrix is also positive semi-definite and square.

====As a scalar====
Another generalization of variance for vector-valued random variables formula_6, which results in a scalar value rather than in a matrix, is the generalized variance formula_168, the determinant of the covariance matrix. The generalized variance can be shown to be related to the multidimensional scatter of points around their mean.

A different generalization is obtained by considering the equation for the scalar variance, formula_169, and reinterpreting formula_170 as the squared Euclidean distance between the random variable and its mean, or, simply as the scalar product of the vector formula_171 with itself. This results in formula_172 which is the trace of the covariance matrix.

<text>A vacuole () is a membrane-bound organelle which is present in plant and fungal cells and some protist, animal, and bacterial cells. Vacuoles are essentially enclosed compartments which are filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including enzymes in solution, though in certain cases they may contain solids which have been engulfed. Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane vesicles and are effectively just larger forms of these. The organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies according to the requirements of the cell.

==Discovery==
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek described the plant vacuole in 1676. Contractile vacuoles (&quot;stars&quot;) were first observed by Spallanzani (1776) in protozoa, although mistaken for respiratory organs. Dujardin (1841) named these &quot;stars&quot; as &quot;vacuoles&quot;. In 1842, Schleiden applied the term for plant cells, to distinguish the structure with cell sap from the rest of the protoplasm. In 1885, de Vries named the vacuole membrane as tonoplast.
Christian de Duve, discovered mammalian lysosomes using biochemical methods in the mid 1970’s. de Duve named lysosomes based on their biochemical properties (from the Greek &quot;lysis&quot; – digestive and &quot;soma&quot; – body). Their physical form was confirmed shortly later by electron microscopy. Because the lysosome shares many properties with vacuoles across taxonomical kingdoms, the notion that vacuoles and lysosomes are distinctly different organelles is more historical than functional.

== Function ==
The function and significance of vacuoles varies greatly according to the type of cell in which they are present, having much greater prominence in the cells of plants, fungi and certain protists than those of animals and bacteria. In general, the functions of the vacuole include:

* Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell
* Containing waste products
* Containing water in plant cells
* Maintaining internal hydrostatic pressure or turgor within the cell
* Maintaining an acidic internal pH
* Containing small molecules
* Exporting unwanted substances from the cell
* Allowing plants to support structures such as leaves and flowers due to the pressure of the central vacuole
* By increasing in size, allowing the germinating plant or its organs (such as leaves) to grow very quickly and through using up mostly just water.
* In seeds, storing proteins needed for germination (these are kept in &#x27;protein bodies&#x27;, which are modified vacuoles).

Vacuoles also play a major role in autophagy, maintaining a balance between biogenesis (production) and degradation (or turnover), of many substances and cell structures in certain organisms. They also aid in the lysis and recycling of misfolded proteins that have begun to build up within the cell. Thomas Boller and others proposed that the vacuole participates in the destruction of invading bacteria and Robert B. Mellor proposed organ-specific forms have a role in &#x27;housing&#x27; symbiotic bacteria. In protists, vacuoles have the additional function of storing food which has been absorbed by the organism and assisting in the digestive and waste management process for the cell.

In animal cells, vacuoles perform mostly subordinate roles, assisting in larger processes of exocytosis and endocytosis.

Animal vacuoles are smaller than their plant counterparts but also usually greater in number. There are also animal cells that do not have any vacuoles.

Exocytosis is the extrusion process of proteins and lipids from the cell. These materials are absorbed into secretory granules within the Golgi apparatus before being transported to the cell membrane and secreted into the extracellular environment. In this capacity, vacuoles are simply storage vesicles which allow for the containment, transport and disposal of selected proteins and lipids to the extracellular environment of the cell.

Endocytosis is the reverse of exocytosis and can occur in a variety of forms. Phagocytosis (&quot;cell eating&quot;) is the process by which bacteria, dead tissue, or other bits of material visible under the microscope are engulfed by cells. The material makes contact with the cell membrane, which then invaginates. The invagination is pinched off, leaving the engulfed material in the membrane-enclosed vacuole and the cell membrane intact. Pinocytosis (&quot;cell drinking&quot;) is essentially the same process, the difference being that the substances ingested are in solution and not visible under the microscope. Phagocytosis and pinocytosis are both undertaken in association with lysosomes which complete the breakdown of the material which has been engulfed.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; is able to survive and reproduce in the vacuoles of several mammal species after being engulfed.

The vacuole probably evolved several times independently, even within the Viridiplantae.

== Types ==

=== Central ===

Most mature plant cells have one large vacuole that typically occupies more than 30% of the cell&#x27;s volume, and that can occupy as much as 80% of the volume for certain cell types and conditions. Strands of cytoplasm often run through the vacuole.

A vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast (word origin: Gk tón(os) + -o-, meaning “stretching”, “tension”, “tone” + comb. form repr. Gk plastós formed, molded) and filled with cell sap. Also called the vacuolar membrane, the tonoplast is the cytoplasmic membrane surrounding a vacuole, separating the vacuolar contents from the cell&#x27;s cytoplasm. As a membrane, it is mainly involved in regulating the movements of ions around the cell, and isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell.

Transport of protons from the cytosol to the vacuole stabilizes cytoplasmic pH, while making the vacuolar interior more acidic creating a proton motive force which the cell can use to transport nutrients into or out of the vacuole. The low pH of the vacuole also allows degradative enzymes to act. Although single large vacuoles are most common, the size and number of vacuoles may vary in different tissues and stages of development. For example, developing cells in the meristems contain small provacuoles and cells of the vascular cambium have many small vacuoles in the winter and one large one in the summer.

Aside from storage, the main role of the central vacuole is to maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall. Proteins found in the tonoplast (aquaporins) control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole through active transport, pumping potassium (K+) ions into and out of the vacuolar interior. Due to osmosis, water will diffuse into the vacuole, placing pressure on the cell wall. If water loss leads to a significant decline in turgor pressure, the cell will plasmolyze. Turgor pressure exerted by vacuoles is also required for cellular elongation: as the cell wall is partially degraded by the action of expansins, the less rigid wall is expanded by the pressure coming from within the vacuole. Turgor pressure exerted by the vacuole is also essential in supporting plants in an upright position. Another function of a central vacuole is that it pushes all contents of the cell&#x27;s cytoplasm against the cellular membrane, and thus keeps the chloroplasts closer to light. Most plants store chemicals in the vacuole that react with chemicals in the cytosol. If the cell is broken, for example by a herbivore, then the two chemicals can react forming toxic chemicals. In garlic, alliin and the enzyme alliinase are normally separated but form allicin if the vacuole is broken. A similar reaction is responsible for the production of syn-propanethial-S-oxide when onions are cut.

Vacuoles in fungal cells perform similar functions to those in plants and there can be more than one vacuole per cell. In yeast cells the vacuole (Vac7) is a structure that can rapidly modify its morphology. They are involved in many processes including the homeostasis of cell pH and the concentration of ions, osmoregulation, storing amino acids and polyphosphate and degradative processes. Toxic ions, such as strontium (), cobalt(II) (), and lead(II) () are transported into the vacuole to isolate them from the rest of the cell.

=== Contractile ===
A contractile vacuole is a specialized osmoregulatory organelle that is present in many free-living protists. The contractile vacuole is part of the contractile vacuole complex which includes radial arms and a spongiome. The contractile vacuole complex works periodically contracts to remove excess water and ions from the cell to balance water flow into the cell. When the contractile vacuole is slowly taking water in, the contractile vacuole enlarges, this is called diastole and when it reaches its threshold, the central vacuole contracts then contracts (systole) periodically to release water.

=== Digestive ===
Food vacuoles (also called digestive vacuole) are organelles found in certain protists, such as ciliates, amoeboids and &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, a protozoan parasite that causes malaria.

In &quot;Paramecium&quot;, the food vacuoles can show variation in size and shape based on their contents, solute balance and timing of ingestion in the cellular pharynx. The vacuoles of &quot;Ophrydium versatile&quot; undergo discoidal vesicle membrane recycling to the cytostome, condensing in the process, then associate with rough endoplasmic reticulum, receive protein coating on their cytosolic or exterior face from fusion with cup-shaped coated vesicles and condense again while producing cup-shaped coated vesicles, possibly for the purpose of enzyme recycling, prior to cytoproct egestion of residues mediated by vacuole fusion.

The food vacuoles of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; have been found to have calcium storage properties mediated by active transport and associated with vacuole acidification that are important for &quot;P. falciparum&quot; asexual reproduction.

==Histopathology==
In histopathology, vacuolization is the formation of vacuoles or vacuole-like structures, within or adjacent to cells. It is an unspecific sign of disease.

<doc id="32351" wikidata="Q1429662" url="?curid=32351" title="Verlan">
<text> () is a type of argot in the French language, featuring inversion of syllables in a word, and is common in slang and youth language. It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words. The word itself is an example of verlan (making it an autological word). It is derived from inverting the sounds of the syllables in &quot;l&#x27;envers&quot; (, &quot;the inverse&quot;, frequently used in the sense of &quot;back-to-front&quot;). The first documented use of verlan dates back to the 19th century, among robbers.

== Word formation ==

Words in verlan are formed by switching the order in which syllables from the original word are pronounced. For example, becomes .

Verlan generally retains the pronunciation of the original syllables. However, French words that end in a (such as ) and words that end in a pronounced consonant (such as ) gain the sound once reversed. In addition, verlan often drops the final vowel sound after the word is inverted, so and become ( – in full form) and ( – in full form), respectively.

The study of written verlan is difficult as it is primarily passed down orally, without standardized spelling. While some still argue that the letters should be held over from the original word, in the case of verlan, most experts agree that words should be spelled as to best approximate pronunciation. For example, is preferred to .
The French author Auguste Le Breton uses numerous examples of verlan, for instance in .

Different rules apply for one-syllable words, and words with more than two syllables may be verlan-ised in more than one way. For example, may yield or .

== Vocabulary ==
Some verlan words, such as , have become so commonplace that they have been included in the . The purpose of verlan is to create a somewhat secret language that only its speakers can understand. Words becoming mainstream is counterproductive. As a result, such newly common words may be reversed a second time .

Some verlan words, which are now well incorporated in common French language, have taken on their own significance, or at least certain connotations that have changed their meaning. For example, the word , which can still be used to refer to any woman, also refers to the speaker&#x27;s girlfriend when used in the possessive form ( → my girl); while the original word would refer to the speaker&#x27;s wife when used in the same way ( → my wife). Such words retain a cultural significance from the time at which they appeared in common language. Widespread in the second half of the 20th century, and (from ) refer to people of northern African descent who live in France. The word (a double verlan) is much more recent, and evolved to refer more generally to people of Arab descent who live in France.

In theory, any word can be made into a verlan, but only a few expressions are used in everyday speech. Verbs translated into verlan cannot be conjugated easily. There is no such thing as a verlan grammar, so generally verbs are used in the infinitive, past participle or progressive form. For example:
*&quot;J&#x27;étais en train de pécho une bebon&quot; (&quot;I was hitting on a hot chick&quot;) is said, but not .

Here are some examples of French words that have been made into a verlan and their English meanings:

== Double verlan ==
Creating verlans often brings up words that are verlan of a verlan. This is sometimes called or . One can find the order of the consonants of the original word, but the vowels have been modified.

For example, (verlan of ) becomes . The verlan word , derived from , has been made into .

== Cultural significance ==
Verlan is less a language than a way to set apart certain words. Many verlan words refer either to sex or drugs, related to the original purpose of keeping communication secret from institutions of social control. Verlan is generally limited to one or two key words per sentence. Verlan words and expressions are mixed within a more general language.

Verlan is used by people to mark their membership in, or exclusion from, a particular group (generally young people in the cities and , although some French upper-class youth have also started using it as their slang); it is a tool for marking and delineating group identity. Speakers rarely create a verlan word on the fly; rather, their ability to use and understand words from an accepted set of known verlan terms allows them to be identified as part of a verlan-speaking group. Lefkowitz claims that the best speakers of the language are often the worst students, those most needing to hide from authority.

Some verlan words have gained mainstream currency. Examples of verlan in cultural mainstream include the 1984 comedy (&quot;My New Partner&quot;) ( is verlan for , or rotten, and refers to a corrupt policeman); and the 1977 hit &quot;Laisse béton&quot; by singer Renaud ( is verlan for and the phrase means &quot;drop it&quot;).

Verlan is popular as a form of expression in French hip-hop. Artists claim that it fits well with the musical medium because &quot;form ranks way over substance&quot;.

The stage name of Belgian pop artist and songwriter Stromae (real name Paul Van Haver) is verlan for .

One hypothesis holds that &quot;Voltaire&quot;, the nom-de-plume of François-Marie Arouet, is a verlan word for Airvault.

The French language movie poster for the 2023 American film &quot;Barbie&quot; contains a line that has been interpreted as verlan: &quot;Elle peut tout faire. Lui, c&#x27;est juste Ken&quot;, &quot;She can do everything. He’s just Ken&quot;. By referring to the character Ken, which is a verlan phonological inversion of &quot;nique&quot;, a profane slang term for sex, aloud, it sounds like &quot;Lui sait juste ken,&quot; meaning &quot;he only knows how to fuck.&quot; Warner Bros. refused to confirm or deny whether the profane double entendre was intentional but appreciated the added publicity that the poster generated.

In the 2007 animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, the character chef Auguste Gusteau&#x27;s first name and last name are verlans of each other.

<text>In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.
Virtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:

* [[System virtual machine]]s (also called full virtualization VMs, SysVM, or SYS-VM) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.
* Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.

Some virtual machine emulators, such as QEMU and video game console emulators, are designed to also emulate (or &quot;virtually imitate&quot;) different system architectures, thus allowing execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture. OS-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel. The terms are not universally interchangeable.

== Definitions ==

=== System virtual machines ===

A &quot;virtual machine&quot; was originally defined by Popek and Goldberg as &quot;an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real computer machine.&quot; Current use includes virtual machines that have no direct correspondence to any real hardware. The physical, &quot;real-world&quot; hardware running the VM is generally referred to as the &#x27;host&#x27;, and the virtual machine emulated on that machine is generally referred to as the &#x27;guest&#x27;. A host can emulate several guests, each of which can emulate different operating systems and hardware platforms.

The desire to run multiple operating systems was the initial motive for virtual machines, so as to allow time-sharing among several single-tasking operating systems. In some respects, a system virtual machine can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory that historically preceded it. IBM&#x27;s CP/CMS, the first systems to allow full virtualization, implemented time sharing by providing each user with a single-user operating system, the Conversational Monitor System (CMS). Unlike virtual memory, a system virtual machine entitled the user to write privileged instructions in their code. This approach had certain advantages, such as adding input/output devices not allowed by the standard system.

As technology evolves virtual memory for purposes of virtualization, new systems of memory overcommitment may be applied to manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machines on one computer operating system. It may be possible to share &quot;memory pages&quot; that have identical contents among multiple virtual machines that run on the same physical machine, what may result in mapping them to the same physical page by a technique termed kernel same-page merging (KSM). This is especially useful for read-only pages, such as those holding code segments, which is the case for multiple virtual machines running the same or similar software, software libraries, web servers, middleware components, etc. The guest operating systems do not need to be compliant with the host hardware, thus making it possible to run different operating systems on the same computer (e.g., Windows, Linux, or prior versions of an operating system) to support future software.

The use of virtual machines to support separate guest operating systems is popular in regard to embedded systems. A typical use would be to run a real-time operating system simultaneously with a preferred complex operating system, such as Linux or Windows. Another use would be for novel and unproven software still in the developmental stage, so it runs inside a sandbox. Virtual machines have other advantages for operating system development and may include improved debugging access and faster reboots.

Multiple VMs running their own guest operating system are frequently engaged for server consolidation.

=== Process virtual machines ===


A process VM, sometimes called an &quot;application virtual machine&quot;, or &quot;Managed Runtime Environment&quot; (MRE), runs as a normal application inside a host OS and supports a single process. It is created when that process is started and destroyed when it exits. Its purpose is to provide a platform-independent programming environment that abstracts away details of the underlying hardware or operating system and allows a program to execute in the same way on any platform.

A process VM provides a high-level abstraction that of a high-level programming language (compared to the low-level ISA abstraction of the system VM). Process VMs are implemented using an interpreter; performance comparable to compiled programming languages can be achieved by the use of just-in-time compilation.

This type of VM has become popular with the Java programming language, which is implemented using the Java virtual machine. Other examples include the Parrot virtual machine and the .NET Framework, which runs on a VM called the Common Language Runtime. All of them can serve as an abstraction layer for any computer language.

A special case of process VMs are systems that abstract over the communication mechanisms of a (potentially heterogeneous) computer cluster. Such a VM does not consist of a single process, but one process per physical machine in the cluster. They are designed to ease the task of programming concurrent applications by letting the programmer focus on algorithms rather than the communication mechanisms provided by the interconnect and the OS. They do not hide the fact that communication takes place, and as such do not attempt to present the cluster as a single machine.

Unlike other process VMs, these systems do not provide a specific programming language, but are embedded in an existing language; typically such a system provides bindings for several languages (e.g., C and Fortran). Examples are Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and Message Passing Interface (MPI).

== History ==

Both system virtual machines and process virtual machines date to the 1960s and remain areas of active development.

&quot;System virtual machines&quot; grew out of time-sharing, as notably implemented in the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). Time-sharing allowed multiple users to use a computer concurrently: each program appeared to have full access to the machine, but only one program was executed at the time, with the system switching between programs in time slices, saving and restoring state each time. This evolved into virtual machines, notably via IBM&#x27;s research systems: the M44/44X, which used partial virtualization, and the CP-40 and SIMMON, which used full virtualization, and were early examples of hypervisors. The first widely available virtual machine architecture was the CP-67/CMS (see History of CP/CMS for details). An important distinction was between using multiple virtual machines on one host system for time-sharing, as in M44/44X and CP-40, and using one virtual machine on a host system for prototyping, as in SIMMON. Emulators, with hardware emulation of earlier systems for compatibility, date back to the IBM System/360 in 1963, while the software emulation (then-called &quot;simulation&quot;) predates it.

&quot;Process virtual machines&quot; arose originally as abstract platforms for an intermediate language used as the intermediate representation of a program by a compiler; early examples date to around 1964 with the META II compiler-writing system using it for both syntax description and target code generation. A notable 1966 example was the O-code machine, a virtual machine that executes O-code (object code) emitted by the front end of the BCPL compiler. This abstraction allowed the compiler to be easily ported to a new architecture by implementing a new back end that took the existing O-code and compiled it to machine code for the underlying physical machine. The Euler language used a similar design, with the intermediate language named &quot;P&quot; (portable). This was popularized around 1970 by Pascal, notably in the Pascal-P system (1973) and Pascal-S compiler (1975), in which it was termed p-code and the resulting machine as a p-code machine. This has been influential, and virtual machines in this sense have been often generally called p-code machines. In addition to being an intermediate language, Pascal p-code was also executed directly by an interpreter implementing the virtual machine, notably in UCSD Pascal (1978); this influenced later interpreters, notably the Java virtual machine (JVM). Another early example was SNOBOL4 (1967), which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language (SIL), an assembly language for a virtual machine, which was then targeted to physical machines by transpiling to their native assembler via a macro assembler. Macros have since fallen out of favor, however, so this approach has been less influential. Process virtual machines were a popular approach to implementing early microcomputer software, including Tiny BASIC and adventure games, from one-off implementations such as Pyramid 2000 to a general-purpose engine like Infocom&#x27;s z-machine, which Graham Nelson argues is &quot;possibly the most portable virtual machine ever created&quot;.

Significant advances occurred in the implementation of Smalltalk-80,
particularly the Deutsch/Schiffmann implementation
which pushed just-in-time (JIT) compilation forward as an implementation approach that uses process virtual machine.
Later notable Smalltalk VMs were VisualWorks, the Squeak Virtual Machine,
and Strongtalk.
A related language that produced a lot of virtual machine innovation was the Self programming language, which pioneered adaptive optimization and generational garbage collection. These techniques proved commercially successful in 1999 in the HotSpot Java virtual machine. Other innovations include a register-based virtual machine, to better match the underlying hardware, rather than a stack-based virtual machine, which is a closer match for the programming language; in 1995, this was pioneered by the Dis virtual machine for the Limbo language.

== Virtualization techniques ==

=== Full virtualization ===
In full virtualization, the virtual machine simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified &quot;guest&quot; OS (one designed for the same instruction set) to be run in isolation. This approach was pioneered in 1966 with the IBM CP-40 and CP-67, predecessors of the VM family.

Examples outside the mainframe field include Parallels Workstation, Parallels Desktop for Mac, VirtualBox, Virtual Iron, Oracle VM, Virtual PC, Virtual Server, Hyper-V, VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, VMware Server (discontinued, formerly called GSX Server), VMware ESXi, QEMU, Adeos, Mac-on-Linux, Win4BSD, Win4Lin Pro, and Egenera vBlade technology.

==== Hardware-assisted virtualization ====
In hardware-assisted virtualization, the hardware provides architectural support that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows guest OSes to be run in isolation.
Hardware-assisted virtualization was first introduced on the IBM System/370 in 1972, for use with VM/370, the first virtual machine operating system offered by IBM as an official product.

In 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD provided additional hardware to support virtualization. Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) added similar features in their UltraSPARC T-Series processors in 2005. Examples of virtualization platforms adapted to such hardware include KVM, VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, Hyper-V, Windows Virtual PC, Xen, Parallels Desktop for Mac, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, VirtualBox and Parallels Workstation.

In 2006, first-generation 32- and 64-bit x86 hardware support was found to rarely offer performance advantages over software virtualization.

=== OS-level virtualization ===
In OS-level virtualization, a physical server is virtualized at the operating system level, enabling multiple isolated and secure virtualized servers to run on a single physical server. The &quot;guest&quot; operating system environments share the same running instance of the operating system as the host system. Thus, the same operating system kernel is also used to implement the &quot;guest&quot; environments, and applications running in a given &quot;guest&quot; environment view it as a stand-alone system. The pioneer implementation was FreeBSD jails; other examples include Docker, Solaris Containers, OpenVZ, Linux-VServer, LXC, AIX Workload Partitions, Parallels Virtuozzo Containers, and iCore Virtual Accounts.

== Snapshots ==

A &quot;snapshot&quot; is a state of a virtual machine, and generally its storage devices, at an exact point in time. A snapshot enables the virtual machine&#x27;s state at the time of the snapshot to be restored later, effectively undoing any changes that occurred afterwards. This capability is useful as a backup technique, for example, prior to performing a risky operation.

Virtual machines frequently use virtual disks for their storage; in a very simple example, a 10-gigabyte hard disk drive is simulated with a 10-gigabyte flat file. Any requests by the VM for a location on its physical disk are transparently translated into an operation on the corresponding file. Once such a translation layer is present, however, it is possible to intercept the operations and send them to different files, depending on various criteria. Every time a snapshot is taken, a new file is created, and used as an overlay for its predecessors. New data is written to the topmost overlay; reading existing data, however, needs the overlay hierarchy to be scanned, resulting in accessing the most recent version. Thus, the entire stack of snapshots is virtually a single coherent disk; in that sense, creating snapshots works similarly to the incremental backup technique.

Other components of a virtual machine can also be included in a snapshot, such as the contents of its random-access memory (RAM), BIOS settings, or its configuration settings. &quot;Save state&quot; feature in video game console emulators is an example of such snapshots.

Restoring a snapshot consists of discarding or disregarding all overlay layers that are added after that snapshot, and directing all new changes to a new overlay.

== Migration ==

The snapshots described above can be moved to another host machine with its own hypervisor; when the VM is temporarily stopped, snapshotted, moved, and then resumed on the new host, this is known as migration. If the older snapshots are kept in sync regularly, this operation can be quite fast, and allow the VM to provide uninterrupted service while its prior physical host is, for example, taken down for physical maintenance.

== Failover ==

Similar to the migration mechanism described above, failover allows the VM to continue operations if the host fails. Generally it occurs if the migration has stopped working. However, in this case, the VM continues operation from the &quot;last-known&quot; coherent state, rather than the &quot;current&quot; state, based on whatever materials the backup server was last provided with.

== Nested virtualization ==
Nested virtualization refers to the ability of running a virtual machine within another, having this general concept extendable to an arbitrary depth. In other words, nested virtualization refers to running one or more hypervisors inside another hypervisor. The nature of a nested guest virtual machine does not need to be homogeneous with its host virtual machine; for example, application virtualization can be deployed within a virtual machine created by using hardware virtualization.

Nested virtualization becomes more necessary as widespread operating systems gain built-in hypervisor functionality, which in a virtualized environment can be used only if the surrounding hypervisor supports nested virtualization; for example, Windows 7 is capable of running Windows XP applications inside a built-in virtual machine. Furthermore, moving already existing virtualized environments into a cloud, following the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach, is much more complicated if the destination IaaS platform does not support nested virtualization.

The way nested virtualization can be implemented on a particular computer architecture depends on supported hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities. If a particular architecture does not provide hardware support required for nested virtualization, various software techniques are employed to enable it. Over time, more architectures gain required hardware support; for example, since the Haswell microarchitecture (announced in 2013), Intel started to include VMCS shadowing as a technology that accelerates nested virtualization.

<text>In computing, virtual memory, or virtual storage, is a memory management technique that provides an &quot;idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine&quot; which &quot;creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory&quot;.

The computer&#x27;s operating system, using a combination of hardware and software, maps memory addresses used by a program, called &quot;virtual addresses&quot;, into &quot;physical addresses&quot; in computer memory. Main storage, as seen by a process or task, appears as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments. The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a memory management unit (MMU), automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Software within the operating system may extend these capabilities, utilizing, e.g., disk storage, to provide a virtual address space that can exceed the capacity of real memory and thus reference more memory than is physically present in the computer.

The primary benefits of virtual memory include freeing applications from having to manage a shared memory space, ability to share memory used by libraries between processes, increased security due to memory isolation, and being able to conceptually use more memory than might be physically available, using the technique of paging or segmentation.

== Properties ==
Virtual memory makes application programming easier by hiding fragmentation of physical memory; by delegating to the kernel the burden of managing the memory hierarchy (eliminating the need for the program to handle overlays explicitly); and, when each process is run in its own dedicated address space, by obviating the need to relocate program code or to access memory with relative addressing.

Memory virtualization can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory.

== Usage ==
Virtual memory is an integral part of a modern computer architecture; implementations usually require hardware support, typically in the form of a memory management unit built into the CPU. While not necessary, emulators and virtual machines can employ hardware support to increase performance of their virtual memory implementations. Older operating systems, such as those for the mainframes of the 1960s, and those for personal computers of the early to mid-1980s (e.g., DOS), generally have no virtual memory functionality, though notable exceptions for mainframes of the 1960s include:

* the Atlas Supervisor for the Atlas
* THE multiprogramming system for the Electrologica X8 (software based virtual memory without hardware support)
* MCP for the Burroughs B5000
* MTS, TSS/360 and CP/CMS for the IBM System/360 Model 67
* Multics for the GE 645
* The Time Sharing Operating System for the RCA Spectra 70/46

During the 1960s and early &#x27;70s, computer memory was very expensive. The introduction of virtual memory provided an ability for software systems with large memory demands to run on computers with less real memory. The savings from this provided a strong incentive to switch to virtual memory for all systems. The additional capability of providing virtual address spaces added another level of security and reliability, thus making virtual memory even more attractive to the marketplace.

Most modern operating systems that support virtual memory also run each process in its own dedicated address space. Each program thus appears to have sole access to the virtual memory. However, some older operating systems (such as OS/VS1 and OS/VS2 SVS) and even modern ones (such as IBM i) are single address space operating systems that run all processes in a single address space composed of virtualized memory.

Embedded systems and other special-purpose computer systems that require very fast and/or very consistent response times may opt not to use virtual memory due to decreased determinism; virtual memory systems trigger unpredictable traps that may produce unwanted and unpredictable delays in response to input, especially if the trap requires that data be read into main memory from secondary memory. The hardware to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses typically requires a significant chip area to implement, and not all chips used in embedded systems include that hardware, which is another reason some of those systems do not use virtual memory.

==History==
In the 1950s, all larger programs had to contain logic for managing primary and secondary storage, such as overlaying. Virtual memory was therefore introduced not only to extend primary memory, but to make such an extension as easy as possible for programmers to use. To allow for multiprogramming and multitasking, many early systems divided memory between multiple programs without virtual memory, such as early models of the PDP-10 via registers.

A claim that the concept of virtual memory was first developed by German physicist Fritz-Rudolf Güntsch at the Technische Universität Berlin in 1956 in his doctoral thesis, &quot;Logical Design of a Digital Computer with Multiple Asynchronous Rotating Drums and Automatic High Speed Memory Operation&quot;, does not stand up to careful scrutiny. The computer proposed by Güntsch (but never built) had an address space of 105 words which mapped exactly onto the 105 words of the drums, i.e. the addresses were real addresses and there was no form of indirect mapping, a key feature of virtual memory. What Güntsch did invent was a form of cache memory, since his high-speed memory was intended to contain a copy of some blocks of code or data taken from the drums. Indeed, he wrote (as quoted in translation): &quot;The programmer need not respect the existence of the primary memory (he need not even know that it exists), for there is only one sort of addresses by which one can program as if there were only one storage.&quot; This is exactly the situation in computers with cache memory, one of the earliest commercial examples of which was the IBM System/360 Model 85. In the Model 85 all addresses were real addresses referring to the main core store. A semiconductor cache store, invisible to the user, held the contents of parts of the main store in use by the currently executing program. This is exactly analogous to Güntsch&#x27;s system, designed as a means to improve performance, rather than to solve the problems involved in multi-programming.
The first true virtual memory system was that implemented at the University of Manchester to create a one-level storage system as part of the Atlas Computer. It used a paging mechanism to map the virtual addresses available to the programmer onto the real memory that consisted of 16,384 words of primary core memory with an additional 98,304 words of secondary drum memory. The addition of virtual memory into the Atlas also eliminated a looming programming problem: planning and scheduling data transfers between main and secondary memory and recompiling programs for each change of size of main memory. The first Atlas was commissioned in 1962 but working prototypes of paging had been developed by 1959.

As early as 1958, Robert S. Barton, working at Shell Research, suggested that main storage should be allocated automatically rather than have the programmer being concerned with overlays from secondary memory, in effect virtual memory. By 1960 Barton was lead architect on the Burroughs B5000 project. From 1959 to 1961, W. R. Lonergan was manager of the Burroughs Product Planning Group which included Barton, Donald Knuth as consultant, and Paul King. In May 1960, UCLA ran a two-week seminar &quot;Using and Exploiting Giant Computers&quot; to which Paul King and two others were sent. Stan Gill gave a presentation on virtual memory in the Atlas I computer. Paul King took the ideas back to Burroughs and it was determined that virtual memory should be designed into the core of the B5000.. Burroughs Corporation released the B5000 in 1964 as the first commercial computer with virtual memory.

IBM developed the concept of hypervisors in their CP-40 and CP-67, and in 1972 provided it for the S/370 as Virtual Machine Facility/370. IBM introduced the Start Interpretive Execution (SIE) instruction as part of 370-XA on the 3081, and VM/XA versions of VM to exploit it.

Before virtual memory could be implemented in mainstream operating systems, many problems had to be addressed. Dynamic address translation required expensive and difficult-to-build specialized hardware; initial implementations slowed down access to memory slightly. There were worries that new system-wide algorithms utilizing secondary storage would be less effective than previously used application-specific algorithms. By 1969, the debate over virtual memory for commercial computers was over; an IBM research team led by David Sayre showed that their virtual memory overlay system consistently worked better than the best manually controlled systems. Throughout the 1970s, the IBM 370 series running their virtual-storage based operating systems provided a means for business users to migrate multiple older systems into fewer, more powerful, mainframes that had improved price/performance. The first minicomputer to introduce virtual memory was the Norwegian NORD-1; during the 1970s, other minicomputers implemented virtual memory, notably VAX models running VMS.

Virtual memory was introduced to the x86 architecture with the protected mode of the Intel 80286 processor, but its segment swapping technique scaled poorly to larger segment sizes. The Intel 80386 introduced paging support underneath the existing segmentation layer, enabling the page fault exception to chain with other exceptions without double fault. However, loading segment descriptors was an expensive operation, causing operating system designers to rely strictly on paging rather than a combination of paging and segmentation.

==Paged virtual memory==
Nearly all current implementations of virtual memory divide a virtual address space into pages, blocks of contiguous virtual memory addresses. Pages on contemporary systems are usually at least 4 kilobytes in size; systems with large virtual address ranges or amounts of real memory generally use larger page sizes.

===Page tables===
Page tables are used to translate the virtual addresses seen by the application into physical addresses used by the hardware to process instructions; such hardware that handles this specific translation is often known as the memory management unit. Each entry in the page table holds a flag indicating whether the corresponding page is in real memory or not. If it is in real memory, the page table entry will contain the real memory address at which the page is stored. When a reference is made to a page by the hardware, if the page table entry for the page indicates that it is not currently in real memory, the hardware raises a page fault exception, invoking the paging supervisor component of the operating system.

Systems can have, e.g., one page table for the whole system, separate page tables for each address space or process, separate page tables for each segment; similarly, systems can have, e.g., no segment table, one segment table for the whole system, separate segment tables for each address space or process, separate segment tables for each &quot;region&quot; in a tree of region tables for each address space or process. If there is only one page table, different applications running at the same time use different parts of a single range of virtual addresses. If there are multiple page or segment tables, there are multiple virtual address spaces and concurrent applications with separate page tables redirect to different real addresses.

Some earlier systems with smaller real memory sizes, such as the SDS 940, used &quot;page registers&quot; instead of page tables in memory for address translation.

===Paging supervisor===
This part of the operating system creates and manages page tables and lists of free page frames. In order to ensure that there will be enough free page frames to quickly resolve page faults, the system may periodically steal allocated page frames, using a page replacement algorithm, e.g., a least recently used (LRU) algorithm. Stolen page frames that have been modified are written back to auxiliary storage before they are added to the free queue. On some systems the paging supervisor is also responsible for managing translation registers that are not automatically loaded from page tables.

Typically, a page fault that cannot be resolved results in an abnormal termination of the application. However, some systems allow the application to have exception handlers for such errors. The paging supervisor may handle a page fault exception in several different ways, depending on the details:
*If the virtual address is invalid, the paging supervisor treats it as an error.
*If the page is valid and the page information is not loaded into the MMU, the page information will be stored into one of the page registers.
*If the page is uninitialized, a new page frame may be assigned and cleared.
*If there is a stolen page frame containing the desired page, that page frame will be reused.
*For a fault due to a write attempt into a read-protected page, if it is a copy-on-write page then a free page frame will be assigned and the contents of the old page copied; otherwise it is treated as an error.
*If the virtual address is a valid page in a memory-mapped file or a paging file, a free page frame will be assigned and the page read in.
In most cases, there will be an update to the page table, possibly followed by purging the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), and the system restarts the instruction that causes the exception.

If the free page frame queue is empty then the paging supervisor must free a page frame using the same page replacement algorithm for page stealing.

===Pinned pages===
Operating systems have memory areas that are &quot;pinned&quot; (never swapped to secondary storage). Other terms used are &quot;locked&quot;, &quot;fixed&quot;, or &quot;wired&quot; pages. For example, interrupt mechanisms rely on an array of pointers to their handlers, such as I/O completion and page fault. If the pages containing these pointers or the code that they invoke were pageable, interrupt-handling would become far more complex and time-consuming, particularly in the case of page fault interruptions. Hence, some part of the page table structures is not pageable.

Some pages may be pinned for short periods of time, others may be pinned for long periods of time, and still others may need to be permanently pinned. For example:
* The paging supervisor code and drivers for secondary storage devices on which pages reside must be permanently pinned, as otherwise paging would not even work because the necessary code would not be available.
* Timing-dependent components may be pinned to avoid variable paging delays.
* Data buffers that are accessed directly by peripheral devices that use direct memory access or I/O channels must reside in pinned pages while the I/O operation is in progress because such devices and the buses to which they are attached expect to find data buffers located at physical memory addresses; regardless of whether the bus has a memory management unit for I/O, transfers cannot be stopped if a page fault occurs and then restarted when the page fault has been processed. For example, the data could come from a measurement sensor unit and lost real time data that got lost because of a page fault can not be recovered.

In IBM&#x27;s operating systems for System/370 and successor systems, the term is &quot;fixed&quot;, and such pages may be long-term fixed, or may be short-term fixed, or may be unfixed (i.e., pageable). System control structures are often long-term fixed (measured in wall-clock time, i.e., time measured in seconds, rather than time measured in fractions of one second) whereas I/O buffers are usually short-term fixed (usually measured in significantly less than wall-clock time, possibly for tens of milliseconds). Indeed, the OS has a special facility for &quot;fast fixing&quot; these short-term fixed data buffers (fixing which is performed without resorting to a time-consuming Supervisor Call instruction).

Multics used the term &quot;wired&quot;. OpenVMS and Windows refer to pages temporarily made nonpageable (as for I/O buffers) as &quot;locked&quot;, and simply &quot;nonpageable&quot; for those that are never pageable. The Single UNIX Specification also uses the term &quot;locked&quot; in the specification for , as do the man pages on many Unix-like systems.

====Virtual-real operation====
In OS/VS1 and similar OSes, some parts of systems memory are managed in &quot;virtual-real&quot; mode, called &quot;V=R&quot;. In this mode every virtual address corresponds to the same real address. This mode is used for interrupt mechanisms, for the paging supervisor and page tables in older systems, and for application programs using non-standard I/O management. For example, IBM&#x27;s z/OS has 3 modes (virtual-virtual, virtual-real and virtual-fixed).

===Thrashing===
When paging and page stealing are used, a problem called &quot;thrashing&quot; can occur, in which the computer spends an unsuitably large amount of time transferring pages to and from a backing store, hence slowing down useful work. A task&#x27;s working set is the minimum set of pages that should be in memory in order for it to make useful progress. Thrashing occurs when there is insufficient memory available to store the working sets of all active programs. Adding real memory is the simplest response, but improving application design, scheduling, and memory usage can help. Another solution is to reduce the number of active tasks on the system. This reduces demand on real memory by swapping out the entire working set of one or more processes.

A system thrashing is often a result of a sudden spike in page demand from a small number of running programs. Swap-token is a lightweight and dynamic thrashing protection mechanism. The basic idea is to set a token in the system, which is randomly given to a process that has page faults when thrashing happens. The process that has the token is given a privilege to allocate more physical memory pages to build its working set, which is expected to quickly finish its execution and to release the memory pages to other processes. A time stamp is used to handover the token one by one. The first version of swap-token was implemented in Linux 2.6. The second version is called preempt swap-token and is also in Linux 2.6. In this updated swap-token implementation, a priority counter is set for each process to track the number of swap-out pages. The token is always given to the process with a high priority, which has a high number of swap-out pages. The length of the time stamp is not a constant but is determined by the priority: the higher the number of swap-out pages of a process, the longer the time stamp for it will be.

==Segmented virtual memory==
Some systems, such as the Burroughs B5500, and the current Unisys MCP systems use segmentation instead of paging, dividing virtual address spaces into variable-length segments. Using segmentation matches the allocated memory blocks to the logical needs and requests of the programs, rather than the physical view of a computer, although pages themselves are an artificial division in memory. The designers of the B5000 would have found the artificial size of pages to be Procrustean in nature, a story they would later use for the exact data sizes in the B1000.

In the Burroughs and Unisys systems, each memory segment is described by a master descriptor which is a single absolute descriptor which may be referenced by other relative (copy) descriptors, effecting sharing either within a process or between processes. Descriptors are central to the working of virtual memory in MCP systems. Descriptors contain not only the address of a segment, but the segment length and status in virtual memory indicated by the &#x27;p-bit&#x27; or &#x27;presence bit&#x27; which indicates if the address is to a segment in main memory or to a secondary-storage block. When a non-resident segment (p-bit is off) is accessed, an interrupt occurs to load the segment from secondary storage at the given address, or if the address itself is 0 then allocate a new block. In the latter case, the length field in the descriptor is used to allocate a segment of that length.

A further problem to thrashing in using a segmented scheme is checkerboarding, where all free segments become too small to satisfy requests for new segments. The solution is to perform memory compaction to pack all used segments together and create a large free block from which further segments may be allocated. Since there is a single master descriptor for each segment the new block address only needs to be updated in a single descriptor, since all copies refer to the master descriptor.

Paging is not free from fragmentation – the fragmentation is internal to pages (internal fragmentation). If a requested block is smaller than a page, then some space in the page will be wasted. If a block requires larger than a page, a small area in another page is required resulting in large wasted space. The fragmentation thus becomes a problem passed to programmers who may well distort their program to match certain page sizes. With segmentation, the fragmentation is external to segments (external fragmentation) and thus a system problem, which was the aim of virtual memory in the first place, to relieve programmers of such memory considerations. In multi-processing systems, optimal operation of the system depends on the mix of independent processes at any time. Hybrid schemes of segmentation and paging may be used.

The Intel 80286 supports a similar segmentation scheme as an option, but it is rarely used.

Segmentation and paging can be used together by dividing each segment into pages; systems with this memory structure, such as Multics and IBM System/38, are usually paging-predominant, segmentation providing memory protection.

In the Intel 80386 and later IA-32 processors, the segments reside in a 32-bit linear, paged address space. Segments can be moved in and out of that space; pages there can &quot;page&quot; in and out of main memory, providing two levels of virtual memory; few if any operating systems do so, instead using only paging. Early non-hardware-assisted x86 virtualization solutions combined paging and segmentation because x86 paging offers only two protection domains whereas a VMM, guest OS or guest application stack needs three. The difference between paging and segmentation systems is not only about memory division; segmentation is visible to user processes, as part of memory model semantics. Hence, instead of memory that looks like a single large space, it is structured into multiple spaces.

This difference has important consequences; a segment is not a page with variable length or a simple way to lengthen the address space. Segmentation that can provide a single-level memory model in which there is no differentiation between process memory and file system consists of only a list of segments (files) mapped into the process&#x27;s potential address space.

This is not the same as the mechanisms provided by calls such as mmap and Win32&#x27;s MapViewOfFile, because inter-file pointers do not work when mapping files into semi-arbitrary places. In Multics, a file (or a segment from a multi-segment file) is mapped into a segment in the address space, so files are always mapped at a segment boundary. A file&#x27;s linkage section can contain pointers for which an attempt to load the pointer into a register or make an indirect reference through it causes a trap. The unresolved pointer contains an indication of the name of the segment to which the pointer refers and an offset within the segment; the handler for the trap maps the segment into the address space, puts the segment number into the pointer, changes the tag field in the pointer so that it no longer causes a trap, and returns to the code where the trap occurred, re-executing the instruction that caused the trap. This eliminates the need for a linker completely and works when different processes map the same file into different places in their private address spaces.

==Address space swapping==
Some operating systems provide for swapping entire address spaces, in addition to whatever facilities they have for paging and segmentation. When this occurs, the OS writes those pages and segments currently in real memory to swap files. In a swap-in, the OS reads back the data from the swap files but does not automatically read back pages that had been paged out at the time of the swap out operation.

IBM&#x27;s MVS, from OS/VS2 Release 2 through z/OS, provides for marking an address space as unswappable; doing so does not pin any pages in the address space. This can be done for the duration of a job by entering the name of an eligible main program in the Program Properties Table with an unswappable flag. In addition, privileged code can temporarily make an address space unswappable using a SYSEVENT Supervisor Call instruction (SVC); certain changes in the address space properties require that the OS swap it out and then swap it back in, using SYSEVENT TRANSWAP.

Swapping does not necessarily require memory management hardware, if, for example, multiple jobs are swapped in and out of the same area of storage.

<doc id="32356" wikidata="Q828975" url="?curid=32356" title="Vexatious litigation">
<text>Vexatious litigation is legal action which is brought solely to harass or subdue an adversary. It may take the form of a primary frivolous lawsuit or may be the repetitive, burdensome, and unwarranted filing of meritless motions in a matter which is otherwise a meritorious cause of action. Filing vexatious litigation is considered an abuse of the judicial process and may result in sanctions against the offender.

A single action, even a frivolous one, is usually not enough to raise a litigant to the level of being declared vexatious. Rather, a pattern of frivolous legal actions is typically required to rise to the level of vexatious. Repeated and severe instances by a single lawyer or firm can result in eventual disbarment.

Some jurisdictions have a list of vexatious litigants: people who have repeatedly abused the legal system. Because lawyers could be disbarred for participating in this abuse of the legal process, vexatious litigants are often unable to retain legal counsel, and such litigants, therefore, represent themselves in court. Those on the vexatious litigant list are usually either forbidden from any further legal action or are required to obtain prior permission from a senior judge before taking any legal action. The process by which a person is added to the list varies among jurisdictions. In liberal democratic jurisdictions, declaring someone a vexatious litigant is considered to be a serious measure and rarely occurs, as judges and officials are reluctant to curtail a person&#x27;s access to the courts.
These legal actions occur in some countries of the former British Empire, where the common law system still remains: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, UK, and US, which are specified below. Civil (codified/continental) law systems typically do not have a prohibition against vexatious litigation.

==History of legislation against vexatious litigation==
The concept of vexatious litigation entered into law in 1896 with the Vexatious Actions Act, enacted in England and soon extended to Scotland and Ireland. This was primarily a response to the actions of Alexander Chaffers, a solicitor who filed numerous actions against leading members of Victorian society. When costs were awarded against him, he failed to pay.

The first such law outside the British Isles, the Supreme Court Act, 1927 was passed in Australia nearly thirty years later. This too was prompted by the behaviour of an individual, Rupert Millane. The first vexatious litigant law in the United States was enacted in California in 1963. By 2007 four more US states had passed similar legislation: Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas.

==Laws by country==

===Australia===

====Queensland====
In Queensland, the process for having someone declared a vexatious litigant is governed by the &quot;Vexatious Proceedings Act 2005&quot;, which supplanted an earlier Act. The Act defines a vexatious proceeding to include a proceeding brought without merit or any prospect of success, with the consequence that it is not necessary to prove the existence of any improper motive in order to obtain relief under the Act. there were 26 people found to be vexatious litigants.

====South Australia====
In South Australia, vexatious litigation laws were enacted in the mid-1930s with the &quot;Supreme Court Act 1935-1936&quot;, following similar laws enacted in Victoria. In 2010 the Rann government acted to strengthen the ability of the courts to act against vexatious litigants by &quot;increasing the range of courts and tribunals that can declare people as vexatious&quot;. Prior to that date, few people had been banned from bringing litigation to South Australian courts – by 2005, only two people were listed as having been declared as vexatious litigants, the first in 1997 and the second declared during that year. there were 7 people found to be vexatious litigants.

====Statistics====

, 21 people in Victoria had been declared vexatious litigants since the law was introduced in 1930.

The High Court of Australia declared only four people to be vexatious litigants in its 116 years in existence , whereas the Australian Federal Court system, established in 1976, has at least 49 names on its barred registry.

In New South Wales, there were 43 people on the New South Wales Supreme Court&#x27;s vexatious litigants register.

 there were 22 people found to be vexatious litigants in Western Australia.

===Canada===
Under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, section 92(14), each province is vested with the power to enact and apply laws relating to the administration of justice within its own territory.

In Canada, Section 40 of the &quot;Federal Court Act&quot;
 and in Ontario Section 140 of the &quot;Courts of Justice Act&quot;, restrict the ability to introduce or continue proceedings for those who have instituted vexatious proceedings or conducted proceedings in a vexatious manner.

====Quebec====
In Quebec, the Code of Civil Procedure is the principal legislation that sets rules related to civil procedure. Under section 46 of the Code of Civil Procedure, all judicial courts and judges in Quebec are vested with &quot;all the powers necessary for the exercise of their jurisdiction&quot;. Furthermore, they may:

Section 46 vests a very broad power on judicial courts and judges to ensure that the administration of justice is conducted according to decorum and according to the remedial nature of justice. As the courts&#x27;s decisions have shown it, the authority to declare a litigant as vexatious is directly tributary to the power conferred by section 46. Cases illustrating the application of section 46 are numerous. Among them, there are: &quot;Nguiagain v. Commission de la fonction publique&quot;, in which the judge rejected the plaintiff&#x27;s motion for a &quot;mandamus&quot; to enjoin his union to revise the grievance that he had filed on the grounds that the motion was groundless and abusive; &quot;De Niverville c. Descôteaux&quot;, where an injunction was rendered declaring the respondent, disbarred lawyer Descôteaux, as a vexatious litigant due to the multiple unfounded and frivolous actions that he had sought against the plaintiff De Niverville; and in &quot;Fabrikant v. Corbin&quot;, a motion to declare the plaintiff Valery Fabrikant as a vexatious litigant was granted to the defendant, Corbin. In all of the above cited cases, a litigant was only declared vexatious following a proceeding instated by the opposite party. Moreover, section 46&#x27;s scope is limited to judicial courts and judges. Administrative tribunals are legislative creations and they can only exist and function within the limits that are imposed by law. Administrative tribunals in Quebec cannot declare a person a vexatious litigant.

As per section 90 of the &quot;Rules of Practice of the Superior Court of Québec in Civil Matters&quot;, such litigants are now indexed in a registry kept by the Chief Justice in the judiciary district of Montreal. Lawyer and author Claude Duchesnay has reported in May 2003 that a document on the Quebec attorney general&#x27;s intranet contains the name of 58 persons who must obtain permission prior to instating proceedings before the courts.

===India===
There is not a specific law titled &quot;Vexatious Litigation Law&quot; in India, the concept is primarily addressed through provisions in the Civil Procedure Code and through judicial decisions. The Indian legal system empowers courts to deal with vexatious litigation through several mechanisms. One common tool is the imposition of costs on the litigant who files frivolous suits. Courts have the discretion to order costs to be paid to the opposing party as a means of discouraging such behavior. These costs can include legal fees and compensation for the wasted time and resources of the other party. Also under Section 35A of the Civil Procedure Code, courts have the authority to declare a litigant a &quot;vexatious litigant.&quot; This declaration prohibits the person from filing any further lawsuits in a particular court without obtaining prior permission. This provision is designed to deter individuals from repeatedly abusing the legal system. Courts have the authority to dismiss frivolous cases at the preliminary stage and even initiate contempt of court proceedings against those who persistently file baseless lawsuits.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, a court may, of its own motion or on application, order that no proceedings, either of a certain type or at all, may be issued by a certain person without leave of that court or some other court, for a specified time, or indefinitely. Such an order is referred to in legal circles as an Isaac Wunder order after Isaac Wunder who made several claims against the Hospitals Trust claiming sweepstakes prizes, but the claims were found to be groundless and the case deemed frivolous or vexatious. He was prohibited from taking further High Court proceedings in the action without leave of the court.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand a person may be declared a vexatious litigant by a High Court Judge on the application of the Attorney-General. A vexatious litigant must then apply to a High Court Judge for leave to commence any action. A decision by the High Court whether or not to grant leave cannot be appealed.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====

In England and Wales there are two methods to control vexatious litigants: 
* Civil restraint orders (made by the courts themselves on the application or their own initiative); and
* Vexatious litigants orders (made by the High Court under section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 on the application of HM Attorney-General).

His Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service maintains a list of vexatious litigants and those subject to a civil restraint order.

===== Civil restraint orders =====
Courts in England and Wales have the means of escalating the sanctions against a litigant who makes applications to the court that are &quot;totally without merit&quot;. Civil restraint orders allow courts to forbid applications for court hearings without the permission of a judge. There are three types of CRO: limited, extended and general, with different scopes of application. Further applications totally without merit can lead to the withdrawal of the right of appeal. Harassment of the court and court officials can lead to a penal prohibition notice, prohibiting the litigant from contacting or approaching the court without permission.

===== Vexatious litigant orders =====
Section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 provides the High Court with the power to make an order restricting the ability of a person to undertake litigation without leave of the High Court. The High Court may make a civil proceedings order, a criminal proceedings order or an all proceedings order.

A person subject to a civil proceedings order may not institute or continue civil proceedings in any court (which includes tribunals of a judicial function) without leave of the High Court. A person subject to a criminal proceeding order may not lay information before a justice of the peace or prefer a bill of indictment without leave of the High Court. A person subject to an all proceedings order is subject to the restriction in both a civil proceedings order and a criminal proceedings order.

Where the High Court makes an order under this section it is published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

Such an order can only be made on the application of HM Attorney-General and where the High Court is satisfied that the person has habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground—
# instituted vexatious civil proceedings, whether in the High Court or the family court or any inferior court, and whether against the same person or against different persons; or
# made vexatious applications in any civil proceedings, whether in the High Court or the family court or any inferior court, and whether instituted by him or another, or
# instituted vexatious prosecutions (whether against the same person or different persons).

In relation to the civil proceedings, the High Court will only grant leave to initiate or continue the proceedings or application where it is satisfied it is not an abuse of the process of the court in question and that there are reasonable grounds for the proceedings or application.

In relation to criminal proceedings, the High Court will only grant leave for the laying of an information or for an application for leave to prefer a bill of indictment where it is satisfied that the institution of the prosecution is not an abuse of the criminal process and that there are reasonable grounds for the institution of the prosecution by the applicant.

====Scotland====
The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service holds a published list of members of the public who have habitually and persistently instituted vexatious legal proceedings without reasonable ground, and have been declared vexatious litigants under the Vexatious Actions (Scotland) Act 1898. This piece of legislation has been repealed, and replaced by incorporation into section 100 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. Under this legislation, the Inner House of the Court of Session can make an order to prevent a person accused of vexatious litigation from raising or progressing any civil legal proceedings without permission from a judge of the Outer House of the Court of Session. Such an Order may have a specified time period, or may run indefinitely. The published list of such individuals, as of December 2024, contains thirteen names.

===United States===

As of 2007, several states have vexatious litigant laws — California, Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas.

====California====

The Judicial Council of California maintains an online monthly Vexatious Litigant List containing the names of several thousand vexatious individuals and companies. Orders filed from 1991 to the present are included on the list. Unless represented by an attorney, persons on the list may not file any new litigation in California without first obtaining permission from the presiding judge of the court. Under California Code of Civil Procedure § 391.7(a), any vexatious litigant who disobeys the prefiling order may be punished for contempt of court.

Under California law a vexatious litigant is someone who does any of the following, most of which require that the litigant be proceeding &quot;pro se&quot;, i.e., representing himself:

#In the immediately preceding seven-year period has maintained &quot;in propria persona&quot; at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been (i) finally determined adversely to the person or (ii) unjustifiably remained pending at least two years without going to trial or hearing.
#After a litigation has been finally determined against the person, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate, &quot;in propria persona&quot;, either (i) the validity of the determination against the same defendant or defendants or (ii) the cause of action, claim, or any of the issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by the final determination against the same defendant or defendants.
#In any litigation while acting &quot;in propria persona&quot;, repeatedly files unmeritorious motions or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
#Has previously been declared to be a vexatious litigant by any state or federal court in a proceeding based upon substantially similar facts.

The threshold for &quot;repeated&quot; frivolous motions or litigations is quite high. “Most cases affirming the vexatious litigant designation involve situations where litigants have filed dozens of motions either during the pendency of an action or relating to the same judgment.&quot; Evidence that a litigant is a frequent plaintiff or defendant alone is insufficient to support a vexatious litigant designation.

Repeated motions must be &quot;so devoid of merit and be so frivolous that they can be described as a flagrant abuse of the system, have no reasonable probability of success, lack reasonable or probable cause or excuse, and are clearly meant to abuse the processes of the courts and to harass the adverse party than other litigants.&quot; The moving party, in addition to demonstrating that the plaintiff is vexatious, must show that the case has little chance of prevailing on the merits. If the plaintiff is so determined, a bond may be required, and if the plaintiff does not meet the bond requirement, the case is dismissed. 

Habeas petitions do not count towards vexatious litigant determination. Vexatiousness in probate actions have a lower standard.

==Notable vexatious litigants==
* Lawrence Bittaker, who together with his partner Roy Norris was convicted of torturing, raping and murdering five young girls in 1979, filed 40 separate frivolous lawsuits against the state of California, including one claiming &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; after being served a broken cookie. In 1993, he was declared a vexatious litigant and was forbidden from filing lawsuits without the permission of a lawyer or a judge.
* Alexander Chaffers, a solicitor whose actions led to the first British law against vexatious litigation, the Vexatious Actions Act, 1896. Chaffers became notorious after accusing the wife of Travers Twiss of being a prostitute, and subsequently issued 48 proceedings against leading members of Victorian society in the 1890s. Costs awarded against Chaffers were never paid. After the act was passed, he became the first person to be declared a habitually vexatious litigant and barred from future litigation without judicial permission.
* Caryl Chessman, American sentenced to death in 1948 for kidnapping and sexual assault. 
* Valery Fabrikant, a former Concordia University professor serving a life sentence for the murders of four colleagues in 1992.
* Julian Knight, convicted of the Hoddle Street massacre in Melbourne, Australia. Numerous actions, primarily seeking injunctions against the prison incarcerating him, have cost the Victorian government over A$250,000 directly, plus some A$128,000 in outside legal costs.
* David James &quot;Indian Chief&quot; Lindsey, a Melbourne man so declared after repeatedly suing doctors, insurance firms and companies such as Carlton &amp; United Breweries for smoking-related damages. On February 21, 2006, the Supreme Court of Appeal gave him leave to sue Philip Morris, demonstrating that a vexatious litigant is not completely blocked from launching further court action.
* Andy Martin (Anthony Martin-Tragona), a perennial candidate for US elections, who has been barred since 1983 from filing any legal action in a United States federal court without permission. He is also banned from seeking indigent status in Florida courts due to his history of filing abusive petitions, and from filing lawsuits in New York, unless represented by an attorney or with the court&#x27;s prior approval.
* Jonathan Lee Riches, former prisoner who filed over 2,600 lawsuits over the course of six years.
* The Church of Scientology; after Scientology sued former member Robin Scott, the court wrote in 1996: &quot;Plaintiffs (Scientologists) have abused the federal court system by using it, &quot;inter alia&quot;, to attempt to destroy their opponents, rather than to resolve an actual dispute over trademark law or any other legal matter [and also has a] documented history of vexatious behavior. [Furthermore], The Special Master has never seen a more glaring example of bad faith litigation than this.&quot;
* Francis &quot;Coyote&quot; Shivers, actor and singer, declared vexatious by the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2008.
* Dorothy Squires, singer and former wife of actor Roger Moore; declared a vexatious litigant in 1987; legal fees led to her bankruptcy.
* Leo Stoller, a trademark troll, was declared a vexatious litigant by multiple U.S. federal courts, including the Supreme Court, in 2007.
* Isaac Wunder, who gave his name to the Isaac Wunder order which may be issued in Ireland to vexatious litigants.

<doc id="32359" wikidata="Q1398" url="?curid=32359" title="Virgil">
<text>Publius Vergilius Maro (; 15 October 70 BC21 September 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil ( ) in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He composed three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the &quot;Eclogues&quot; (or &quot;Bucolics&quot;), the &quot;Georgics&quot;, and the epic &quot;Aeneid&quot;. A number of minor poems, collected in the &quot;Appendix Vergiliana&quot;, were attributed to him in ancient times, but modern scholars generally regard these works as spurious, with the possible exception of a few short pieces.

Already acclaimed in his own lifetime as a classic author, Virgil rapidly replaced Ennius and other earlier authors as a standard school text, and stood as the most popular Latin poet through late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and early modernity, exerting inestimable influence on all subsequent Western literature. Geoffrey Chaucer assigned Virgil a uniquely prominent position among all the celebrities of human history in &quot;The House of Fame&quot; (1374–85), describing him as standing &quot;on a pilere / that was of tinned yren clere&quot; (&quot;on a pillar that was of bright tin-plated iron&quot;), and in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, in which Virgil appears as the author&#x27;s guide through Hell and Purgatory, Dante pays tribute to Virgil with the words (&quot;Inf.&quot; I.86–7) (&quot;thou art alone the one from whom I took the beautiful style that has done honour to me&quot;). In the 20th Century, T. S. Eliot famously began a lecture on the subject &quot;What Is a Classic?&quot; by asserting as self-evidently true that &quot;whatever the definition we arrive at, it cannot be one which excludes Virgil – we may say confidently that it must be one which will expressly reckon with him.&quot;

==Traditional biography==
===Biographical sources===
Biographical information about Virgil is transmitted chiefly in (&#x27;lives&#x27;) of the poet prefixed to commentaries on his work by Probus, Donatus, and Servius. The life given by Donatus is generally considered to closely reproduce the life of Virgil from a lost work of Suetonius on the lives of famous authors, just as Donatus used this source for the poet&#x27;s life in his commentary on Terence, where Suetonius is explicitly credited. The far shorter life given by Servius likewise seems to be an abridgement of Suetonius except for one or two statements. Varius is said to have written a memoir of his friend Virgil, and Suetonius likely drew on this lost work and other sources contemporary with the poet. A life written in verse by the grammarian Phocas (probably active in the 4th through 5th century AD) differs in some details from Donatus and Servius. Henry Nettleship believed that the life attributed to Probus may have drawn independently from the same sources as Suetonius, but it is attributed by other authorities to an anonymous author of the 5th or 6th century AD who drew on Donatus, Servius, and Phocas. The Servian life was the principal source of Virgil&#x27;s biography for medieval readers, while the Donatian life enjoyed a more limited circulation, and the lives of Phocas and Probus remained largely unknown.

Although the commentaries record much factual information about Virgil, some of their evidence can be shown to rely on allegorizing and on inferences drawn from his poetry. For this reason, details regarding Virgil&#x27;s life story are considered somewhat problematic.

===Family and birth===

According to the ancient , Publius Vergilius Maro was born on the Ides of October in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus (15 October 70 BC) in the village of Andes, near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy, added to Italy proper during his lifetime). The Donatian life reports that some say Virgil&#x27;s father was a potter, but most say he was an employee of an apparitor named Magius, whose daughter he married. According to Phocas and Probus, the name of Virgil&#x27;s mother was Magia Polla. The cognomen of Virgil&#x27;s maternal family, &quot;Magius,&quot; and failure to distinguish the genitive form of this rare name (&quot;Magi&quot;) in Servius&#x27; life from the genitive &quot;magi&quot; of the noun &quot;magus&quot; (&quot;magician&quot;), probably contributed to the rise of the medieval legend that Virgil&#x27;s father was employed by a certain itinerant magician, and that Virgil was a magician himself.

Analysis of his name has led some to believe that he descended from earlier Roman colonists. Modern speculation is not supported by narrative evidence from his writings or his later biographers.

====Site of Andes====

A tradition of obscure origin, which was accepted by Dante, identifies Andes with modern Pietole, two or three miles southeast of Mantua. The ancient biography attributed to Probus records that Andes was thirty Roman miles (about ) from Mantua. There are eight or nine references to the &quot;gens&quot; to which Vergil belonged, &quot;gens Vergilia&quot;, in inscriptions from Northern Italy. Out of these, four are from townships remote from Mantua, three appear in inscriptions from Verona, and one in an inscription from Calvisano, a votive offering to the Matronae (a group of deities) by a woman called Vergilia, asking the goddesses to deliver from danger another woman, called Munatia. A tomb erected by a member of the &quot;gens Magia&quot;, to which Virgil&#x27;s mother belonged, is found at Casalpoglio, just from Calvisano. In 1915, G. E. K. Braunholtz drew attention to the proximity of these inscriptions to each other, and the fact that Calvisano is exactly 30 Roman miles from Mantua, which led Robert Seymour Conway to theorize that these inscriptions have to do with relatives of Virgil, and Calvisano or Carpenedolo, not Pietole, is the site of Andes. E. K. Rand defended the traditional site at Pietole, noting that Egnazio&#x27;s 1507 edition of Probus&#x27; commentary, supposedly based on a &quot;very ancient codex&quot; from Bobbio Abbey which can no longer be found, says that Andes was three miles from Mantua, and arguing that this is the correct reading. Conway replied that Egnazio&#x27;s manuscript cannot be trusted to have been as ancient as Egnazio claimed it was, nor can we be sure that the reading &quot;three&quot; is not Egnazio&#x27;s own conjectural correction of his manuscript to harmonize it with the Pietole tradition, and all other evidence strongly favours the unanimous reading of the other witnesses of &quot;thirty miles.&quot; Other studies claim that today&#x27;s consideration for ancient &quot;Andes&quot; should be sought in the Casalpoglio area of Castel Goffredo.

==== Spelling of name ====
By the fourth or fifth century AD the original spelling &quot;Vergilius&quot; had been changed to &quot;Virgilius&quot;, and then the latter spelling spread to the modern European languages. This latter spelling persisted even though, as early as the 15th century, the classical scholar Poliziano had shown &quot;Vergilius&quot; to be the original spelling. Today, the anglicisations &quot;Vergil&quot; and &quot;Virgil&quot; are both considered acceptable.

There is some speculation that the spelling &quot;Virgilius&quot; might have arisen due to a pun, since &quot;virg-&quot; carries an echo of the Latin word for &#x27;wand&#x27; (&quot;uirga&quot;), Virgil being particularly associated with magic in the Middle Ages. There is also a possibility that &quot;virg-&quot; is meant to evoke the Latin &quot;virgo&quot; (&#x27;virgin&#x27;); this would be a reference to the fourth &quot;Eclogue&quot;, which has a history of Christian, and specifically Messianic, interpretations.

===Childhood and education===

Virgil spent his boyhood in Cremona until his 15th year (55 BC), when he is said to have received the &quot;toga virilis&quot; on the very day that Lucretius died. From Cremona, he moved to Milan, and shortly afterwards to Rome. After briefly considering a career in rhetoric and law, the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry. Despite the biographers statements that Virgil&#x27;s family was of modest means, these accounts of his education, as well as of his ceremonial assumption of the &quot;toga virilis,&quot; suggest that his father was in fact a wealthy equestrian landowner.

He is said to have been tall and stout, with a swarthy complexion and a rustic appearance. Virgil also seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid. Schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved, and he was nicknamed &quot;Parthenias&quot; (&quot;virgin&quot;) because of his social aloofness.

===Poetic career===

The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter &quot;Eclogues&quot; (or &quot;Bucolics&quot;) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC, although this is controversial. After defeating the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar in the Battle of Philippi (42 BC), Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, which—according to tradition—included an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of Virgil&#x27;s family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as his motives in the composition of the &quot;Eclogues&quot;. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the &quot;Eclogues&quot;. In &quot;Eclogues&quot; 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident.

Sometime after the publication of the &quot;Eclogues&quot; (probably before 37 BC), Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas, Octavian&#x27;s capable &quot;agent d&#x27;affaires&quot; who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian&#x27;s side. Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time, including Horace, in whose poetry he is often mentioned, and Varius Rufus, who later helped finish the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

At Maecenas&#x27;s insistence (according to the tradition) Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37–29 BC) on the long dactylic hexameter poem called the &quot;Georgics&quot; (from Greek, &quot;On Working the Earth&quot;), which he dedicated to Maecenas.

Virgil worked on the &quot;Aeneid&quot; during the last eleven years of his life (29–19 BC), commissioned, according to Propertius, by Augustus. According to the tradition, Virgil traveled to the senatorial province of Achaea in Greece in about 19 BC to revise the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara. After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in Apulia on 21 September 19 BC. Augustus ordered Virgil&#x27;s literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard Virgil&#x27;s own wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.

==== Burial and tomb ====
After his death at Brundisium according to Donatus, or at Taranto according to some late manuscripts of Servius, Virgil&#x27;s remains were transported to Naples, where his tomb was engraved with an epitaph that he himself composed: &quot;&quot;; &quot;Mantua gave me life, the Calabrians took it away, Naples holds me now; I sang of pastures, farms, and commanders.&quot; (transl. Bernard Knox) Martial reports that Silius Italicus annexed the site to his estate (11.48, 11.50), and Pliny the Younger says that Silius &quot;would visit Virgil&#x27;s tomb as if it were a temple&quot; (&quot;Epistulae&quot; 3.7.8).

The structure known as Virgil&#x27;s tomb is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel () in Piedigrotta, a district from the centre of Naples, near the Mergellina harbour, on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli. While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death, in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers, and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration. Through the nineteenth century, the supposed tomb regularly attracted travellers on the Grand Tour, and it still draws visitors today.

==Works==
===Early works===

According to the commentators, Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and later went to Cremona, Milan, and finally Rome to study rhetoric, medicine, and astronomy, which he would abandon for philosophy. From Virgil&#x27;s admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna, it has been inferred that he was, for a time, associated with Catullus&#x27;s neoteric circle. According to the &quot;Catalepton&quot;, he began to write poetry while in the Epicurean school of Siro in Naples. A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title &quot;Appendix Vergiliana&quot;, but are largely considered spurious by scholars. One, the &quot;Catalepton&quot;, consists of fourteen short poems, some of which may be Virgil&#x27;s, and another, a short narrative poem titled the &quot;Culex&quot; (&quot;The Gnat&quot;), was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD.

===&quot;Eclogues&quot;===

The &quot;Eclogues&quot; (from the Greek for &quot;selections&quot;) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic (that is, &quot;pastoral&quot; or &quot;rural&quot;) poetry of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus, which were written in dactylic hexameter. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (&quot;Ecl&quot;. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master&#x27;s pet, &quot;Ecl&quot;. 2), or a master singer&#x27;s claim to have composed several eclogues (&quot;Ecl&quot;. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author&#x27;s characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought.

The ten &quot;Eclogues&quot; present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (&quot;Ecl&quot;. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (&quot;Ecl&quot;. 3). &quot;Eclogue&quot; 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called &quot;Messianic Eclogue&quot;, uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Virgil in his &quot;Eclogues&quot; is credited with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and with setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus and later writers.

===&quot;Georgics&quot;===


The ostensible theme of the &quot;Georgics&quot; is instruction in the methods of running a farm. In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the didactic (&quot;how to&quot;) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; and several works of the later Hellenistic poets.

The four books of the &quot;Georgics&quot; focus respectively on:
# raising crops;
# raising trees;
# livestock and horses;
# beekeeping and the qualities of bees.

Well-known passages include the beloved &quot;Laus Italiae&quot; of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an &quot;epyllion&quot; which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus&#x27; journey to the underworld.

Ancient scholars, such as Servius, conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor&#x27;s request, a long section in praise of Virgil&#x27;s friend, the poet Gallus, who was disgraced by Augustus, and who committed suicide in 26 BC.

The tone of the &quot;Georgics&quot; wavers between optimism and pessimism, sparking critical debate on the poet&#x27;s intentions, but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry. Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the &quot;Georgics&quot; to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.

===&quot;Aeneid&quot;===

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; is widely considered Virgil&#x27;s finest work, and is regarded as one of the most important poems in the history of Western literature (T. S. Eliot referred to it as &#x27;the classic of all Europe&#x27;). The work (modelled after Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;) chronicles a refugee of the Trojan War, named Aeneas, as he struggles to fulfill his destiny. His intentions are to reach Italy, where his descendants Romulus and Remus are to found the city of Rome.

The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas, a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy, to Italy, his battle with the Italian prince Turnus, and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge. The &quot;Aeneid&quot;&#x27;s first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome. Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic; Homer, the pre-eminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to whom he alludes. Although the &quot;Aeneid&quot; casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres, such as tragedy and aetiological poetry. Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the &quot;Aeneid&quot; into two sections based on the poetry of Homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as a model while the last six were connected to the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Book 1 (at the head of the Odyssean section) opens with a storm which Juno, Aeneas&#x27;s enemy throughout the poem, stirs up against the fleet. The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which historically was Rome&#x27;s deadliest foe. The queen, Dido, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. In Book 5, funeral games are celebrated for Aeneas&#x27;s father Anchises, who had died a year before. On reaching Cumae, in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl, who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome&#x27;s destiny to his son.

Book 7 (beginning the Iliadic half) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas&#x27;s arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus. Lavinia had already been promised to Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, who is roused to war by the Fury Allecto and Amata, Lavinia&#x27;s mother. In Book 8, Aeneas allies with King Evander, who occupies the future site of Rome, and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history. Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians; Book 10, the death of Evander&#x27;s young son Pallas; and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus. The &quot;Aeneid&quot; ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus&#x27;s city, the death of Amata, and Aeneas&#x27;s defeat and killing of Turnus, whose pleas for mercy are spurned. The final book ends with the image of Turnus&#x27;s soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld.

===Reception of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;===

Critics of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; focus on a variety of issues. The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The &quot;Aeneid&quot; is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus&#x27;s victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas&#x27;s emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the &quot;pious&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot; Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus.

The &quot;Aeneid&quot; appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4, and 6 to Augustus; and Book 6 apparently caused the emperor&#x27;s sister Octavia to faint. Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly skepticism, it has served as a basis for later art, such as Jean-Baptiste Wicar&#x27;s &quot;Virgil Reading the Aeneid&quot;.

Some lines of the poem were left unfinished, and the whole was unedited, at Virgil&#x27;s death in 19 BC. As a result, the text of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e. not a complete line of dactylic hexameter). Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect. Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate.

== Legacy and reception ==

=== Antiquity ===
The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The &quot;Eclogues&quot;, &quot;Georgics&quot;, and above all the &quot;Aeneid&quot; became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; in &quot;Amores&quot; 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, the so-called &quot;mini-Aeneid&quot;, has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan&#x27;s epic, the &quot;Bellum Civile&quot;, has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing of the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian-era poet Statius in his 12-book epic &quot;Thebaid&quot; engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to &quot;rival the divine &quot;Aeneid&quot;, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.&quot; Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers in Silius Italicus. With almost every line of his epic &quot;Punica&quot;, Silius references Virgil.

Partially as a result of his so-called &quot;Messianic&quot; Fourth Ecloguewidely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus ChristVirgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the &quot;Sortes Vergilianae&quot;, the process of using Virgil&#x27;s poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the &quot;Saturnalia&quot; credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Virgil also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius&#x27;s commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil&#x27;s life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.

=== Late antiquity ===

The verse inscription at Virgil&#x27;s tomb was supposedly composed by the poet himself: &quot;Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces.&quot; (&quot;[[Mantua]] gave me life, the [[Salento|Calabrians]] took it away, [[Naples]] holds me now; I sang of pastures, farms, and commanders&quot; [transl. [[Bernard Knox]]])
Even as the Western Roman Empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet – Saint Augustine, for example, confessing how he had wept at reading the death of Dido. The best-known surviving manuscripts of Virgil&#x27;s works include manuscripts from late antiquity such as the &quot;Vergilius Augusteus&quot;, the &quot;Vergilius Vaticanus&quot; and the &quot;Vergilius Romanus&quot;.

=== Middle Ages ===
Gregory of Tours read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though he cautions that &quot;we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death&quot;. In the Renaissance of the 12th century, Alexander Neckham placed the &quot;divine&quot; &quot;Aeneid&quot; on his standard arts curriculum, and Dido became the romantic heroine of the age. Monks like Maiolus of Cluny might repudiate what they called &quot;the luxurious eloquence of Virgil&quot;, but they could not deny the power of his appeal.

==== Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ====

Dante presents Virgil as his guide through Hell and the greater part of Purgatory in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Dante also mentions Virgil in &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot;, as one of the four &quot;regulati poetae&quot; along with Ovid, Lucan and Statius (ii, vi, 7).

=== Renaissance and early modernity ===
The Renaissance saw a number of authors inspired to write epic in Virgil&#x27;s wake: Edmund Spenser called himself the English Virgil; &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was influenced by the example of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;; and later artists influenced by Virgil include Berlioz and Hermann Broch.

===Legends===
The legend of &quot;Virgil in his basket&quot; arose in the Middle Ages, and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos, demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men. In this story Virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman, sometimes described as the emperor&#x27;s daughter or mistress and called Lucretia. She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house, which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window. When he did so he was hoisted only halfway up the wall and then left trapped there into the next day, exposed to public ridicule. The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle. Among other artists depicting the scene, Lucas van Leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving.

In the Middle Ages, Virgil&#x27;s reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy. From at least the 3rd century, Christian thinkers interpreted &quot;Eclogue&quot; 4, which describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age, as a prediction of Jesus&#x27;s birth. In consequence, Virgil came to be seen on a similar level to the Hebrew prophets of the Bible as one who had heralded Christianity. Relatedly, &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; argues that medieval legends about the golem may have been inspired by Virgilian legends about the poet&#x27;s apocryphal power to bring inanimate objects to life.

Possibly as early as the second century AD, Virgil&#x27;s works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination. In what became known as the &quot;Sortes Vergilianae&quot; (&quot;Virgilian Lots&quot;), passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions. In the 12th century, starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe, a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician. Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years, arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves. Virgil&#x27;s legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name, &quot;Fferyllt&quot; or &quot;Pheryllt&quot;, became a generic term for magic-worker, and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist, &quot;fferyllydd&quot;.

<text>Value theory is the study of values. Also called axiology, it examines the nature, sources, and types of values. It is a branch of philosophy and an interdisciplinary field closely associated with social sciences like economics, sociology, anthropology, and psychology.

Value is the worth of something, usually understood as a degree that covers both positive and negative magnitudes corresponding to the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. Values influence many human endeavors related to emotion, decision-making, and action. Value theorists distinguish between intrinsic and instrumental value. An entity has intrinsic value if it is good in itself, independent of external factors. An entity has instrumental value if it is useful as a means leading to other good things. Some classifications focus on the type of benefit, including economic, moral, political, aesthetic, and religious values. Other categorizations include attributive, predicative, personal, impersonal, and agent-relative values.

Value realists state that values have mind-independent existence as objective features of reality. Anti-realists reject this, with some seeing values as subjective human creations and others viewing value statements as meaningless. Regarding the sources of value, hedonists argue that only pleasure has intrinsic value, whereas desire theorists discuss desires as the ultimate source of value. Perfectionism, another approach, emphasizes the cultivation of characteristic human abilities. Value pluralism identifies diverse sources of intrinsic value, raising the issue of whether values belonging to different types are comparable. Value theorists employ various methods of inquiry, ranging from reliance on intuitions and thought experiments to the description of first-person experience and the analysis of language.

Ethics, a related field, focuses primarily on normative concepts of right behavior, whereas value theory explores evaluative concepts about what is good. In economics, theories of value are frameworks to assess and explain the economic value of commodities. Sociology and anthropology examine values as aspects of societies and cultures, reflecting dominant preferences and beliefs. Psychologists tend to understand values as abstract motivational goals that shape an individual&#x27;s personality. The roots of value theory lie in the ancient period as reflections on the highest good that humans should pursue.

== Definition ==
Value theory, also known as &quot;axiology&quot; and &quot;theory of values&quot;, is the systematic study of values. As the branch of philosophy examining which things are good and what it means for something to be good, it distinguishes different types of values and explores how they can be measured and compared. It also studies whether values are a fundamental aspect of reality and how they affect phenomena such as emotion, desire, decision, and action. Its topic is relevant to many human endeavors because values are guiding principles that underlie the political, economic, scientific, and personal spheres. Value theory analyzes and evaluates phenomena such as well-being, utility, beauty, human life, knowledge, wisdom, freedom, love, and justice.

The precise definition of value theory is disputed and some theorists rely on alternative characterizations. In a broad sense, &quot;value theory&quot; is a catch-all label that encompasses all philosophical disciplines studying evaluative or normative topics. According to this view, value theory is one of the main branches of philosophy and includes ethics, aesthetics, social philosophy, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. A similar broad characterization sees value theory as a multidisciplinary area of inquiry that covers research from fields like sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics in addition to philosophy. In a narrow sense, value theory is a subdiscipline of ethics that is particularly relevant to the school of consequentialism since it determines how to assess the value of consequences.

The word &quot;axiology&quot; has its origin in the ancient Greek terms (axios, meaning or ) and (logos, meaning or ). Even though the roots of value theory reach back to the ancient period, this area of thought was only conceived as a distinct discipline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the term &quot;axiology&quot; was coined. The terms &quot;value theory&quot; and &quot;axiology&quot; are usually used as synonyms but some philosophers distinguish between them. According to one characterization, axiology is a subfield of value theory that limits itself to theories about what things are valuable and how valuable they are. The term &quot;timology&quot; is an older and less common synonym.

== Value ==

Value is the worth, usefulness, or merit of something. Many evaluative terms are employed to talk about value, including &quot;good&quot;, &quot;best&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;excellent&quot; as well as their negative counterparts, like &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;terrible&quot;. Some value terms, like &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, are pure evaluations in that they only express the value of something without any additional descriptive content. They are known as &quot;thin evaluative concepts&quot;. Thick evaluative concepts, like &quot;courageous&quot; and &quot;cruel&quot;, provide more information by expressing other qualities besides the evaluation, such as character traits. Values are often understood as degrees that cover positive and negative magnitudes corresponding to good and bad. The term &quot;value&quot; is sometimes restricted to positive degrees to contrast with the term &quot;disvalue&quot; for the negative degrees. The terms &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; are used to compare degrees, but it is controversial whether this is possible in all cases. Evaluation is the assessment or measurement of value, often employed to compare the benefits of different options to find the most advantageous choice.

Evaluative terms are sometimes distinguished from normative or deontic terms. Normative terms, like &quot;right&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot;, and &quot;obligation&quot;, prescribe actions or other states by expressing what ought to be done or what is required. Evaluative terms have a wider scope because they are not limited to what people can control or are responsible for. For example, involuntary events like digestion and earthquakes can have a positive or negative value even if they are not right or wrong in a strict sense. Despite the distinction, evaluative and normative concepts are closely related. For example, the value of the consequences of an action may affect whether this action is right or wrong.

Value theorists distinguish various types or categories of values. The different classifications overlap and are based on considerations like the source, beneficiary, and function of the value.

=== Intrinsic and instrumental ===

A thing has intrinsic or final value if it is good in itself or good for its own sake. This means that it is good independent of external factors or outcomes. A thing has extrinsic or instrumental value if it is useful or leads to other good things. In other words, it is a means to bring about a desired end. For example, tools like microwaves or money have instrumental value thanks to the useful functions they perform. In some cases, the thing produced this way has itself instrumental value, like when using money to buy a microwave. This can result in a chain of instrumentally valuable things in which each link gets its value by causing the following link. Intrinsically valuable things stand at the endpoint of these chains and ground the value of all the links that come before them. 

One suggestion to distinguish between intrinsic and instrumental value relies on a thought experiment that imagines the valuable thing in isolation from everything else. In such a situation, purely instrumentally valuable things lose their value since they serve no purpose while purely intrinsically valuable things remain valuable. According to a common view, pleasure is one of the sources of intrinsic value. Other suggested sources include desire satisfaction, virtue, life, health, beauty, freedom, and knowledge.

Intrinsic and instrumental value are not exclusive categories. As a result, a thing can have both intrinsic and instrumental value if it is both good in itself while also leading to other good things. In a similar sense, a thing can have different instrumental values at the same time, both positive and negative ones. This is the case if some of its consequences are good while others are bad. The total instrumental value of a thing is the value balance of all its consequences.

Because instrumental value depends on other values, it is an open question whether it should be understood as a value in a strict sense. For example, the overall value of a chain of causes leading to an intrinsically valuable thing remains the same if instrumentally valuable links are added or removed without affecting the intrinsically valuable thing. The observation that the overall value does not change is sometimes used as an argument that the things added or removed do not have value.

Traditionally, value theorists have used the terms &quot;intrinsic value&quot; and &quot;final value&quot; interchangeably, just like the terms &quot;extrinsic value&quot; and &quot;instrumental value&quot;. This practice has been questioned in the 20th century based on the idea that they are similar but not identical concepts. According to this view, a thing has intrinsic value if the source of its value is an intrinsic property, meaning that the value does not depend on how the thing is related to other objects. Extrinsic value, by contrast, depends on external relations. This view sees instrumental value as one type of extrinsic value based on causal relations. At the same time, it allows that there are other types of non-instrumental extrinsic value. Final value is understood as what is valued for its own sake, independent of whether intrinsic or extrinsic properties are responsible.

=== Absolute and relative ===
Another distinction relies on the contrast between absolute and relative value. Absolute value, also called &quot;value simpliciter&quot;, is a form of unconditional value. A thing has relative value if its value is limited to certain considerations or viewpoints.

One form of relative value is restricted to the type of an entity, expressed in sentences like &quot;That is a good knife&quot; or &quot;Jack is a good thief&quot;. This form is known as &quot;attributive goodness&quot; since the word &quot;good&quot; modifies the meaning of another term. To be attributively good as a certain type means to possess certain qualities characteristic of that type. For example, a good knife is sharp and a good thief has the skill of stealing without getting caught. Attributive goodness contrasts with predicative goodness. The sentence &quot;Pleasure is good&quot; is an example since the word good is used as a predicate to talk about the unqualified value of pleasure. Attributive and predicative goodness can accompany each other, but this is not always the case. For instance, being a good thief is not necessarily a good thing.

Another type of relative value restricts goodness to a specific person. Known as &quot;personal value&quot;, it expresses what benefits a particular person, promotes their welfare, or is in their interest. For example, a poem written by a child may have personal value for the parents even if the poem lacks value for others. Impersonal value, by contrast, is good in general without restriction to any specific person or viewpoint. Some philosophers, like G. E. Moore, reject the existence of personal values, holding that all values are impersonal. Others have proposed theories about the relation between personal and impersonal value. The agglomerative theory says that impersonal value is nothing but the sum of all personal values. Another view understands impersonal value as a specific type of personal value taken from the perspective of the universe as a whole.

Agent-relative value is sometimes contrasted with personal value as another person-specific limitation of the evaluative outlook. Agent-relative values affect moral considerations about what a person is responsible for or guilty of. For example, if Mei promises to pick Pedro up from the airport then an agent-relative value obligates Mei to drive to the airport. This obligation is in place even if it does not benefit Mei, in which case there is an agent-relative value without a personal value. In consequentialism, agent-relative values are often discussed in relation to ethical dilemmas. One dilemma revolves around the question of whether an individual should murder an innocent person if this prevents the murder of two innocent people by a different perpetrator. The agent-neutral perspective tends to affirm this idea since one murder is preferable to two. The agent-relative perspective tends to reject this conclusion, arguing that the initial murder should be avoided since it negatively impacts the agent-relative value of the individual.

Traditionally, most value theorists see absolute value as the main topic of value theory and focus their attention on this type. Nonetheless, some philosophers, like Peter Geach and Philippa Foot, have argued that the concept of absolute value by itself is meaningless and should be understood as one form of relative value.

=== Other distinctions ===
Other classifications of values have been proposed without a widely accepted main classification. Some focus on the types of entities that have value. They include distinct categories for entities like things, the environment, individuals, groups, and society. Another subdivision pays attention to the type of benefit involved and encompasses material, economic, moral, social, political, aesthetic, and religious values. Classifications by the beneficiary of the value distinguish between self- and other-oriented values.

A historically influential approach identifies three spheres of value: truth, goodness, and beauty. For example, the neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband characterizes them as the highest goals of consciousness, with thought aiming at truth, will aiming at goodness, and emotion aiming at beauty. A similar view, proposed by the Chinese philosopher Zhang Dainian, says that the value of truth belongs to knowledge, the value of goodness belongs to behavior, and the value of beauty belongs to art. This three-fold distinction also plays a central role in the philosophies of Franz Brentano and Jürgen Habermas. Other suggested types of values include objective, subjective, potential, actual, contingent, necessary, inherent, and constitutive values.

== Schools of thought ==
=== Realism and anti-realism ===
Value realism is the view that values have mind-independent existence. This means that objective facts determine what has value, irrespective of subjective beliefs and preferences. According to this view, the evaluative statement &quot;That act is bad&quot; is as objectively true or false as the empirical statement &quot;That act causes distress&quot;.

Realists often analyze values as properties of valuable things. For example, stating that kindness is good asserts that kindness possesses the property of goodness. Value realists disagree about what type of property is involved. Naturalists say that value is a natural property. Natural properties can be known through empirical observation and are studied by the natural sciences. This means that value is similar to other natural properties, like size and shape. Non-naturalists reject this view but agree that values are real. They say that values differ significantly from empirical properties and belong to another realm of reality. According to one view, they are known through rational or emotional intuition rather than empirical observation.

Another disagreement among realists is about whether the entity carrying the value is a concrete individual or a state of affairs. For instance, the name &quot;Bill&quot; refers to an individual while the sentence &quot;Bill is pleased&quot; refers to a state of affairs. States of affairs are complex entities that combine other entities, like the individual &quot;Bill&quot; and the property &quot;is pleased&quot;. Some value theorists hold that the value is a property directly of Bill while others contend that it is a property of the state of affairs that Bill is pleased. This distinction affects various disputes in value theory. In some cases, a value is intrinsic according to one view and extrinsic according to the other.

Value realism contrasts with anti-realism, which comes in various forms. In its strongest version, anti-realism rejects the existence of values in any form, claiming that value statements are meaningless. Between these two positions, there are various intermediary views. Some anti-realists accept that value claims have meaning but deny that they have a truth value, a position known as non-cognitivism. For example, emotivists say that value claims express emotional attitudes, similar to how exclamations like &quot;Yay!&quot; or &quot;Boo!&quot; express emotions rather than stating facts.

Cognitivists contend that value statements have a truth value. Error theorists defend anti-realism based on this view by stating that all value statements are false because there are no values. Another view accepts the existence of values but denies that they are mind-independent. According to this view, the mental states of individuals determine whether an object has value, for instance, because individuals desire it. A similar view is defended by existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre, who argued that values are human creations that endow the world with meaning. Subjectivist theories say that values are relative to each subject, whereas more objectivist outlooks hold that values depend on mind in general rather than on the individual mind. A different position accepts that values are mind-independent but holds that they are reducible to other facts, meaning that they are not a fundamental part of reality. One form of reductionism maintains that a thing is good if it is fitting to favor this thing, regardless of whether people actually favor it. The strongest form of realism says that value is a fundamental part of reality and cannot be reduced to other aspects.

=== Sources of value ===
Various theories about the sources of value have been proposed. They aim to clarify what kinds of things are intrinsically good. The historically influential theory of hedonism states that how people feel is the only source of value. More specifically, it says that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and pain is the only intrinsic evil. According to this view, everything else only has instrumental value to the extent that it leads to pleasure or pain, including knowledge, health, and justice. Hedonists usually understand the term &quot;pleasure&quot; in a broad sense that covers all kinds of enjoyable experiences, including bodily pleasures of food and sex as well as more intellectual or abstract pleasures, like the joy of reading a book or being happy about a friend&#x27;s promotion. Pleasurable experiences come in degrees, and hedonists usually associate their intensity and duration with the magnitude of value they have.

Many hedonists identify pleasure and pain as symmetric opposites, meaning that the value of pleasure balances out the disvalue of pain if they have the same intensity. However, some hedonists reject this symmetry and give more weight to avoiding pain than to experiencing pleasure. Although it is widely accepted that pleasure is valuable, the hedonist claim that it is the only source of value is controversial. Welfarism, a closely related theory, understands well-being as the only source of value. Well-being is what is ultimately good for a person. As a consequence, welfarism asserts that value has its origin in the states of individuals.

Desire theories offer a slightly different account, stating that desire satisfaction is the only source of value. This theory overlaps with hedonism because many people desire pleasure and because desire satisfaction is often accompanied by pleasure. Nonetheless, there are important differences: people desire a variety of other things as well, like knowledge, achievement, and respect; additionally, desire satisfaction may not always result in pleasure. Some desire theorists hold that value is a property of desire satisfaction itself, while others say that it is a property of the objects that satisfy a desire. One debate in desire theory concerns whether any desire is a source of value. For example, if a person has a false belief that money makes them happy, it is questionable whether the satisfaction of their desire for money is a source of value. To address this consideration, some desire theorists say that a desire can only provide value if a fully informed and rational person would have it. This view excludes faulty desires.

Perfectionism identifies the realization of human nature and the cultivation of characteristic human abilities as the source of intrinsic goodness. It covers capacities and character traits belonging to the bodily, emotional, volitional, cognitive, social, artistic, and religious fields. Perfectionists disagree about which human excellences are the most important. Many are pluralistic in recognizing a diverse array of human excellences, such as knowledge, creativity, health, beauty, free agency, and moral virtues like benevolence and courage. According to one suggestion, there are two main fields of human goods: theoretical abilities responsible for understanding the world and practical abilities responsible for interacting with it. Some perfectionists provide an ideal characterization of human nature, holding that human excellences are those aspects that promote the realization of this goal. This view is exemplified in Aristotle&#x27;s focus on rationality as the nature and ideal state of human beings. Non-humanistic versions extend perfectionism to the natural world in general, arguing that excellence as a source of intrinsic value is not limited to the human realm.

=== Monism and pluralism ===
Monist theories of value assert that there is only a single source of intrinsic value. They agree that various things have value but maintain that all fundamentally good things belong to the same type. For example, hedonists hold that nothing but pleasure has intrinsic value, while desire theorists argue that desire satisfaction is the only source of fundamental goodness. Pluralists reject this view, contending that a simple single-value system is too crude to capture the complexity of the sphere of values. They say that diverse sources of value exist independently of one another, each contributing to the overall value of the world.

One motivation for value pluralism is the observation that people value diverse types of things, including happiness, friendship, success, and knowledge. This diversity becomes particularly prominent when people face difficult decisions between competing values, such as choosing between friendship and career success. Since monists accept only one source of intrinsic value, they explain this observation by holding that other items in this diversity have only instrumental value or, in some cases, no value at all.

Pluralists have proposed various accounts of how their view affects practical decisions. Rational decisions often rely on value comparisons to determine which course of action should be pursued. Some pluralists discuss a hierarchy of values reflecting the relative importance and weight of different value types to help people promote higher values when faced with difficult choices. For example, philosopher Max Scheler ranks values based on how enduring and fulfilling they are into the levels of pleasure, utility, vitality, culture, and holiness. He asserts that people should not promote lower values, like pleasure, if this comes at the expense of higher values.

Radical pluralists reject this approach, putting more emphasis on diversity by holding that different types of values are not comparable with each other. This means that each value type is unique, making it impossible to determine which one is superior. Some value theorists use radical pluralism to argue that value conflicts are inevitable, that the gain of one value cannot always compensate for the loss of another, and that some ethical dilemmas are irresolvable. For example, philosopher Isaiah Berlin applied this idea to the values of liberty and equality, arguing that a gain in one cannot make up for a loss in the other. Similarly, philosopher Joseph Raz said that it is often impossible to compare the values of career paths, like when choosing between becoming a lawyer or a clarinetist. The terms &quot;incomparability&quot; and &quot;incommensurability&quot; are often used as synonyms. However, philosophers like Ruth Chang distinguish them. According to this view, incommensurability means that there is no common measure to quantify values of different types. Incommensurable values may or may not be comparable. If they are, it is possible to say that one value is better than another, but it is not possible to quantify how much better it is.

=== Others ===
Several controversies surround the question of how the intrinsic value of a whole is determined by the intrinsic values of its parts. According to the additivity principle, the intrinsic value of a whole is simply the sum of the intrinsic values of its parts. For example, if a virtuous person becomes happy then the intrinsic value of the happiness is simply added to the intrinsic value of the virtue, thereby increasing the overall value.

Various counterexamples to the additivity principle have been proposed, suggesting that the relation between parts and wholes is more complex. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that if a vicious person becomes happy, this happiness, though good in itself, does not increase the overall value. On the contrary, it makes things worse, according to Kant, since viciousness should not be rewarded with happiness. This situation is known as an &quot;organic unity&quot;, a whole whose intrinsic value differs from the sum of the intrinsic values of its parts. Another perspective, called &quot;holism about value&quot;, asserts that the intrinsic value of a thing depends on its context. Holists can argue that happiness has positive intrinsic value in the context of virtue and negative intrinsic value in the context of vice. Atomists reject this view, saying that intrinsic value is context-independent.

Theories of value aggregation provide concrete principles for calculating the overall value of an outcome based on how positively or negatively each individual is affected by it. For example, if a government implements a new policy that affects some people positively and others negatively, theories of value aggregation can be used to determine whether the overall value of the policy is positive or negative. Axiological utilitarianism accepts the additivity principle, saying that the total value is simply the sum of all individual values. Axiological egalitarians are not only interested in the sum total of value but also in how the values are distributed. They argue that an outcome with a balanced advantage distribution is better than an outcome where some benefit a lot while others benefit little, even if the two outcomes have the same sum total. Axiological prioritarians are particularly concerned with the benefits of individuals who are worse off. They say that providing advantages to people in need has more value than providing the same advantages to others.

Another debate addresses the meaning of life, investigating whether life or existence as a whole has a higher meaning or purpose. Naturalist views argue that the meaning of life is found within the physical world, either as objective values that are true for everyone or as subjective values that vary according to individual preferences. Suggested fields where humans find meaning include exercising freedom, committing oneself to a cause, practicing altruism, engaging in positive social relationships, or pursuing personal happy. Supernaturalists, by contrast, propose that meaning lies beyond the natural world. For example, various religions teach that God created the world for a higher purpose, imbuing existence with meaning. A related outlook argues that immortal souls serve as sources of meaning by being connected to a transcendent reality and evolving spiritually. Existential nihilists reject both naturalist and supernaturalist explanations by asserting that there is no higher purpose. They suggest that life is meaningless, with the consequence that there is no higher reason to continue living and that all efforts, achievements, happiness, and suffering are ultimately pointless.

Formal axiology is a theory of value initially developed by philosopher Robert S. Hartman. This approach treats axiology as a formal science, akin to logic and mathematics. It uses axioms to give an abstract definition of value, understanding it not as a property of things but as a property of concepts. Values measure the extent to which an entity fulfills its concept. For example, a good car has all the desirable qualities of cars, like a reliable engine and effective brakes, whereas a bad car lacks many. Formal axiology distinguishes between three fundamental value types: intrinsic values apply to people; extrinsic values apply to things, actions, and social roles; systemic values apply to conceptual constructs. Formal axiology examines how these value types form a hierarchy and how they can be measured.

== Methods ==
Value theorists employ various methods to conduct their inquiry, justify theories, and measure values. Intuitionists rely on intuitions to assess evaluative claims. In this context, an intuition is an immediate apprehension or understanding of a self-evident claim, meaning that its truth can be assessed without inferring it from another observation. Value theorists often rely on thought experiments to gain this type of understanding. Thought experiments are imagined scenarios that exemplify philosophical problems. Philosophers use counterfactual reasoning to evaluate the possible consequences and gain insight into the underlying problem. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick imagines an experience machine that can virtually simulate an ideal life. Based on his observation that people would not want to spend the rest of their lives in this pleasurable simulation, Nozick argues against the hedonist claim that pleasure is the only source of intrinsic value. According to him, the thought experiment shows that the value of an authentic connection to reality is not reducible to pleasure.

Phenomenologists provide a detailed first-person description of the experience of values. They closely examine emotional experiences, ranging from desire, interest, and preference to feelings in the form of love and hate. However, they do not limit their inquiry to these phenomena, asserting that values permeate experience at large. A key aspect of the phenomenological method is to suspend preconceived ideas and judgments to understand the essence of experiences as they present themselves to consciousness.

The analysis of concepts and ordinary language is another method of inquiry. By examining terms and sentences used to talk about values, value theorists aim to clarify their meanings, uncover crucial distinctions, and formulate arguments for and against axiological theories. For example, a prominent dispute between naturalists and non-naturalists hinges on the conceptual analysis of the term &quot;good&quot;, in particular, whether its meaning can be analyzed through natural terms, like &quot;pleasure&quot;.

In the social sciences, value theorists face the challenge of measuring the evaluative outlook of individuals and groups. Specifically, they aim to determine personal value hierarchies, for example, whether a subject gives more weight to truth than to moral goodness or beauty. They distinguish between direct and indirect measurement methods. Direct methods involve asking people straightforward questions about what things they value and which value priorities they have. This approach assumes that people are aware of their evaluative outlook and able to articulate it accurately. Indirect methods do not share this assumption, asserting instead that values guide behavior and choices on an unconscious level. Consequently, they observe how people decide and act, seeking to infer the underlying value attitudes responsible for picking one course of action rather than another.

Various catalogs or scales of values have been proposed to measure value priorities. The Rokeach Value Survey considers a total of 36 values divided into two groups: instrumental values, like honesty and capability, which serve as means to promote terminal values, such as freedom and family security. It asks participants to rank them based on their impact on the participants&#x27; lives, aiming to understand the relative importance assigned to each of them. The Schwartz theory of basic human values is a modification of the Rokeach Value Survey that seeks to provide a more cross-cultural and universal assessment. It arranges the values in a circular manner to reflect that neighboring values are compatible with each other, such as tradition and security, while values on opposing sides may conflict with each other, such as tradition and self-direction.

== In various fields ==
=== Ethics ===
Ethics and value theory are overlapping fields of inquiry. Ethics studies moral phenomena, focusing on how people should act or which behaviors are morally right. Value theory investigates the nature, sources, and types of values in general. Some philosophers understand value theory as a subdiscipline of ethics. This is based on the idea that what people should do is affected by value considerations but not necessarily limited to them. Another view sees ethics as a subdiscipline of value theory. This outlook follows the idea that ethics is concerned with moral values affecting what people can control, whereas value theory examines a broader horizon of values, including those beyond anyone&#x27;s control. Some perspectives contrast ethics and value theory, asserting that the normative concepts examined by ethics are distinct from the evaluative concepts examined by value theory. Axiological ethics is a subfield of ethics examining the nature and role of values from a moral perspective, with particular interest in determining which ends are worth pursuing.

The ethical theory of consequentialism combines the perspectives of ethics and value theory, asserting that the rightness of an action depends on the value of its consequences. Consequentialists compare possible courses of action, saying that people should follow the one leading to the best overall consequences. The overall consequences of an action are the totality of its effects, or how it impacts the world by starting a causal chain of events that would not have occurred otherwise. Distinct versions of consequentialism rely on different theories of the sources of value. Classical utilitarianism, a prominent form of consequentialism, says that moral actions produce the greatest amount of pleasure for the greatest number of people. It combines a consequentialist outlook on right action with a hedonist outlook on pleasure as the only source of intrinsic value.

=== Economics ===

Economics is a social science studying how goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed, both from the perspective of individual agents and societal systems. Economists view evaluations as a driving force underlying economic activity. They use the notion of economic value and related evaluative concepts to understand decision-making processes, resource allocation, and the impact of policies. The economic value or benefit of a commodity is the advantage it provides to an economic agent, often measured in terms of the money people are willing to pay for it.

Economic theories of value are frameworks to explain how economic value arises and which factors influence it. Prominent frameworks include the classical labor theory of value and the neo-classical marginal theory of value. The labor theory, initially developed by the economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo, distinguishes between use value—the utility or satisfaction a commodity provides—and exchange value—the proportion at which one commodity can be exchanged with another. It focuses on exchange value, which it says is determined by the amount of labor required to produce the commodity. In its simplest form, it directly correlates exchange value to labor time. For example, if the time needed to hunt a deer is twice the time needed to hunt a beaver then one deer is worth two beavers. The philosopher Karl Marx extended the labor theory of value in various ways. He introduced the concept of surplus value, which goes beyond the time and resources invested to explain how capitalists can profit from the labor of their employees.

The marginal theory of value focuses on consumption rather than production. It says that the utility a commodity is the source of its value. Specifically, it is interested in marginal utility, the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of the commodity. Marginal utility often diminishes if many units have already been consumed, leading to a decrease in the exchange value of commodities that are abundantly available. Both the labor theory and the marginal theory were later challenged by the Sraffian theory of value.

=== Sociology ===
Sociology studies social behavior, relationships, institutions, and society at large. In their analyses and explanations of these phenomena, some sociologists use the concept of values to understand issues like social cohesion and conflict, the norms and practices people follow, and collective action. They usually understand values as subjective attitudes possessed by individuals and shared in social groups. According to this view, values are beliefs or priorities about goals worth pursuing that guide people to act in certain ways. This subjective conception of values as aspects of individuals and social groups contrasts with the objective conceptions of values more prominent in economics, which understands values as aspects of commodities.

Shared values can help unite people in the pursuit of a common cause, fostering social cohesion. Value differences, by contrast, may divide people into antagonistic groups that promote conflicting projects. Some sociologists employ value research to predict how people will behave. Given the observation that someone values the environment, they may conclude that this person is more likely to recycle or support pro-environmental legislation. One approach to this type of research uses value scales, such as the Rokeach Value Survey and the Schwartz theory of basic human values, to measure the value outlook of individuals and groups.

=== Anthropology ===

Anthropology also studies human behavior and societies but does not limit itself to contemporary social structures, extending its focus to humanity both past and present. Similar to sociologists, many anthropologists understand values as social representations of goals worth pursuing. For them, values are embedded in mental structures associated with culture and ideology about what is desirable. A slightly different approach in anthropology focuses on the practical side of values, holding that values are constantly created through human activity.

Anthropological value theorists use values to compare cultures. They can be employed to examine similarities as universal concerns present in every society. For example, anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn and sociologist Fred Strodtbeck proposed a set of value orientations found in every culture. Values can also be used to analyze differences between cultures and value changes within a culture. Anthropologist Louis Dumont followed this idea, suggesting that the cultural meaning systems in distinct societies differ in their value priorities. He argued that values are ordered hierarchically around a set of paramount values that trump all other values.

The contrast between individualism and collectivism is an influential topic in cross-cultural value research. Individualism promotes values associated with the autonomy of individuals, such as self-directedness, independence, and personal goals. Collectivism gives priority to group-related values, like cooperation, conformity, and foregoing personal advantages for the sake of collective benefits. As a rough simplification, it is often suggested that individualism is more prominent in Western cultures, whereas collectivism is more commonly observed in Eastern cultures.

=== Psychology ===

As the study of mental phenomena and behavior, psychology contrasts with sociology and anthropology by focusing more on the perspective of individuals than the broader social and cultural contexts. Psychologists tend to understand values as abstract motivational goals or general principles about what matters. From this perspective, values differ from specific plans and intentions since they are stable evaluative tendencies not bound to concrete situations.

Various psychological theories of values establish a close link between an individual&#x27;s evaluative outlook and their personality. An early theory, formulated by psychologists Philip E. Vernon and Gordon Allport, understands personality as a collection of aspects unified by a coherent value system. It distinguishes between six personality types corresponding to the value spheres of theory, economy, aesthetics, society, politics, and religion. For example, people with theoretical personalities place special importance on the value of knowledge and discovery of truth. Influenced by Vernon and Allport, psychologist Milton Rokeach conceptualized values as enduring beliefs about what goals and conduct are preferable. He divided values into the categories of instrumental and terminal values. He thought that a central aspect of personality lies in how people prioritize the values within each category. Psychologist Shalom Schwartz refined this approach by linking values to emotion and motivation. He explored how value rankings affect decisions in which the values of different options conflict.

== History ==
The origin of value theory lies in the ancient period, with early reflections on the good life and the ends worth pursuing. Socrates () identified the highest good as the right combination of knowledge, pleasure, and virtue, holding that active inquiry is associated with pleasure while knowledge of the good leads to virtuous action. Plato () conceived the good as a universal and changeless idea. It is the highest form in his theory of forms, acting as the source of all other forms and the foundation of reality and knowledge. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) saw eudaimonia as the highest good and ultimate goal of human life. He understood eudaimonia as a form of happiness or flourishing achieved through the exercise of virtues in accordance with reason, leading to the full realization of human potential. Epicurus () proposed a nuanced egoistic hedonism, stating that personal pleasure is the greatest good while recommending moderation to avoid the negative effects of excessive desires and anxiety about the future. According to the Stoics, a virtuous life following nature and reason is the highest good. They thought that self-mastery and rationality lead to a pleasant equanimity independent of external circumstances. Influenced by Plato, Plotinus () held that the Good is the ultimate principle of reality from which everything emanates. For him, evil is not a distinct opposing principle but merely a deficiency or absence of being resulting from a missing connection to the Good.

In ancient Indian philosophy, the idea that people are trapped in a cycle of rebirths arose around 600 BCE. Many traditions adopted it, arguing that liberation from this cycle is the highest good. Hindu philosophy distinguishes the four fundamental values of duty, economic wealth, sensory pleasure, and liberation. Many Hindu schools of thought prioritize the value of liberation. A similar outlook is found in ancient Buddhist philosophy, starting between the sixth and the fifth centuries BCE, where the cessation of suffering through the attainment of Nirvana is considered the ultimate goal. In ancient China, Confucius () explored the role of self-cultivation in leading a virtuous life, viewing general benevolence towards humanity as the supreme virtue. In comparing the highest virtue to water, Laozi (6th century BCE) emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the natural order of the universe.

Religious teachings influenced value theory in the medieval period. Early Christian thinkers, such as St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430 CE), adapted the theories of Plato and Plotinus into a religious framework. They identified God as the ultimate source of existence and goodness, seeing evil as a mere lack or privation of good. Drawing on Aristotelianism, Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas (1224–1274 CE) said that communion with the divine, achieved through a beatific vision of God, is the highest end of humans. In Arabic–Persian philosophy, al-Farabi () asserted that the supreme form of human perfection is an intellectual happiness, reachable in the afterlife by developing the intellect to its fullest potential. Avicenna (980–1037 CE) also regarded the intellect as the highest human faculty. He thought that a contemplative life prepares humans for the greatest good, which is only attained in the afterlife when humans are free from bodily distractions. In Indian philosophy, Adi Shankara () taught that liberation, the highest human end, is reached by realizing that the self is the same as ultimate reality encompassing all of existence. In Chinese thought, the early neo-Confucian philosopher Han Yu (768–824) identified the sage as an ideal role model who, through self-cultivation, achieves personal integrity expressed in harmony between theory and action in daily life.

Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) understood values as subjective phenomena that depend on a person&#x27;s interests. He examined how the interests of individuals can be aggregated to guide political decisions. David Hume (1711–1776) agreed with Hobbes&#x27;s subjectivism, exploring how values differ from objective facts. Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) asserted that the highest good is happiness in proportion to moral virtue. He emphasized the primacy of virtue by respecting the moral law and the inherent value of people, adding that moral virtue is ideally, but not always, accompanied by personal happiness. Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) formulated classical utilitarianism, combining a hedonist theory about value with a consequentialist theory about right action. Hermann Lotze (1817–1881) developed a philosophy of values, holding that values make the world meaningful as an ordered whole centered around goodness. Influenced by Lotze, the neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband (1848–1915) understood philosophy as a theory of values, claiming that universal values determine the principles that all subjects should follow, including the norms of knowledge and action. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) held that values are human creations. He criticized traditional values in general and Christian values in particular, calling for a revaluation of all values centered on life-affirmation, power, and excellence.

Pragmatist philosopher John Dewey (1859–1952) formulated an axiological naturalism. He distinguished values from value judgments, adding that the skill of correct value assessment must be learned through experience. G. E. Moore (1873–1958) developed and refined various axiological concepts, such as organic unities and the contrast between intrinsic and extrinsic value. He defended non-naturalism about the nature of values and intuitionism about the knowledge of values. W. D. Ross (1877–1971) accepted and further elaborated on Moore&#x27;s intuitionism, using it to formulate an axiological pluralism. R. B. Perry (1876–1957) and D. W. Prall (1886–1940) articulated systematic theories of value based on the idea that values originate in affective states such as interest and liking. Robert S. Hartman (1910–1973) developed formal axiology, saying that values measure the level to which a thing embodies its ideal concept. A. J. Ayer (1910–1989) proposed anti-realism about values, arguing that value statements merely express the speaker&#x27;s approval or disapproval. A different type of anti-realism, formulated by J. L. Mackie (1917–1981), asserts that all value assertions are false since no values exist. G. H. von Wright (1916–2003) provided a conceptual analysis of the term &quot;good&quot; by distinguishing different meanings or varieties of goodness, such as the technical goodness of a good driver and the hedonic goodness of a good meal.

In continental philosophy, Franz Brentano (1838–1917) formulated an early version of the fitting-attitude theory of value, saying that a thing is good if it is fitting to have a positive attitude towards it, such as love. In the 1890s, his students Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) and Christian von Ehrenfels (1859–1932) conceived the idea of a general theory of values. Edmund Husserl (1859–1938), another of Brentano&#x27;s students, developed phenomenology and applied this approach to the study of values. Following Husserl&#x27;s approach, Max Scheler (1874–1928) and Nicolai Hartmann (1882–1950) each proposed a comprehensive system of axiological ethics. Asserting that values have objective reality, they explored how different value types form a value hierarchy and examined the problems of value conflicts and right decisions from this hierarchical perspective. Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) criticized value theory, claiming that it rests on a mistaken metaphysical perspective by understanding values as aspects of things. Existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) said that values do not exist by themselves but are actively created, emphasizing the role of human freedom, responsibility, and authenticity in the process.
