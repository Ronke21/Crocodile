<text>In 3D computer graphics, a wire-frame model (also spelled wireframe model) is a visual representation of a three-dimensional (3D) physical object. It is based on a polygon mesh or a volumetric mesh, created by specifying each edge of the physical object where two mathematically continuous smooth surfaces meet, or by connecting an object&#x27;s constituent vertices using (straight) lines or curves. 

The object is projected into screen space and rendered by drawing lines at the location of each edge. The term &quot;wire frame&quot; comes from designers using metal wire to represent the three-dimensional shape of solid objects. 3D wireframe computer models allow for the construction and manipulation of solids and solid surfaces. 3D solid modeling efficiently draws higher quality representations of solids than conventional line drawing.

Using a wire-frame model allows for the visualization of the underlying design structure of a 3D model. Traditional two-dimensional views and drawings/renderings can be created by the appropriate rotation of the object, and the selection of hidden-line removal via cutting planes.

Since wire-frame renderings are relatively simple and fast to calculate, they are often used in cases where a relatively high screen frame rate is needed (for instance, when working with a particularly complex 3D model, or in real-time systems that model exterior phenomena). 

When greater graphical detail is desired, surface textures can be added automatically after the completion of the initial rendering of the wire frame. This allows a designer to quickly review solids, or rotate objects to different views without the long delays associated with more realistic rendering, or even the processing of faces and simple flat shading.

The wire frame format is also well-suited and widely used in programming tool paths for direct numerical control (DNC) machine tools.

Hand-drawn wire-frame-like illustrations date back as far as the Italian Renaissance. Wire-frame models were also used extensively in video games to represent 3D objects during the 1980s and early 1990s, when &quot;properly&quot; filled 3D objects would have been too complex to calculate and draw with the computers of the time. Wire-frame models are also used as the input for computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).

There are three main types of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models; &quot;wire frame&quot; is the most abstract and least realistic. The other types are &quot;surface&quot; and &quot;solid&quot;. The wire-frame method of modelling consists of only lines and curves that connect the points or vertices and thereby define the edges of an object.

==Simple example of wireframe model==
An object is specified by two tables: (1) Vertex Table, and, (2) Edge Table. 
The vertex table consists of three-dimensional coordinate values for each vertex with reference to the origin. 

Edge table specifies the start and end vertices for each edge.

A naive interpretation could create a wire-frame representation by simply drawing straight lines between the screen coordinates of the appropriate vertices using the edge list.

Unlike representations designed for more detailed rendering, face information is not specified (it must be calculated if required for solid rendering). 

Appropriate calculations have to be performed to transform the 3D coordinates of the vertices into 2D screen coordinates.

<doc id="33293" wikidata="Q741547" url="?curid=33293" title="WIPO Copyright Treaty">
<text>The World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty (WIPO Copyright Treaty or WCT) is an international treaty on copyright law adopted by the member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996. It provides additional protections for copyright to respond to advances in information technology since the formation of previous copyright treaties before it. As of August 2023, the treaty has 115 contracting parties. The WCT and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, are together termed WIPO &quot;internet treaties&quot;.

== History ==
During the earlier stages of negotiations, the WCT was seen as a protocol to the Berne Convention, constituting an update of that agreement since the 1971 Stockholm Conference. However, as any amendment to the Berne Convention required unanimous consent of all parties, the WCT was conceptualized as an additional treaty which supplemented the Berne Convention. The collapse of negotiations around the extension of the Berne Convention during the 1980s saw the shifting of the forum to the GATT, resulting in the TRIPS Agreement. Thus, the nature of any copyright treaty by the World Intellectual Property Organization became considerably narrower, being limited to addressing the challenges posed by digital technologies.

== Protection granted by the Treaty ==
The WCT emphasizes the incentive nature of copyright protection, claiming its importance to creative endeavours. It ensures that computer programs are protected as literary works (Article 4), and that the arrangement and selection of material in databases is protected (Article 5). It provides authors of works with control over their rental and distribution in Articles 6 to 8, which they may not have under the Berne Convention alone. It also prohibits circumvention of technological measures for the protection of works (Article 11) and unauthorized modification of rights management information contained in works (Article 12).

The treaty has been criticised for being too broad (for example in its prohibition of circumvention of technical protection measures, even where such circumvention is used in the pursuit of legal and fair use rights) and for applying a &quot;one size fits all&quot; standard to all signatory countries, despite their widely differing stages of economic development and knowledge industry.

==Implementation==
The WIPO Copyright Treaty is implemented in United States law by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). By Decision 2000/278/EC of 16 March 2000, the Council of the European Union approved the treaty on behalf of the European Community. European Union Directives which largely cover the subject matter of the treaty are: Directive 91/250/EC, creating copyright protection for software; Directive 96/9/EC on copyright protection for databases; and Directive 2001/29/EC, prohibiting devices for circumventing &quot;technical protection measures&quot;, such as digital rights management (also known as DRM).

<text>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO; (OMPI)) is one of the 15 specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN). Pursuant to the 1967 Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO was created to promote and protect intellectual property (IP) across the world by cooperating with countries as well as international organizations. It began operations on 26 April 1970 when the convention entered into force. The current Director General is Singaporean Daren Tang, former head of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, who began his term on 1 October 2020.

WIPO&#x27;s activities include: hosting forums to discuss and shape international IP rules and policies, providing global services that register and protect IP in different countries, resolving transboundary IP disputes, helping connect IP systems through uniform standards and infrastructure, and serving as a general reference database on all IP matters; this includes providing reports and statistics on the state of IP protection or innovation both globally and in specific countries. WIPO also works with governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals to utilize IP for socioeconomic development.

WIPO administers 26 international treaties that concern a wide variety of intellectual property issues, ranging from the protection of audiovisual works to establishing international patent classification. It is governed by the General Assembly and the Coordination Committee, which together set policy and serve as the main decision making bodies. The General Assembly also elects WIPO&#x27;s chief administrator, the Director General, currently Daren Tang of Singapore, who took office on 1 October 2020. WIPO is administered by a Secretariat that helps carry out its day-to-day activities.

Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, WIPO has &quot;external offices&quot; around the world, including in Algiers (Algeria); Rio de Janeiro (Brazil); Beijing (China), Tokyo (Japan); Abuja (Nigeria); Moscow (Russia); and Singapore (Singapore). Unlike most UN organizations, WIPO does not rely heavily on assessed or voluntary contributions from member states; 95 percent of its budget comes from fees related to its global services.

WIPO currently has 193 member states, including 190 UN member states and the Cook Islands, Holy See and Niue; Palestine has permanent observer status. The only non-members, among the countries recognized by the UN are the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and South Sudan.

== History ==
=== Pre BIRPI ===
==== 1883 – Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property ====

The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property was adopted in 1883 and was one of the first intellectual property treaties. It established a Union for the protection of industrial property. Additionally, it applies to a wide range of industrial property including patents, trademarks, utility models, industrial designs, trade names, service marks, geographical indications as well as the &quot;repression of unfair competition&quot;. The Paris Convention was the first international agreement to protect the works of creators in other countries.

Moving on, the Convention was adopted in diplomatic conferences held in Paris in 1880 and 1883, it was then signed on 20 March 1883, on behalf of Brazil, France, Guatemala, Netherlands, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland, Belgium, Italy and El Salvador. It consisted of the Convention proper, which contains 19 articles, and the &quot;Protocole de clôture&quot; (Final Protocol), which is almost the same length as the Convention proper.

The &quot;International Bureau&quot; established by the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property later became part of BIRPI and later WIPO.

==== 1886 – Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works ====

The Berne Convention was adopted in 1886, it deals with copyright, the protection of works and rights of authors and rights holders. It provides creators including writers, poets, painters, musicians with ways to control how and by who their works are used and the terms of use. It also contains provisions on minimum protections and special provisions for developing countries. The Convention follows three basic principles; that works originating in one of the Contracting States must be given the same protection in each of the other Contracting States (principle of &quot;national treatment&quot;), that there is automatic protection and no formal process is required and that protection under the convention is independent of protection in the country of origin of the work (principle of &quot;independence&quot; of protection). The &quot;International Bureau&quot; was created to oversee the Berne Convention and later became part of BIRPI and later WIPO.

==== 1891 – Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks ====

In 1891 nine of the 14 States to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property created the first &quot;special arrangements for the protection of industrial property&quot;. Along with the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement (1989) it created the Madrid System, the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world.

=== BIRPI ===

The Bureaus created to administer the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property were under &quot;the high supervision&quot; (&quot;haute surveillance&quot;) of the Government of the Swiss Confederation. In 1893 the Swiss government combined them with the same director and same staff as United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property, &quot;Bureaux internationaux réunis pour la protection de la propriété intellectuelle&quot; (BIRPI). BIRPI was the predecessor of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) which superseded it 87 years later, in 1970.

=== Formation of WIPO ===
WIPO was formally created by the Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization, which entered into force on 26 April 1970. WIPO allowed members who were part of the Berne Convention, Paris Convention or a member of the United Nations system including the United Nations, any of its specialized agencies, the International Atomic Energy Agency or the International Court of Justice.

That date is commemorated annually as World Intellectual Property Day, which raises awareness of the importance of IP. Under Article 3 of this convention, WIPO seeks to &quot;promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world&quot;. WIPO became a specialized agency of the UN in 1974. The Agreement between the United Nations and the World Intellectual Property Organization notes in Article 1 that WIPO is responsible:
The Agreement marked a transition for WIPO from the mandate it inherited in 1967 from BIRPI, to promote the protection of intellectual property, to one that involved the more complex task of promoting technology transfer and economic development.

=== WIPO joining the United Nations ===

In 1974 WIPO became a specialized agency of the United Nations through a bilateral agreement between WIPO and the UN approved by the General Assembly of WIPO on 27 September 1974, and by the UN General Assembly on 17 December 1974. A protocol was signed by then Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim and then Director General of WIPO Árpád Bogsch on 21 January 1975. The Agreement became effective on 17 December 1974.

The relative importance of WIPO in global IP governance decreased after the United States incorporated intellectual property matters into the Uruguay Round of the GATT Negotiations in the 1980s.

=== WIPO Development agenda ===
In October 2004, WIPO agreed to adopt a proposal offered by Argentina and Brazil, the &quot;Proposal for the Establishment of a Development Agenda for WIPO&quot;—from the Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization. This proposal was well supported by developing countries. The agreed &quot;WIPO Development Agenda&quot; (composed of over 45 recommendations) was the culmination of a long process of transformation for the organization from one that had historically been primarily aimed at protecting the interests of rightholders, to one that has increasingly incorporated the interests of other stakeholders in the international intellectual property system as well as integrating into the broader corpus of international law on human rights, environment and economic cooperation.

A number of civil society bodies have been working on a draft Access to Knowledge (A2K) treaty which they would like to see introduced.

In 2009, WIPO started drafting future treaties on intellectual property and genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore in relation with indigenous peoples and local communities.

In December 2011, WIPO published its first World Intellectual Property Report on the Changing Face of Innovation, the first such report of the new Office of the Chief Economist. WIPO is also a co-publisher of the Global Innovation Index.

=== Recent events ===
In 2016, WIPO initiated the High-Level Conference on Intellectual Property for BRI Countries. WIPO Director General Francis Gurry encouraged countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative to use WIPO tools like its global IP services and databases and to join WIPO-administered IP treaties.

In September 2020 China blocked the Wikimedia Foundation from observer status at WIPO citing the existence of a Wikimedia affiliate in Taiwan. According to the Chinese statement &quot;there is reason to believe that this foundation has been carrying out political activities through its member organizations which could undermine the state&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.&quot; China again rejected Wikimedia&#x27;s bid, for the same reason, in 2021, 2023, and 2024.

WIPO, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the WTO launched on 11 April 2022 their new Trilateral COVID-19 Technical Assistance Platform. This new tool aims to help members and WTO accession candidates address their capacity building needs to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Platform provides members and accession candidates with a single contact form which they can use to reach out to the trilateral organizations.

== Global services ==

=== Patent Cooperation Treaty ===
The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) (1970) established a service which assists individuals, companies, and institutions in seeking patent protection internationally for their inventions. It also helps patent offices with their patent granting decisions and facilitates public access to technical information relating to those inventions. 153 countries are currently party to the PCT.

Under the PCT, an applicant can file one PCT application in one language, at one patent office, within 12 months from the date of the earliest patent application which has been filed for the same invention (the &quot;priority date&quot;). This one PCT application has the same legal effect as filing separate regional or national patent applications in all PCT member countries.

PCT applications are processed in a standardized manner as provided in the Treaty and Regulations, including an international search for documents relevant to the potential patentability of the invention and international publication. Granting patents remains under the control of the regional or national patent Offices in the &quot;national phase&quot;.

Using the PCT, patent applicants can postpone paying national and regional patent-related fees while they learn about the likelihood of obtaining a patent, benefitting from the additional time and information to help them decide whether, and in which countries, to pursue patents.

=== Madrid System ===

The Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks serves as a means to seek protection for trademarks worldwide, in over 120 countries. Created in 1891, the Madrid System is now governed by the Madrid Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (1989). In order to become a member of the Madrid System, a state or intergovernmental organization must already be a party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883).

The Madrid System is a centralized trademark registration system: through a single application, in one language and with one set of fees (in one currency, the Swiss franc), protection can be obtained in member states and intergovernmental organizations. International registrations can then be modified, renewed or expanded, centrally through WIPO (rather than through each separate IP Office).

The Madrid System can only be used by a natural person or a legal entity, which is a national, is domiciled or has a company in the territory of a member of the Madrid System.

=== Lisbon System ===

The Lisbon System for the International Registration of Appellations of Origin and Geographical indications provides a means of obtaining international protection for a geographical indication or an appellation of origin. Geographical indications and appellations of origin are intellectual property rights which identify a product that originates from a specific geographical area and that has characteristics that are attributable to its geographical origin. Comté cheese (France), Chulucanas pottery (Peru), Tequila (Mexico), Porto (Portugal), Herend porcelain (Hungary), and Kampot pepper (Cambodia) are examples of appellations of origin and geographical indications registered under the Lisbon System. Through a single registration and one set of fees, protection can be obtained in the other countries (and intergovernmental organizations, such as the European Union) covered by the Lisbon System.

The Lisbon System includes the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration of 1958 (&#x27;the Lisbon Agreement&#x27;) and, its latest revision, the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications of 2015 (&#x27;the Geneva Act&#x27;) form the Lisbon System. Registrations under the Lisbon System are published in the official bulletin and can be searched through the Lisbon Express Database.

=== WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center ===
The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center was established in 1994 as an international resource for alternatives to court litigation of intellectual property and technology disputes. It offers alternative dispute resolution (ADR) options including mediation, arbitration, and expert determination to resolve international commercial disputes between private parties. It is an administrator of cases and a provider of legal and policy expertise. The Center also provides domain name dispute resolution services under the WIPO-designed UDRP. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland and since 2010 the Center has had an office at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore.

=== Hague System ===
The WIPO Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs provides an international mechanism for securing protection of up to 100 designs in multiple countries or regions, through a single international application, filed in one language and using one currency (Swiss francs).

International design applications are filed directly through WIPO, according to the requirements and procedures established by the Hague Agreement. The domestic legal framework of each designated contracting party governs the design protection provided by the resulting international registrations.

According to the rules laid out by the Hague Agreement, anyone who is a national of, or who has a domicile, habitual residence or real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in any Hague System contracting party – including any country of the European Union or the African Intellectual Property Organization – can use the Hague System. The Hague System does not require the applicant to file a national or regional design application.

On 5 February 2020, China officially deposited its accession documents for entering the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs and the Marrakesh Treaty (which increases the accessibility of publications to people with visual impairment), before the commencement of the Beijing Olympic Winter Games. The accession will take effect on 5 May 2022.

China became the 68th contracting party to the Geneva Act (1999) of the Hague Agreement and, therefore, the 77th member of the Hague System.

== Funding ==
WIPO, unlike other UN agencies, derives most of its income from fees for the Global IP services it provides as opposed to Member States contributions. In 2020, WIPO&#x27;s revenue amounted to CHF 468.3 million. In 2020 WIPO generated over 94.3% of its revenue from fees that are paid by users of its intellectual property services for patents, trademarks and industrial designs due to international demand for intellectual property titles. These services are provided through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) (providing 76.6% of revenue), Madrid System (providing 16.3% of revenue) and Hague System (providing 1.4% of revenue).

== Governance and normative work ==

=== WIPO Assemblies ===
WIPO Assemblies develop global intellectual property agreements through bringing stakeholders together. The main policy and decision making bodies of WIPO are the Coordination Committee and the General Assembly. Twenty-two Assemblies, the Unions administered by WIPO, and other bodies of the Member States of WIPO meet in ordinary or extraordinary sessions in autumn. The General Assembly appoints the Director General through nomination by the Coordination Committee. Any of the policy and decision making bodies can constitute Permanent Committees or Standing Committees.

=== Standing Committees ===
Standing committees are ad hoc groups of experts established for a given purpose and acting as a place for policy discussions and negotiations on the future development of intellectual property. Any WIPO Standing Committee or other bodies also decide to establish a working group to examine a question in more detail, make suggestions or give advice on any subject within the competence of the Organization.

=== WIPO administered treaties ===
WIPO administers 26 treaties, including the WIPO Convention.

==== Intellectual property protection treaties ====
Intellectual property protection treaties define internationally agreed basic standards of intellectual property (IP) protection in each country.
==== Global protection system treaties ====

Global protection system treaties govern WIPO&#x27;s services, ensuring that one international registration or filing will have effect in any of the relevant signatory States.
==== Classification treaties ====
Classification treaties that create classification systems that organize information concerning inventions, trademarks and industrial designs.
== Policy work ==

=== Genetic resources, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions ===
For years, many local communities, Indigenous peoples and governments have sought effective intellectual property (IP) protection for traditional cultural expressions (folklore) and traditional knowledge as tradition-based forms of ingenuity and creativity. As a living body of knowledge developed, sustained and passed on from generation to generation within a community, it is not easily protected under the current IP system, which typically grants protection for a limited period to new inventions and original works as private rights. Some genetic resources, too, are linked to traditional knowledge and related practices through their use and conservation by Indigenous peoples and local communities. Although genetic resources, as encountered in nature, are not eligible for IP protection, inventions based on or developed with the use of genetic resources may be patentable. Since 2010, the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC) has been negotiating the text of one or several legal instruments on the matter.

=== Global health ===
WIPO Re:Search is a public-private partnership between WIPO and the non-profit BIO Ventures for Global Health focused on early-stage medical research and development against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), malaria and tuberculosis. It has 150 members, including eight of the world&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical companies. WIPO Re:Search supports collaborations between scientific institutions and pharmaceutical companies all over the world with the goal to advance research for medicines, treatment methods and diagnostic techniques against the neglected tropical diseases that affect over 1 billion people worldwide.

<text>Wicca (), also known as &quot;The Craft&quot;, is a modern pagan, syncretic, earth-centered religion. Considered a new religious movement by scholars of religion, the path evolved from Western esotericism, developed in England during the first half of the 20th century, and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant. Wicca draws upon ancient pagan and 20th-century Hermetic motifs for theological and ritual purposes. Doreen Valiente joined Gardner in the 1950s, further building Wicca&#x27;s liturgical tradition of beliefs, principles, and practices, disseminated through published books as well as secret written and oral teachings passed along to initiates.

Many variations of the religion have grown and evolved over time, associated with a number of diverse lineages, sects, and denominations, referred to as &quot;traditions&quot;, each with its own organisational structure and level of centralisation. Given its broadly decentralised nature, disagreements arise over the boundaries that define Wicca. Some traditions, collectively referred to as British Traditional Wicca (BTW), strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider &quot;Wicca&quot; specific to similar traditions, excluding newer, eclectic traditions. Other traditions, as well as scholars of religion, apply &quot;Wicca&quot; as a broad term for a religion with denominations that differ on some key points but share core beliefs and practices.

Wicca is typically duotheistic, venerating both a Goddess and a God, traditionally conceived as the Triple Goddess and the Horned God, respectively. These deities may be regarded in a henotheistic way, as having many different divine aspects which can be identified with various pagan deities from different historical pantheons. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Great Goddess&quot; and the &quot;Great Horned God&quot;, with the honorific &quot;great&quot; connoting a personification containing many other deities within their own nature. Some Wiccans refer to the goddess as &quot;Lady&quot; and the god as &quot;Lord&quot; to invoke their divinity. These two deities are sometimes viewed as facets of a universal pantheistic divinity, regarded as an impersonal force rather than a personal deity. Other traditions of Wicca embrace polytheism, pantheism, monism, and Goddess monotheism.

Wiccan celebrations encompass both the cycles of the Moon, known as Esbats and commonly associated with the Triple Goddess, alongside the cycles of the Sun, seasonally based festivals known as Sabbats and commonly associated with the Horned God. The Wiccan Rede is a popular expression of Wiccan morality, often with respect to the ritual practice of magic.

==Definition and terminology==

Scholars of religious studies classify Wicca as a new religious movement, and more specifically as a form of modern paganism. Wicca has been cited as the largest, best known, most influential, and most academically studied form of modern paganism. Within the movement, it has been identified as sitting on the eclectic end of the eclectic to reconstructionist spectrum.

Several academics have also categorised Wicca as a form of nature religion, a term that is also embraced by many of its practitioners, and as a mystery religion. However, given that Wicca also incorporates the practice of magic, several scholars have referred to it as a &quot;magico-religion&quot;. Wicca is also a form of Western esotericism, and more specifically a part of the esoteric current known as occultism. Academics like Wouter Hanegraaff and Tanya Luhrmann have categorised Wicca as part of the New Age, although other academics, and many Wiccans themselves, dispute this categorisation.

Although recognised as a religion by academics, some evangelical Christians have attempted to deny it legal recognition as such, while some Wiccan practitioners themselves eschew the term &quot;religion&quot; – associating the latter purely with organised religion – instead favouring &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;way of life&quot;. Although Wicca as a religion is distinct from other forms of contemporary paganism, there has been much &quot;cross-fertilization&quot; between these different pagan faiths; accordingly, Wicca has both influenced and been influenced by other pagan religions, thus making clear-cut distinctions between them more difficult for religious studies scholars to make.
The terms &quot;wizard&quot; and &quot;warlock&quot; are sometimes discouraged altogether. &quot;Wizard&quot; can represent an emphasis on wisdom and insight-based practices, and it is used by some interchangeably with the term &quot;witch&quot; for their common roots in the meaning of gaining &quot;wisdom&quot; and being &quot;wise&quot;. In Wicca, denominations are referred to as &quot;traditions&quot;, while non-Wiccans are often termed &quot;cowans&quot;.

===Wiccan definition of &quot;Witchcraft&quot;===
When the religion first came to public attention, its followers commonly called it &quot;Witchcraft&quot;. Gerald Gardner—the man regarded as the &quot;Father of Wicca&quot;—referred to it as the &quot;Craft of the Wise&quot;, &quot;Witchcraft&quot;, and &quot;the Witch-cult&quot; during the 1950s. Gardner believed in the theory that persecuted witches had actually been followers of a surviving pagan religion, but this theory has now been proven wrong. There is no evidence that he ever called it &quot;Wicca&quot;, although he did refer to its community of followers as &quot;the Wica&quot; (with one &quot;c&quot;). As a name for the religion, &quot;Wicca&quot; developed in Britain during the 1960s. It is not known who first used this name for the religion, although one possibility is that it might have been Gardner&#x27;s rival Charles Cardell, who was calling it the &quot;Craft of the Wiccens&quot; by 1958. The first recorded use of the name &quot;Wicca&quot; was in 1962, and it had been popularised to the extent that several British practitioners founded a newsletter called &quot;The Wiccan&quot; in 1968.

Although pronounced differently, the Modern English term &quot;Wicca&quot; is borrowed from the Old English &quot;wicca&quot; and &quot;wicce&quot; , the masculine and feminine term for witch, respectively, that was used in Anglo-Saxon England. By adopting it for modern usage, Wiccans were both symbolically linking themselves to the ancient, pre-Christian past, and adopting a self-designation that would be less controversial than &quot;Witchcraft&quot;. The scholar of religion and Wiccan priestess Joanne Pearson noted that while &quot;the words &#x27;witch&#x27; and &#x27;wicca&#x27; are therefore linked etymologically, […] they are used to emphasize different things today&quot;.

In early sources, &quot;Wicca&quot; referred to the whole of the religion rather than to a specific tradition. In following decades, members of certain traditions – those known as British Traditional Wicca – began claiming that only they should be called &quot;Wiccan&quot;, and that other traditions must not use it. From the late 1980s onwards, various books propagating Wicca were published that again used the former, broader definition of the word. Thus, by the 1980s, there were two competing definitions of the word &quot;Wicca&quot; in use among the pagan and esoteric communities, one broad and inclusive, the other narrow and exclusionary. Among scholars of pagan studies, it is the older, broader, inclusive meaning which is preferred.

Alongside &quot;Wicca&quot;, some practitioners still call the religion &quot;Witchcraft&quot; or &quot;the Craft&quot;. Using the word &quot;Witchcraft&quot; in this context can result in confusion with other, non-religious meanings of &quot;witchcraft&quot; as well as other religions—such as Satanism and Luciferianism—whose practitioners also sometimes describe themselves as &quot;Witches&quot;. Another term sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;Wicca&quot; is &quot;Pagan witchcraft&quot;, although there are also other forms of modern paganism—such as types of Heathenry—which also use the term &quot;Pagan witchcraft&quot;. From the 1990s onward, various Wiccans began describing themselves as &quot;Traditional Witches&quot;, although this term was also employed by practitioners of other magico-religious traditions like Luciferianism. In some popular culture, such as television programs &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Charmed&quot;, the word &quot;Wicca&quot; has been used as a synonym for witchcraft more generally, including in non-religious and non-pagan forms.

==Beliefs==

===Theology===
Theological views within Wicca are diverse. The religion encompasses theists, atheists, and agnostics, with some viewing the religion&#x27;s deities as entities with a literal existence and others viewing them as Jungian archetypes or symbols. Even among theistic Wiccans, there are divergent beliefs, and Wicca includes pantheists, monotheists, duotheists, and polytheists. Common to these divergent perspectives, however, is that Wicca&#x27;s deities are viewed as forms of ancient, pre-Christian divinities by its practitioners.

====Duotheism====

Most early Wiccan groups adhered to the duotheistic worship of a Horned God and a Mother Goddess, with practitioners typically believing that these had been the ancient deities worshipped by the hunter-gatherers of the Old Stone Age, whose veneration had been passed down in secret right to the present. This theology derived from Egyptologist Margaret Murray&#x27;s claims about the witch-cult in her book &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot; published by Oxford University Press in 1921; she claimed that this cult had venerated a Horned God at the time of the Early Modern witch trials, but centuries before it had also worshipped a Mother Goddess. This duotheistic Horned God/Mother Goddess structure was embraced by Gardner – who claimed that it had Stone Age roots – and remains the underlying theological basis to his Gardnerian tradition. Gardner claimed that the names of these deities were to be kept secret within the tradition, although in 1964 they were publicly revealed to be Cernunnos and Aradia; the secret Gardnerian deity names were subsequently changed.

Although different Wiccans attribute different traits to the Horned God, he is most often associated with animals and the natural world, but also with the afterlife, and he is furthermore often viewed as an ideal role model for men. The Mother Goddess has been associated with life, fertility, and the springtime, and has been described as an ideal role model for women. Wicca&#x27;s duotheism has been compared to the Taoist system of yin and yang.

Other Wiccans have adopted the original Gardnerian God/Goddess duotheistic structure but have adopted deity forms other than that of the Horned God and Mother Goddess. For instance, the God has been interpreted as the Oak King and the Holly King, as well as the Sun God, Son/Lover God, and Vegetation God. He has also been seen in the roles of the Leader of the Wild Hunt and the Lord of Death. The Goddess is often portrayed as a Triple Goddess, thereby being a triadic deity comprising a Maiden goddess, a Mother goddess, and a Crone goddess, each of whom has different associations, namely virginity, fertility, and wisdom. Other Wiccan conceptualisations have portrayed her as a Moon Goddess and as a Menstruating Goddess. According to the anthropologist Susan Greenwood, in Wicca the Goddess is &quot;a symbol of self-transformation - she is seen to be constantly changing and a force for change for those who open themselves up to her&quot;.

====Monotheism and polytheism====

Gardner stated that beyond Wicca&#x27;s two deities was the &quot;Supreme Deity&quot; or &quot;Prime Mover&quot;, an entity that was too complex for humans to understand. This belief has been endorsed by other practitioners, who have referred to it as &quot;the Cosmic Logos&quot;, &quot;Supreme Cosmic Power&quot;, or &quot;Godhead&quot;. Gardner envisioned this Supreme Deity as a deist entity who had created the &quot;Under-Gods&quot;, among them the God and Goddess, but who was not otherwise involved in the world; alternately, other Wiccans have interpreted such an entity as a pantheistic being, of whom the God and Goddess are facets.

Although Gardner criticised monotheism, citing the Problem of Evil, explicitly monotheistic forms of Wicca developed in the 1960s, when the U.S.-based Church of Wicca developed a theology rooted in the worship of what they described as &quot;one deity, without gender&quot;. In the 1970s, Dianic Wiccan groups developed which were devoted to a singular, monotheistic Goddess; this approach was often criticised by members of British Traditional Wiccan groups, who lambasted such Goddess monotheism as an inverted imitation of Christian theology. As in other forms of Wicca, some Goddess monotheists have expressed the view that the Goddess is not an entity with a literal existence, but rather a Jungian archetype.

As well as pantheism and duotheism, many Wiccans accept the concept of polytheism, thereby believing that there are many different deities. Some accept the view espoused by the occultist Dion Fortune that &quot;all gods are one god, and all goddesses are one goddess&quot; – that is that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are, respectively, aspects of one supernal God and Goddess. With this mindset, a Wiccan may regard the Germanic Ēostre, Hindu Kali, and Catholic Virgin Mary each as manifestations of one supreme Goddess and likewise, the Celtic Cernunnos, the ancient Greek Dionysus and the Judeo-Christian Yahweh as aspects of a single, archetypal god. A more strictly polytheistic approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right. The Wiccan writers Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone have postulated that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, tending to embrace a more traditionally pagan worldview. Some Wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical archetypes or thoughtforms, thereby technically allowing them to be atheists. Such a view is held by the High Priestess Vivianne Crowley, herself a psychologist, who considered the Wiccan deities to be Jungian archetypes that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual. It was for this reason, she said &quot;The Goddess and God manifest to us in dream and vision&quot;.
Wiccans often believe that the gods are not perfect and can be argued with.

Many Wiccans also adopt a more explicitly polytheistic or animistic world-view of the universe as being replete with spirit-beings. In many cases these spirits are associated with the natural world, for instance as &quot;genius loci&quot;, fairies, and elementals. In other cases, such beliefs are more idiosyncratic and atypical; Wiccan Sybil Leek for instance endorsed a belief in angels.

===Afterlife===

Belief in the afterlife varies among Wiccans and does not occupy a central place within the religion. As the historian Ronald Hutton remarked, &quot;the instinctual position of most [Wiccans] ... seems to be that if one makes the most of the present life, in all respects, then the next life is more or less certainly going to benefit from the process, and so one may as well concentrate on the present&quot;. It is nevertheless a common belief among Wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death. Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with the Feri tradition of witchcraft, for instance, having adopted a belief from the Theosophy-inspired Huna movement, Kabbalah, and other sources, that the human being has three souls.

Although not accepted by all Wiccans, a belief in reincarnation is the dominant afterlife belief within Wicca, having been originally espoused by Gardner. Understandings of how the cycle of reincarnation operates differ among practitioners; Wiccan Raymond Buckland for instance insisted that human souls would only incarnate into human bodies, whereas other Wiccans believe that a human soul can incarnate into any life form. There is also a common Wiccan belief that any Wiccans will come to be reincarnated as future Wiccans, an idea originally expressed by Gardner. Gardner also articulated the view that the human soul rested for a period between bodily death and its incarnation, with this resting place commonly being referred to as &quot;The Summerland&quot; among the Wiccan community. This allows many Wiccans to believe that mediums can contact the spirits of the deceased, a belief adopted from Spiritualism.

===Magic and spellcraft===
Many Wiccans believe in magic, a manipulative force exercised through the practice of &quot;spellcraft&quot;. Many Wiccans agree with the definition of magic offered by ceremonial magicians, such as Aleister Crowley, who declared that magic was &quot;the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will&quot;, while another ceremonial magician, MacGregor Mathers stated that it was &quot;the science of the control of the secret forces of nature&quot;. Many Wiccans believe magic to be a law of nature, as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science, and as such they do not view it as being supernatural, but a part of what Leo Martello calls the &quot;super powers that reside in the natural&quot;. Some Wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses to achieve surprising results, whilst other Wiccans do not claim to know how magic works, merely believing that it does because they believe they have observed it to be so.

During ritual practices, which are often staged in a sacred circle, Wiccans cast spells or &quot;workings&quot; intended to bring about real changes in the physical world. Common Wiccan spells include those used for healing, for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences. Many early Wiccans, such as Alex Sanders, Sybil Leek and Alex Winfield, referred to their own magic as &quot;white magic&quot;, which contrasted with &quot;black magic&quot;, which they associated with evil and Satanism. Sanders also used the similar terminology of &quot;left-hand path&quot; to describe malevolent magic, and &quot;right-hand path&quot; to describe magic performed with good intentions; terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans, however, have stopped using the white/black magic and left/right-hand-path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil.

Scholars of religion Rodney Stark and William Bainbridge claimed in 1985 that Wicca had &quot;reacted to secularisation by a headlong plunge back into magic&quot; and that it was a reactionary religion which would soon die out. This view was heavily criticised in 1999 by the historian Ronald Hutton who claimed that the evidence displayed the very opposite: that &quot;a large number [of Wiccans] were in jobs at the cutting edge [of scientific culture], such as computer technology&quot;.

===Witchcraft===

Historian Wouter Hanegraaff noted that the Wiccan view of witchcraft was &quot;an outgrowth of Romantic (semi)scholarship&quot;, especially the &#x27;witch cult&#x27; theory. It proposed that historical alleged witches were actually followers of a surviving pagan religion, and that accusations of infanticide, cannibalism, Satanism, etc., were either made up by the Inquisition or were misunderstandings of pagan rites. This theory that accused witches were actually pagans has now been disproven using archive records of witch trials. Nevertheless, Gardner and other founders of Wicca believed the theory was true, and saw the witch as a &quot;&quot;positive antitype&quot; which derives much of its symbolic force from its implicit criticism of dominant Judaeo-Christian and Enlightenment values&quot;.

Pearson suggested that Wiccans &quot;identify with the witch because she is imagined as powerful - she can make people sleep for one hundred years, she can see the future, she can curse and kill as well as heal... and of course, she can turn people into frogs!&quot; Pearson says that Wicca &quot;provides a framework in which the image of oneself as a witch can be explored and brought into a modern context&quot;.
Identifying as a witch also enables Wiccans to link themselves with those persecuted in the witch trials of the Early Modern period, often referred to by Wiccans as &quot;the Burning Times&quot;. Various practitioners have claimed that as many as nine million people were executed as witches in the Early Modern period, thus drawing comparisons with the killing of six million Jews in the Holocaust and presenting themselves, as modern witches, as &quot;persecuted minorities&quot;.

===Morality===

Wicca has been characterised as a life-affirming religion. Practitioners typically present themselves as &quot;a positive force against the powers of destruction which threaten the world&quot;.
There exists no dogmatic moral or ethical code followed universally by Wiccans of all traditions. However, a majority follow a code known as the Wiccan Rede, which states, &quot;an it harm none, do what ye will&quot;. This is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of taking responsibility for what follows from one&#x27;s actions and minimising harm to oneself and others.

Another common element of Wiccan morality is the Law of Threefold Return which holds that whatever benevolent or malevolent actions a person performs will return to that person with triple force, or with equal force on each of the three levels of body, mind, and spirit, similar to the eastern idea of karma. The Wiccan Rede was most likely introduced into Wicca by Gerald Gardner and formalised publicly by Doreen Valiente, one of his High Priestesses. The Threefold Law was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by Monique Wilson and further popularized by Raymond Buckland, in his books on Wicca.

Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in Doreen Valiente&#x27;s &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot;, these being mirth, reverence, honour, humility, strength, beauty, power, and compassion. In Valiente&#x27;s poem, they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a dualism that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy. Some lineaged Wiccans also observe a set of Wiccan Laws, commonly called the &quot;Craft Laws&quot; or &quot;Ardanes&quot;, 30 of which exist in the Gardnerian tradition and 161 of which are in the Alexandrian tradition. Valiente, one of Gardner&#x27;s original High Priestesses, argued that the first thirty of these rules were most likely invented by Gerald Gardner himself in mock-archaic language as the by-product of inner conflict within his Bricket Wood coven.

In British Traditional Wicca, &quot;sex complementarity is a basic and fundamental working principle&quot;, with men and women being seen as a necessary presence to balance each other out. This may have derived from Gardner&#x27;s interpretation of Murray&#x27;s claim that the ancient witch-cult was a fertility religion. Thus, many practitioners of British Traditional Wicca have argued that gay men and women are not capable of correctly working magic without mixed-sex pairings.

Although Gerald Gardner initially demonstrated an aversion to homosexuality, claiming that it brought down &quot;the curse of the goddess&quot;, it is now generally accepted in all traditions of Wicca, with groups such as the Minoan Brotherhood openly basing their philosophy upon it. Nonetheless, a variety of viewpoints exist in Wicca around this point, with some covens adhering to a hetero-normative viewpoint. Carly B. Floyd of Illinois Wesleyan University has published an informative white paper on this subject: &quot;Mother Goddesses and Subversive Witches: Competing Narratives of Gender Essentialism, Heteronormativity, Feminism, and Queerness in Wiccan Theology and Ritual.&quot;

The scholar of religion Joanne Pearson noted that in her experience, most Wiccans take a &quot;realistic view of living in the real world&quot; replete with its many problems and do not claim that the gods &quot;have all the answers&quot; to these. She suggested that Wiccans do not claim to seek perfection but instead &quot;wholeness&quot; or &quot;completeness&quot;, which includes an acceptance of traits like anger, weakness, and pain. She contrasted the Wiccan acceptance of an &quot;interplay between light and dark&quot; against the New Age focus on &quot;white light&quot;. Similarly, the scholar of religion Geoffrey Samuel noted that Wiccans devote &quot;a perhaps surprising amount of attention to darkness and death&quot;.

Many Wiccans are involved in environmentalist campaigns.

===Five elements===

Many traditions hold a belief in the five classical elements, although they are seen as symbolic representations of the phases of matter. These five elements are invoked during many magical rituals, notably when consecrating a magic circle. The five elements are air, fire, water, earth, and aether (or spirit), where aether unites the other four elements. Various analogies have been devised to explain the concept of the five elements; for instance, the Wiccan Ann-Marie Gallagher used that of a tree, which is composed of earth (with the soil and plant matter), water (sap and moisture), fire (through photosynthesis) and air (the formation of oxygen from carbon dioxide), all of which are believed to be united through spirit.

Traditionally in the Gardnerian Craft, each element has been associated with a cardinal point of the compass; air with east, fire with south, water with west, earth with north, and the spirit with centre. However, some Wiccans, such as Frederic Lamond, have claimed that the set cardinal points are only those applicable to the geography of southern England, where Wicca evolved, and that Wiccans should determine which directions best suit each element in their region. For instance, those living on the east coast of North America should invoke water in the east and not the west because the colossal body of water, the Atlantic Ocean, is to their east. Other Craft groups have associated the elements with different cardinal points, for instance Robert Cochrane&#x27;s Clan of Tubal Cain associated earth with south, fire with east, water with west and air with north, and each of which were controlled over by a different deity who were seen as children of the primary Horned God and Goddess. The five elements are symbolised by the five points of the pentagram, the most-used symbol of Wicca.

==Practices==
The Wiccan high priestess and journalist Margot Adler stated that Wiccan rituals were not &quot;dry, formalised, repetitive experiences&quot;, but performed with the intent of inducing a religious experience in the participants, thereby altering their consciousness. She noted that many Wiccans remain skeptical about the existence of the supernatural but remain involved in Wicca because of its ritual experiences: she quoted one as saying that &quot;I love myth, dream, visionary art. The Craft is a place where all of these things fit together – beauty, pageantry, music, dance, song, dream&quot;. The Wiccan practitioner and historian Aidan Kelly wrote that the practices and experiences within Wicca were more important than the beliefs, stating: &quot;it&#x27;s a religion of ritual rather than theology. The ritual is first; the myth is second&quot;. Similarly, Adler stated that Wicca permits &quot;total skepticism about even its own methods, myths and rituals&quot;.

The anthropologist Susan Greenwood characterised Wiccan rituals as &quot;a form of resistance to mainstream culture&quot;. She saw these rituals as &quot;a healing space away from the ills of the wider culture&quot;, one in which female practitioners can &quot;redefine and empower themselves&quot;.

Wiccan rituals usually take place in private. The Reclaiming tradition has utilised its rituals for political purposes.

Practice in Wicca (including, as an example, matters such as the varying attributions of the elements to different directions discussed in the preceding section) varies widely due to the Craft&#x27;s emphasis on individual expression in one&#x27;s spiritual/magical path.

===Ritual practices===
Many rituals within Wicca are used when celebrating the Sabbats, worshipping the deities, and working magic. Often these take place on a full moon, or in some cases a new moon, which is known as an Esbat. In typical rites, the coven or solitary assembles inside a ritually cast and purified magic circle. Casting the circle may involve the invocation of the &quot;Guardians&quot; of the cardinal points, alongside their respective classical elements; air, fire, water, and earth. Once the circle is cast, a seasonal ritual may be performed, prayers to the God and Goddess are said, and spells are sometimes worked; these may include various forms of &#x27;raising energy&#x27;, including raising a cone of power to send healing or other magic to persons outside of the sacred space.

In constructing his ritual system, Gardner drew upon older forms of ceremonial magic, in particular, those found in the writings of Aleister Crowley.

The classical ritual scheme in British Traditional Wicca traditions is:
# Purification of the sacred space and the participants
# Casting the circle
# Calling of the elemental quarters
# Cone of power
# Drawing down the Gods
# Spellcasting
# Great Rite
# Wine, cakes, chanting, dancing, games
# Farewell to the quarters and participants

These rites often include a special set of magical tools. These usually include a knife called an athame, a wand, a pentacle and a chalice, but other tools include a broomstick known as a besom, a cauldron, candles, incense and a curved blade known as a boline. An altar is usually present in the circle, on which ritual tools are placed and representations of the God and the Goddess may be displayed. Before entering the circle, some traditions fast for the day, and/or ritually bathe. After a ritual has finished, the God, Goddess, and Guardians are thanked, the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed.

A central aspect of Wicca (particularly in Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca), often sensationalised by the media is the traditional practice of working in the nude, also known as &quot;skyclad&quot;. Although no longer widely used, this practice seemingly derives from a line in &quot;Aradia&quot;, Charles Leland&#x27;s supposed record of Italian witchcraft. Many Wiccans believe that performing rituals skyclad allows &quot;power&quot; to flow from the body in a manner unimpeded by clothes. Some also note that it removes signs of social rank and differentiation and thus encourages unity among the practitioners. Some Wiccans seek legitimacy for the practice by stating that various ancient societies performed their rituals while nude.

One of Wicca&#x27;s best known liturgical texts is &quot;The Charge of the Goddess&quot;. The most commonly used version used by Wiccans today is the rescension of Doreen Valiente, who developed it from Gardner&#x27;s version. Gardner&#x27;s wording of the original &quot;Charge&quot; added extracts from Aleister Crowley&#x27;s work, including &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, (especially from Ch 1, spoken by Nuit, the Star Goddess) thus linking modern Wicca irrevocably to the principles of Thelema. Valiente rewrote Gardner&#x27;s version in verse, keeping the material derived from &quot;Aradia&quot;, but removing the material from Crowley.

===Sex magic===

Other traditions wear robes with cords tied around the waist or even normal street clothes. In certain traditions, ritualised sex magic is performed in the form of the Great Rite, whereby a High Priest and High Priestess invoke the God and Goddess to possess them before performing sexual intercourse to raise magical energy for use in spellwork. In nearly all cases it is instead performed &quot;in token&quot;, thereby merely symbolically, using the athame to symbolise the penis and the chalice to symbolise the womb.

Gerald Gardner, the man many consider the father of Wicca, believed strongly in sex magic. Much of Gardner&#x27;s witch practice centered around the power of sex and its liberation, and that one of the most important aspects of the neo-pagan revival has been its ties, not just to sexual liberation, but also to feminism and women&#x27;s liberation.

For some Wiccans, the ritual space is a &quot;space of resistance, in which the sexual morals of Christianity and patriarchy can be subverted&quot;, and for this reason they have adopted techniques from the BDSM subculture into their rituals.

Publicly, many Wiccan groups have tended to excise the role of sex magic from their image. This has served both to escape the tabloid sensationalism that has targeted the religion since the 1950s and the concerns surrounding the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria in the 1980s and 1990s.

Some Wiccan Traditions substitute a Communion style rite in honor of the God and Goddess rather than the symbolic Great Rite in their Esbat ritual.

===Wheel of the Year===


Wiccans celebrate several seasonal festivals of the year, commonly known as Sabbats. Collectively, these occasions are termed the Wheel of the Year. Most Wiccans celebrate a set of eight of these Sabbats; however, other groups such as those associated with the Clan of Tubal Cain only follow four. In the rare case of the Ros an Bucca group from Cornwall, only six are adhered to. The four Sabbats that are common to all British derived groups are the cross-quarter days, sometimes referred to as &quot;Greater Sabbats&quot;. The names of these festivals are in some cases taken from the Old Irish fire festivals and the Welsh God Mabon, though in most traditional Wiccan covens the only commonality with the Celtic festival is the name. Gardner himself made use of the English names of these holidays, stating that &quot;the four great Sabbats are Candlemas , May Eve, Lammas, and Halloween; the equinoxes and solstices are celebrated also&quot;. In the Egyptologist Margaret Murray&#x27;s &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot; (1921) and &quot;The God of the Witches&quot; (1933), in which she dealt with what she believed had been a historical Witch-Cult, she stated that the four main festivals had survived Christianisation and had been celebrated in the pagan Witchcraft religion. Subsequently, when Wicca was first developing in the 1930s through to the 1960s, many of the early groups, such as Robert Cochrane&#x27;s Clan of Tubal Cain and Gerald Gardner&#x27;s Bricket Wood coven adopted the commemoration of these four Sabbats as described by Murray.

The other four festivals commemorated by many Wiccans are known as &quot;Lesser Sabbats&quot;. They are the solstices and the equinoxes, and they were only adopted in 1958 by members of the Bricket Wood coven, before they were subsequently adopted by other followers of the Gardnerian tradition. They were eventually adopted by followers of other traditions like Alexandrian Wicca and the Dianic tradition. The names of these holidays that are commonly used today are often taken from Germanic pagan holidays. However, the festivals are not reconstructive in nature nor do they often resemble their historical counterparts, instead, they exhibit a form of universalism. The rituals that are observed may display cultural influences from the holidays from which they take their names as well as influences from other unrelated cultures.

===Rites of passage===

Various rites of passage can be found within Wicca. Perhaps the most significant of these is an initiation ritual, through which somebody joins the Craft and becomes a Wiccan. In British Traditional Wiccan (BTW) traditions, there is a line of initiatory descent that goes back to Gerald Gardner, and from him is said to go back to the New Forest coven; however, the existence of this coven remains unproven. Gardner himself said that there was a traditional length of &quot;a year and a day&quot; between when a person began studying the Craft and when they were initiated, although he frequently broke this rule with initiates.

In BTW, initiation only accepts someone into the first degree. To proceed to the second degree, an initiate has to go through another ceremony, in which they name and describe the uses of the ritual tools and implements. It is also at this ceremony that they are given their craft name. By holding the rank of second degree, a BTW is considered capable of initiating others into the Craft, or founding their own semi-autonomous covens. The third degree is the highest in BTW, and it involves the participation of the Great Rite, either actual or symbolically, and in some cases ritual flagellation, which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado-masochistic overtones. By holding this rank, an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven.

According to new-age religious scholar James R. Lewis, in his book &quot;Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopaedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions&quot;, a high priestess becomes a queen when she has successfully hived off her first new coven under a new third-degree high priestess (in the orthodox Gardnerian system). She then becomes eligible to wear the &quot;moon crown&quot;. The sequence of high priestess and queens traced back to Gerald Gardner is known as a lineage, and every orthodox Gardnerian High Priestess has a set of &quot;lineage papers&quot; proving the authenticity of her status.

This three-tier degree system following initiation is largely unique to BTW, and traditions heavily based upon it. The Cochranian tradition, which is not BTW, but based upon the teachings of Robert Cochrane, does not have the three degrees of initiation, merely having the stages of novice and initiate.

Some solitary Wiccans also perform self-initiation rituals, to dedicate themselves to becoming a Wiccan. The first of these to be published was in Paul Huson&#x27;s &quot;Mastering Witchcraft&quot; (1970), and unusually involved recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer backwards as a symbol of defiance against the historical Witch Hunt. Subsequent, more overtly pagan self-initiation rituals have since been published in books designed for solitary Wiccans by authors like Doreen Valiente, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf.

Handfasting is another celebration held by Wiccans, and is the commonly used term for their weddings. Some Wiccans observe the practice of a trial marriage for a year and a day, which some traditions hold should be contracted on the Sabbat of Lughnasadh, as this was the traditional time for trial, &quot;Telltown marriages&quot; among the Irish. A common marriage vow in Wicca is &quot;for as long as love lasts&quot; instead of the traditional Christian &quot;till death do us part&quot;. The first known Wiccan wedding ceremony took part in 1960 amongst the Bricket Wood coven, between Frederic Lamond and his first wife, Gillian.

Infants in Wiccan families may be involved in a ritual called a Wiccaning, which is analogous to a Christening. The purpose of this is to present the infant to the God and Goddess for protection. Parents are advised to &quot;give children the gift of Wicca&quot; in a manner suitable to their age. In accordance with the importance put on free will in Wicca, the child is not expected or required to adhere to Wicca or other forms of paganism should they not wish to do so when they reach adulthood.

===Book of Shadows===
In Wicca, there is no set sacred text such as the Christian Bible, Jewish Tanakh, or Islamic Quran, although there are certain scriptures and texts that various traditions hold to be important and influence their beliefs and practices. Gerald Gardner used a book containing many different texts in his covens, known as the Book of Shadows (among other names), which he would frequently add to and adapt. In his Book of Shadows, there are texts taken from various sources, including Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; (1899) and the works of 19th–20th century occultist Aleister Crowley, whom Gardner knew personally. Also in the Book are examples of poetry largely composed by Gardner and his High Priestess Doreen Valiente, the most notable of which is the &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot;.

Similar in use to the grimoires of ceremonial magicians, the Book contained instructions for how to perform rituals and spells, as well as religious poetry and chants like &quot;Eko Eko Azarak&quot; to use in those rituals. Gardner&#x27;s original intention was that every copy of the book would be different because a student would copy from their initiators, but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective, however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today, particularly in the United States, all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess Monique Wilson copied from Gardner, with nothing being altered. The Book of Shadows was originally meant to be kept a secret from non-initiates into BTW, but parts of the Book have been published by authors including Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba, Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar.

===Symbolism===

The pentacle is a symbol commonly used by Wiccans. Wiccans often understand the pentacle&#x27;s five points as representing each of the five elements: earth, air, fire, water, and aether/spirit. It is also regarded as a symbol of the human, with the five points representing the head, arms, and legs.

==Structure==
There is no overarching organisational structure to Wicca. In Wicca, all practitioners are considered to be priests and priestesses.
Wicca generally requires a ritual of initiation.

===Traditions===
In the 1950s through to the 1970s, when the Wiccan movement was largely confined to lineaged groups such as Gardnerian Wicca and Alexandrian Wicca, a &quot;tradition&quot; usually implied the transfer of a lineage by initiation. However, with the rise of more and more such groups, often being founded by those with no previous initiatory lineage, the term came to be a synonym for a religious denomination within Wicca. Scholars of religion tend to treat Wicca as a religion with denominations that differ on some important points but share core beliefs, much like Christianity and its many denominations. There are many such traditions and there are also many solitary practitioners who do not align themselves with any particular lineage, working alone. Some covens have formed but who do not follow any particular tradition, instead choosing their influences and practices eclectically.

Those traditions which trace a line of initiatory descent back to Gerald Gardner include Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca and the Algard tradition; because of their joint history, they are often referred to as British Traditional Wicca, particularly in North America. Other traditions trace their origins to different figures, even if their beliefs and practices have been influenced to a greater or lesser extent by Gardner. These include Cochrane&#x27;s Craft and the 1734 Tradition, both of which trace their origins to Robert Cochrane; Feri, which traces itself back to Victor Anderson and Gwydion Pendderwen; and Dianic Wicca, whose followers often trace their influences back to Zsuzsanna Budapest. Some of these groups prefer to refer to themselves as &quot;Witches&quot;, thereby distinguishing themselves from the BTW traditions, who more typically use the term &quot;Wiccan&quot; (see Etymology). During the 1980s, Viviane Crowley, an initiate of both the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions, merged the two.

Pearson noted that &quot;Wicca has evolved and, at times, mutated quite dramatically into completely different forms&quot;. Wicca has also been &quot;customized&quot; to the various national contexts into which it has been introduced; for instance, in Ireland, the veneration of ancient Irish deities has been incorporated into Wicca.

===Covens===
Lineaged Wicca is organised into covens of initiated priests and priestesses. Covens are autonomous and are generally headed by a High Priest and a High Priestess working in partnership, being a couple who have each been through their first, second, and third degrees of initiation. Occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second-degree initiates, in which case they come under the rule of the parent coven. Initiation and training of new priesthood is most often performed within a coven environment, but this is not a necessity, and a few initiated Wiccans are unaffiliated with any coven. Most covens would not admit members under the age of 18. They often do not advertise their existence, and when they do, do so through pagan magazines. Some organise courses and workshops through which prospective members can come along and be assessed.

A commonly quoted Wiccan tradition holds that the ideal number of members for a coven is thirteen, though this is not held as a hard-and-fast rule. Indeed, many U.S. covens are far smaller, though the membership may be augmented by unaffiliated Wiccans at &quot;open&quot; rituals. Pearson noted that covens typically contained between five and ten initiates. They generally avoid mass recruitment due to the feasibility of finding spaces large enough to bring together greater numbers for rituals and because larger numbers inhibit the sense of intimacy and trust that covens utilise.

Some covens are short-lived, but others have survived for many years. Covens in the Reclaiming tradition are often single-sex and non-hierarchical in structure. Coven members who leave their original group to form another, separate coven are described as having &quot;hived off&quot; in Wicca.

Initiation into a coven is traditionally preceded by an apprenticeship period of a year and a day. A course of study may be set during this period. In some covens a &quot;dedication&quot; ceremony may be performed during this period, some time before the initiation proper, allowing the person to attend certain rituals on a probationary basis. Some solitary Wiccans also choose to study for a year and a day before their self-dedication to the religion.

Various high priestesses and high priests have reported being &quot;put on a pedestal&quot; by new initiates, only to have those students later &quot;kick away&quot; the pedestal as they develop their own knowledge and experience of Wicca. Within a coven, different members may be respected for having particular knowledge of specific areas, such as the Qabalah, astrology, or the Tarot.

Based on her experience among British Traditional Wiccans in the UK, Pearson stated that the length of time between becoming a first-degree initiate and a second was &quot;typically two to five years&quot;. Some practitioners nevertheless chose to remain as first-degree initiates rather than proceed to the higher degrees.

===Eclectic Wicca===
A large number of Wiccans do not exclusively follow any single tradition or even are initiated. These &quot;eclectic Wiccans&quot; each create their own syncretic spiritual paths by adopting and reinventing the beliefs and rituals of a variety of religious traditions connected to Wicca and broader paganism.

While the origins of modern Wiccan practice lie in covenantal activity of a select few initiates in established lineages, eclectic Wiccans are more often than not solitary practitioners uninitiated in any tradition. A widening public appetite, especially in the United States, made traditional initiation unable to satisfy demand for involvement in Wicca. Since the 1970s, larger, more informal, often publicly advertised camps and workshops began to take place. This less formal but more accessible form of Wicca proved successful. Eclectic Wicca is the most variety of Wicca in America and eclectics now significantly outnumber lineaged Wiccans.

Eclectic Wicca is not necessarily the complete abandonment of tradition. Eclectic practitioners may follow their own individual ideas and ritual practices, while still drawing on one or more religious or philosophical paths. Eclectic approaches to Wicca often draw on Earth religion and ancient Egyptian, Greek, Saxon, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Asian, Jewish, and Polynesian traditions.

In contrast to the British Traditional Wiccans, Reclaiming Wiccans, and various eclectic Wiccans, the sociologist Douglas Ezzy argued that there existed a &quot;Popularized Witchcraft&quot; that was &quot;driven primarily by consumerist marketing and is represented by movies, television shows, commercial magazines, and consumer goods&quot;. Books and magazines in this vein were targeted largely at young girls and included spells for attracting or repelling boyfriends, money spells, and home protection spells. He termed this &quot;New Age Witchcraft&quot;, and compared individuals involved in this to the participants in the New Age.

==History==
===Origins, 1921–1935===
Wicca was founded in England between 1921 and 1950, representing what the historian Ronald Hutton called &quot;the only full-formed religion which England can be said to have given the world&quot;. Characterised as an &quot;invented tradition&quot; by scholars, Wicca was created from the patchwork adoption of various older elements, many taken from pre-existing religious and esoteric movements. Pearson characterised it as having arisen &quot;from the cultural impulses of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot;&quot;.

Wicca took as its basis the witch-cult hypothesis. This was the idea that those persecuted as witches in early modern Europe were actually followers of a surviving pagan religion; not Satanists as the persecutors claimed, nor innocent people who confessed under threat of torture, as had long been the historical consensus. The &#x27;Father of Wicca&#x27;, Gerald Gardner, claimed his religion was a survival of this European &#x27;witch-cult&#x27;. The &#x27;witch-cult&#x27; theory had been first expressed by the German Professor Karl Ernest Jarcke in 1828, before being endorsed by German Franz Josef Mone and then the French historian Jules Michelet. In the late 19th century, it was then adopted by two Americans, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Charles Leland, the latter of whom promoted a variant of it in his 1899 book, &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;. The theory&#x27;s most notable advocate was the English Egyptologist Margaret Murray, who promoted it in a series of books – most notably 1921&#x27;s &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot; and 1933&#x27;s &quot;The God of the Witches&quot;.

Almost all of Murray&#x27;s peers regarded the witch-cult theory as incorrect and based on poor scholarship. However, Murray was invited to write the entry on &quot;witchcraft&quot; for the 1929 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, which was reprinted for decades and became so influential that, according to folklorist Jacqueline Simpson, Murray&#x27;s ideas became &quot;so entrenched in popular culture that they will probably never be uprooted&quot;. Simpson noted that the only contemporary member of the Folklore Society who took Murray&#x27;s theory seriously was Gerald Gardner, who used it as the basis for Wicca. Murray&#x27;s books were the sources of many well-known motifs which have often been incorporated into Wicca. The idea that covens should have 13 members was developed by Murray, based on a single witness statement from one of the witch trials, as was her assertion that covens met on the four cross-quarter days. Murray was very interested in ascribing naturalistic or religious ceremonial explanations to some of the more fantastic descriptions found in witch trial testimony. For example, many of the confessions included the idea that Satan was personally present at coven meetings. Murray interpreted this as a witch priest wearing horns and animal skins, and a pair of forked boots to represent his authority or rank. Most mainstream folklorists, on the other hand, have argued that the entire scenario was always fictitious and does not require a naturalistic explanation, but Gardner enthusiastically adopted many of Murray&#x27;s explanations into his own tradition. The witch-cult theory was &quot;the historical narrative around which Wicca built itself&quot;, with the early Wiccans claiming to be the survivors of this ancient pagan religion.

The &#x27;witch-cult&#x27; theory has since been disproven by further historical research, but it is still common for Wiccans to claim solidarity with witch trial victims. The notion that Wiccan traditions and rituals have survived from ancient times is contested by most recent researchers, who say that Wicca is a 20th-century creation which combines elements of freemasonry and 19th-century occultism. In his 1999 book &quot;The Triumph of the Moon&quot;, English historian Ronald Hutton researched the Wiccan claim that ancient pagan customs have survived into modern times after being Christianised in medieval times as folk practices. Hutton found that most of the folk customs which are claimed to have pagan roots (such as the Maypole dance) actually date from the Middle Ages. He concluded that the idea that medieval revels were pagan in origin is a legacy of the Protestant Reformation. Hutton noted that Wicca predates the modern New Age movement and also differs markedly in its general philosophy.

Other influences upon early Wicca included various Western esoteric traditions and practices, among them ceremonial magic, Aleister Crowley and his religion of Thelema, Freemasonry, Spiritualism, and Theosophy. To a lesser extent, Wicca also drew upon folk magic and the practices of cunning folk. It was further influenced both by scholarly works on folkloristics, particularly James Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, as well as romanticist writings like Robert Graves&#x27; &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, and pre-existing modern pagan groups such as the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry and Druidism.

===Early development, 1936–1959===
It was during the 1930s that the first evidence appears for the practice of a neopagan &#x27;Witchcraft&#x27; religion (what would be recognisable now as Wicca) in England. It seems that several groups around the country, in such places as Norfolk, Cheshire and the New Forest had set themselves up after being inspired by Murray&#x27;s writings about the &quot;Witch-Cult&quot;.

The history of Wicca starts with Gerald Gardner (the &quot;Father of Wicca&quot;) in the mid-20th century. Gardner was a retired British civil servant and amateur anthropologist, with a broad familiarity in paganism and occultism. He claimed to have been initiated into a witches&#x27; coven in New Forest, Hampshire, in the late 1930s. Intent on perpetuating this craft, Gardner founded the Bricket Wood coven with his wife Donna in the 1940s, after buying the Naturist Fiveacres Country Club. Much of the coven&#x27;s early membership was drawn from the club&#x27;s members and its meetings were held within the club grounds. Many notable figures of early Wicca were direct initiates of this coven, including Dafo, Doreen Valiente, Jack Bracelin, Frederic Lamond, Dayonis, Eleanor Bone, and Lois Bourne.

The Witchcraft religion began to grow in 1951, with the repeal of the Witchcraft Act 1735, after which Gerald Gardner and then others such as Charles Cardell and Cecil Williamson began publicising their own versions of the Craft. Gardner and others never used the term &quot;Wicca&quot; as a religious identifier, simply referring to the &quot;witch cult&quot;, &quot;witchcraft&quot;, and the &quot;Old Religion&quot;. However, Gardner did refer to witches as &quot;the Wica&quot;. During the 1960s, the name of the religion normalised to &quot;Wicca&quot;. Gardner&#x27;s tradition, later termed Gardnerianism, soon became the dominant form in England and spread to other parts of the British Isles.

===Adaptation and spread, 1960–present===

Following Gardner&#x27;s death in 1964, the Craft continued to grow unabated despite sensationalism and negative portrayals in British tabloids, with new traditions being propagated by figures like Robert Cochrane, Sybil Leek, and most importantly Alex Sanders, whose Alexandrian Wicca, which was predominantly based upon Gardnerian Wicca, albeit with an emphasis placed on ceremonial magic, spread quickly and gained much media attention. Around this time, the term &quot;Wicca&quot; began to be commonly adopted over &quot;Witchcraft&quot; and the faith was exported to countries like Australia and the United States.

During the 1970s, a new generation joined Wicca who had been influenced by the counterculture of the 1960s. Many brought environmentalist ideas with them into the movement, as reflected by the formation of groups like the UK-based Pagans Against Nukes.
In the U.S., Victor Anderson, Cora Anderson, and Gwydion Pendderwen established the Feri Tradition.

It was in the United States and in Australia that new, home-grown traditions, sometimes based upon earlier, regional folk-magical traditions and often mixed with the basic structure of Gardnerian Wicca, began to develop, including Victor Anderson&#x27;s Feri Tradition, Joseph Wilson&#x27;s 1734 Tradition, Aidan Kelly&#x27;s New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, and eventually Zsuzsanna Budapest&#x27;s Dianic Wicca, each of which emphasised different aspects of the faith. It was also around this time that books teaching people how to become Witches themselves without formal initiation or training began to emerge, among them Paul Huson&#x27;s &quot;Mastering Witchcraft&quot; (1970) and &quot;Lady Sheba&#x27;s Book of Shadows&quot; (1971). Similar books continued to be published throughout the 1980s and 1990s, fuelled by the writings of such authors as Doreen Valiente, Janet Farrar, Stewart Farrar, and Scott Cunningham, who popularised the idea of self-initiation into the Craft. Among witches in Canada, anthropologist Heather Botting (née Harden) of the University of Victoria was the first recognized Wiccan chaplain of a public university. She is the original high priestess of Coven Celeste.

In the 1990s, amid ever-rising numbers of self-initiates, the popular media began to explore &quot;witchcraft&quot; in fictional films like &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996) and television series like &quot;Charmed&quot; (1998–2006), introducing numbers of young people to the idea of religious witchcraft. This growing demographic was soon catered to through the Internet and by authors like Silver RavenWolf, much to the criticism of traditional Wiccan groups and individuals. In response to the way that Wicca was increasingly portrayed as trendy, eclectic, and influenced by the New Age movement, many Witches turned to the pre-Gardnerian origins of the Craft, and to the traditions of his rivals like Cardell and Cochrane, describing themselves as following &quot;traditional witchcraft&quot;. Groups within this Traditional Witchcraft revival included Andrew Chumbley&#x27;s Cultus Sabbati and the Cornish Ros an Bucca coven.

==Demographics==
Originating in Britain, Wicca then spread to North America, Australasia, continental Europe, and South Africa.

The actual number of Wiccans worldwide is unknown, and it has been noted that it is more difficult to establish the numbers of members of Neopagan faiths than many other religions due to their disorganised structure. However, Adherents.com, an independent website which specialises in collecting estimates of world religions, cites over thirty sources with estimates of numbers of Wiccans (principally from the US and the UK). From this, they developed a median estimate of 800,000 members. As of 2016, Doyle White suggested that there were &quot;hundreds of thousands of practising Wiccans around the globe&quot;.

In 1998, the Wiccan high priestess and academic psychologist Vivianne Crowley suggested that Wicca had been less successful in propagating in countries whose populations were primarily Roman Catholic. She suggested that this might be because Wicca&#x27;s emphasis on a female divinity was more novel to people raised in Protestant-dominant backgrounds. On the basis of her experience, Pearson concurred that this was broadly true.

Wicca has been described as a non-proselytizing religion. In 1998, Pearson noted that there were very few individuals who had grown up as Wiccans although increasing numbers of Wiccan adults were themselves, parents. Many Wiccan parents did not refer to their children as also being Wiccan, believing it important that the latter are allowed to make their own choices about their religious identity when they are old enough. From her fieldwork among members of the Reclaiming tradition in California during 1980-90, the anthropologist Jone Salomonsen found that many described joining the movement following &quot;an extraordinary experience of revelation&quot;.

Based on their analysis of internet trends, the sociologists of religion Douglas Ezzy and Helen Berger argued that, by 2009, the &quot;phenomenal growth&quot; that Wicca has experienced in preceding years had slowed.

===Europe===

From her 1996 survey of British Wiccans, Pearson found that most Wiccans were aged between 25 and 45, with the average age being around 35. She noted that as the Wiccan community aged, so the proportion of older practitioners would increase. She found roughly equal proportions of men and women, and found that 62% were from Protestant backgrounds, which was consistent with the dominance of Protestantism in Britain at large. Pearson&#x27;s survey also found that half of British Wiccans featured had a university education and that they tended to work in &quot;healing professions&quot; like medicine or counselling, education, computing, and administration. She noted that there thus was &quot;a certain homogeneity about the background&quot; of British Wiccans.

In the United Kingdom, census figures on religion were first collected in 2001; no detailed statistics were reported outside of the six main religions. For the 2011 census a more detailed breakdown of responses was reported with 56,620 people identifying themselves as pagans, 11,766 as Wiccans and a further 1,276 describing their religion as &quot;Witchcraft&quot;.

===North America===

In the United States, the American Religious Identification Survey has shown significant increases in the number of self-identified Wiccans, from 8,000 in 1990, to 134,000 in 2001, and 342,000 in 2008. Wiccans have also made up significant proportions of various groups within that country; for instance, Wicca is the largest non-Christian faith practised in the United States Air Force, with 1,434 airmen identifying themselves as such. In 2014, the Pew Research Center estimated 0.3% of the US population (~950,000 people) identified as Wiccan or pagan based on a sample size of 35,000.

In 2018, a Pew Research Center study estimated the number of Wiccans in the United States to be at least 1.5 million.

==Acceptance==
Wicca emerged in predominantly Christian England, and from its inception the religion encountered opposition from certain Christian groups as well as from the popular tabloids like the &quot;News of the World&quot;. Some Christians still believe that Wicca is a form of Satanism, despite important differences between these two religions. Detractors typically depict Wicca as a form of malevolent Satanism, a characterisation that Wiccans reject. Due to negative connotations associated with witchcraft, many Wiccans continue the traditional practice of secrecy, concealing their faith for fear of persecution. Revealing oneself as a Wiccan to family, friends or colleagues is often termed &quot;coming out of the broom-closet&quot;. Attitudes to Christianity vary within the Wiccan movement, stretching from outright rejection to a willingness to work alongside Christians in interfaith endeavours.

The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey wrote that &quot;the popular and prevalent media image [of Wicca] is mostly inaccurate&quot;. Pearson similarly noted that &quot;popular and media perceptions of Wicca have often been misleading&quot;.

In the United States, a number of legal decisions have improved and validated the status of Wiccans, especially &quot;Dettmer v. Landon&quot; in 1986. However, Wiccans have encountered opposition from some politicians and Christian organisations, including former president of the United States George W. Bush, who stated that he did not believe Wicca to be a religion.

In 2007 the United States Department of Veterans Affairs after years of dispute added the Pentacle to the list of emblems of belief that can be included on government-issued markers, headstones, and plaques honoring deceased veterans.
In Canada, Heather Botting (&quot;Lady Aurora&quot;) and Gary Botting (&quot;Pan&quot;), the original high priestess and high priest of Coven Celeste and founding elders of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, successfully campaigned the British Columbian government and the federal government in 1995 to allow them to perform recognised Wiccan weddings, to become prison and hospital chaplains, and (in the case of Heather Botting) to become the first officially recognized Wiccan chaplain in a public university.

The oath-based system of many Wiccan traditions makes it difficult for &quot;outsider&quot; scholars to study them. For instance, after the anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann revealed information about what she learned as an initiate of a Wiccan coven in her academic study, various Wiccans were upset, believing that she had broken the oaths of secrecy taken at initiation.

<doc id="33299" wikidata="Q11869" url="?curid=33299" title="William Henry Harrison">
<text>William Henry Harrison (February 9, 1773April 4, 1841) was the ninth president of the United States, serving from March 4 to April 4, 1841, the shortest presidency in U.S. history. He was also the first U.S. president to die in office, causing a brief constitutional crisis since presidential succession was not then fully defined in the U.S. Constitution. Harrison was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies, and was a member of the Harrison family of Virginia. He was a son of Benjamin Harrison V, a U.S. Founding Father, and was the grandfather of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd U.S. president.

Harrison was born in Charles City County, Virginia. In 1794, he participated in the Battle of Fallen Timbers, an American military victory that ended the Northwest Indian War. In 1811, he led a military force against Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe, where he earned the nickname &quot;Old Tippecanoe&quot;. He was promoted to major general in the Army during the War of 1812, and led American infantry and cavalry to victory at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada.

Harrison&#x27;s political career began in 1798, with an appointment as secretary of the Northwest Territory. In 1799, he was elected as the territory&#x27;s non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives. He became governor of the newly established Indiana Territory in 1801 and negotiated multiple treaties with American Indian tribes, with the nation acquiring millions of acres. After the War of 1812, he moved to Ohio where, in 1816, he was elected to represent the state&#x27;s in the House. In 1824, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, though his Senate term was cut short by his appointment as minister plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia in 1828.

Harrison returned to private life in Ohio until he was nominated as one of several Whig Party nominees in the 1836 U.S. presidential election, in which he lost to Democratic vice president Martin Van Buren. In the 1840 presidential election, the party nominated him again, with John Tyler as his running mate, under the campaign slogan &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler Too&quot;, and Harrison defeated Van Buren. Just three weeks after his inauguration, Harrison fell ill and died days later. After resolution of an ambiguity in the constitution regarding succession to the powers and duties of the office, Tyler became president. Harrison is remembered for his Indian treaties, and also his inventive election campaign tactics. He is often omitted in historical presidential rankings due to the brevity of his tenure.

==Early life and education==
William Henry Harrison was the seventh and youngest child of Benjamin Harrison V and Elizabeth (Bassett) Harrison. Born on February 9, 1773, at Berkeley Plantation, the home of the Harrison family of Virginia on the James River in Charles City County, he became the last United States president not born as an American citizen. The Harrisons were a prominent political family of English descent whose ancestors had been in Virginia since the 1630s. His father was a Virginia planter, who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress (1774–1777) and who signed the Declaration of Independence. His father also served in the Virginia legislature and as the fifth governor of Virginia (1781–1784) in the years during and after the American Revolutionary War. Harrison&#x27;s older brother Carter Bassett Harrison represented Virginia in the House of Representatives (1793–1799). William Henry often referred to himself as a &quot;child of the revolution&quot;, as indeed he was, having grown up in a home just from where Washington won the war against the British in the Battle of Yorktown.

Harrison was tutored at home until age 14 when he attended Hampden–Sydney College, a Presbyterian college in Hampden Sydney, Virginia. He studied there for three years, receiving a classical education that included Latin, Greek, French, logic, and debate. His Episcopalian father removed him from the college, possibly for religious reasons, and after brief stays at an academy in Southampton County, Virginia, and with his elder brother Benjamin in Richmond, he went to Philadelphia in 1790.

His father died in the spring of 1791, and he was placed in the care of Robert Morris, a close family friend in Philadelphia. He studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. During his time at Penn, he studied with Doctor Benjamin Rush, a Founding Father of the United States and a Penn professor of chemistry and medicine and William Shippen Sr. His older brother inherited their father&#x27;s money, so he lacked the funds for his further medical schooling, which he had also discovered he didn&#x27;t prefer. He therefore withdrew from Penn, though school archives record him as a &quot;non-graduate alumnus of Penn&#x27;s medical school class of 1793&quot;. With the influence of his father&#x27;s friend, Governor Henry Lee III, he embarked upon a military career.

===Early military career===
On August 16, 1791, within 24 hours of meeting Lee, Harrison, age 18, was commissioned as an ensign in the Army and assigned to the First American Regiment. He was initially assigned to Fort Washington, Cincinnati in the Northwest Territory where the army was engaged in the ongoing Northwest Indian War. Biographer William W. Freehling says that young Harrison, in his first military act, rounded up about eighty thrill-seekers and troublemakers off Philadelphia&#x27;s streets, talked them into signing enlistment papers, and marched them to Fort Washington.

Harrison was promoted to lieutenant after Major General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne took command of the western army in 1792, following a disastrous defeat under Arthur St. Clair. In 1793, he became Wayne&#x27;s aide-de-camp and acquired the skills to command an army on the frontier; he participated in Wayne&#x27;s decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, which ended the Northwest Indian War. He received the following commendation from Wayne for his role in the battle: &quot;I must add the name of my faithful and gallant Aide-de-camp ... Lieutenant Harrison, who ... rendered the most essential service by communicating my orders in every direction ... conduct and bravery exciting the troops to press for victory.&quot; Harrison was a signatory of the Treaty of Greenville (1795), as witness to Wayne, the principal negotiator for the U.S. Under the terms of the treaty, a coalition of Indians ceded a portion of their lands to the federal government, opening two-thirds of Ohio to settlement.

At his mother&#x27;s death in 1793, Harrison inherited a portion of his family&#x27;s Virginia estate, including approximately of land and several slaves. He was serving in the Army at the time and sold the land to his brother. Harrison was promoted to captain in May 1797 and resigned from the Army on June 1, 1798.

===Marriage and family===
Harrison met Anna Tuthill Symmes of North Bend, Ohio in 1795 when he was 22. She was a daughter of Anna Tuthill and Judge John Cleves Symmes, who served as a colonel in the Revolutionary War and as a representative to the Congress of the Confederation. Harrison asked the judge for permission to marry Anna but was refused, so the couple waited until Symmes left on business. They then eloped and were married on November 25, 1795, at the North Bend home of Stephen Wood, treasurer of the Northwest Territory. They honeymooned at Fort Washington, since Harrison was still on military duty. Judge Symmes confronted him two weeks later at a farewell dinner for General Wayne, sternly demanding to know how he intended to support a family. Harrison responded, &quot;by my sword, and my own right arm, sir&quot;. The match was advantageous for Harrison, as he eventually exploited his father-in-law&#x27;s connections with land speculators, which facilitated his departure from the army. Judge Symmes&#x27; doubts about him persisted, as he wrote to a friend, &quot;He can neither bleed, plead, nor preach, and if he could plow I should be satisfied.&quot; Matters eventually became cordial with the father-in-law, who later sold the Harrisons of land in North Bend, which enabled Harrison to build a home and start a farm.

Anna was frequently in poor health during the marriage, primarily because of her many pregnancies, yet she outlived William by 23 years, dying on February 25, 1864, at 88.

The Harrisons had ten children:

*Elizabeth Bassett (1796–1846)
*John Cleves Symmes (1798–1830), who married the only surviving daughter of Zebulon Pike
*Lucy Singleton (1800–1826)
*William Henry Jr. (1802–1838)
*John Scott (1804–1878), father of future U.S. president Benjamin Harrison 
*Benjamin (1806–1840)
*Mary Symmes (1809–1842)
*Carter Bassett (1811–1839)
*Anna Tuthill (1813–1865)
*James Findlay (1814–1817)

Professor Kenneth R. Janken, in his biography of Walter Francis White, claims that Harrison had six children by an enslaved African-American woman named Dilsia and gave four of them to a brother before running for president to avoid scandal. The assertion is based on the White family&#x27;s oral history. In her 2012 biography of Harrison, author Gail Collins describes this as an unlikely story, although White believed it to be true.

==Political career==
Harrison began his political career when he temporarily resigned from the military on June 1, 1798, and campaigned among his friends and family for a post in the Northwest Territorial government. His close friend Timothy Pickering was serving as Secretary of State, and along with Judge Symmes&#x27; influence, he was recommended to replace Winthrop Sargent, the outgoing territorial secretary. President John Adams appointed Harrison to the position in July 1798. The work of recording the activities of the territory was tedious, and he soon became bored, and sought a position in the U. S. Congress.

===U.S. Congress===

Harrison had many friends in the eastern aristocracy and quickly gained a reputation among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Congress had legislated a territorial policy that led to high land costs, a primary concern for settlers in the Territory; Harrison became their champion to lower those prices. The Northwest Territory&#x27;s population reached a sufficient number to have a congressional delegate in October 1799, and Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.

Harrison defeated Arthur St. Clair Jr. by one vote to become the Northwest Territory&#x27;s first congressional delegate in 1798 at age 26, and served in the Sixth United States Congress from March 4, 1799, to May 14, 1800. He had no authority to vote on legislative bills, but he was permitted to serve on a committee, to submit legislation, and to engage in debate. He became chairman of the Committee on Public Lands and promoted the Land Act of 1800, which made it easier to buy Northwest Territory land in smaller tracts at a lower cost. Freeholders were permitted to buy smaller lots with a down payment of only five percent, and this became an important factor in the Territory&#x27;s rapid population growth.

Harrison was also instrumental in arranging the division of the Territory into two sections. The eastern section continued to be known as the Northwest Territory and included present-day Ohio and eastern Michigan; the western section was named the Indiana Territory and included present-day Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, a portion of western Michigan, and an eastern portion of Minnesota. The two new territories were formally established by law in 1800.

On May 13, 1800, President John Adams appointed Harrison as the governor of the Indiana Territory, based on his ties to the west and his apparent neutral political stances. He served in this capacity for twelve years. His governorship was confirmed by the Senate and he resigned from Congress to become the first Indiana territorial governor in 1801.

===Indiana territorial governor===

Harrison began his duties on January 10, 1801, at Vincennes, the capital of the Indiana Territory. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were members of the Democratic-Republican Party, and they reappointed him as governor in 1803, 1806, and 1809. In 1804, Harrison was assigned to administer the civilian government of the District of Louisiana. He conducted the district&#x27;s affairs for five weeks until the Louisiana Territory was formally established on July 4, 1805, and Brigadier General James Wilkinson assumed the duties of governor.

In 1805, Harrison built a plantation-style home near Vincennes that he named Grouseland, in tribute to the birds on the property. The 26-room home was one of the first brick structures in the territory; and it served as a center of social and political life in the territory during his tenure as governor. Harrison founded a university at Vincennes in 1801, which was incorporated as Vincennes University on November 29, 1806. The territorial capital was eventually moved to Corydon in 1813, and Harrison built a second home at nearby Harrison Valley.

Harrison&#x27;s primary responsibility was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory&#x27;s population, a requirement for statehood. He was also eager to expand the territory for personal reasons, as his political fortunes were tied to Indiana&#x27;s eventual statehood. While benefiting from land speculation on his own behalf, and acquiring two milling operations, he was credited as a good administrator, with significant improvements in roads and other infrastructure.

When Harrison was reappointed as the Indiana territorial governor on February 8, 1803, he was given expanded authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians. The 1804 Treaty of St. Louis with Quashquame required the Sauk and Meskwaki tribes to cede much of western Illinois and parts of Missouri. Many of the Sauk resented the loss of lands, especially their leader Black Hawk. Harrison thought that the Treaty of Grouseland (1805) appeased some of the Indians, but tensions remained high along the frontier. The Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809) raised new tensions when Harrison purchased more than from the Potawatomi, Delaware, Miami, and Eel River tribes. Some Indians disputed the authority of the tribes joining in the treaty. Harrison was also able to conduct matters unquestioned by the government, as the administration changed hands from Jefferson to Madison.

He pursued the treaty process aggressively, offering large subsidies to the tribes and their leaders, so as to gain political favor with Jefferson before his departure. Biographer Freehling asserts that the Indians perceived the ownership of land was as common to all, just as the air that is breathed. In 1805, Harrison succeeded in acquiring for the nation as many as 51,000,000 acres from the Indians, after plying five of their chiefs with alcohol, for no more than a dollar per 20,000 acres , and comprising two-thirds of Illinois and sizable chunks of Wisconsin and Missouri.

In addition to resulting tensions with the Indians, Harrison&#x27;s pro-slavery position made him unpopular with the Indiana Territory&#x27;s abolitionists, as he tried in vain to encourage slavery in the territory. In 1803, he had lobbied Congress to temporarily suspend for ten years Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance prohibiting slavery in the Indiana Territory. Though Harrison asserted that the suspension was necessary to promote settlement and make the territory economically viable and ready for statehood, the proposal failed. Lacking the suspension of Article VI, in 1807 the territorial legislature, with Harrison&#x27;s support, enacted laws that authorized indentured servitude and gave masters authority to determine the length of service.

President Jefferson, primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, made a secret compact with James Lemen to defeat the nascent pro-slavery movement supported by Harrison. He donated $100 to encourage Lemen with abolition and other good works, and later (in 1808) another $20 to help fund the church known as Bethel Baptist Church. In Indiana, the planting of the anti-slavery church led to citizens signing a petition and organizing politically to defeat Harrison&#x27;s efforts to legalize slavery in the territory.

The Indiana Territory held elections to the legislature&#x27;s upper and lower houses for the first time in 1809. Harrison found himself at odds with the legislature after the abolitionists came to power, and the eastern portion of the Indiana Territory grew to include a large anti-slavery population. The Territory&#x27;s general assembly convened in 1810, and its anti-slavery faction immediately repealed the indenturing laws previously enacted. After 1809, the Indiana legislature assumed more authority and the territory advanced toward statehood.

===Tecumseh and Tippecanoe===

Indian resistance to American expansion came to a head, with the leadership of Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (&quot;The Prophet&quot;), in a conflict that became known as Tecumseh&#x27;s War. Tenskwatawa convinced the tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and that no harm could befall them if they rose up against the settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man&#x27;s ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey. Harrison received word of the resistance through spies he had placed within the tribes, and asked Madison to fund military preparations. Madison dragged his feet, and Harrison attempted to negotiate, sending a letter to Tecumseh saying, &quot;Our Blue Coats (U.S. Army soldiers) are more numerous than you can count, and our hunting shirts (volunteer militiamen) are like the leaves of the forests or the grains of sand on the Wabash.&quot;

In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 warriors down the Wabash River to meet with Harrison in Vincennes. They were dressed in war paint, and their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh berated the condescending Harrison repeatedly, and insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate, arguing that one tribe could not sell land without the approval of the other tribes. He asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly. Harrison said that the individual tribes were the owners of the land and could sell it as they wished. He rejected Tecumseh&#x27;s claim that all the Indians formed one nation and said that each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to do so. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation.

Tecumseh launched an &quot;impassioned rebuttal&quot;, in the words of one historian, but Harrison was unable to understand his language. Tecumseh then began shouting at Harrison and called him a liar. A Shawnee friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh&#x27;s speech was leading to trouble, and some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill Harrison. Many of them began to pull their weapons, representing a substantial threat to Harrison and the town, which held a population of only 1,000. Harrison drew his sword, and Tecumseh&#x27;s warriors backed down when the officers presented their firearms in his defense. Chief Winamac was friendly to Harrison, and he countered Tecumseh&#x27;s arguments, telling the warriors that they should return home in peace since they had come in peace. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that he would seek an alliance with the British if the Fort Wayne Treaty was not nullified. After the meeting, Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation to battle the United States.

Harrison was concerned that Tecumseh&#x27;s actions would endanger the statehood of Indiana, as well as his political future, leaving it &quot;the haunt of a few wretched savages&quot;. Tecumseh was traveling in 1811, leaving Tenskwatawa in charge of Indian forces. Harrison saw a window of opportunity in Tecumseh&#x27;s absence, and advised Secretary of War William Eustis to present a show of force to the Indian confederation. Despite being 13 years removed from military action, Harrison convinced Madison and Eustis to allow him to assume command. He led an army north with 950 men to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace, but the tribes launched a surprise attack early on November 7 in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison countered and defeated the tribal forces at Prophetstown next to the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers; the battle became famous and he was hailed as a national hero. Although his troops had suffered 62 dead and 126 wounded during the battle and the Shawnee just 150 casualties, the Shawnee prophet&#x27;s vision of spiritual protection had been shattered. Tenskwatawa and his forces fled to Canada, and their campaign to unite the tribes of the region to reject assimilation failed.

When reporting to Secretary Eustis, Harrison had informed him of the battle near the Tippecanoe River and that he had anticipated an attack. A first dispatch had not been clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary interpreted it as a defeat until the follow-up dispatch clarified the situation. When no second attack came, the Shawnee defeat had become more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against the initial attack, and Harrison said that he had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War, which continued into the War of 1812. Freehling says that Harrison&#x27;s rusty skills resulted in his troops setting campfires the night before the battle, exposing their position to a surprise attack and casualties.

The press did not cover the battle at first, until one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison&#x27;s first dispatch to mean that he was defeated. By December, however, most major American papers carried stories on the battle victory, and public outrage grew over the Shawnee. Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms, and Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. Congress declared war on June 18, 1812, and Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.

===War of 1812===

The outbreak of war with the British in 1812 led to continued conflict with Indians in the Northwest. Harrison briefly served as a major general in the Kentucky militia until the government commissioned him on September 17 to command the Army of the Northwest. He received federal military pay for his service, and he also collected a territorial governor&#x27;s salary from September until December 28, when he formally resigned as governor and continued his military service. Authors Gugin and St. Clair claim the resignation was forced upon him. Harrison was succeeded by John Gibson as acting governor of the territory.

The Americans suffered a defeat in the siege of Detroit. General James Winchester offered Harrison the rank of brigadier general, but Harrison wanted sole command of the army. President James Madison removed Winchester from command in September, and Harrison became commander of the fresh recruits. He received orders to retake Detroit and boost morale, but he initially held back, unwilling to press the war northward. The British and their Indian allies greatly outnumbered Harrison&#x27;s troops, so Harrison constructed a defensive position during the winter along the Maumee River in northwest Ohio. He named it Fort Meigs in honor of Ohio governor Return J. Meigs Jr. He then received reinforcements in 1813, took the offensive, and led the army north to battle. He won victories in the Indiana Territory as well as Ohio and recaptured Detroit before invading Upper Canada (Ontario). His army defeated the British, and Tecumseh was killed, on October 5, 1813, at the Battle of the Thames. It was considered to be one of the great American victories in the war, second only to the Battle of New Orleans, and secured a national reputation for Harrison.

In 1814, Secretary of War John Armstrong divided the command of the army, assigning Harrison to an outlying post and giving control of the front to one of Harrison&#x27;s subordinates. Armstrong and Harrison had disagreed over the lack of coordination and effectiveness in the invasion of Canada, and Harrison resigned from the army in May. After the war ended, Congress investigated Harrison&#x27;s resignation and determined that Armstrong had mistreated him during his military campaign and that his resignation was justified. Congress awarded Harrison a gold medal for his services during the war.

Harrison and Michigan Territory&#x27;s Governor Lewis Cass were responsible for negotiating the peace treaty with the Indians. President Madison appointed Harrison in June 1815 to help in negotiating a second treaty with the Indians that became known as the Treaty of Springwells, in which the tribes ceded a large tract of land in the west, providing additional land for American purchase and settlement.

==Postwar life==
===Ohio politician and diplomat===
Harrison resigned from the army in 1814, shortly before the conclusion of the War of 1812, and returned to his family and farm in North Bend, Ohio. Freehling claims that his expenses then well exceeded his means and he fell into debt, that Harrison chose &quot;celebrity over duty&quot;, as he sought the adulation found at parties in New York, Washington, and Philadelphia, and that he became an office seeker. He was elected in 1816 to complete John McLean&#x27;s term in the House of Representatives, representing Ohio&#x27;s 1st congressional district until 1819. He attempted to secure the post as Secretary of War under President Monroe in 1817 but lost out to John C. Calhoun. He was also passed over for a diplomatic post to Russia. He was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1819 and served until 1821, having lost the election for Ohio governor in 1820. He ran in the 1822 election for the United States House of Representatives, but lost to James W. Gazlay. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1824, and was an Ohio presidential elector in 1820 for James Monroe and for Henry Clay in 1824.

Harrison was appointed in 1828 as minister plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia, so he resigned from Congress and served in his new post until March 8, 1829. He arrived in Bogotá on December 22, 1828, and found the condition of Colombia saddening. He reported to the Secretary of State that the country was on the edge of anarchy, and that Simón Bolívar was about to become a military dictator. He wrote a letter of polite rebuke to Bolívar, stating that &quot;the strongest of all governments is that which is most free&quot; and calling on Bolívar to encourage the development of democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote that the United States &quot;seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom&quot;, a sentiment that achieved fame in Latin America.

Freehling indicates Harrison&#x27;s missteps in Colombia were &quot;bad and frequent&quot;, that he failed to properly maintain a position of neutrality in Colombian affairs, by publicly opposing Bolivar, and that Colombia sought his removal. Andrew Jackson took office in March 1829, and recalled Harrison in order to make his own appointment to the position. Biographer James Hall claims that Harrison found in Colombia a military despotism and that &quot;his liberal opinions, his stern republican integrity, and the plain simplicity of his dress and manners, contrasted too strongly with the arbitrary opinions and ostentatious behaviour of the public officers, to allow him to be long a favourite with those who had usurped the power of that government. They feared that the people would perceive the difference between a real and a pretended patriot, and commenced a series of persecutions against our minister, which rendered his situation extremely irksome.&quot; A very similar sentiment of the situation is related by biographer Samuel Burr.

Harrison, after leaving his post but while still in the country, wrote his roughly ten-page letter to Bolivar, which is reproduced in full in the Hall and Burr biographies. It left the former struck by Harrison&#x27;s &quot;deeply imbued principles of liberty&quot;. Burr describes the letter as &quot;replete with wisdom, goodness, and patriotism…and the purest of principles&quot;.

===Private citizen===
Harrison returned to the United States and his North Bend farm, living in relative privacy after nearly four decades of government service. He had accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, and he lived on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Burr references M. Chavalier, who encountered Harrison in Cincinnati at this time, and described Harrison as &quot;poor, with a numerous family, abandoned by the Federal government, yet vigorous with independent thinking&quot;.

In May 1817, Harrison served as one of the founding vestry members of the Episcopal congregation, Christ Church in downtown Cincinnati (now Christ Church Cathedral). Harrison went on to serve as a vestry member through 1819, and then again in 1824.

Local supporters had come to Harrison&#x27;s relief, by appointing him Clerk of Courts for Hamilton County, where he worked from 1836 until 1840. Chevalier remarked, &quot;His friends back east talk of making him President, while here we make him clerk of an inferior court.&quot; He also cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey, but closed it after he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers. In an address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, he said that he had sinned in making whiskey and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.

About this time, he met abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor George DeBaptiste who lived in nearby Madison, and the two became friends. Harrison wrote at the time, &quot;we might look forward to a day when a North American sun would not look down upon a slave.&quot; DeBaptiste became his valet, and later White House steward.

Burr closes his account of Harrison by describing an event, denied by some of his friends—a reception given the general at Philadelphia, in 1836. According to Burr, &quot;Thousands and tens of thousands crowded Chesnut street wharf upon his arrival, and greeted him with continual cheering as he landed. He stepped into the barouche but the crowd pressed forward so impetuously, that the horses became frightened and reared frequently. A rush was made to unharness the animals when the General spoke to several of them and endeavored to prevent it; but the team was soon unmanageable, and it became necessary to take them off. A rope was brought, and attached to the carriage, by which the people drew it to the Marshall House. This act was the spontaneous burst of ten thousand grateful hearts. Pennsylvanians fought under the hero, and they loved him. We speak particularly on this point, because we were eyewitnesses of all that passed.&quot;

===1836 presidential campaign===
Harrison was the western Whig candidate for president in 1836, one of four regional Whig party candidates. The others were Daniel Webster, Hugh L. White, and Willie P. Mangum. More than one Whig candidate emerged in an effort to defeat the incumbent Vice President Martin Van Buren, who was the popular Jackson-chosen Democrat. The Democrats charged that, by running several candidates, the Whigs sought to prevent a Van Buren victory in the electoral college, and force the election into the House. In any case the plan, if there was one, failed. In the end, Harrison came in second, and carried nine of the twenty-six states in the Union.

Harrison ran in all the non-slave states except Massachusetts, and in the slave states of Delaware, Maryland, and Kentucky. White ran in the remaining slave states except for South Carolina. Daniel Webster ran in Massachusetts, and Mangum in South Carolina. Van Buren won the election with 170 electoral votes. A swing of just over 4,000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state&#x27;s 30 electoral votes to Harrison and the election would have been decided in the House of Representatives.

===1840 presidential campaign===
Harrison faced incumbent Van Buren as the sole Whig candidate in the 1840 election. The Whigs saw in Harrison a born southerner and war hero, who would contrast well with the aloof, uncaring, and aristocratic Van Buren. He was chosen over more controversial members of the party, such as Clay and Webster; his campaign highlighted his military record and focused on the weak U.S. economy caused by the Panic of 1837.

The Whigs blamed Van Buren for the economic problems and nicknamed him &quot;Van Ruin&quot;. The Democrats, in turn, ridiculed the elder Harrison by calling him &quot;Granny Harrison, the petticoat general&quot;, because he resigned from the army before the War of 1812 ended. They noted for the voters what Harrison&#x27;s name would be when spelled backwards: &quot;No Sirrah&quot;. They cast him as a provincial, out-of-touch old man who would rather &quot;sit in his log cabin drinking hard cider&quot; than attend to the administration of the country. This strategy backfired when Harrison and running mate John Tyler adopted the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols. Their campaign used the symbols on banners and posters and created bottles of hard cider shaped like log cabins, all to connect the candidates to the &quot;common man&quot;. Freehling relates that, &quot;One bitter pro-Van Buren paper lamented after his defeat, &#x27;We have been sung down, lied down and drunk down.&#x27; In one sentence, this described the new American political process.&quot;

Harrison came from a wealthy, slaveholding Virginia family, yet his campaign promoted him as a humble frontiersman in the style popularized by Andrew Jackson, while presenting Van Buren as a wealthy elitist. A memorable example was the Gold Spoon Oration that Pennsylvania&#x27;s Whig representative Charles Ogle delivered in the House, ridiculing Van Buren&#x27;s elegant White House lifestyle and lavish spending. The Whigs invented a chant in which people would spit tobacco juice as they chanted &quot;wirt-wirt&quot;, and this also exhibited the difference between candidates from the time of the election: 


The Whigs boasted of Harrison&#x27;s military record and his reputation as the hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe. The campaign slogan &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too&quot; became one of the most famous in American politics. While Van Buren campaigned from the White House, Harrison was on the campaign trail, entertaining with his impressions of Indian war whoops, and took people&#x27;s minds off the nation&#x27;s economic troubles. In June 1840, a Harrison rally at the site of the Tippecanoe battle drew 60,000 people. The Village of North Bend, Ohio, as well as the alumni of Ohio State University claim that the state&#x27;s use of the nickname &quot;Buckeyes&quot; began with Harrison&#x27;s campaign message. Harrison&#x27;s campaign was the victim of what is described as the nation&#x27;s first &quot;October surprise.&quot; Just days before voters went to the polls, Van Buren&#x27;s Justice Department alleged that Whig Party officials had committed &quot;the most stupendous and atrocious fraud,&quot; when they paid Pennsylvanians to travel to New York to vote for Whig candidates two years earlier.

Voter turnout shot to a spectacular 80%, 20 points higher than the previous election. Harrison won a landslide victory in the Electoral College, 234 electoral votes to Van Buren&#x27;s 60. The popular vote margin was much closer, at fewer than 150,000 votes, though he carried nineteen of the twenty-six states.

==Presidency (1841)==
===Inauguration===
When Harrison came to Washington, he wanted to show that he was still the steadfast hero of Tippecanoe and that he was a better educated and more thoughtful man than the backwoods caricature portrayed in the campaign. He took the oath of office on Thursday, March 4, 1841, a cold and wet day. He braved the chilly weather and chose not to wear an overcoat or a hat, rode on horseback to the grand ceremony, and then delivered the longest inaugural address in American history at 8,445 words. It took him nearly two hours to read, although his friend and fellow Whig Daniel Webster had edited it for length. Freehling opines that speeches like this were actually common at the time, and that its irony was rich, as Harrison, &quot;a lifelong office seeker, elected by deeply partisan politics, harshly criticized both practices&quot;.

The inaugural address was a detailed statement of the Whig agenda, a repudiation of Jackson&#x27;s and Van Buren&#x27;s policies, and the first and only formal articulation by Harrison of his approach to the presidency. The address began with Harrison&#x27;s sincere regard for the trust being placed in him:

 Harrison promised to re-establish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency in Henry Clay&#x27;s American system. He intended to rely on the judgment of Congress in legislative matters, using his veto power only if an act were unconstitutional, and to reverse Jackson&#x27;s spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government, and under no circumstance would he run for a second term. He condemned the financial excesses of the prior administration and pledged not to interfere with congressional financial policy. All in all, Harrison committed to a weak presidency, deferring to &quot;the First Branch&quot;, the Congress, in keeping with Whig principles.

He addressed the nation&#x27;s already hotly debated issue of slavery. As a slaveholder himself, he agreed with the right of states to control the matter:
As he was about to conclude his remarks, Harrison incorporated his reliance upon the country&#x27;s freedom of religion while taking pains to present himself as part of the religious mainstream rather than a dissenter or member of a minority faith:
Harrison&#x27;s lengthy speech offered vague clues about what his presidency would offer to the people of the United States. He declared he would only serve for one term in office and not abuse his veto power. Harrison was against devising financial schemes for the nation, rather he left that wholly to Congress. He was against agitating the Southern United States on the slavery question. He did not discuss the tariff and distribution. He said little of the national bank, except he mentioned he was open to paper money, rather than metallic currency. Harrison&#x27;s concept of the presidency was very limited. This followed closely with Harrison&#x27;s Whig political ideology.

Following the speech, he rode through the streets in the inaugural parade, stood in a three-hour receiving line at the White House, and attended three inaugural balls that evening, including one at Carusi&#x27;s Saloon entitled the &quot;Tippecanoe&quot; ball with 1,000 guests who had paid $10 per person (equal to $312 in 2021).

===The press of patronage ===
Clay was a leader of the Whigs and a powerful legislator, as well as a frustrated presidential candidate in his own right, and he expected to have substantial influence in the Harrison administration. He ignored his own platform plank of overturning the &quot;spoils&quot; system and attempted to influence Harrison&#x27;s actions before and during his brief presidency, especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other presidential appointments. Harrison rebuffed his aggression, saying, &quot;Mr. Clay, you forget that &quot;I&quot; am the President.&quot; The dispute escalated when Harrison named as Secretary of State Daniel Webster, Clay&#x27;s arch-rival for control of the Whig Party. Harrison also appeared to give Webster&#x27;s supporters some highly coveted patronage positions. His sole concession to Clay was to name his protégé John J. Crittenden to the post of Attorney General. Despite this, the contretemps continued until the president&#x27;s death.

Clay was not the only one who hoped to benefit from Harrison&#x27;s election. Hordes of office applicants came to the White House, which was then open to any who wanted a meeting with the president. Most of Harrison&#x27;s business during his month-long presidency involved extensive social obligations and receiving visitors at the White House. He was advised to have an administration in place before the inauguration but declined, wanting to focus on the festivities. As such, job seekers awaited him at all hours and filled the Executive Mansion, with no process for organizing and vetting them.

Harrison wrote in a letter dated March 10, &quot;I am so much harassed by the multitude that calls upon me that I can give no proper attention to any business of my own.&quot; U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia Alexander Hunter recalled an incident in which Harrison was besieged by office seekers who were preventing him from getting to a cabinet meeting; when his pleas for their consideration were ignored, Harrison finally &quot;accepted their petitions, which filled his arms and pockets&quot;. Another anecdote of the time recounted that the halls were so full one afternoon that in order to get from one room to the next, Harrison had to be helped out a window, walked the length of the White House exterior, and then helped in through another window.

Harrison took seriously his pledge to reform executive appointments, visiting each of the six cabinet departments to observe its operations and issuing through Webster an order that electioneering by employees would be considered grounds for dismissal. He resisted pressure from other Whigs over partisan patronage. A group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from any appointed office, and Harrison proclaimed, &quot;So help me God, I will resign my office before I can be guilty of such an iniquity!&quot; His own cabinet attempted to countermand his appointment of John Chambers as Governor of the Iowa Territory in favor of Webster&#x27;s friend James Wilson. Webster attempted to press this decision at a March 25 cabinet meeting, and Harrison asked him to read aloud a handwritten note, which said simply &quot;William Henry Harrison, President of the United States&quot;. Harrison then stood and declared: &quot;William Henry Harrison, President of the United States, tells you, gentlemen, that, by God, John Chambers shall be governor of Iowa!&quot;

Harrison&#x27;s only other official decision of consequence was whether to call Congress into a special session. He and Clay had disagreed over the necessity of such a session, and Harrison&#x27;s cabinet proved evenly divided, so the president initially vetoed the idea. Clay pressed him on the special session on March 13, but Harrison rebuffed him and told him not to visit the White House again, to address him only in writing. A few days later, however, Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing reported to Harrison that federal funds were in such trouble that the government could not continue to operate until Congress&#x27;s regularly scheduled session in December; Harrison thus relented, and proclaimed the special session on March 17, in the interests of &quot;the condition of the revenue and finance of the country&quot;. The session would have begun on May 31 as scheduled if Harrison had lived.

==Death and funeral==

Harrison had been physically worn down by many persistent office seekers and a demanding social schedule. On Wednesday, March 24, 1841, Harrison took his daily morning walk to local markets, without a coat or hat. Despite being caught in a sudden rainstorm, he did not change his wet clothes upon return to the White House. On Friday, March 26, Harrison became ill with cold-like symptoms and sent for his doctor, Thomas Miller, though he told the doctor he felt better after having taken medication for &quot;fatigue and mental anxiety&quot;. The next day, Saturday, the doctor was called again, and arrived to find Harrison in bed with a &quot;severe chill&quot;, after taking another early morning walk. Miller applied mustard plaster to his stomach and gave him a mild laxative, and he felt better that afternoon. At 4:00 a.m. Sunday, March 28, Harrison developed severe pain in the side and the doctor initiated bloodletting; the procedure was terminated when there was a drop in his pulse rate. Miller also applied heated cups to the president&#x27;s skin to enhance blood flow. The doctor then gave him castor oil and medicines to induce vomiting, and diagnosed him with pneumonia in the right lung. A team of doctors was called in Monday, March 29, and they confirmed right lower lobe pneumonia. Harrison was then administered laudanum, opium, and camphor, along with wine and brandy.

No official announcements were made concerning Harrison&#x27;s illness, which fueled public speculation and concern the longer he remained out of public view. Washington society had noticed his uncharacteristic absence from church on Sunday. Conflicting and unconfirmed newspaper reports were based on leaks by people with contacts in the White House. A Washington paper reported on Thursday, April 1, that Harrison&#x27;s health was decidedly better. In fact, Harrison&#x27;s condition had seriously weakened, and Cabinet members and family were summoned to the White House—his wife Anna had remained in Ohio due to her own illness. According to papers in Washington on Friday, Harrison had rallied, despite a &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; report that his condition was of a &quot;more dangerous character&quot;. A reporter for the &quot;New York Commercial&quot; indicated that &quot;the country&#x27;s people were deeply distressed and many of them in tears.&quot;

In the evening of Saturday, April 3, Harrison developed severe diarrhea and became delirious, and at 8:30 p.m. he uttered his last words, to his attending doctor, assumed to be for Vice President John Tyler: &quot;Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.&quot; Harrison died at 12:30 a.m. on April 4, 1841, Palm Sunday, nine days after becoming ill and exactly one month after taking the oath of office; he was the first president to die in office. Harrison&#x27;s wife Anna was still in Ohio packing for the trip to Washington when she learned of her loss. Anna never moved into the White House. Harrison&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Jane Irwin Harrison, widow of Harrison&#x27;s son, had served as hostess of the White House in Anna&#x27;s place while Harrison was president.

The prevailing theory at the time was that his illness had been caused by the bad weather at his inauguration three weeks earlier. Jane McHugh and Philip A. Mackowiak did an analysis in &quot;Clinical Infectious Diseases&quot; (2014), examining Miller&#x27;s notes and records showing that the White House water supply was downstream of public sewage, and they concluded that he likely died of septic shock due to &quot;enteric fever&quot; (typhoid or paratyphoid fever).

A 30-day period of mourning commenced following the president&#x27;s death. The White House hosted various public ceremonies, modeled after European royal funeral practices. An invitation-only funeral service was also held on April 7 in the East Room of the White House, after which Harrison&#x27;s coffin was brought to Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., where it was placed in the Public Vault. Solomon Northup gave an account of the procession in &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot;:

That June, Harrison&#x27;s body was transported by train and river barge to North Bend, Ohio, and he was buried on July 7 at the summit of Mt. Nebo, which is now the William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial.

===Tyler&#x27;s accession to office===
On April 5, Fletcher Webster, the son of Secretary of State Daniel Webster, notified Tyler that Harrison had died in office. Tyler had been visiting family in Williamsburg and returned to Washington on the morning of April 6. That same day, Tyler was sworn into office in front of Harrison&#x27;s cabinet, officially beginning his presidency. On April 9, Tyler gave a brief inaugural address. In his address to the nation, Tyler did not give any personal consolation to Harrison&#x27;s widow Anna or family members. Tyler did compliment Harrison by saying Harrison had been elected for a &quot;great work&quot; of purging the federal government of corruption. Tyler and his family moved into the White House one week after Harrison&#x27;s funeral, before Harrison&#x27;s 30-day mourning period was over. The White House state rooms were still hung with black mourning crêpe.

===Impact of Harrison&#x27;s death===

Harrison&#x27;s death called attention to an ambiguity in Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution regarding succession to the presidency. The Constitution specifically provided for the vice president to take over the &quot;Powers and Duties of the said Office&quot; in the event of a president&#x27;s removal, death, resignation, or inability, but it was unclear whether the vice president formally became president of the United States, or simply temporarily assumed the powers and duties of that office, in a case of succession.

Harrison&#x27;s cabinet insisted that Tyler was &quot;Vice President acting as President&quot;. Tyler was resolute in his claim to the title of President and in his determination to exercise the full powers of the presidency. The cabinet consulted with Chief Justice Roger Taney and decided that, if Tyler took the presidential oath of office, he would assume the office of president. Tyler obliged and was sworn into office on April 6, 1841. Congress convened, and on May 31, 1841, after a short period of debate in both houses, passed a joint resolution, which confirmed Tyler as president for the remainder of Harrison&#x27;s term. The precedent that Congress set in 1841 was followed on seven occasions when an incumbent president died, and it was written into the Constitution in 1967 through Section One of the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation===

Among Harrison&#x27;s most enduring legacies is the series of treaties that he negotiated and signed with Indian leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the tribes ceded large tracts of land in the west which provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement by the nation.

Harrison&#x27;s long-term impact on American politics includes his campaigning methods, which laid the foundation for modern presidential campaign tactics. Harrison died nearly penniless, and Congress voted his wife Anna a presidential widow&#x27;s pension of $25,000, one year of Harrison&#x27;s salary (equivalent to about $ in ). She also received the right to mail letters free of charge.

Freehling refers to Harrison as &quot;the most dominant figure in the evolution of the Northwest territories into the Upper Midwest today&quot;. Harrison, age 68 at the time of his inauguration, was the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency, a distinction he held until 1981, when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated at age 69.

Harrison&#x27;s son John Scott Harrison represented Ohio in the House of Representatives between 1853 and 1857. Harrison&#x27;s grandson Benjamin Harrison of Indiana served as the 23rd president from 1889 to 1893, making William and Benjamin Harrison the only grandparent-grandchild pair of presidents.

===Honors and tributes===
 Several monuments and memorial statues have been erected in tribute to Harrison. There are public statues of him in downtown Indianapolis, Cincinnati&#x27;s Piatt Park, the Tippecanoe County Courthouse, Harrison County, Indiana, and Owen County, Indiana. Numerous counties and towns also bear his name.

The village of North Bend, Ohio, honors Harrison every year with a parade to celebrate his birthday. The Gen. William Henry Harrison Headquarters in Franklinton, Ohio, commemorates Harrison. The house was his military headquarters from 1813 to 1814. On February 19, 2009, the U.S. Mint released the ninth coin in the Presidential $1 Coin Program, bearing Harrison&#x27;s likeness.

<doc id="33302" wikidata="Q122701" url="?curid=33302" title="Lord Kelvin">
<text>William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (26 June 182417 December 1907), was a British mathematician, mathematical physicist and engineer. Born in Belfast, he was the professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Glasgow for 53 years, where he undertook significant research and mathematical analysis of electricity, was instrumental in the formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and contributed significantly to unifying physics, which was then in its infancy of development as an emerging academic discipline. He received the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal in 1883 and served as its president from 1890 to 1895. In 1892, he became the first scientist to be elevated to the House of Lords.

Absolute temperatures are stated in units of kelvin in Lord Kelvin&#x27;s honour. While the existence of a coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, was known before his work, Kelvin determined its correct value as approximately −273.15 degrees Celsius or −459.67 degrees Fahrenheit. The Joule–Thomson effect is also named in his honour.

Kelvin worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. He also had a career as an electrical telegraph engineer and inventor which propelled him into the public eye and earned him wealth, fame, and honours. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project, he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and worked on the mariner&#x27;s compass, which previously had limited reliability.

Kelvin was ennobled in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to Irish Home Rule, becoming Baron Kelvin, of Largs in the County of Ayr. The title refers to the River Kelvin, which flows near his laboratory at the University of Glasgow&#x27;s Gilmorehill home at Hillhead. Despite offers of elevated posts from several world-renowned universities, Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining until his retirement from that post in 1899. Active in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by George Eastman to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman Kodak. In 1904 he became chancellor of the University of Glasgow.

Kelvin resided in Netherhall, a redstone mansion in Largs, which he built in the 1870s and where he died in 1907. The Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow has a permanent exhibition on the work of Kelvin, which includes many of his original papers, instruments, and other artefacts, including his smoking pipe.

== Early life and work ==
=== Family ===
Thomson&#x27;s father, James Thomson, was a teacher of mathematics and engineering at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and the son of an Ulster Scots farmer. James Thomson married Margaret Gardner in 1817 and, of their children, four boys and two girls survived infancy. Margaret Thomson died in 1830 when William was six years old.

William and his elder brother James were tutored at home by their father while the younger boys were tutored by their elder sisters. James was intended to benefit from the major share of his father&#x27;s encouragement, affection and financial support and was prepared for a career in engineering.

In 1832, his father was appointed professor of mathematics at Glasgow, and the family moved there in October 1833. The Thomson children were introduced to a broader cosmopolitan experience than their father&#x27;s rural upbringing, spending mid-1839 in London, and the boys were tutored in French in Paris. Much of Thomson&#x27;s life during the mid-1840s was spent in Germany and the Netherlands. Language study was given a high priority.

His sister, Anna Thomson, was the mother of physicist James Thomson Bottomley FRSE.

=== Youth ===

Thomson attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where his father was a professor of Mathematics in the university department. In 1834, aged 10, he began studying at the University of Glasgow, not out of any precociousness; the university provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for able pupils, and this was a typical starting age. In school, he showed a keen interest in the classics along with his natural interest in the sciences. At age 12 he won a prize for translating Lucian of Samosata&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot; from Ancient Greek to English.

In the academic year 1839/1840, Thomson won the class prize in astronomy for his &quot;Essay on the figure of the Earth&quot; which showed an early facility for mathematical analysis and creativity. His physics tutor at this time was his namesake, David Thomson. Throughout his life, he would work on the problems raised in the essay as a coping strategy during times of personal stress. On the title page of this essay Thomson wrote the following lines from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Man&quot;. These lines inspired Thomson to understand the natural world using the power and method of science:

Thomson became intrigued with Joseph Fourier&#x27;s &quot;Théorie analytique de la chaleur&quot; (&quot;The Analytical Theory of Heat&quot;). He committed himself to study the &quot;continental&quot; mathematics resisted by a British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir Isaac Newton. Unsurprisingly, Fourier&#x27;s work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, Philip Kelland authoring a critical book. The book motivated Thomson to write his first published scientific paper under the pseudonym &quot;P.Q.R.&quot;, defending Fourier, which was submitted to &quot;The Cambridge Mathematical Journal&quot; by his father. A second P.Q.R. paper followed almost immediately.

While on holiday with his family in Lamlash in 1841, he wrote a third, more substantial P.Q.R. paper &quot;On the uniform motion of heat in homogeneous solid bodies, and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity&quot;. In the paper he made remarkable connections between the mathematical theories of thermal conduction and electrostatics, an analogy that James Clerk Maxwell was ultimately to describe as one of the most valuable science-forming ideas&quot;.&quot;

=== Cambridge ===
William&#x27;s father was able to make a generous provision for his favourite son&#x27;s education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at Peterhouse, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and sculling, winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843. He took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of mathematics, physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination. In 1845 Thomson graduated as second wrangler. He also won the first Smith&#x27;s Prize, which, unlike the tripos, is a test of original research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner &quot;You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.&quot;

In 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of Michael Faraday&#x27;s idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or &quot;dielectric&quot;, and not by some incomprehensible &quot;action at a distance&quot;. He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the Faraday effect, which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related.

He was elected a fellow of St. Peter&#x27;s (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845. On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated Henri Victor Regnault, at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the University of Glasgow. At age 22 he found himself wearing the gown of a professor in one of the oldest universities in the country and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student a few years before.

=== Thermodynamics ===
By 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the British Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Oxford. At that meeting, he heard James Prescott Joule making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the caloric theory of heat and the theory of the heat engine built upon it by Sadi Carnot and Émile Clapeyron. Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and mechanical work and for their mechanical equivalence.

Thomson was intrigued but sceptical. Though he felt that Joule&#x27;s results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot–Clapeyron school. He predicted that the melting point of ice must fall with pressure, otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot;. Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs.

In 1848, he extended the Carnot–Clapeyron theory further through his dissatisfaction that the gas thermometer provided only an operational definition of temperature. He proposed an &quot;absolute temperature scale&quot; in which &quot;a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature &quot;T&quot;° of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (&quot;T&quot;−1)°, would give out the same mechanical effect &quot;[work]&quot;, whatever be the number &quot;T&quot;.&quot; Such a scale would be &quot;quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance.&quot; By employing such a &quot;waterfall&quot;, Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of &quot;absolute zero&quot; about which Guillaume Amontons had speculated in 1702. &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat&quot;, published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin&#x27;s birth, used −267 as an estimate of the absolute zero temperature. Thomson used data published by Regnault to calibrate his scale against established measurements.

In his publication, Thomson wrote:

—But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule&#x27;s &quot;very remarkable discoveries&quot;. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two sides.

Thomson returned to critique Carnot&#x27;s original publication and read his analysis to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1849, still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound. However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot&#x27;s theory and convinced of Joule&#x27;s. In February 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking. He was uncertain of how to frame his theory, and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule. During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the second law of thermodynamics. In Carnot&#x27;s theory, lost heat was &quot;absolutely lost,&quot; but Thomson contended that it was &quot;&quot;lost to man&quot; irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world&quot;. Moreover, his theological beliefs led Thomson to extrapolate the second law to the cosmos, originating the idea of universal heat death.

Compensation would require &quot;a creative act or an act possessing similar power&quot;, resulting in a &quot;rejuvenating universe&quot; (as Thomson had previously compared universal heat death to a clock running slower and slower, although he was unsure whether it would eventually reach thermodynamic equilibrium and &quot;stop for ever&quot;). Thomson also formulated the heat death paradox (Kelvin&#x27;s paradox) in 1862, which uses the second law of thermodynamics to disprove the possibility of an infinitely old universe; this paradox was later extended by William Rankine.

In final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared &quot;the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius.&quot; Thomson went on to state a form of the second law:

In the paper, Thomson supports the theory that heat was a form of motion but admits that he had been influenced only by the thought of Sir Humphry Davy and the experiments of Joule and Julius Robert von Mayer, maintaining that experimental demonstration of the conversion of heat into work was still outstanding. As soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the Joule–Thomson effect, sometimes called the Kelvin–Joule effect, and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule&#x27;s work and the kinetic theory.

Thomson published more than 650 scientific papers and applied for 70 patents (not all were issued). Regarding science, Thomson wrote the following:

== Transatlantic cable ==

=== Calculations on data rate ===

Though eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of Walter Crum; but her health broke down on their honeymoon, and over the next 17 years Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of Faraday on the proposed transatlantic telegraph cable.

Faraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent - in modern terms, the bandwidth. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month. He expressed his results in terms of the data rate that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential revenue of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis, Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its profitability.

Thomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable. Thomson&#x27;s results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson&#x27;s calculations implied that the cable must be &quot;abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible&quot;.

Thomson attacked Whitehouse&#x27;s contention in a letter to the popular &quot;Athenaeum&quot; magazine, pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. He thought Whitehouse no fool and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson&#x27;s work had attracted the attention of the project&#x27;s undertakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.

=== Scientist to engineer ===
Thomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir Charles Tilston Bright as chief engineer, but Whitehouse had his way with the specification, supported by Faraday and Samuel F. B. Morse.

Thomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the &quot;Engineer&quot; the whole theory of the stresses involved in the laying of a submarine communications cable, showing when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.

Thomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a character every 3.5 seconds. He patented the key elements of his system, the mirror galvanometer and the siphon recorder, in 1858. Whitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson&#x27;s many suggestions and proposals. It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.

The board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, which the board had been unenthusiastic about, alongside Whitehouse&#x27;s equipment. Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory, and the &quot;Agamemnon&quot; had to return home following a disastrous storm in June 1858. In London, the board was about to abandon the project and mitigate their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer&#x27;s instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to assist in manual work. A cable was completed on 5 August.

=== Disaster and triumph ===
Thomson&#x27;s fears were realised when Whitehouse&#x27;s apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson&#x27;s mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He fatally damaged the cable by applying 2,000 volts. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse&#x27;s proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient vigour.

A joint committee of inquiry was established by the Board of Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable&#x27;s failure was found to rest with Whitehouse. The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of reliability, most of the problems arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October 1863.

In July 1865, Thomson sailed on the cable-laying expedition of the , but the voyage was dogged by technical problems. The cable was lost after had been laid, and the project was abandoned. A further attempt in 1866 laid a new cable in two weeks, and then recovered and completed the 1865 cable. The enterprise was feted as a triumph by the public, and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation. Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was knighted on 10 November 1866. To exploit his inventions for signalling on long submarine cables, Thomson entered into a partnership with C. F. Varley and Fleeming Jenkin. In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an automatic curb sender, a kind of telegraph key for sending messages on a cable.

=== Later expeditions ===

Thomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic submarine communications cable of 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student James Alfred Ewing. He was present at the laying of the Pará to Pernambuco section of the Brazilian coast cables in 1873.

Thomson&#x27;s wife, Margaret, died on 17 June 1870, and he resolved to make changes in his life. Already addicted to seafaring, in September he purchased a 126-ton schooner, the &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; and used it as a base for entertaining friends and scientific colleagues. His maritime interests continued in 1871 when he was appointed to the Board of Enquiry into the sinking of .

In June 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were on board the &quot;Hooper&quot;, bound for Lisbon with of cable when the cable developed a fault. An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in Madeira followed, and Thomson became good friends with Charles R. Blandy and his three daughters. On 2 May 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot;. As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; and Fanny (Blandy&#x27;s daughter Frances Anna Blandy) signalled back &quot;Yes&quot;. Thomson married Fanny, 13 years his junior, on 24 June 1874.
== Other contributions ==
=== &quot;Treatise on Natural Philosophy&quot; ===

Over the period 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with Peter Guthrie Tait on a textbook that founded the study of mechanics first on the mathematics of kinematics, the description of motion without regard to force. The text developed dynamics in various areas but with constant attention to energy as a unifying principle. A second edition appeared in 1879, expanded to two separately bound parts. The textbook set a standard for early education in mathematical physics.

=== Atmospheric electricity ===
Thomson made significant contributions to atmospheric electricity for the relatively short time for which he worked on the subject, around 1859. He developed several instruments for measuring the atmospheric electric field, using some of the electrometers he had initially developed for telegraph work, which he tested at Glasgow and whilst on holiday on Arran. His measurements on Arran were sufficiently rigorous and well-calibrated that they could be used to deduce air pollution from the Glasgow area, through its effects on the atmospheric electric field. Thomson&#x27;s water dropper electrometer was used for measuring the atmospheric electric field at Kew Observatory and Eskdalemuir Observatory for many years, and one was still in use operationally at the Kakioka Observatory in Japan until early 2021. Thomson may have unwittingly observed atmospheric electrical effects caused by the Carrington event (a significant geomagnetic storm) in early September 1859.

=== Vortex theory of the atom ===
Between 1870 and 1890 the vortex atom theory, which purported that an atom was a vortex in the aether, was popular among British physicists and mathematicians. Thomson pioneered the theory, which was distinct from the 17th century vortex theory of René Descartes in that Thomson was thinking in terms of a unitary continuum theory, whereas Descartes was thinking in terms of three different types of matter, each relating respectively to emission, transmission, and reflection of light. About 60 scientific papers were written by approximately 25 scientists. Following the lead of Thomson and Tait, the branch of topology called knot theory was developed. Thomson&#x27;s initiative in this complex study that continues to inspire new mathematics has led to persistence of the topic in history of science.

=== Marine ===

Thomson was an enthusiastic yachtsman, his interest in all things relating to the sea perhaps arising from, or fostered by, his experiences on the &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and the &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. Thomson introduced a new method of deep-sea depth sounding, in which a steel piano wire replaces the ordinary hand line. The wire glides so easily to the bottom that &quot;flying soundings&quot; can be taken while the ship is at full speed. Thomson added a pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker. About the same time he revived the Sumner method of finding a ship&#x27;s position, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application.

During the 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable compass to correct errors arising from magnetic deviation owing to the increased use of iron in naval architecture. Thomson&#x27;s design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction. The deviation caused by the ship&#x27;s magnetism was corrected by movable iron masses at the binnacle. Thomson&#x27;s innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles identified by George Biddell Airy and others, but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson&#x27;s energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by The Admiralty.

Charles Babbage had been among the first to suggest that a lighthouse might be made to signal a distinctive number by occultations of its light, but Thomson pointed out the merits of the Morse code for the purpose, and urged that the signals should consist of short and long flashes of the light to represent the dots and dashes.

=== Electrical standards ===
Thomson did more than any other electrician up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparati for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of Coulomb. In the &quot;Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences&quot; for 1857 he published a description of his divided ring electrometer, based on the electroscope of Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger. He introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the &quot;Kelvin balance&quot; or &quot;Ampere balance&quot; (&quot;SiC&quot;), for the precise specification of the ampere, the standard unit of electric current. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer Magnus Maclean FRSE in his electrical experiments.

In 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the Niagara Falls power station. Despite his belief in the superiority of direct current electric power transmission, he endorsed Westinghouse&#x27;s alternating current system which had been demonstrated at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of that year. Even after Niagara Falls, Thomson still held to his belief that direct current was the superior system.

Acknowledging his contribution to electrical standardisation, the International Electrotechnical Commission elected Thomson as its first president at its preliminary meeting, held in London on 26–27 June 1906. &quot;On the proposal of the President [Mr Alexander Siemens, Great Britain], secounded [sic] by Mr Mailloux [US Institute of Electrical Engineers] the Right Honorable Lord Kelvin, G.C.V.O., O.M., was unanimously elected first President of the Commission&quot;, minutes of the Preliminary Meeting Report read.

=== Age of Earth ===

Kelvin made an early physics-based estimation of the age of Earth. Given his youthful work on the figure of Earth and his interest in heat conduction, it is no surprise that he chose to investigate Earth&#x27;s cooling and to make historical inferences of Earth&#x27;s age from his calculations. Thomson was a creationist in a broad sense, but he was not a &#x27;flood geologist&#x27; (a view that had lost mainstream scientific support by the 1840s.) He contended that the laws of thermodynamics operated from the birth of the universe and envisaged a dynamic process that saw the organisation and evolution of the Solar System and other structures, followed by a gradual &quot;heat death&quot;. He developed the view that Earth had once been too hot to support life and contrasted this view with that of uniformitarianism, that conditions had remained constant since the indefinite past. He contended that &quot;This earth, certainly a moderate number of millions of years ago, was a red-hot globe ... .&quot;

After the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, Thomson saw evidence of the relatively short habitable age of Earth as tending to contradict Darwin&#x27;s gradualist explanation of slow natural selection bringing about biological diversity. Thomson&#x27;s own views favoured a version of theistic evolution sped up by divine guidance. His calculations showed that the Sun could not have possibly existed long enough to allow the slow incremental development by evolution - unless it was heated by an energy source beyond the knowledge of Victorian era science. He was soon drawn into public disagreement with geologists and with Darwin&#x27;s supporters John Tyndall and T. H. Huxley. In his response to Huxley&#x27;s address to the Geological Society of London (1868) he presented his address &quot;Of Geological Dynamics&quot; (1869) which, among his other writings, challenged the geologists&#x27; assertion that Earth must be vastly old, perhaps billions of years in age.

Thomson&#x27;s initial 1864 estimate of Earth&#x27;s age was from 20 to 400 million years old. These wide limits were due to his uncertainty about the melting temperature of rock, to which he equated Earth&#x27;s interior temperature, as well as the uncertainty in thermal conductivities and specific heats of rocks. Over the years he refined his arguments and reduced the upper bound by a factor of ten, and in 1897 Thomson, now Lord Kelvin, ultimately settled on an estimate that Earth was 20–40 million years old. In a letter published in Scientific American Supplement 1895 Kelvin criticized geologists&#x27; estimates of the age of rocks and the age of Earth, including the views published by Darwin, as &quot;vaguely vast age&quot;.

His exploration of this estimate can be found in his 1897 address to the Victoria Institute, given at the request of the institute&#x27;s president George Stokes, as recorded in that institute&#x27;s journal &quot;Transactions&quot;. Although his former assistant John Perry published a paper in 1895 challenging Kelvin&#x27;s assumption of low thermal conductivity inside Earth, and thus showing a much greater age, this had little immediate impact. The discovery in 1903 that radioactive decay releases heat led to Kelvin&#x27;s estimate being challenged, and Ernest Rutherford famously made the argument in a 1904 lecture attended by Kelvin that this provided the unknown energy source Kelvin had suggested, but the estimate was not overturned until the development in 1907 of radiometric dating of rocks.

The discovery of radioactivity largely invalidated Kelvin&#x27;s estimate of the age of Earth. Although he eventually paid off a gentleman&#x27;s bet with Strutt on the importance of radioactivity in Earth&#x27;s geology, he never publicly acknowledged this because he thought he had a much stronger argument restricting the age of the Sun to no more than 20 million years. Without sunlight, there could be no explanation for the sediment record on Earth&#x27;s surface. At the time, the only known source for solar energy was gravitational collapse. It was only when thermonuclear fusion was recognised in the 1930s that Kelvin&#x27;s age paradox was truly resolved. However, modern cosmology recognizes the Kelvin period in the early life of a star, during which it shines from gravitational energy (correctly calculated by Kelvin) before fusion and the main sequence begins.

== Later life and death ==

In the winter of 1860–61 Kelvin (aged 37) slipped on the ice while curling near his home at Netherhall and fractured his leg, causing him to miss the 1861 Manchester meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and to limp thereafter. He remained something of a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic until his death.

Thomson remained a devout believer in Christianity throughout his life; attendance at chapel was part of his daily routine. He saw his Christian faith as supporting and informing his scientific work, as is evident from his address to the annual meeting of the Christian Evidence Society on 23 May 1889.

In the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 (the original day of the coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra), Kelvin was appointed a Privy Councillor and one of the first members of the new Order of Merit (OM). He received the order from the King on 8 August 1902 and was sworn a member of the council at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1902. In his later years he often travelled to his town house at 15 Eaton Place, off Eaton Square in London&#x27;s Belgravia.

In November 1907 he caught a chill and his condition deteriorated until he died at his Scottish country seat, Netherhall, in Largs on 17 December. At the request of Westminster Abbey, the undertakers Wylie &amp; Lochhead prepared an oak coffin lined with lead. In the dark of the winter evening the cortege set off from Netherhall for Largs railway station, a distance of about a mile. Large crowds witnessed the passing of the cortege, and shopkeepers closed their premises and dimmed their lights. The coffin was placed in a special Midland and Glasgow and South Western Railway van. The train set off at 8:30 pm for Kilmarnock, where the van was attached to the overnight express to St Pancras railway station in London.

Kelvin&#x27;s funeral was on 23 December 1907. The Abbey was crowded, including representatives from the University of Glasgow and the University of Cambridge, along with representatives from France, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Monaco. Kelvin&#x27;s grave is in the nave, near the choir screen, and close to the graves of Isaac Newton, John Herschel, and Charles Darwin. Darwin&#x27;s son, Sir George Darwin, was one of the pall-bearers.

The University of Glasgow held a memorial service for Kelvin in the Bute Hall. Kelvin had been a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, attached to St Columba&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Largs, and when in Glasgow to St Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church (now, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Glasgow). At the same time as the funeral in Westminster Abbey, a service was held in St Columba&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Largs, attended by a large congregation including burgh dignitaries.

Lord Kelvin is memorialised on the Thomson family grave in Glasgow Necropolis. The family grave has a second modern memorial, erected by the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow; a society of which he was president in the periods 1856–58 and 1874–77.

=== Limits of classical physics ===
In 1884, Lord Kelvin led a master class on &quot;Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of Light&quot; at Johns Hopkins University. Kelvin referred to the acoustic wave equation describing sound as waves of pressure in air and attempted to describe also an electromagnetic wave equation, presuming a luminiferous aether susceptible to vibration. The study group included Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley who subsequently performed the Michelson–Morley experiment, which found no luminiferous aether. Kelvin did not provide a text, but A. S. Hathaway took notes and duplicated them with a papyrograph. As the subject matter was under active development, Kelvin amended that text and in 1904 it was typeset and published. Kelvin&#x27;s attempts to provide mechanical models ultimately failed in the electromagnetic regime. Starting from his lecture in 1884, he was the first scientist to formulate the hypothetical concept of dark matter; he then attempted to define and locate some &quot;dark bodies&quot; in the Milky Way.

He was skeptical about Maxwell&#x27;s prediction of radiation pressure, but admitted that it did exist after seeing Pyotr Lebedev&#x27;s experimental proof of radiation pressure.

On 27 April 1900 he gave a widely reported lecture titled &quot;Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light&quot; to the Royal Institution. The two &quot;dark clouds&quot; he was alluding to were confusion surrounding how matter moves through the aether (including the puzzling results of the Michelson–Morley experiment) and indications that the equipartition theorem in statistical mechanics might break down. Two major physical theories were developed during the 20th century starting from these issues: for the former, the theory of relativity; for the second, quantum mechanics. In 1905 Albert Einstein published the so-called &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; papers, one of which explained the photoelectric effect based on Max Planck&#x27;s discovery of energy quanta which was the foundation of quantum mechanics, another of which described special relativity, and the last of which explained Brownian motion in terms of statistical mechanics, providing a strong argument for the existence of atoms.

===Pronouncements later proven to be false===
Like many scientists, Thomson made some mistakes in predicting the future of technology.

His biographer Silvanus P. Thompson writes that &quot;When Röntgen&#x27;s discovery of the X-rays was announced at the end of 1895, Lord Kelvin was entirely skeptical, and regarded the announcement as a hoax. The papers had been full of the wonders of Röntgen&#x27;s rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until Röntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir&quot;; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper and seen the photographs, he wrote Röntgen a letter saying that &quot;I need not tell you that when I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made&quot; Kelvin had his own hand X-rayed in May 1896.

His forecast for practical aviation (i.e., heavier-than-air aircraft) was negative. In 1896 he refused an invitation to join the Aeronautical Society, writing &quot;I have not the smallest molecule of faith in aerial navigation other than ballooning or of expectation of good results from any of the trials we hear of.&quot; In a 1902 newspaper interview he predicted that &quot;No balloon and no aeroplane will ever be practically successful.&quot;

A statement falsely attributed to Kelvin is: &quot;There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.&quot; This has been widely misattributed to Kelvin since the 1980s, either without citation or stating that it was made in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1900). There is no evidence that Kelvin said this, and the quote is instead a paraphrase of Albert A. Michelson, who in 1894 stated: &quot;... it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established ... An eminent physicist remarked that the future truths of physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of decimals.&quot; Similar statements were given earlier by others, such as Philipp von Jolly. The attribution to Kelvin in 1900 is presumably a confusion with his &quot;Two clouds&quot; lecture and which on the contrary pointed out areas that would subsequently see revolutions.

In 1898, Kelvin predicted that only 400 years of oxygen supply remained on the planet, due to the rate of burning combustibles. In his calculation, Kelvin assumed that photosynthesis was the only source of free oxygen; he did not know all of the components of the oxygen cycle. He could not even have known all of the sources of photosynthesis: for example the cyanobacterium &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; - which accounts for more than half of marine photosynthesis - was not discovered until 1986.

<text>The Wankel engine (, ) is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. The concept was proven by German engineer Felix Wankel, followed by a commercially feasible engine designed by German engineer Hanns-Dieter Paschke. The Wankel engine&#x27;s rotor, which creates the turning motion, is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle, with the sides having less curvature. The rotor spins inside a figure-eight-like epitrochoidal housing around a fixed-toothed gearing. The midpoint of the rotor moves in a circle around the output shaft, rotating the shaft via a cam.

In its basic gasoline fuelled form, the Wankel engine has lower thermal efficiency and higher exhaust emissions relative to the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. The thermal inefficiency has restricted the engine to limited use since its introduction in the 1960s. However, many disadvantages have mainly been overcome over the succeeding decades as the production of road-going vehicles progressed. The advantages of compact design, smoothness, lower weight, and fewer parts over the reciprocating piston internal combustion engines make the Wankel engine suited for applications such as chainsaws, auxiliary power units (APUs), loitering munitions, aircraft, jet skis, snowmobiles, and range extenders in cars. The Wankel engine was also used to power motorcycles and racing cars.

==Concept==

The Wankel engine is a type of rotary piston engine and exists in two primary forms, the Drehkolbenmotor (DKM, &quot;rotary piston engine&quot;), designed by Felix Wankel (see Figure 2.) and the Kreiskolbenmotor (KKM, &quot;circuitous piston engine&quot;), designed by Hanns-Dieter Paschke (see Figure 3.), of which only the latter has left the prototype stage. Thus, all production Wankel engines are of the KKM type.

* In a DKM engine, there are two rotors: the inner, trochoid-shaped rotor, and the outer rotor, which has an outer circular shape, and an inner figure eight shape. The center shaft is stationary, and torque is taken off the outer rotor, which is geared to the inner rotor.
* In a KKM engine, the outer rotor is part of the stationary housing (thus not a moving part). The inner shaft is a moving part with an eccentric lobe for the inner rotor to spin around. The rotor spins around its center and around the axis of the eccentric shaft in a hula hoop fashion, resulting in the rotor making one complete revolution for every three revolutions of the eccentric shaft. In the KKM engine, torque is taken off the eccentric shaft, making it a much simpler design to be adopted to conventional powertrains.

==Wankel engine development==
Felix Wankel designed a rotary compressor in the 1920s, and received his first patent for a rotary type of engine in 1934. He realized that the triangular rotor of the rotary compressor could have intake and exhaust ports added producing an internal combustion engine. Eventually, in 1951, Wankel began working at German firm NSU Motorenwerke to design a rotary compressor as a supercharger for NSU&#x27;s motorcycle engines. Wankel conceived the design of a triangular rotor in the compressor. With the assistance of Prof. from Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences, the concept was defined mathematically. The supercharger he designed was used for one of NSU&#x27;s 50 cm3 one-cylinder two-stroke engines. The engine produced a power output of at 12,000rpm.

In 1954, NSU agreed to develop a rotary internal combustion engine with Felix Wankel, based upon Wankel&#x27;s supercharger design for their motorcycle engines. Since Wankel was known as a &quot;difficult colleague&quot;, the development work for the DKM was carried out at Wankel&#x27;s private Lindau design bureau. According to John B. Hege, Wankel received help from his friend Ernst Höppner, who was a &quot;brilliant engineer&quot;. The first working prototype, DKM 54 (see figure 2.), first ran on 1 February 1957, at the NSU research and development department &quot;Versuchsabteilung TX&quot;. It produced . Soon after that, a second prototype of the DKM was built. It had a working chamber volume Vk of 125 cm3 and also produced at 17,000rpm. It could even reach speeds of up to 25,000rpm. However, these engine speeds distorted the outer rotor&#x27;s shape, thus proving impractical. According to Mazda Motors engineers and historians, four units of the DKM engine were built; the design is described to have a displacement Vh of 250 cm3 (equivalent to a working chamber volume Vk of 125 cm3). The fourth unit built is said to have received several design changes, and eventually produced at 17,000 rpm; it could reach speeds up to 22,000 rpm. One of the four engines built has been on static display at the Deutsches Museum Bonn (see figure. 2).

Due to its complicated design with a stationary center shaft, the DKM engine was impractical. Wolf-Dieter Bensinger explicitly mentions that proper engine cooling cannot be achieved in a DKM engine, and argues that this is the reason why the DKM design had to be abandoned. NSU development chief engineer Walter Froede solved this problem by using Hanns-Dieter Paschke&#x27;s design and converting the DKM into what would later be known as the KKM (see figure 5.). The KKM proved to be a much more practical engine, as it has easily accessible spark plugs, a simpler cooling design, and a conventional power take-off shaft. Wankel disliked Froede&#x27;s KKM engine because of its inner rotor&#x27;s eccentric motion, which was not a pure circular motion, as Wankel had intended. He remarked that his &quot;race horse&quot; was turned into a &quot;plough horse&quot;. Wankel also complained that more stresses would be placed on the KKM&#x27;s apex seals due to the eccentric hula-hoop motion of the rotor. NSU could not afford to finance developing both the DKM and the KKM, and eventually decided to drop the DKM in favor of the KKM, because the latter seemed to be the more practical design.

Wankel obtained the US patent 2,988,065 on the KKM engine on 13 June 1961. Throughout the design phase of the KKM, Froede&#x27;s engineering team had to solve problems such as repeated bearing seizures, the oil flow inside the engine, and the engine cooling. The first fully functioning KKM engine, the KKM 125, weighing in at only displaced 125 cm3 and produced at 11,000rpm. Its first run was on 1 July 1958.

In 1963, NSU produced the first series-production Wankel engine for a car, the KKM 502 (see Figure 6.). It was used in the NSU Spider sports car, of which about 2,000 were made. Despite its &quot;teething troubles&quot;, the KKM 502 was a powerful engine with decent potential, smooth operation, and low noise emissions at high engine speeds. It was a single-rotor PP engine with a displacement of , a rated power of at 6,000rpm and a BMEP of .

==Operation and design==


The Wankel engine has a spinning eccentric power take-off shaft, with a rotary piston riding on eccentrics on the shaft in a hula-hoop fashion, with the crown gear with one and a half times the number of teeth as on the eccentric shaft. Thus the Wankel is a 2:3 type of rotary engine, i.e., its housing&#x27;s inner side resembles a two lobes oval-like epitrochoid (equivalent to a peritrochoid). In contrast, its rotary piston has a three vertices trochoid shape (similar to a Reuleaux triangle). Thus, the Wankel engine&#x27;s rotor constantly forms three moving working chambers. The Wankel engine&#x27;s basic geometry is depicted in figure 7. Seals at the rotor&#x27;s apices seal against the housing&#x27;s periphery. The rotor moves in its rotating motion guided by gears and the eccentric output shaft, not being guided by the external chamber. The rotor does not make contact with the external engine housing. The force of expanded gas pressure on the rotor exerts pressure on the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft.

All practical Wankel engines are four-cycle (i.e., four-stroke) engines. In theory, two-cycle engines are possible, but they are impractical because the intake gas and the exhaust gas cannot be properly separated. The operating principle is similar to the Otto operating principle; the Diesel operating principle with its compression ignition cannot be used in a practical Wankel engine. Therefore, Wankel engines typically have a high-voltage spark ignition system.

In a Wankel engine, one side of the triangular rotor completes the four-stage Otto cycle of intake, compression, expansion, and exhaust each revolution of the rotor (equivalent to three shaft revolutions, see Figure 8.). The shape of the rotor between the fixed apexes is to minimize the volume of the geometric combustion chamber and maximize the compression ratio, respectively. As the rotor has three sides, this gives three power pulses per revolution of the rotor.

Wankel engines have a much lower degree of irregularity relative to a reciprocating piston engine, making the Wankel engine run much smoother. This is because the Wankel engine has a lower moment of inertia and less excess torque area due to its more uniform torque delivery. For example, a two-rotor Wankel engine runs more than twice as smoothly as a four-cylinder piston engine. The eccentric output shaft of a Wankel engine also does not have the stress-related contours of a reciprocating piston engine&#x27;s crankshaft. The maximum revolutions of a Wankel engine are thus mainly limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7,000 or 8,000rpm. In practice, automotive Wankel engines are not operated at much higher output shaft speeds than reciprocating piston engines of similar output power. Wankel engines in auto racing are operated at speeds up to 10,000rpm, but so are four-stroke reciprocating piston engines with relatively small displacement per cylinder. In aircraft, they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500rpm.

===Chamber volume===
In a Wankel rotary engine, the chamber volume formula_1 is equivalent to the product of the rotor surface formula_2 and the rotor path formula_3. The rotor surface formula_2 is given by the rotor tips&#x27; path across the rotor housing and determined by the generating radius formula_5, the rotor width formula_6, and the parallel transfers of the rotor and the inner housing formula_7. Since the rotor has a trochoid (&quot;triangular&quot;) shape, the sine of 60 degrees describes the interval at which the rotors get closest to the rotor housing. Therefore,

:formula_8

The rotor path formula_3 may be integrated via the eccentricity formula_10 as follows:

:formula_11

Therefore,

:formula_12

For convenience, formula_7 may be omitted because it is difficult to determine and small:

:formula_14

A different approach to this is introducing formula_15 as the farthest, and formula_7 as the shortest parallel transfer of the rotor and the inner housing and assuming that formula_17 and formula_18. Then,

:formula_19

Including the parallel transfers of the rotor and the inner housing provides sufficient accuracy for determining chamber volume.

===Equivalent displacement and power output===

Different approaches have been used over time to evaluate the total displacement of a Wankel engine in relation to a reciprocating engine: considering only one, two, or all three chambers.
Part of this dispute was because of Europe vehicle taxation being dependent on engine displacement, as reported by Karl Ludvigsen.

If formula_20 is the number of chambers considered for each rotor and formula_21 the number of rotors, then the total displacement is:

:formula_22

If formula_23 is the mean effective pressure, formula_24 the shaft rotational speed and formula_25 the number of shaft revolutions needed to complete a cycle (formula_26 is the frequency of the thermodynamic cycle), then the total power output is:

:formula_27

====Considering one chamber====

Kenichi Yamamoto and Walter G. Froede placed formula_28 and formula_29:

:formula_30

With these values, a single-rotor Wankel engine produces the same average power as a formula_31 single-cylinder two-stroke engine, with the same average torque, with the shaft running at the same speed, operating the Otto cycles at triple the frequency.

====Considering two chambers====

Richard Franz Ansdale, Wolf-Dieter Bensinger and Felix Wankel based their analogy on the number of cumulative expansion strokes per shaft revolution. In a Wankel rotary engine, the eccentric shaft must make three full rotations (1080°) per combustion chamber to complete all four phases of a four-stroke engine. Since a Wankel rotary engine has three combustion chambers, all four phases of a four-stroke engine are completed within one full rotation of the eccentric shaft (360°), and one power pulse is produced at each revolution of the shaft. This is different from a four-stroke piston engine, which needs to make two full rotations per combustion chamber to complete all four phases of a four-stroke engine. Thus, in a Wankel rotary engine, according to Bensinger, displacement (formula_31) is:

:formula_33

If power is to be derived from BMEP, the four-stroke engine formula applies:

:formula_34

====Considering three chambers====

Eugen Wilhelm Huber, and Karl-Heinz Küttner counted all the chambers, since each one operates its own thermodynamic cycle. So formula_35 and formula_36:

:formula_37

With these values, a single-rotor Wankel engine produces the same average power as a formula_31 three-cylinder four-stroke engine, with 3/2 of the average torque, with the shaft running at 2/3 the speed, operating the Otto cycles at the same frequency:

:formula_39

Applying a 2/3 gear set to the output shaft of the three-cylinder (or a 3/2 one to the Wankel), the two are analogous from the thermodynamic and mechanical output point of view, as pointed out by Huber.

Felix Wankel managed to overcome most of the problems that made prior attempts to perfect the rotary engines fail, by developing a configuration with vane seals having a tip radius equal to the amount of &quot;oversize&quot; of the rotor housing form, relative to the theoretical epitrochoid, to minimize radial apex seal motion plus introducing a cylindrical gas-loaded apex pin which abutted all sealing elements to seal around the three planes at each rotor apex.

In the early days, unique, dedicated production machines had to be built for different housing dimensional arrangements. However, patented designs such as {{US patent|3824746}}, G. J. Watt, 1974, for a &quot;Wankel Engine Cylinder Generating Machine&quot;, {{US patent|3916738}}, &quot;Apparatus for machining and/or treatment of trochoidal surfaces&quot; and {{US patent|3964367}}, &quot;Device for machining trochoidal inner walls&quot;, and others, solved the problem.

Wankel engines have a problem not found in reciprocating piston four-stroke engines in that the block housing has intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust occurring at fixed locations around the housing. This causes a very uneven thermal load on the rotor housing. In contrast, four-stroke reciprocating engines perform these four strokes in one chamber, so that extremes of &quot;freezing&quot; intake and &quot;flaming&quot; exhaust are averaged and shielded by a boundary layer from overheating working parts. The University of Florida proposed the use of heat pipes in an air-cooled Wankel to overcome this uneven heating of the block housing. Pre-heating of certain housing sections with exhaust gas improved performance and fuel economy, also reducing wear and emissions.

The boundary layer shields and the oil film act as thermal insulation, leading to a low temperature of the lubricating film (approximate maximum {{convert|200|°C|°F|disp=or|-1}} on a water-cooled Wankel engine). This gives a more constant surface temperature. The temperature around the spark plug is about the same as in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating engine. With circumferential or axial flow cooling, the temperature difference remains tolerable.

Problems arose during research in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called &quot;chatter marks&quot; and &quot;devil&#x27;s scratch&quot; in the inner epitrochoid surface, resulting in chipping of the chrome coating of the trochoidal surfaces. They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of the apex seals as well as using more suitable materials. Scratches disappeared after introducing more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Yamamoto experimentally lightened apex seals with holes. Now, weight was identified as the main cause. Mazda then used aluminum-impregnated carbon apex seals in their early production engines. NSU used carbon antimony-impregnated apex seals against chrome. NSU developed ELNISIL coating to production maturity and returned to a metal sealing strip for the RO80. Mazda continued to use chrome, but provided the aluminum housing with a steel jacket, which was then coated with a thin dimensional galvanized chrome layer. This allowed Mazda to return to the 3mm and later even 2mm thick metal apex seals. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing instead of a plug being screwed directly into the block housing.

Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and emissions and idle. A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling. These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use. Ford tested a Wankel engine with the plugs placed in the side plates, instead of the usual placement in the housing working surface ({{patent|CA|1036073}}, 1978).

===Torque delivery===
Wankel engines are capable of high-speed operation, meaning they do not necessarily need to produce high torque to produce high power. The positioning of the intake port and intake port closing greatly affect the engine&#x27;s torque production. Early closing of the intake port increases low-end torque, but reduces high-end torque (and thus power). In contrast, late closing of the intake port reduces low-end torque while increasing torque at high engine speeds, thus resulting in more power at higher engine speeds.

A peripheral intake port gives the highest mean effective pressure; however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, because it helps to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts, which cause &quot;misfirings&quot; caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was also linked to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to the addition of a fresh air supply to the exhaust port. It also proved that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a slight loss of power at top rpm. Elasticity is improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine.

Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area relative to earlier designs, and there have been studies of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines. Side intake ports (as used in Mazda&#x27;s Renesis engine) were first proposed by Hanns-Dieter Paschke in the late 1950s. Paschke predicted that precisely calculated intake ports and intake manifolds could make a side port engine as powerful as a PP engine.

===Materials===
As formerly described, the Wankel engine is affected by unequal thermal expansion due to the four cycles taking place in fixed places of the engine. While this puts great demands on the materials used, the simplicity of the Wankel makes it easier to use alternative materials, such as exotic alloys and ceramics. A commonplace method is, for engine housings made of aluminum, to use a spurted molybdenum layer on the engine housing for the combustion chamber area, and a spurted steel layer elsewhere. Engine housings cast from iron can be induction-brazed to make the material suited for withstanding combustion heat stress.

Among the alloys cited for Wankel housing use are A-132, Inconel 625, and 356 treated to T6 hardness. Several materials have been used for plating the housing working surface, Nikasil being one. Citroën, Daimler-Benz, Ford, A P Grazen, and others applied for patents in this field. For the apex seals, the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained, from carbon alloys, to steel, ferritic stainless, Ferro-TiC, and other materials. The combination of housing plating and the apex and side seal materials was determined experimentally, to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover. For the shaft, steel alloys with little deformation on load are preferred, the use of Maraging steel has been proposed for this.

Leaded petrol fuel was the predominant type available in the first years of the Wankel engine&#x27;s development. Lead is a solid lubricant, and leaded petrol is designed to reduce the wearing of seals and housings. The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of petrol&#x27;s lubricating qualities. As leaded petrol was being phased out, Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the petrol to provide lubrication to critical engine parts. An SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton&#x27;s choices of materials and cooling fins.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

===Sealing===
Early engine designs had a high incidence of sealing loss, both between the rotor and the housing and also between the various pieces making up the housing. Also, in earlier model Wankel engines, carbon particles could become trapped between the seal and the casing, jamming the engine and requiring a partial rebuild. It was common for very early Mazda engines to require rebuilding after {{convert|50,000|mi|km}}. Further sealing problems arose from the uneven thermal distribution within the housings causing distortion and loss of sealing and compression. This thermal distortion also caused uneven wear between the apex seal and the rotor housing, evident on higher mileage engines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The problem was exacerbated when the engine was stressed before reaching operating temperature. However, Mazda Wankel engines solved these initial problems. Current engines have nearly 100 seal-related parts.

The problem of clearance for hot rotor apexes passing between the axially closer side housings in the cooler intake lobe areas was dealt with by using an axial rotor pilot radially inboard of the oils seals, plus improved inertia oil cooling of the rotor interior (C-W {{patent|US|3261542}}, C. Jones, 5/8/63, {{patent|US|3176915}}, M. Bentele, C. Jones. A.H. Raye. 7/2/62), and slightly &quot;crowned&quot; apex seals (different height in the center and in the extremes of seal).

===Fuel economy and emissions===
As is described in the thermodynamic disadvantages section, the early Wankel engines had poor fuel economy. This is caused by the Wankel engine&#x27;s design of combustion chamber shape and huge surface area. The Wankel engine&#x27;s design is, on the other hand, much less prone to engine knocking, which allows using low-octane fuels without reducing compression. NSU tested low octane gasoline at the suggestion of Felix Wankel.

On a trial basis 40-octane gasoline was produced by BV Aral, which was used in the Wankel DKM54 test engine with a compression ratio of 8:1; it ran without complaint. This upset the petrochemical industry in Europe, which had invested considerable sums of money in new plants for the production of higher quality gasoline.

Direct injection stratified charge engines can be operated with fuels with particularly low octane numbers. Such as diesel fuel, which only has an octane number of ~25. As a result of the poor efficiency, a Wankel engine with peripheral exhaust porting has a larger amount of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, because the combustion is slow, and temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of the Wankel engine&#x27;s good exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) behavior. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of Wankel and Otto engines are about the same.

The Wankel engine has a significantly higher (ΔtK&gt;100 K) exhaust gas temperature than an Otto engine, especially under low and medium load conditions. This is because of the higher combustion frequency and slower combustion. Exhaust gas temperatures can exceed 1300 K under high load at engine speeds of 6000 rpm−1. To improve the exhaust gas behavior of the Wankel engine, a thermal reactor or catalyst converter may be used to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide from the exhaust.

Mazda uses a dual ignition system with two spark plugs per chamber. This increases the power output and at the same time reduces HC emissions. At the same time, HC emissions can be lowered by reducing the pre-ignition of the T leading plug relative to the L trailing plug. This leads to internal afterburning and reduces HC emissions. On the other hand, the same ignition timing of L and T leads to a higher energy conversion. Hydrocarbons adhering to the combustion chamber wall are expelled into the exhaust at the peripheral outlet.

Mazda used 3 spark plugs in their R26B engine per chamber. The third spark plug ignites the mixture in the trailing side before the squish is generated, causing the mixture to burn completely and, also speeding up flame propagation, which improves fuel consumption. According to Curtiss-Wright research, the factor that controls the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature, with higher temperatures resulting in fewer hydrocarbons in the exhaust. Curtiss-Wright widened the rotor, keeping the rest of engine&#x27;s architecture unchanged, thus reducing friction losses and increasing displacement and power output. The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical, especially shaft deflection at high rotative speeds. Quenching is the dominant source of hydrocarbon at high speeds and leakage at low speeds. Using side-porting which enables closing the exhaust port around the top-dead center and reducing intake and exhaust overlap helps improving fuel consumption.

Mazda&#x27;s RX-8 car with the Renesis engine (that was first presented in 1999), met in 2004 the United States&#x27; low emissions vehicle (LEV-II) standard. This was mainly achieved by using side porting: The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotary engines were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the side of the combustion chamber. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. This design improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port rotary engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular-shaped intake port. However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations, and it was discontinued in 2012. The new Mazda 8C of the Mazda MX-30 R-EV meets the Euro 6d-ISC-FCM emissions standard.

===Laser ignition===
Laser ignition was first proposed in 2011, but first studies of laser ignition were only conducted in 2021. It is assumed that laser ignition of lean fuel mixtures in Wankel engines could improve fuel consumption and exhaust gas behavior. In a 2021 study, a Wankel model engine was tested with laser ignition and various gaseous and liquid fuels. Laser ignition leads to a faster center of combustion development, thus improving combustion speed, leading to a reduction in NOx emissions. The laser pulse energy required for proper ignition is &quot;reasonable&quot;, in the low single-digit mJ-range. A significant modification of the Wankel engine is not required for laser ignition.

===Compression-ignition Wankel===
{{Main article|Wankel Diesel engine}}

Research has occurred into rotary compression ignition engines. The basic design parameters of the Wankel engine preclude obtaining a compression ratio sufficient for Diesel operation in a practical engine. The Rolls-Royce and Yanmar compression-ignition approach was to use a two-stage unit (see figure 16.), with one rotor acting as compressor, while combustion takes place in the other. Both engines were not functional.

===Multifuel Wankel engine===
A different approach from a compression ignition (Diesel) Wankel engine is a non-CI, multifuel Wankel engine that is capable of operating on a huge variety of fuels: diesel, petrol, kerosene, methanol, natural gas, and hydrogen. German engineer Dankwart Eiermann designed this engine at Wankel SuperTec (WST) in the early 2000s. It has a chamber volume of 500 cm3 (cc) and an indicated power output of {{convert|50|kW|hp|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} per rotor. Versions with one up to four rotors are possible.

The WST engine has a common-rail direct injection system operating on a stratified charge principle. Similar to a Diesel engine and unlike a conventional Wankel engine, the WST engine compresses air rather than an air–fuel mixture as in the four-cycle engine compression phase. Fuel is only injected into the compressed air shortly before top-dead centre, which results in stratified charge (i.e., no homogeneous mixture). A spark plug is used to initiate combustion. The pressure at the end of the compression phase and during combustion is lower than in a conventional Diesel engine, and the fuel consumption is equivalent to that of a small indirect injection compression ignition engine (i.e., &gt;250 g/(kW·h)).

Diesel-fuel-powered variants of the WST Wankel engine are being used as APUs in 60 Deutsche Bahn diesel locomotives. The WST diesel fuel engines can produce up to {{convert|400|kW|hp|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.

===Hydrogen fuel===
As a hydrogen/air fuel mixture is quicker to ignite with a faster burning rate than gasoline, an important issue of hydrogen internal combustion engines is to prevent pre-ignition and backfire. In a rotary engine, each cycle of the Otto cycle occurs in different chambers. Importantly, the intake chamber is separated from the combustion chamber, keeping the air/fuel mixture away from localized hot spots. Wankel engines also do not have hot exhaust valves, which eases adapting them to hydrogen operation. Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines. In a Wankel engine, the problem of a hydrogenate attack is circumvented by using ceramic apex seals.

In a prototype Wankel engine fitted to a Mazda RX-8 to research hydrogen operation, Wakayama et al. found that hydrogen operation improved thermal efficiency by 23% over petrol fuel operation.Although the lean operation emits little NOx, total amount of engine-out NOx
exceeds Japanese SULEV standard. The supplementary stoichiometic operation combined with a catalyst
provides additional NOx reduction. Accordingly, the vehicle satisfies the SULEV standard.

==Advantages==
Prime advantages of the Wankel engine are:
* A far higher power-to-weight ratio than a piston engine
* Easier to package in small engine spaces than an equivalent piston engine
* Able to reach higher engine speeds than a comparable piston engine
* Operating with almost no vibration
* Not prone to engine-knock
* Cheaper to mass-produce, because the engine contains fewer parts
* Supplying torque for about two-thirds of the combustion cycle rather than one-quarter for a piston engine
* Easily adapted and highly suitable to use hydrogen fuel.

Wankel engines are considerably lighter and simpler, containing far fewer moving parts than piston engines of equivalent power output. Valves or complex valve trains are eliminated by using simple ports cut into the walls of the rotor housing. Since the rotor rides directly on a large bearing on the output shaft, there are no connecting rods and no crankshaft. The elimination of reciprocating mass gives Wankel engines a low non-uniformity coefficient, meaning that they operate much smoother than comparable reciprocating piston engines. For example, a two-rotor Wankel engine is more than twice as smooth in its operation as a four-cylinder reciprocating piston engine.

A four-stroke cylinder produces a power stroke only every other rotation of the crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses. The Wankel engine also has higher volumetric efficiency than a reciprocating piston engine. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, delivering power quickly when demanded, especially at higher engine speeds. This difference is more pronounced relative to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced relative to higher cylinder counts.

Due to the absence of hot exhaust valves, the fuel octane requirements of Wankel engines are lower than in reciprocating piston engines. As a rule of thumb, it may be assumed that a Wankel engine with a working chamber volume Vk of 500 cm3 and a compression of ε=9 runs well on mediocre-quality petrol with an octane rating of just 91 RON. If in a reciprocating piston engine, the compression must be reduced by one unit of compression to avoid knock, then, in a comparable Wankel engine, a reduction in compression may not be required.

Because of the lower injector count, fuel injection systems in Wankel engines are cheaper than in reciprocating piston engines. An injection system that allows stratified charge operation may help reduce rich mixture areas in undesirable parts of the engine, which improves fuel efficiency.

==Disadvantages==

===Thermodynamic disadvantages===
Wankel rotary engines mainly suffer from poor thermodynamics caused by the Wankel engine&#x27;s design with its huge surface area and poor combustion chamber shape. As an effect of this, the Wankel engine has slow and incomplete combustion, which results in high fuel consumption and bad exhaust gas behavior. Wankel engines can reach a typical maximum efficiency of about 30 percent.

In a Wankel rotary engine, fuel combustion is slow, because the combustion chamber is long, thin, and moving. Flame travel occurs almost exclusively in the direction of rotor movement, adding to the poor quenching of the fuel and air mixture, being the main source of unburnt hydrocarbons at high engine speeds: The trailing side of the combustion chamber naturally produces a &quot;squeeze stream&quot; that prevents the flame from reaching the chamber&#x27;s trailing edge, which worsens the consequences of the fuel and air mixture quenching poorly. Direct fuel injection, in which fuel is injected towards the leading edge of the combustion chamber, can minimize the amount of unburnt fuel in the exhaust.

===Mechanical disadvantages===
Although many of the disadvantages are the subject of ongoing research, the current disadvantages of the Wankel engine in production are the following:
; Rotor sealing: The engine housing has vastly different temperatures in each separate chamber section. The different expansion coefficients of the materials lead to imperfect sealing. Additionally, both sides of the apex seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely. Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil. By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against. Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is exposed to fuel, allowing oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side. Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase. To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates, and the associated thermal dilatation inequities, a heat pipe has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of the engine. The &quot;heat pipes&quot; effectively direct hot exhaust gas to the cooler parts of the engine, resulting in decreases in efficiency and performance. In small-displacement, charge-cooled rotor, air-cooled housing Wankel engines, that has been shown to reduce the maximum engine temperature from {{convert|231|to|129|°C}}, and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of the engine from {{convert|159|to|18|C-change}}.
; Apex seal lifting: Centrifugal force pushes the apex seal onto the housing surface forming a firm seal. Gaps can develop between the apex seal and trochoid housing in light-load operation when imbalances in centrifugal force and gas pressure occur. At low engine-rpm ranges, or under low-load conditions, the gas pressure in the combustion chamber can cause the seal to lift off the surface, resulting in combustion gas leaking into the next chamber. Mazda developed a solution, changing the shape of the trochoid housing, which meant that the seals remained flush with the housing. Using the Wankel engine at sustained higher revolutions helps eliminate apex seal lift-off, making it viable in applications such as electricity generation. In motor vehicles, the engine is suited to series-hybrid applications. NSU circumvented this problem by adding slots on one side of the apex seals, thus directing the gas pressure into the base of the apex. This effectively prevented the apex seals from lifting off.

Although in two dimensions the seal system of a Wankel looks to be even simpler than that of a corresponding multi-cylinder piston engine, in three dimensions the opposite is true. As well as the rotor apex seals evident in the conceptual diagram, the rotor must also seal against the chamber ends.

Piston rings in reciprocating engines are not perfect seals; each has a gap to allow for expansion. The sealing at the apexes of the Wankel rotor is less critical because leakage is between adjacent chambers on adjacent strokes of the cycle, rather than to the mainshaft case. Although sealing has improved over the years, the less-than-effective sealing of the Wankel, which is mostly due to lack of lubrication, remains a factor reducing its efficiency.

The trailing side of the rotary engine&#x27;s combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream that pushes back the flame front. With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber&#x27;s trailing side in the mid and high-engine speed ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent {{patent|US|3848574}}; Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading side, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts. In two-stroke engines, metal reeds last about {{convert|15000|km|abbr=in}} while carbon fiber, around {{convert|8000|km|abbr=in}}. This poor combustion in the trailing side of the chamber is one of the reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons in a Wankel&#x27;s exhaust stream. A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids port overlap, one of the causes of this, because the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system and obtained a complete conversion of the aspirated mixture. In the 26B, the upper late trailing spark plug ignites before the onset of the squeeze flow.

==Regulations and taxation==
National agencies that tax automobiles according to displacement and regulatory bodies in automobile racing use a variety of equivalency factors to compare Wankel engines to four-stroke piston engines. Greece, for example, taxed cars based on the working chamber volume (the face of one rotor), multiplied by the number of rotors, lowering the cost of ownership.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Japan did the same, but applied an equivalency factor of 1.5, making Mazda&#x27;s 13B engine fit just under the 2-liter tax limit. FIA used an equivalency factor of 1.8 but later increased it to 2.0, using the displacement formula described by Bensinger. However, the DMSB applies an equivalency factor of 1.5 in motorsport.

The first rotary-engined car for sale was the 1964 NSU Rotary Spider. Rotary engines were continuously fitted in cars until 2012 when Mazda discontinued the RX-8. Mazda introduced a rotary-engined hybrid electric car, the MX-30 R-EV in 2023.

===NSU and Mazda===
Mazda and NSU signed a study contract to develop the Wankel engine in 1961 and competed to bring the first Wankel-powered automobile to the market. Although Mazda produced an experimental rotary that year, NSU was the first with a rotary automobile for sale, the sporty NSU Spider in 1964; Mazda countered with a display of two- and four-rotor rotary engines at that year&#x27;s Tokyo Motor Show. In 1967, NSU began production of a rotary-engined luxury car, the Ro 80. NSU had not produced reliable apex seals on the rotor, though, unlike Mazda and Curtiss-Wright. NSU had problems with apex seals&#x27; wear, poor shaft lubrication, and poor fuel economy, leading to frequent engine failures, not solved until 1972, which led to large warranty costs curtailing further NSU rotary engine development. This premature release of the new rotary engine gave a poor reputation for all makes, and even when these issues were solved in the last engines produced by NSU in the second half of the &#x27;70s, sales did not recover.

By early 1978, Audi engineers Richard van Basshuysen and Gottlieb Wilmers had designed a new generation of the Audi NSU Wankel engine, the KKM 871. It was a two-rotor unit with a chamber volume Vk of 746.6 cm3, derived from an eccentricity of 17 mm, a generating radius of 118.5 mm, and equidistance of 4 mm and a housing width of 69 mm. It had double side intake ports, and a peripheral exhaust port; it was fitted with a continuously injecting Bosch K-Jetronic multipoint manifold injection system. According to the DIN 70020 standard, it produced 121 kW at 6500 rpm, and could provide a max. torque of 210 N·m at 3500 rpm. Van Basshuysen and Wilmers designed the engine with either a thermal reactor, or a catalytic converter for emissions control. The engine had a mass of 142 kg, and a BSFC of approximately 315 g/(kW·h) at 3000 rpm and a BMEP of 900 kPa. For testing, two KKM 871 engines were installed in Audi 100 Type 43 test cars, one with a five-speed manual gearbox, and one with a three-speed automatic gearbox.

===Mazda===
Mazda claimed to have solved the apex seal problem, operating test engines at high speed for 300 hours without failure. After years of development, Mazda&#x27;s first rotary engine car was the 1967 Cosmo 110S. The company followed with several Wankel (&quot;rotary&quot; in the company&#x27;s terminology) vehicles, including a bus and a pickup truck. Customers often cited the cars&#x27; smoothness of operation. However, Mazda chose a method to comply with hydrocarbon emission standards which, while less expensive to produce, increased fuel consumption.

Mazda later abandoned the rotary in most of their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only. The company normally used two-rotor designs. A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1990 Eunos Cosmo sports car. In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8. The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from the periphery of the rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, and better airflow. The Renesis is capable of {{cvt|238|hp|sigfig=3|order=flip}} with improved fuel economy, reliability, and lower emissions than prior Mazda rotary engines, all from a nominal 2.6 L displacement, but this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards. Mazda ended production of their rotary engine in 2012 after the engine failed to meet the more stringent Euro 5 emission standards, leaving no automotive company selling a rotary-powered road vehicle until 2023.

Mazda launched the MX-30 R-EV hybrid fitted with a Wankel engine range extender in March 2023. The Wankel engine has no direct connection to the wheels and serves only to charge the battery. It is a single-rotor unit with a {{cvt|830|cm3|in3|1}} engine and a rated power output of {{cvt|55|kW|hp|0}}. The engine has petrol direct injection, exhaust gas recirculation, and an exhaust-gas treatment system with a Three-way catalyst and a particulate filter. The engine is Euro 6d-ISC-FCM-compliant.

===Citroën===
Citroën did much research, producing the M35 and GS Birotor cars, and the {{Interlanguage link|Citroën RE-2|fr|3=Citroën RE-2|lt=RE-2}} helicopter, using engines produced by Comotor, a joint venture by Citroën and NSU.

===Daimler-Benz===
Daimler-Benz fitted a Wankel engine in their C111 concept car. The C 111-II&#x27;s engine was naturally aspirated, fitted with petrol direct injection, and had four rotors. The total displacement was {{convert|4.8|L|cuin|abbr=in}}, and the compression ration was 9.3:1 It provided a maximum torque of {{cvt|433|Nm|kpm|0}} at 5,000{{nbsp}}rpm and a power output of {{cvt|350|PS|kW|order=flip|0}} at 6,000{{nbsp}}rpm.

===American Motors===
American Motors Corporation (AMC) was so convinced &quot;... that the rotary engine will play an important role as a powerplant for cars and trucks of the future ...&quot;, that the chairman, Roy D. Chapin Jr., signed an agreement in February 1973 after a year&#x27;s negotiations, to build rotary engines for both passenger cars and military vehicles, and the right to sell any rotary engines it produced to other companies. AMC&#x27;s president, William Luneburg, did not expect dramatic development through to 1980, but Gerald C. Meyers, AMC&#x27;s vice president of the engineering product group, suggested that AMC should buy the engines from Curtiss-Wright before developing its own rotary engines, and predicted a total transition to rotary power by 1984.

Plans called for the engine to be used in the AMC Pacer, but development was pushed back. American Motors designed the unique Pacer around the engine. By 1974, AMC had decided to purchase the General Motors (GM) rotary instead of building an engine in-house. Both GM and AMC confirmed the relationship would be beneficial in marketing the new engine, with AMC claiming that the GM rotary achieved good fuel economy. GM&#x27;s engines had not reached production when the Pacer was launched onto the market. The 1973 oil crisis played a part in frustrating the use of the rotary engine. Rising fuel prices and speculation about proposed US emission standards legislation also increased concerns.

===General Motors===
At its annual meeting in May 1973, General Motors unveiled the Wankel engine it planned to use in the Chevrolet Vega. By 1974, GM R&amp;D had not succeeded in producing a Wankel engine meeting both the emission requirements and good fuel economy, leading to a decision by the company to cancel the project. Because of that decision, the R&amp;D team only partly released the results of its most recent research, which claimed to have solved the fuel-economy problem and built reliable engines with a lifespan above {{convert|530,000|mi}}. Those findings were not taken into account when the cancellation order was issued. The ending of GM&#x27;s rotary project required AMC, who was to purchase the engine, to reconfigure the Pacer to house its AMC straight-6 engine driving the rear wheels.

===AvtoVAZ===
In 1974, the Soviet Union created a special engine-design bureau, which, in 1978, designed an engine designated as VAZ-311 fitted into a VAZ-2101 car. In 1980, the company began delivering the VAZ-411 twin-rotor Wankel engine in VAZ-2106 cars, with about 200 being manufactured. Most of the production went to the security services.

===Ford===
Ford conducted research in rotary engines, resulting in patents granted: {{patent|GB|1460229}}, 1974, a method for fabricating housings; {{patent|US|3833321}} 1974, side plates coating; {{patent|US|3890069}}, 1975, housing coating; {{patent|CA|1030743}}, 1978: Housings alignment; {{patent|CA|1045553}}, 1979, reed-valve assembly. In 1972, Henry Ford II stated that the rotary probably would not replace the piston in &quot;my lifetime&quot;.

===Car racing===
The Sigma MC74 powered by a Mazda 12A engine was the first engine and only team from outside Western Europe or the United States to finish the entire 24{{nbsp}}hours of the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, in 1974. Yojiro Terada was the driver of the MC74. Mazda was the first team from outside Western Europe or the United States to win Le Mans outright. It was also the only non-piston engined car to win Le Mans, which the company accomplished in 1991 with their four-rotor 787B ({{convert |5.24|L|cuin|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} displacement), rated by FIA formula at {{convert|4.708|L|cuin|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). In the C2 class, all participants had the same amount of fuel. The only exception was the unregulated C1 Category 1. This category only allowed naturally aspirated engines. The Mazdas were classified as naturally aspirated to start with 830 kg weight, 170 kg less than the supercharged competitors. The cars under the Group C1 Category 1 regulations for 1991 were allowed to be another 80 kg lighter than the 787B. In addition, Group C1 Category 1 had only permitted 3.5-liter naturally aspirated engines and had no fuel quantity limits.

===As a vehicle range extender===
Due to the compact size and the high power-to-weight ratio of a Wankel engine, it has been proposed for electric vehicles as range extenders to provide supplementary power when electric battery levels are low. A Wankel engine used as a generator has packaging, noise, vibration, and harshness advantages when used in a passenger car, maximizing interior passenger and luggage space, as well as providing a good noise and vibration emissions profile. However, it is questionable whether or not the inherent disadvantages of the Wankel engine allow the usage of the Wankel engine as a range extender for passenger cars.

In 2010, Audi unveiled a prototype series-hybrid electric car, the A1 e-tron. It incorporated a Wankel engine with a chamber volume Vk of 254 cm3, capable of producing 18 kW at 5000 rpm. It was mated to an electric generator, which recharged the car&#x27;s batteries as needed and provided electricity directly to the electric driving motor. The package had a mass of 70 kg and could produce 15 kW of electric power.

In November 2013, Mazda announced to the motoring press a series-hybrid prototype car, the Mazda2 EV, using a Wankel engine as a range extender. The generator engine, located under the rear luggage floor, is a tiny, almost inaudible, single-rotor 330-cc unit, generating {{cvt|30|hp|order=flip}} at 4,500{{nbsp}}rpm and maintaining a continuous electric output of 20 kW.

Mazda introduced the MX-30 R-EV fitted with a Wankel engine range extender in March 2023. The car&#x27;s Wankel engine is a naturally aspirated single-rotor unit with a chamber volume Vk of {{cvt|830|cm3|in3|1}}, a compression of 11.9, and a rated power output of {{cvt|55|kW|hp|0}}. It has petrol direct injection, exhaust gas recirculation, and an exhaust-gas treatment system with a TWC and a particulate filter. According to &quot;auto motor und sport&quot;, the engine is Euro 6d-ISC-FCM-compliant.

==Motorcycle applications==
{{split|Wankel engine use in motorcycles|date=December 2022}}

The first Wankel-engined motorcycle was an MZ-built MZ ES 250, fitted with a water-cooled KKM 175 W Wankel engine. An air-cooled version followed this in 1965, called the KKM 175 L. The engine produced {{cvt|24|bhp|kW|0}} at 6,750{{nbsp}}rpm, but the motorcycle never went into series production.

===Norton===

In Britain, Norton Motorcycles developed a Wankel rotary engine for motorcycles, based on the Sachs air-cooled rotor Wankel that powered the DKW/Hercules W-2000 motorcycle. This two-rotor engine was included in the Commander and F1. Norton improved on Sachs&#x27;s air cooling, introducing a plenum chamber. Suzuki also made a production motorcycle powered by a Wankel engine, the RE-5, using ferroTiC alloy apex seals and an NSU rotor in a successful attempt to prolong the engine&#x27;s life.

In the early 1980s, using earlier work at BSA, Norton produced the air-cooled twin-rotor Classic, followed by the liquid-cooled Commander and the Interpol2 (a police version). Subsequent Norton Wankel bikes included the Norton F1, F1 Sports, RC588, Norton RCW588, and NRS588. Norton proposed a new 588-cc twin-rotor model called the &quot;NRV588&quot; and a 700-cc version called the &quot;NRV700&quot;. A former mechanic at Norton, Brian Crighton, started developing his own rotary engined motorcycles line named &quot;Roton&quot;, which won several Australian races.

Despite successes in racing, no motorcycles powered by Wankel engines have been produced for sale to the general public for road use since 1992.

===Yamaha===
In 1972, Yamaha introduced the RZ201 at the Tokyo Motor Show, a prototype with a Wankel engine, weighing 220 kg and producing {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} from a twin-rotor 660-cc engine (US patent N3964448). In 1972, Kawasaki presented its two-rotor Kawasaki X99 rotary engine prototype (US patents N 3848574 &amp;3991722). Both Yamaha and Kawasaki claimed to have solved the problems of poor fuel economy, high exhaust emissions, and poor engine longevity in early Wankels, but neither prototype reached production.

===Hercules===
In 1974, Hercules produced W-2000 Wankel motorcycles, but low production numbers meant the project was unprofitable, and production ceased in 1977.

===Suzuki===
From 1975 to 1976, Suzuki produced its RE5 single-rotor Wankel motorcycle. It was a complex design, with both liquid cooling and oil cooling, and multiple lubrication and carburetor systems. It worked well and was smooth, but it did not sell well because it was heavy and had a modest power output of {{convert|62|hp|abbr=on}}.
Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water-cooling system. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings, and silencers with heat shields. Suzuki had three lube systems, while Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system that fed both the main bearings and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, but with rough patches at 4,000 rpm. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame.
Although it was described to handle well, the result was that the Suzuki was heavy, overcomplicated, expensive to manufacture, and, at 62 bhp, short on power.

===Van Veen===
Dutch motorcycle importer and manufacturer Van Veen produced small quantities of a dual-rotor Wankel-engined OCR-1000 motorcycle between 1978 and 1980, using surplus Comotor engines. The OCR 1000 engine used a modified KKM 624 engine initially intended for the Citroën GS Birotor car. Whereby an electronic map ignition from Hartig replaced the ignition distributor.

==Non-road vehicle applications==

===Aircraft===


In principle, rotary engines are ideal for light aircraft, being light, compact, almost vibrationless, and with a high power-to-weight ratio. Further aviation benefits of a rotary engine include:

# The engine is not susceptible to &quot;shock-cooling&quot; during descent;
# The engine does not require an enriched mixture for cooling at high power;
# Having no reciprocating parts, there is less vulnerability to damage when the engine revolves at a higher rate than the designed maximum.

Unlike cars and motorcycles, a rotary aero-engine will be sufficiently warm before full power is applied because of the time taken for pre-flight checks. Also, the journey to the runway has minimum cooling, which further permits the engine to reach the operating temperature for full power on take-off. A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its operational time at high power outputs, with little idling.

Since rotary engines operate at a relatively high rotational speed, at 6,000{{nbsp}}rpm of the output shaft, the rotor spins only at about one-third of that speed. With relatively low torque, propeller-driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units; for example, the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox.

The first rotary engine aircraft was in the late-1960s in the experimental Lockheed Q-Star civilian version of the United States Army&#x27;s reconnaissance QT-2, essentially a powered Schweizer sailplane. The plane was powered by a {{convert|185|hp|abbr=on}} Curtiss-Wright RC2-60 Wankel rotary engine. The same engine model was also used in a Cessna Cardinal and a helicopter, as well as other airplanes. The French company Citroën developed a rotary-powered {{Interlanguage link|Citroën RE-2|fr|3=Citroën RE-2|lt=RE-2}} helicopter in the 1970s. In Germany in the mid-1970s, a pusher ducted fan airplane powered by a modified NSU multi-rotor rotary engine was developed in both civilian and military versions, Fanliner and Fantrainer.

At roughly the same time as the first experiments with full-scale aircraft powered with rotary engines, model aircraft-sized versions were pioneered by a combination of the well-known Japanese O.S. Engines firm and the then-extant German Graupner aeromodelling products firm, under license from NSU. The Graupner model Wankel engine has a chamber volume Vk of 4.9 cm3, and produces 460 W at 16,000 rpm−1; its mass is 370 g. It was produced by O.S. engines of Japan.

Rotary engines have been fitted in homebuilt experimental aircraft, such as the ARV Super2, a couple of which were powered by the British MidWest aero-engine. Most are Mazda 12A and 13B automobile engines, converted for aviation use. This is a very cost-effective alternative to certified aircraft engines, providing engines ranging from 100 to {{convert|300|hp}} at a fraction of the cost of traditional piston engines. These conversions were initially in the early 1970s. Peter Garrison, a contributing editor for &quot;Flying&quot; magazine, wrote &quot;in my opinion … the most promising engine for aviation use is the Mazda rotary.&quot;

The sailplane manufacturer Schleicher uses an Austro Engine AE50R engine in its self-launching models ASK-21 Mi, ASH-26E, ASH-25 M/Mi, ASH-30 Mi, ASH-31 Mi, ASW-22 BLE, and ASG-32 Mi.

In 2013, e-Go airplanes, based in Cambridge, United Kingdom, announced that a rotary engine from Rotron Power will power its new single-seater canard aircraft.

The DA36 E-Star, an aircraft designed by Siemens, Diamond Aircraft and EADS, employs a series hybrid powertrain with the propeller being turned by a Siemens {{convert|70|kW|abbr=on}} electric motor. The aim is to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25%. An onboard {{convert|40|hp|abbr=on}} Austro Engine engine and generator provide the electricity. A propeller speed reduction unit is eliminated. The electric motor uses electricity stored in batteries, with the generator engine off, to take off and climb reducing sound emissions. The series-hybrid powertrain using the Wankel engine reduces the plane&#x27;s weight by 100 kg relative to its predecessor. The DA36 E-Star first flew in June 2013, making this the first-ever flight of a series-hybrid powertrain. Diamond Aircraft claims that rotary engine technology is scalable to a 100-seat aircraft.

===Trains===
Since 2015, a total of 60 trains in Germany have been equipped with Wankel-engined auxiliary power systems that burn diesel fuel. The locomotives use the WST KKM 351 Wankel diesel fuel engine.

===Other uses===
The Wankel engine is well-suited for devices in which a human operator is close to the engine, e.g., hand-held devices such as chainsaws. The excellent starting behavior and low mass make the Wankel engine also a good powerplant for portable fire pumps and portable power generators.

Small Wankel engines are being found in applications such as go-karts, personal watercraft, and auxiliary power units for aircraft. Kawasaki patented mixture-cooled rotary engine (US patent 3991722). Japanese diesel engine manufacturer Yanmar and Dolmar-Sachs of Germany had a rotary-engined chain saw (SAE paper 760642) and outboard boat engines, and the French Outils Wolf, made a lawnmower (Rotondor) powered by a Wankel rotary engine. The rotor was in a horizontal position to save on production costs, and there were no seals on the downside.

The simplicity of the rotary engine makes it well-suited for mini, micro, and micro-mini engine designs. The Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) Rotary Engine Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, formerly researched developing rotary engines down to 1 mm in diameter, with displacements less than 0.1 cc. Materials include silicon, and motive power includes compressed air. The goal of such research was to eventually develop an internal combustion engine with the ability to deliver 100 milliwatts of electrical power, with the engine serving as the rotor of the electric generator, with magnets built into the engine rotor. Development of the miniature rotary engine stopped at UC Berkeley at the end of the DARPA contract.

In 1976, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; reported that Ingersoll-Rand would develop a Wankel engine with a chamber volume Vk of {{cvt|25|dm3|in3|-2|order=flip}} with a rated power of {{cvt|500|hp|kW|0}} per rotor. Eventually, 13 units of the proposed engine were built, albeit with a larger displacement, and covered over 90,000 operating hours combined. The engine was made with a chamber volume Vk of {{cvt|2500|in3|dm3|0}}, and a power output of {{cvt|550|hp|kW|0}} per rotor. Both single, and twin-rotor engines were made (producing {{cvt|550|hp|kW|0}} or {{cvt|1100|hp|kW|0}} respectively). The engines ran on natural gas and had a relatively low engine speed due to its application.

Deere &amp; Company acquired the Curtiss-Wright rotary division in February 1984, making large multi-fuel prototypes, some with an 11-liter rotor for large vehicles. The developers attempted to use a stratified charge concept. The technology was transferred to RPI in 1991.

Yanmar of Japan produced small, charge-cooled rotary engines for chainsaws and outboard engines. One of its products is the LDR (rotor recess in the leading edge of the combustion chamber) engine, which has better exhaust emissions profiles, and reed-valve controlled intake ports, which improve part-load and low rpm performance.

In 1971 and 1972, Arctic Cat produced snowmobiles powered by Sachs KM 914 303-cc and KC-24 294-cc Wankel engines made in Germany.

In the early 1970s, Outboard Marine Corporation sold snowmobiles under the Johnson and other brands, which were powered by {{convert|35|or|45|hp|abbr=on}} OMC engines.

Aixro of Germany produces and sells a go-kart engine with a 294-cc-chamber charge-cooled rotor and liquid-cooled housings. Other makers include Wankel AG, Cubewano, Rotron, and Precision Technology.

===Non-internal combustion===
In addition to applications as an internal combustion engine, the basic Wankel design has also been used for gas compressors, and superchargers for internal combustion engines, but in these cases, although the design still offers advantages in reliability, the primary advantages of the Wankel in size and weight over the four-stroke internal combustion engine are irrelevant. In a design using a Wankel supercharger on a Wankel engine, the supercharger is twice the size of the engine.

The Wankel design is used in the seat belt pre-tensioner system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars. When the deceleration sensors detect a potential crash, small explosive cartridges are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds into tiny Wankel engines, which rotate to take up the slack in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers firmly in the seat before a collision.

<text>White Dwarf is a magazine published by British games manufacturer Games Workshop, which has long served as a promotions and advertising platform for Games Workshop and Citadel Miniatures products.

During the first ten years of its publication, it covered a wide variety of fantasy and science-fiction role-playing games (RPGs) and board games, particularly the role-playing games &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;), &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and &quot;Traveller&quot;. 

These games were all published by other games companies and distributed in the United Kingdom by Games Workshop stores. The magazine underwent a major change in style and content in the late 1980s. It is now dedicated exclusively to the miniature wargames produced by Games Workshop.

== History ==

=== 1970s ===
Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone initially produced a newsletter called &quot;Owl and Weasel&quot;, which ran for twenty-five issues from February 1975 before it evolved into &quot;White Dwarf&quot;.

Originally scheduled for May/June 1977, &quot;White Dwarf&quot; was first published one month later. According to Shannon Appelcline, &quot;Issue #1 ... was a 20-page magazine printed on glossy stock with a two-color cover.&quot; The magazine had a bimonthly schedule, with an initial (and speculative) print run of 4,000. &quot;White Dwarf&quot; continued the fantasy and science fiction role-playing and board-gaming theme developed in &quot;Owl and Weasel&quot;. Due to the increase in available space, there was an opportunity to produce reviews, articles and scenarios to a greater depth than had been possible in &quot;Owl and Weasel&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
During the early 1980s the magazine focused mainly on the &quot;big three&quot; role-playing games of the time: &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and &quot;Traveller&quot;.

In addition to this a generation of writers passed through its offices and onto other RPG projects in the next decade, such as Phil Masters and Marcus L. Rowland. The magazine included mini-game scenarios, capable of completion in a single night&#x27;s play, rather than the long games typical of the off-the-shelf campaigns. This would often be in the form of a single task for either existing or new characters to resolve. These could either be added to existing campaign plots, or be used stand-alone, just for an evening, and were easily grasped by those familiar with RPG rules.

During this period the magazine included many features such as the satirical comic strip &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; and Dave Langford&#x27;s &quot;Critical Mass&quot; book review column, as well as a comical advertising series &quot;The Androx Diaries&quot;, and always had cameos and full scenarios for a broad selection of the most popular games of the time, as well as a more rough and informal editorial style.

In the mid-late 1980s, however, there was a repositioning from being a general periodical covering all aspects and publishers within the hobby niche to a focus almost exclusively on Games Workshop&#x27;s own products and publications. The last &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; article appeared in issue 93, with the changeover being complete by issue #102. In this respect it took over some of the aspects of the &quot;Citadel Journal&quot;, an intermittent publication that supported the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; game. The magazine has always been a conduit for new rules and ideas for GW games as well as a means to showcase developments. It often includes scenarios, campaigns, hobby news, photos of recently released miniatures and tips on building terrain and constructing or converting miniatures.

Grombrindal the White Dwarf is also a special character for the &quot;Warhammer&quot; Dwarf army, whose rules are published only in certain issues of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (being revamped for the most recent edition of the rules). It is never stated who exactly the White Dwarf is, but it is implied that he is the spirit of Snorri Whitebeard, the last king of the Dwarfs to receive respect from an Elf. The image of the White Dwarf has graced the cover of many issues of the magazine. The image was also used on the character sheet for the Dwarf character in &quot;HeroQuest&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
In December 2004, &quot;White Dwarf&quot; published its 300th issue in the United Kingdom and North America. Each issue contained many special &quot;freebies&quot; as well as articles on the history of the magazine and the founding of Games Workshop.

The monthly battle reports are a regular feature. Battle reports detail a battle between two or more forces, usually with their own specific victory conditions. The reports follow the gamers through their army selection, tactics and deployment, through the battle to their respective conclusions. The format varies, ranging from a simplified, generalized style to a more detailed and visual style.

The page count of the US and UK publications was substantially different (for example, bearing in mind the US/UK numbering difference: issue US #319, 156 pages; UK #320, 132 pages) with substantial differences in actual amount of content (for example in the same issues: US, 114 pages; UK, 71 pages) and each magazine had substantial overlap with the other as well as unique articles.

=== 2010s ===
In June 2010 Andrew Kenrick replaced Mark Latham as editor. Kenrick had previously been sub-editor, as well as editing other Games Workshop material such as the most recent edition of &quot;Codex: Space Marines&quot;.

As of the October 2012 issue, &quot;White Dwarf&quot; was redesigned with a new nine-member production staff with Matthew Hutson, Kris Shield and Andrew Kenrick continuing from the previous version, and six new members, including Jes Bickham as the new editor. Bickham had previously edited the &quot;Battle Games in Middle-earth&quot; magazine.

&quot;White Dwarf&quot; continued to be published on a monthly basis until issue #409, January 2014. On 1 February 2014, the magazine moved to a 32-page format, published weekly and renumbered from issue 1. &quot;Warhammer Visions&quot;, a monthly sister title, was launched at the same time, in a format favouring the imagery over text. The weekly version of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; lasted for 131 issues and in September 2016 the magazine returned to its monthly format, also subsuming &quot;Warhammer Visions&quot;.

<text>The bhavachakra (Sanskrit: भवचक्र; Pāli: &quot;bhavacakka&quot;; Tibetan: སྲིད་པའི་འཁོར་ལོ, Wylie: &quot;srid pa&#x27;i &#x27;khor lo&quot;) or wheel of life is a visual teaching aid and meditation tool symbolically representing saṃsāra (or cyclic existence). It is found on the walls of Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help both Buddhists and non Buddhists understand the core Buddhist teachings. The image consists of four concentric circles, held by Yama, the lord of Death, with an image of the Buddha pointing to the moon metaphorically representing the possibility for liberation from the suffering of reincarnation.

==Etymology==
&quot;Bhavachakra&quot;, &quot;wheel of life,&quot; consists of the words &quot;bhava&quot; and &quot;chakra&quot;.

&quot;bhava&quot; () means &quot;being, worldly existence, becoming, birth, being, production, origin&quot;.

In Buddhism, &quot;bhava&quot; denotes the continuity of becoming (reincarnating) in one of the realms of existence, in the samsaric context of rebirth, life and the maturation arising therefrom. It is the tenth of the Twelve Nidanas, in its &quot;Pratītyasamutpāda&quot; doctrine.

The word &quot;Chakra&quot; () derives from the Sanskrit word meaning &quot;wheel,&quot; as well as &quot;circle&quot; and &quot;cycle&quot;.

# The term chakra is also used to denote yantras (mystic diagrams), variously known as &#x27;, &#x27;, etc.
# Chakras are also part of the subtle body as taught by Tibetan Buddhism.

Legend has it that the historical Buddha himself created the first depiction of the bhavachakra, and the story of how he gave the illustration to King Rudrāyaṇa appears in the anthology of Buddhist narratives called the &quot;Divyāvadāna&quot;. &quot;Sahasodgata-avadāna&quot;, in the opening paragraphs of the work, describes the Buddha&#x27;s instructions for creating the bhavachakra.

==Explanation of the diagram==
The &quot;bhavachakra&quot; is painted on the outside walls of nearly every Tibetan Buddhist temple in Tibet and India, to instruct non-monastic audience about the Buddhist teachings.

===Elements of the &quot;bhavachakra&quot;===

The &quot;bhavachakra&quot; consists of the following elements: 
# The pig, rooster and snake in the hub of the wheel represent the three poisons of ignorance, attachment and aversion.
# The second layer represents karma, with one half showing a person reaping the results of negative actions whilst the other half shows a person reaping the results of positive actions.
# The third layer represents samsara and its Six Paths.
# The fourth layer represents the twelve links of dependent origination.
# The fierce figure holding the wheel represents impermanence. It is also Yama, the god of death.
# The moon above the wheel represents liberation from samsara or cyclic existence.
# The Buddha pointing to the white circle indicates that liberation is possible.

Symbolically, the three inner circles, moving from the center outward, show that the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion give rise to positive and negative actions; these actions and their results are called karma. Karma in turn gives rise to the six realms, which represent the different types of suffering within samsara.

The fourth and outer layer of the wheel symbolizes the twelve links of dependent origination; these links indicate &quot;how&quot; the sources of suffering that the three poisons and karma produce live within cyclic existence.

The fierce being holding the wheel represents impermanence; this symbolizes that the entire process of samsara or cyclic existence is impermanent, transient, constantly changing. The moon above the wheel indicates liberation. The Buddha is pointing to the moon, indicating that liberation from samsara is possible.

===Hub: the three poisons===
In the hub of the wheel are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They represent the three poisons of ignorance, aversion, and attachment, respectively. The pig stands for ignorance; this comparison is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is because it will be aroused and strike at the slightest touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as &quot;desire&quot; or &quot;clinging&quot;). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavachakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.

In many drawings of the wheel, the snake and bird are shown as coming out of the mouth of the pig, indicating that aversion and attachment arise from ignorance. The snake and bird are also shown grasping the tail of the pig, indicating that they in turn promote greater ignorance.

Under the influence of the three poisons, beings create karma, as shown in the next layer of the circle.

===Second layer: karma===
The second layer of the wheel shows two-half circles:
* One half-circle (usually light) shows contented people moving upwards to higher states, possibly to the higher realms.
* The other half-circle (usually dark) shows people in a miserable state being led downwards to lower states, possibly to the lower realms.

These images represent karma, the law of cause and effect. The light half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of positive actions. The dark half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of negative actions.

Ringu Tulku states:
:We create karma in three different ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we experience will accord with the quality of our actions.

Propelled by their karma, beings take rebirth in the six realms of samsara, as shown in the next layer of the circle.

===Third layer: the six realms of samsara===
The third layer of the wheel is divided into six sections that represent the six realms of samsara, or cyclic existence, the process of cycling through one rebirth after another. These six realms are divided into three higher realms and three lower realms. The wheel can also be represented as having five realms, combining the God realm and the Demi-god realm into a single realm.

The three higher realms are shown in the top half of the circle:
* God realm (Deva): Also known as six heavens in desire worlds. The gods &amp; goddesses lead long and enjoyable lives full of pleasure and abundance, but they spend their lives pursuing meaningless distractions and never think to practice the dharma. When death comes to them, they are completely unprepared; without realizing it, they have completely exhausted their good karma (which was the cause for being reborn in the god realm) and they suffer through being reborn in the lower realms.
* Demi-god realm (Asura): the demi-gods have pleasure and abundance almost as much as the gods, but they spend their time fighting among themselves or making war on the gods. When they make war on the gods, they always lose, since the gods are much more powerful. The demi-gods suffer from constant fighting and jealousy, and from being killed and wounded in their wars with each other and with the gods.
* Human realm (Manuṣya): humans suffer from hunger, thirst, heat, cold, separation from friends, being attacked by enemies, not getting what they want, and getting what they do not want. They also suffer from the general sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death. Yet the human realm is considered to be the most suitable realm for practicing the dharma, because humans are not completely distracted by pleasure (like the gods or demi-gods) or by pain and suffering (like the beings in the lower realms). There are four human realms in existence, including Jambudvīpa, Pūrvavideha, Uttarakuru and Aparagodānīya.

The three lower realms are shown in the bottom half of the circle:
* Animal realm (Tiryagyoni): wild animals suffer from being attacked and eaten by other animals; they generally lead lives of constant fear. Domestic animals suffer from being exploited by humans; for example, they are slaughtered for food, overworked, and so on.
* Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts suffer from extreme hunger and thirst. They wander constantly in search of food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but by the time they get there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.
* Hell realm (Naraka): hell beings endure unimaginable suffering for eons of time. In Buddhist cosmology there are eighteen different types of hells, each inflicting a different kind of torment. In the hot hells, beings suffer from unbearable heat and continual torments of various kinds. In the cold hells, beings suffer from unbearable cold and other torments.

Among the six realms, the human realm is considered to offer the best opportunity to practice the dharma. In some representations of the wheel, there is a buddha or bodhisattva depicted within each realm, trying to help sentient beings find their way to nirvana.

===Outer rim: the twelve links===

The outer rim of the wheel is divided into twelve sections that represent the Twelve Nidānas. As previously stated, the three inner layers of the wheel show that the three poisons lead to karma, which leads to the suffering of the six realms. The twelve links of the outer rim show &quot;how&quot; this happens—by presenting the process of cause and effect in detail.

These twelve links can be understood to operate on an outer or inner level. 
* On the outer level, the twelve links can be seen to operate over several lifetimes; in this case, these links show how our past lives influence our current lifetime, and how our actions in this lifetime influence our future lifetimes.
* On the inner level, the twelve links can be understood to operate in every moment of existence in an interdependent manner. On this level, the twelve links can be applied to show the effects of one particular action.

By contemplating on the twelve links, one gains greater insight into the workings of karma; this insight enables us to begin to unravel our habitual way of thinking and reacting.

The twelve causal links, paired with their corresponding symbols, are: 
# Avidyā &quot;lack of knowledge&quot;&quot;a blind person, often walking, or a person peering out&quot;
# Saṃskāra &quot;constructive volitional activity&quot;&quot;a potter shaping a vessel or vessels&quot;
# Vijñāna &quot;consciousness&quot;&quot;a man or a monkey grasping a fruit&quot;
# Nāmarūpa &quot;name and form&quot; (constituent elements of mental and physical existence)&quot;two men afloat in a boat&quot;
# Ṣaḍāyatana &quot;six senses&quot; (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind)&quot;a dwelling with six windows&quot;
# Sparśa &quot;contact (of objects with the senses)&quot;&quot;lovers consorting, kissing, or entwined&quot;
# Vedanā &quot;feeling&quot;&quot;an arrow to the eye&quot;
# Tṛṣṇa &quot;craving or thirst&quot;&quot;a drinker receiving drink&quot;
# Upādāna &quot;grasping or attachment&quot;&quot;a man or a monkey picking fruit&quot;
# Bhava &quot;coming to be&quot;&quot;a couple engaged in intercourse, a standing, leaping, or reflective person&quot;
# Jāti &quot;being born&quot;&quot;woman giving birth&quot;
# Jarāmaraṇa &quot;old age and death&quot;&quot;corpse being carried&quot;

===The figure holding the wheel: impermanence===
The wheel is being held by a fearsome figure who represents impermanence.

This figure is often interpreted as being Mara, the demon who tried to tempt the Buddha, or as Yama, the lord of death. Regardless of the figure depicted, the inner meaning remains the same–that the entire process of cyclic existence (samsara) is transient; everything within this wheel is constantly changing.

Yama has the following attributes:
* He wears a crown of five skulls that symbolize the impermanence of the five aggregates. (The skulls are also said to symbolize the five poisons.)
* He has a third eye that symbolizes the wisdom of understanding impermanence.
* He is sometimes shown adorned with a tiger skin, which symbolizes fearfulness. (The tiger skin is typically seen hanging beneath the wheel.)
* His four limbs (that are clutching the wheel) symbolize the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death.

===The moon: liberation===
Above the wheel is an image of the moon; the moon represents liberation from the sufferings of samsara. Some drawings may show an image of a &quot;pure land&quot; to indicate liberation, rather than a moon.

===The Buddha pointing to the white circle: the path to liberation===
The upper part of the drawing also shows an image of the Buddha pointing toward the moon; this represents the path to liberation. While in Theravada Buddhism this is the Noble Eightfold Path, in Mahayana Buddhism this is the Bodhisattva path, striving to liberation for all sentient beings. In Tibetan Buddhism, this is Lamrim, which details all the stages on the path, while Zen has its own complicated history of the entanglement of meditation practice and direct insight.

===Inscription===
Drawings of the Bhavachakra usually contain an inscription consisting of a few lines of text that explain the process that keeps people in samsara and how to reverse that process.

==Alternative interpretations==

===Theravada===
The Theravada-tradition does not have a graphical representation of the round of rebirths, but cakra-symbolism is an elementary component of Buddhism, and Buddhaghosa&#x27;s &quot;Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga)&quot; contains such imagery:
===Western psychological interpretation===
Some western interpreters take a psychological point of view, explaining that different karmic actions contribute to one&#x27;s metaphorical existence in different realms, or rather, different actions reinforce personal characteristics described by the realms. According to Mark Epstein, &quot;each realm becomes not so much a specific place but rather a metaphor for a different psychological state, with the entire wheel becoming a representation of neurotic suffering.&quot;

<doc id="33306" wikidata="Q283" url="?curid=33306" title="Water">
<text>Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. It is the main constituent of Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, , indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°. In liquid form, is also called &quot;water&quot; at standard temperature and pressure.

Because Earth&#x27;s environment is relatively close to water&#x27;s triple point, water exists on Earth as a solid, a liquid, and a gas. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.

Water covers about 71% of the Earth&#x27;s surface, with seas and oceans making up most of the water volume (about 96.5%). Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%). Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.

Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the fresh water used by humans goes to agriculture. Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world, providing 6.5% of global protein. Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances, both mineral and organic; as such, it is widely used in industrial processes and in cooking and washing. Water, ice, and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating, snowboarding, and skiing.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;water&quot; comes from Old English , from Proto-Germanic (source also of Old Saxon , Old Frisian , Dutch , Old High German , German , , Gothic ()), from Proto-Indo-European , suffixed form of root (; ). Also cognate, through the Indo-European root, with Greek (; from Ancient Greek (), whence English ), Russian (), Irish , and Albanian .

==History==

===On Earth===
==Properties==

Water () is a polar inorganic compound. At room temperature it is a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue. The simplest hydrogen chalcogenide, it is by far the most studied chemical compound and is sometimes described as the &quot;universal solvent&quot; for its ability to dissolve more substances than any other liquid, though it is poor at dissolving nonpolar substances. This allows it to be the &quot;solvent of life&quot;: indeed, water as found in nature almost always includes various dissolved substances, and special steps are required to obtain chemically pure water. Water is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas in normal terrestrial conditions.

===States===

Along with &quot;oxidane&quot;, &quot;water&quot; is one of the two official names for the chemical compound ; it is also the liquid phase of . The other two common states of matter of water are the solid phase, ice, and the gaseous phase, water vapor or steam. The addition or removal of heat can cause phase transitions: freezing (water to ice), melting (ice to water), vaporization (water to vapor), condensation (vapor to water), sublimation (ice to vapor) and deposition (vapor to ice).

==== Density ====

Water is one of only a few common naturally occurring substances which, for some temperature ranges, become less dense as they cool, and the only known naturally occurring substance which does so while liquid. In addition it is unusual as it becomes significantly less dense as it freezes, though it is not unique in that respect.

At 1 atm pressure, it reaches its maximum density of at . 

Below that temperature, but above the freezing point of , it expands becoming less dense until it reaches freezing point, reaching a density in its liquid phase of .

Once it freezes and becomes ice, it expands by about 9%, with a density of . This expansion can exert enormous pressure, bursting pipes and cracking rocks. As a solid, it displays the usual behavior of contracting and becoming more dense as it cools. These unusual thermal properties have important consequences for life on earth. 

In a lake or ocean, water at sinks to the bottom, and ice forms on the surface, floating on the liquid water. This ice insulates the water below, preventing it from freezing solid. Without this protection, most aquatic organisms residing in lakes would perish during the winter. In addition, this anomalous behavior is an important part of the thermohaline circulation which distributes heat around the planet&#x27;s oceans.

==== Magnetism ====
Water is a diamagnetic material. Though interaction is weak, with superconducting magnets it can attain a notable interaction.

==== Phase transitions ====
At a pressure of one atmosphere (atm), ice melts or water freezes (solidifies) at and water boils or vapor condenses at . However, even below the boiling point, water can change to vapor at its surface by evaporation (vaporization throughout the liquid is known as boiling). Sublimation and deposition also occur on surfaces. For example, frost is deposited on cold surfaces while snowflakes form by deposition on an aerosol particle or ice nucleus. In the process of freeze-drying, a food is frozen and then stored at low pressure so the ice on its surface sublimates.

The melting and boiling points depend on pressure. A good approximation for the rate of change of the melting temperature with pressure is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation:

formula_1

where formula_2 and formula_3 are the molar volumes of the liquid and solid phases, and formula_4 is the molar latent heat of melting. In most substances, the volume increases when melting occurs, so the melting temperature increases with pressure. However, because ice is less dense than water, the melting temperature decreases. In glaciers, pressure melting can occur under sufficiently thick volumes of ice, resulting in subglacial lakes.

The Clausius-Clapeyron relation also applies to the boiling point, but with the liquid/gas transition the vapor phase has a much lower density than the liquid phase, so the boiling point increases with pressure. Water can remain in a liquid state at high temperatures in the deep ocean or underground. For example, temperatures exceed in Old Faithful, a geyser in Yellowstone National Park. In hydrothermal vents, the temperature can exceed .

At sea level, the boiling point of water is . As atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the boiling point decreases by 1 °C every 274 meters. High-altitude cooking takes longer than sea-level cooking. For example, at , cooking time must be increased by a fourth to achieve the desired result. Conversely, a pressure cooker can be used to decrease cooking times by raising the boiling temperature. In a vacuum, water will boil at room temperature.

==== Triple and critical points ====

On a pressure/temperature phase diagram (see figure), there are curves separating solid from vapor, vapor from liquid, and liquid from solid. These meet at a single point called the triple point, where all three phases can coexist. The triple point is at a temperature of and a pressure of ; it is the lowest pressure at which liquid water can exist. Until 2019, the triple point was used to define the Kelvin temperature scale.

The water/vapor phase curve terminates at and . This is known as the critical point. At higher temperatures and pressures the liquid and vapor phases form a continuous phase called a supercritical fluid. It can be gradually compressed or expanded between gas-like and liquid-like densities; its properties (which are quite different from those of ambient water) are sensitive to density. For example, for suitable pressures and temperatures it can mix freely with nonpolar compounds, including most organic compounds. This makes it useful in a variety of applications including high-temperature electrochemistry and as an ecologically benign solvent or catalyst in chemical reactions involving organic compounds. In Earth&#x27;s mantle, it acts as a solvent during mineral formation, dissolution and deposition.

==== Phases of ice and water ====

The normal form of ice on the surface of Earth is ice Ih, a phase that forms crystals with hexagonal symmetry. Another with cubic crystalline symmetry, ice Ic, can occur in the upper atmosphere. As the pressure increases, ice forms other crystal structures. As of 2024, twenty have been experimentally confirmed and several more are predicted theoretically. The eighteenth form of ice, ice XVIII, a face-centred-cubic, superionic ice phase, was discovered when a droplet of water was subject to a shock wave that raised the water&#x27;s pressure to millions of atmospheres and its temperature to thousands of degrees, resulting in a structure of rigid oxygen atoms in which hydrogen atoms flowed freely. When sandwiched between layers of graphene, ice forms a square lattice.

The details of the chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that its unusual behavior is due to the existence of two liquid states.

===Taste and odor===
Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths, and frogs are known to be able to smell it. However, water from ordinary sources (including mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water in order to avoid water that is too salty or putrid.

===Color and appearance===
Pure water is visibly blue due to absorption of light in the region c. 600–800 nm. The color can be easily observed in a glass of tap-water placed against a pure white background, in daylight. The principal absorption bands responsible for the color are overtones of the O–H stretching vibrations. The apparent intensity of the color increases with the depth of the water column, following Beer&#x27;s law. This also applies, for example, with a swimming pool when the light source is sunlight reflected from the pool&#x27;s white tiles.

In nature, the color may also be modified from blue to green due to the presence of suspended solids or algae.

In industry, near-infrared spectroscopy is used with aqueous solutions as the greater intensity of the lower overtones of water means that glass cuvettes with short path-length may be employed. To observe the fundamental stretching absorption spectrum of water or of an aqueous solution in the region around 3,500 cm (2.85 μm) a path length of about 25 μm is needed. Also, the cuvette must be both transparent around 3500 cm and insoluble in water; calcium fluoride is one material that is in common use for the cuvette windows with aqueous solutions.

The Raman-active fundamental vibrations may be observed with, for example, a 1 cm sample cell.

Aquatic plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep, because sunlight can reach them.
Practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below of depth.

The refractive index of liquid water (1.333 at ) is much higher than that of air (1.0), similar to those of alkanes and ethanol, but lower than those of glycerol (1.473), benzene (1.501), carbon disulfide (1.627), and common types of glass (1.4 to 1.6). The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.

=== Molecular polarity ===

In a water molecule, the hydrogen atoms form a 104.5° angle with the oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms are close to two corners of a tetrahedron centered on the oxygen. At the other two corners are &quot;lone pairs&quot; of valence electrons that do not participate in the bonding. In a perfect tetrahedron, the atoms would form a 109.5° angle, but the repulsion between the lone pairs is greater than the repulsion between the hydrogen atoms. The O–H bond length is about 0.096 nm.

Other substances have a tetrahedral molecular structure, for example methane () and hydrogen sulfide (). However, oxygen is more electronegative than most other elements, so the oxygen atom has a negative partial charge while the hydrogen atoms are partially positively charged. Along with the bent structure, this gives the molecule an electrical dipole moment and it is classified as a polar molecule.

Water is a good polar solvent, dissolving many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as ethanol. Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide—the latter giving the fizz of carbonated beverages, sparkling wines and beers. In addition, many substances in living organisms, such as proteins, DNA and polysaccharides, are dissolved in water. The interactions between water and the subunits of these biomacromolecules shape protein folding, DNA base pairing, and other phenomena crucial to life (hydrophobic effect).

Many organic substances (such as fats and oils and alkanes) are hydrophobic, that is, insoluble in water. Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal oxides, sulfides, and silicates.

===Hydrogen bonding===

Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules. Hydrogen bonds are about ten times as strong as the Van der Waals force that attracts molecules to each other in most liquids. This is the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide. They also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 4.2 J/(g·K)), heat of fusion (about 333 J/g), heat of vaporization (), and thermal conductivity (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/(m·K)). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth&#x27;s climate, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere. The hydrogen bonds of water are around 23 kJ/mol (compared to a covalent O-H bond at 492 kJ/mol). Of this, it is estimated that 90% is attributable to electrostatics, while the remaining 10% is partially covalent.

These bonds are the cause of water&#x27;s high surface tension and capillary forces. The capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity. This property is relied upon by all vascular plants, such as trees.

===Self-ionization===
Water is a weak solution of hydronium hydroxide—there is an equilibrium , in combination with solvation of the resulting hydronium and hydroxide ions.

===Electrical conductivity and electrolysis===
Pure water has a low electrical conductivity, which increases with the dissolution of a small amount of ionic material such as common salt.

Liquid water can be split into the elements hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it—a process called electrolysis. The decomposition requires more energy input than the heat released by the inverse process (285.8 kJ/mol, or 15.9 MJ/kg).

===Mechanical properties===
Liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes: its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to in ordinary conditions. Even in oceans at 4 km depth, where the pressure is 400 atm, water suffers only a 1.8% decrease in volume.

The viscosity of water is about 10 Pa·s or 0.01 poise at , and the speed of sound in liquid water ranges between depending on temperature. Sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation, especially at low frequencies (roughly 0.03 dB/km for 1 kHz), a property that is exploited by cetaceans and humans for communication and environment sensing (sonar).

===Reactivity===
Metallic elements which are more electropositive than hydrogen, particularly the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium and cesium displace hydrogen from water, forming hydroxides and releasing hydrogen. At high temperatures, carbon reacts with steam to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

==On Earth==

Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is hydrography. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, of glaciers is glaciology, of inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography. Ecological processes with hydrology are in the focus of ecohydrology.

The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the hydrosphere. Earth&#x27;s approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is .

Liquid water is found in bodies of water, such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, canal, pond, or puddle. The majority of water on Earth is seawater. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in aquifers.

Water is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most rocks, and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of faulting. Water in the mantle is responsible for the melt that produces volcanoes at subduction zones. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical weathering processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of sediment transport that occurs on the surface of the earth. Deposition of transported sediment forms many types of sedimentary rocks, which make up the geologic record of Earth history.

===Water cycle===

The water cycle (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) is the continuous exchange of water within the hydrosphere, between the atmosphere, soil water, surface water, groundwater, and plants.

Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the &quot;water cycle&quot; consisting of the following transfer processes:
* evaporation from oceans and other water bodies into the air and transpiration from land plants and animals into the air.
* precipitation, from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to the earth or ocean.
* runoff from the land usually reaching the sea.
Most water vapors found mostly in the ocean returns to it, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47 Tt per year while evaporation and transpiration happening in land masses also contribute another 72 Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and hail, with some contribution from fog and dew. Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface. Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth&#x27;s surface starts to increase. Condensed water in the air may also refract sunlight to produce rainbows.

Water runoff often collects over watersheds flowing into rivers. Through erosion, runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water which occurs when a river overflows its banks or a storm surge happens. On the other hand, drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation either due to its topography or due to its location in terms of latitude.

===Water resources===

Water resources are natural resources of water that are potentially useful for humans, for example as a source of drinking water supply or irrigation water. Water occurs as both &quot;stocks&quot; and &quot;flows&quot;. Water can be stored as lakes, water vapor, groundwater or aquifers, and ice and snow. Of the total volume of global freshwater, an estimated 69 percent is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover; 30 percent is in groundwater; and the remaining 1 percent in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere, and biota. The length of time water remains in storage is highly variable: some aquifers consist of water stored over thousands of years but lake volumes may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, decreasing during dry periods and increasing during wet ones. A substantial fraction of the water supply for some regions consists of water extracted from water stored in stocks, and when withdrawals exceed recharge, stocks decrease. By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of total water used for irrigation comes from unsustainable withdrawals of groundwater, causing groundwater depletion.

===Seawater and tides===

Seawater contains about 3.5% sodium chloride on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of seawater differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about ) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the Baltic Sea to 4.0% in the Red Sea. (The Dead Sea, known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30 and 40%, is really a salt lake.)

Tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the effects of Earth rotation and the local bathymetry. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the intertidal zone, is an important ecological product of ocean tides.
==Effects on life==
From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body&#x27;s solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides, and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.

Water is fundamental to both photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun&#x27;s energy to split off water&#x27;s hydrogen from oxygen. In the presence of sunlight, hydrogen is combined with (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun&#x27;s energy and reform water and in the process (cellular respiration).

Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion () to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7 in an ideal state. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7.

===Aquatic life forms===

Earth&#x27;s surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as amphibians, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton is generally the foundation of the ocean food chain.

Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see insect and mollusc siphons) and gills (&quot;Carcinus&quot;). However, as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.

==Effects on human civilization==

Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; Mesopotamia, one of the so-called cradles of civilization, was situated between the major rivers Tigris and Euphrates; the ancient society of the Egyptians depended entirely upon the Nile. The early Indus Valley civilization () developed along the Indus River and tributaries that flowed out of the Himalayas. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river Tiber. Large metropolises like Rotterdam, London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.

===Health and pollution===

Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation, or by a range of other methods. More than 660 million people do not have access to safe drinking water.

Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful to humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called safe water, or &quot;safe for bathing&quot;. Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet light.

Water reclamation is the process of converting wastewater (most commonly sewage, also called municipal wastewater) into water that can be reused for other purposes. There are 2.3 billion people who reside in nations with water scarcities, which means that each individual receives less than of water annually. of municipal wastewater are produced globally each year.

Freshwater is a renewable resource, recirculated by the natural hydrologic cycle, but pressures over access to it result from the naturally uneven distribution in space and time, growing economic demands by agriculture and industry, and rising populations. Currently, nearly a billion people around the world lack access to safe, affordable water. In 2000, the United Nations established the Millennium Development Goals for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and sanitation. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the Sustainable Development Goals of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that safe water could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from diarrhea each year.

In developing countries, 90% of all municipal wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams. Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world&#x27;s population, also suffer from medium or high water scarcity and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles. The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.

===Human uses===

====Agriculture====
The most substantial human use of water is for agriculture, including irrigated agriculture, which accounts for as much as 80 to 90 percent of total human water consumption. In the United States, 42% of freshwater withdrawn for use is for irrigation, but the vast majority of water &quot;consumed&quot; (used and not returned to the environment) goes to agriculture.

Access to fresh water is often taken for granted, especially in developed countries that have built sophisticated water systems for collecting, purifying, and delivering water, and removing wastewater. But growing economic, demographic, and climatic pressures are increasing concerns about water issues, leading to increasing competition for fixed water resources, giving rise to the concept of peak water. As populations and economies continue to grow, consumption of water-thirsty meat expands, and new demands rise for biofuels or new water-intensive industries, new water challenges are likely.

An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population. It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world&#x27;s people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of physical water scarcity, where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity, where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in the future, but that continuation of today&#x27;s food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industries and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.

Water scarcity is also caused by production of water intensive products. For example, cotton: 1 kg of cotton—equivalent of a pair of jeans—requires water to produce. While cotton accounts for 2.4% of world water use, the water is consumed in regions that are already at a risk of water shortage. Significant environmental damage has been caused: for example, the diversion of water by the former Soviet Union from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers to produce cotton was largely responsible for the disappearance of the Aral Sea.

====As a scientific standard====
On 7 April 1795, the gram was defined in France to be equal to &quot;the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one-hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice&quot;. For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the kilogram. Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water. In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at —a highly reproducible &quot;temperature&quot;—the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water &quot;density&quot;, which was measured at the time as .

The Kelvin temperature scale of the SI system was based on the triple point of water, defined as exactly , but as of May 2019 is based on the Boltzmann constant instead. The scale is an absolute temperature scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the boiling point (set to ) and melting point (set to ) of water.

Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes oxygen-18, oxygen-17, and hydrogen-2 (deuterium). The percentage of the heavier isotopes is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less heavy isotopes than seawater. Therefore, standard water is defined in the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water specification.

====For drinking====


The human body contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size. To function properly, the body requires between of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though the British Dietetic Association advises that 2.5 liters of total water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration, including 1.8 liters (6 to 7 glasses) obtained directly from beverages. Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.

Healthy kidneys can excrete 0.8 to 1 liter of water per hour, but stress such as exercise can reduce this amount. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration), which can be fatal. The popular claim that &quot;a person should consume eight glasses of water per day&quot; seems to have no real basis in science. Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to at mealtime, was associated with weight loss. Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.
An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. National Research Council read: &quot;An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.&quot; The latest dietary reference intake report by the U.S. National Research Council in general recommended, based on the median total water intake from US survey data (including food sources): for men and of water total for women, noting that water contained in food provided approximately 19% of total water intake in the survey.

Specifically, pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. The US Institute of Medicine recommends that, on average, men consume and women ; pregnant women should increase intake to and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing. Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages (caffeinated included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through urine and feces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.

Humans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead, and harmful bacteria, such as &quot;Vibrio&quot;. Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed electrolytes.

The single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is Lake Baikal in Siberia.

====Washing====
====Transportation====
====Chemical uses====
Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant and less commonly as a solute or catalyst. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as ammonia and compounds closely related to water. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is amphoteric (acidic &quot;and&quot; basic) and nucleophilic. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of Diels-Alder reactions by water has been observed. Supercritical water has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently.

====Heat exchange====
Water and steam are a common fluid used for heat exchange, due to its availability and high heat capacity, both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It is especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all thermal power stations, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed-loop between boiler, steam turbine, and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.

In the nuclear power industry, water can also be used as a neutron moderator. In most nuclear reactors, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also slows the nuclear reaction down. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.

====Fire considerations====

Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good fire extinguishing fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.

Use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a steam explosion, which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, charcoal, or coke graphite, decompose the water, producing water gas.

The power of such explosions was seen in the Chernobyl disaster, although the water involved in this case did not come from fire-fighting but from the reactor&#x27;s own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of a reaction between steam and hot zirconium.

Some metallic oxides, most notably those of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, produce so much heat in reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide quicklime, also known as calcium oxide, is a mass-produced substance that is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.

====Recreation====

Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, waterskiing, boating, surfing and diving. In addition, some sports, like ice hockey and ice skating, are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other flowing water structures are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other flora and fauna inside aquariums or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports such as skiing, sledding, snowmobiling or snowboarding, which require the water to be at a low temperature either as ice or crystallized into snow.

====Water industry====
The water industry provides drinking water and wastewater services (including sewage treatment) to households and industry. Water supply facilities include water wells, cisterns for rainwater harvesting, water supply networks, and water purification facilities, water tanks, water towers, water pipes including old aqueducts. Atmospheric water generators are in development.

Drinking water is often collected at springs, extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve the removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful microbes. Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes. Distillation does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis. Desalination of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates.

The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems, tanker delivery or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.

Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, seawater is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve freshwater resources.

Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms&#x27; profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradable.

Municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at wastewater treatment plants. Mitigation of polluted surface runoff is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques.
====Industrial applications====
Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water slurries or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as mining, chemical pulping, pulp bleaching, paper manufacturing, textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.

Water is used in power generation. Hydroelectricity is electricity obtained from hydropower. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.

Pressurized water is used in water blasting and water jet cutters. High pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.

Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the steam turbine and heat exchanger, in addition to its use as a chemical solvent. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and uses a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.

====Food processing====
Boiling, steaming, and simmering are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam. Water is also used for dishwashing. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of food science.

Solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as air pressure, which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One mole of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by , and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by ; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water&#x27;s freezing point.

Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food. Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water. Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity. Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.

Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains. Water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100 mg/L (UK) or less than 60 mg/L (US).

According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.

====Medical use====
Water for injection is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s list of essential medicines.

==Distribution in nature==

===In the universe===
Much of the universe&#x27;s water is produced as a byproduct of star formation. The formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas.

On 22 July 2011, a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing &quot;140 trillion times more water than all of Earth&#x27;s oceans combined&quot; around a quasar located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the &quot;discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence&quot;.

Water has been detected in interstellar clouds within the Milky Way. Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too, because its components, hydrogen, and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe. Based on models of the formation and evolution of the Solar System and that of other star systems, most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredients.

====Water vapor====
Water is present as vapor in:
* Atmosphere of the Sun: in detectable trace amounts
* Atmosphere of Mercury: 3.4%, and large amounts of water in Mercury&#x27;s exosphere
* Atmosphere of Venus: 0.002%
* Earth&#x27;s atmosphere: ≈0.40% over full atmosphere, typically 1–4% at surface; as well as that of the Moon in trace amounts
* Atmosphere of Mars: 0.03%
* Atmosphere of Ceres
* Atmosphere of Jupiter: 0.0004% – in ices only; and that of its moon Europa
* Atmosphere of Saturn – in ices only; Enceladus: 91% and Dione (exosphere)
* Atmosphere of Uranus – in trace amounts below 50 bar
* Atmosphere of Neptune – found in the deeper layers
* Extrasolar planet atmospheres: including those of HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b, Tau Boötis b, HAT-P-11b, XO-1b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b, and WASP-19b.
* Stellar atmospheres: not limited to cooler stars and even detected in giant hot stars such as Betelgeuse, Mu Cephei, Antares and Arcturus.
* Circumstellar disks: including those of more than half of T Tauri stars such as AA Tauri as well as TW Hydrae, IRC +10216 and APM 08279+5255, VY Canis Majoris and S Persei.

====Liquid water====
Liquid water is present on Earth, covering 71% of its surface. Liquid water is also occasionally present in small amounts on Mars. Scientists believe liquid water is present in the Saturnian moons of Enceladus, as a 10-kilometre thick ocean approximately 30–40 kilometers below Enceladus&#x27; south polar surface, and Titan, as a subsurface layer, possibly mixed with ammonia. Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa has surface characteristics which suggest a subsurface liquid water ocean. Liquid water may also exist on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede as a layer sandwiched between high pressure ice and rock.

====Water ice====
Water is present as ice on:
* Mars: under the regolith and at the poles.
* Earth–Moon system: mainly as ice sheets on Earth and in Lunar craters and volcanic rocks NASA reported the detection of water molecules by NASA&#x27;s Moon Mineralogy Mapper aboard the Indian Space Research Organization&#x27;s Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft in September 2009.
* Ceres
* Jupiter&#x27;s moons: Europa&#x27;s surface and also that of Ganymede and Callisto
* Saturn: in the planet&#x27;s ring system and on the surface and mantle of Titan and Enceladus
* Pluto–Charon system
* Comets and other related Kuiper belt and Oort cloud objects

And is also likely present on:
* Mercury&#x27;s poles
* Tethys

====Exotic forms====
Water and other volatiles probably comprise much of the internal structures of Uranus and Neptune and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of ionic water in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper still as superionic water in which the oxygen crystallizes, but the hydrogen ions float about freely within the oxygen lattice.

===Water and planetary habitability===
The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of life on Earth as we know it. The Earth is located in the habitable zone of the Solar System; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the Sun (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.

Earth&#x27;s gravity allows it to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer (greenhouse effect) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars).

The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation (insolation), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth&#x27;s temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. This proposal is known as the Gaia hypothesis.

The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet&#x27;s gravity. If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets Gliese 436 b and GJ 1214 b.

==Law, politics, and crisis==


Water politics is politics affected by water and water resources. Water, particularly fresh water, is a strategic resource across the world and an important element in many political conflicts. It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.

Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation. However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability. A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.

1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990. The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30% in 1970 to 71% in 1990, 79% in 2000, and 84% in 2004.

A 2006 United Nations report stated that &quot;there is enough water for everyone&quot;, but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption. In addition, global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery, such as the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health, potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act.

The authors of the 2007 Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply &#x27;blueprints&#x27; that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the International Water Management Institute of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia&#x27;s draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.

In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases, which are often tied to a lack of adequate sanitation.

Since 2003, the UN World Water Development Report, produced by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme, has provided decision-makers with tools for developing sustainable water policies. The 2023 report states that two billion people (26% of the population) do not have access to drinking water and 3.6 billion (46%) lack access to safely managed sanitation. People in urban areas (2.4 billion) will face water scarcity by 2050. Water scarcity has been described as endemic, due to overconsumption and pollution. The report states that 10% of the world&#x27;s population lives in countries with high or critical water stress. Yet over the past 40 years, water consumption has increased by around 1% per year, and is expected to grow at the same rate until 2050. Since 2000, flooding in the tropics has quadrupled, while flooding in northern mid-latitudes has increased by a factor of 2.5. The cost of these floods between 2000 and 2019 was 100,000 deaths and $650 million.

Organizations concerned with water protection include the International Water Association (IWA), WaterAid, Water 1st, and the American Water Resources Association. The International Water Management Institute undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty. Water related conventions are United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Ramsar Convention. World Day for Water takes place on 22 March and World Oceans Day on 8 June.

==In culture==

===Religion===


Water is considered a purifier in most religions. Faiths that incorporate ritual washing (ablution) include Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, the Rastafari movement, Shinto, Taoism, and Wicca. Immersion (or aspersion or affusion) of a person in water is a central Sacrament of Christianity (where it is called baptism); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (&quot;Ghusl&quot;), Judaism (&quot;mikvah&quot;) and Sikhism (&quot;Amrit Sanskar&quot;). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after washing certain parts of the body using clean water (&quot;wudu&quot;), unless water is unavailable (see &quot;Tayammum&quot;). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of &quot;misogi&quot;).

In Christianity, holy water is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of baptism, the blessing of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.

In Zoroastrianism, water (&quot;āb&quot;) is respected as the source of life.

===Philosophy===

The Ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles saw water as one of the four classical elements (along with fire, earth, and air), and regarded it as an ylem, or basic substance of the universe. Thales, whom Aristotle portrayed as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a monist, believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed that the shape of water is an icosahedron – flowing easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.

The theory of the four bodily humors associated water with phlegm, as being cold and moist. The classical element of water was also one of the five elements in traditional Chinese philosophy (along with earth, fire, wood, and metal).

Some traditional and popular Asian philosophical systems take water as a role-model. James Legge&#x27;s 1891 translation of the &quot;Dao De Jing&quot; states, &quot;The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao&quot; and &quot;There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed.&quot; &quot;Guanzi&quot; in the &quot;Shui di&quot; 水地 chapter further elaborates on the symbolism of water, proclaiming that &quot;man is water&quot; and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.

=== Folklore ===
&quot;Living water&quot; features in Germanic and Slavic folktales as a means of bringing the dead back to life. Note the Grimm fairy-tale (&quot;The Water of Life&quot;) and the Russian dichotomy of and . The Fountain of Youth represents a related concept of magical waters allegedly preventing aging.
===Art and activism===
In the significant modernist novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922) by Irish writer James Joyce, the chapter &quot;Ithaca&quot; takes the form of a catechism of 309 questions and answers, one of which is known as the &quot;water hymn&quot;. According to Richard E. Madtes, the hymn is not merely a &quot;monotonous string of facts&quot;, rather, its phrases, like their subject, &quot;ebb and flow, heave and swell, gather and break, until they subside into the calm quiescence of the concluding &#x27;pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.&#x27;&quot; The hymn is considered one of the most remarkable passages in Ithaca, and according to literary critic Hugh Kenner, achieves &quot;the improbable feat of raising to poetry all the clutter of footling information that has accumulated in schoolbooks.&quot; The literary motif of water represents the novel&#x27;s theme of &quot;everlasting, everchanging life,&quot; and the hymn represents the culmination of the motif in the novel. The following is the hymn quoted in full.
Painter and activist Fredericka Foster curated &quot;The Value of Water&quot;, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, which anchored a year-long initiative by the Cathedral on our dependence on water. The largest exhibition to ever appear at the Cathedral, it featured over forty artists, including Jenny Holzer, Robert Longo, Mark Rothko, William Kentridge, April Gornik, Kiki Smith, Pat Steir, Alice Dalton Brown, Teresita Fernandez and Bill Viola. Foster created Think About Water, an ecological collective of artists who use water as their subject or medium. Members include Basia Irland, Aviva Rahmani, Betsy Damon, Diane Burko, Leila Daw, Stacy Levy, Charlotte Coté, Meridel Rubenstein, and Anna Macleod.

To mark the 10th anniversary of access to water and sanitation being declared a human right by the UN, the charity WaterAid commissioned ten visual artists to show the impact of clean water on people&#x27;s lives.
===Dihydrogen monoxide parody===

&#x27;Dihydrogen monoxide&#x27; is a technically correct but rarely used chemical name of water. This name has been used in a series of hoaxes and pranks that mock scientific illiteracy. This began in 1983, when an April Fools&#x27; Day article appeared in a newspaper in Durand, Michigan. The false story consisted of safety concerns about the substance.

===Music===

The word &quot;Water&quot; has been used by many Florida based rappers as a sort of catchphrase or adlib. Rappers who have done this include BLP Kosher and Ski Mask the Slump God. To go even further some rappers have made whole songs dedicated to the water in Florida, such as the 2023 Danny Towers song &quot;Florida Water&quot;. Others have made whole songs dedicated to water as a whole, such as XXXTentacion, and Ski Mask the Slump God with their hit song &quot;H2O&quot;.

<doc id="33308" wikidata="Q209956" url="?curid=33308" title="Weezer">
<text>Weezer is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1992. Since 2001, the band has consisted of Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Patrick Wilson (drums, backing vocals), Brian Bell (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and Scott Shriner (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). They have sold 10 million albums in the United States and more than 35 million worldwide.

After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, also known as the Blue Album, in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, and &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;, the Blue Album became a multi-platinum success. Weezer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and &quot;Pinkerton&quot; are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, founding bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.

In 2001, Weezer returned with the Green Album with their new bassist, Mikey Welsh. With a more pop-oriented sound, and promoted by singles &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; and &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;, it was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left for health reasons and was replaced by Shriner. Weezer&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Maladroit&quot; (2002), incorporated a hard rock sound and achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. &quot;Make Believe&quot; (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; became Weezer&#x27;s first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and their first to reach the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2008, Weezer released the Red Album; its lead single, &quot;Pork and Beans&quot;, became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a Grammy-winning music video. &quot;Raditude&quot; (2009) and &quot;Hurley&quot; (2010) both featured more modern pop production, along with songs co-written with other artists, receiving further mixed reviews and moderate sales. &quot;Everything Will Be Alright in the End&quot; (2014) and the White Album (2016) returned to a rock style that was reminiscent of their 90s sound, mixed with modern alternative production, and achieved more positive reviews. &quot;Pacific Daydream&quot; (2017) returned to more mainstream pop sound. In 2019, Weezer released an album of covers, the Teal Album, followed by the Black Album. In 2021, they released &quot;OK Human&quot;, which featured an orchestral pop sound and received acclaim, followed by the hard rock-inspired &quot;Van Weezer&quot;. In 2022, Weezer released &quot;SZNZ&quot; (pronounced seasons), a series of EPs based on the four seasons.

==History==

===Formation and first years (1986–1994)===
Lead vocalist and guitarist Rivers Cuomo moved to Los Angeles from Mansfield, Connecticut, in 1989 with his high school metal band, Avant Garde, later renamed Zoom. After the group disbanded, Cuomo met drummer Patrick Wilson, a native of Buffalo, New York, and moved in with him and Wilson&#x27;s friend Matt Sharp. Cuomo moved away from metal and explored alternative rock influences such as Nirvana, the Pixies and Sonic Youth. He and Wilson formed a band, Fuzz, and enlisted Scottie Chapman on bass. Chapman quit after a few early shows; the band reformed as Sixty Wrong Sausages, with Cuomo&#x27;s friend Pat Finn on bass and Jason Cropper on guitar, but soon disbanded.

Cuomo moved to Santa Monica, California, and recorded dozens of demos, including the future Weezer songs &quot;The World Has Turned and Left Me Here&quot; and &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;. Sharp was enthusiastic about the demos, and became the group&#x27;s bassist and de facto manager.

Cuomo, Wilson, Sharp, and Cropper formed Weezer on February 14, 1992. Their first show was on March 19, 1992, closing for Keanu Reeves&#x27; band Dogstar. They took their name from a nickname Cuomo&#x27;s father gave him, which was based on a character called &quot;Wheezer&quot; from the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short films. Cuomo gave Sharp one year to get the band a record deal before Cuomo accepted a scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley. In November, Weezer recorded a demo, &quot;The Kitchen Tape&quot;, including a version of the future Weezer single &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;. The demo was heard by Todd Sullivan, an A&amp;R man at Geffen Records, who signed Weezer in June 1993.

===The &quot;Blue Album&quot; (1994)===


Weezer recorded their debut album with producer Ric Ocasek at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. Cropper was fired during recording, as Cuomo and Sharp felt he was threatening the band chemistry. He was replaced by Brian Bell. Weezer&#x27;s self-titled debut album&quot;,&quot; also known as the &quot;Blue Album&quot;, was released in May 1994. Described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as integrating &quot;geeky humor, dense cultural references, and positively gargantuan hooks&quot;, it combined alternative rock, power pop, polished production and what &quot;AllMusic&quot; critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called an &quot;&#x27;70s trash-rock predilection ... resulting in something quite distinctive&quot;.

Weezer&#x27;s first single, &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;, was backed by a music video directed by Spike Jonze; filmed in an unbroken take, it featured Weezer performing on a sound stage with little action, barring a pack of dogs swarming the set. The video became an instant hit on MTV. The song reached No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jonze also directed Weezer&#x27;s second video, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, splicing the band into footage from the 1970s television sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. The video achieved heavy rotation on MTV and won four MTV Video Music Awards, including Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Music Video, and two &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Awards. &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; peaked at No. 18 on the Hot 100 Airplay and No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song is included on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Best Songs Of All Time. A third single, &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;, followed. It was met with critical acclaim and later Pitchfork ranked it #10 on the top 200 tracks of the 90s list. The song reached No. 51 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and No. 7 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. Additionally, the track was included in Rolling Stone&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 100 Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;.

Their debut album gained critical and commercial success. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked it number 294 on The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time. &quot;Weezer&quot; is certified quadruple platinum in the United States as well as Canada, making it Weezer&#x27;s best-selling album.

===&quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1995–1997)===


In 1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays. Cuomo traveled to his home state of Connecticut and began recording demos for Weezer&#x27;s next album. His original concept was a space-themed rock opera, &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot;, that would express his mixed feelings about success. Cuomo conceived the story as a metaphor for his conflicted feelings about touring in a successful rock band. Weezer developed the concept through intermittent recording sessions through 1995. At the end of the year, Cuomo enrolled at Harvard University, where his songwriting became &quot;darker, more visceral and exposed, less playful&quot;, and he abandoned &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot;.

While attending Harvard, Cuomo experienced loneliness and frustration while also undergoing an extensive surgery for his left leg. These experiences influenced his songwriting for the next record. The other members of Weezer decided to embark on their own side projects during this time. Sharp started The Rentals, who released their debut album, &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot;, in October 1995, also featuring Patrick Wilson on drums.

Weezer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, was released on September 24, 1996. &quot;Pinkerton&quot; is named after the character BF Pinkerton from &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, who marries and then abandons a Japanese woman named Butterfly. Calling him an &quot;asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star&quot;, Cuomo felt the character was &quot;the perfect symbol for the part of myself that I am trying to come to terms with on this album&quot;. It produced three singles: &quot;El Scorcho&quot;, &quot;The Good Life&quot;, and &quot;Pink Triangle&quot;.

With a darker, more abrasive sound, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; sold poorly compared to the Blue Album and received mixed reviews; it was voted &quot;one of the worst albums of 1996&quot; in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reader poll. However, the album eventually gained a cult following and came to be considered among Weezer&#x27;s best work; in 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted &quot;Pinkerton&quot; the 16th greatest album of all time. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a new review, awarding it five out of five stars and adding it to the &quot;&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Hall of Fame&quot;. &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was later certified platinum in 2016.

The album became an emo masterpiece and some credit it to &quot;rewriting the emo blueprint&quot; as it became quite influential for a number of bands and the genre itself in the 2000s.

In July 1997, sisters Mykel, Carli, and Trysta Allan died in a car accident while driving home from a Weezer show in Denver, Colorado. Mykel and Carli ran Weezer&#x27;s fan club and helped manage publicity for several other Los Angeles bands, and had inspired the &quot;Sweater Song&quot; B-side &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot;. Weezer canceled a show to attend their funeral. In August, Weezer and other bands held a benefit concert for the family in Los Angeles. A compilation album, &quot;Hear You Me! A Tribute to Mykel and Carli&quot;, was dedicated to their memory. The album included &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot;, as well as songs by Ozma, That Dog, and Kara&#x27;s Flowers. In 2001, Jimmy Eat World released &quot;Hear You Me&quot; which was dedicated to Mykel and Carli.

===Hiatus (1997–2000)===
Weezer completed the &quot;Pinkerton&quot; tour in mid-1997 and went on hiatus. Wilson returned to his home in Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, the Special Goodness, and Bell worked on his band Space Twins. In 1998, Sharp left Weezer due to differences with the band members. He said of his departure: &quot;I certainly have my view of it, as I&#x27;m sure everybody else has their sort of foggy things. When you have a group that doesn&#x27;t communicate, you&#x27;re going to have a whole lot of different stories.&quot;

Cuomo returned to Harvard but took a break to focus on songwriting. He formed a new band composed of a changing lineup of Boston musicians, and performed new material. The songs were abandoned, but bootlegs of the Boston shows are traded on the internet. Wilson eventually flew to Boston to join Homie, another Cuomo side project. The members of the band were composed of Greg Brown (Cake and Deathray), Matt Sharp, Yuval Gabay (Soul Coughing and Sulfur), Adam Orth (Shufflepuck), and future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh. Although a Homie album was being recorded, they ended up only releasing one song, called &quot;American Girls&quot;, for the 1998 film &quot;Meet the Deedles&quot;.

In February 1998, Cuomo, Bell and Wilson reunited in Los Angeles to start work on the next Weezer album. The group hired Mikey Welsh, who had played with Cuomo in Boston, as their new bassist. Welsh was also previously a bassist for Juliana Hatfield. Weezer continued rehearsing and recording demos until late 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and in late 1998, Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo. In November 1998, the band played two club shows with a substitute drummer in California under the name Goat Punishment, consisting entirely of covers of Nirvana and Oasis songs. In the months following, Cuomo entered a period of depression, unplugging his phone, painting the walls of his home black, and putting fiberglass insulation over his windows to prevent light from entering. Eventually during this time, Cuomo started experimenting with his music and ended up writing 121 songs by 1999. In the meantime, Wilson continued to work with The Special Goodness while Bell again worked with Space Twins. Welsh continued to tour with Juliana Hatfield.

===Comeback and the &quot;Green Album&quot; (2000–2001)===

Weezer reunited in April 2000, when they accepted a lucrative offer to perform at the Fuji Rock Festival. The festival served as a catalyst for Weezer&#x27;s productivity, and from April to May 2000, they rehearsed and demoed new songs in Los Angeles. They returned to live shows in June 2000, playing small unpromoted concerts once again under the name Goat Punishment. In June 2000, the band joined the American Warped Tour for nine dates.

Eventually the band went back into the studio to produce a third album, the &quot;Green Album&quot;. Due to the mixed reception of &quot;Pinkerton,&quot; Cuomo wrote less personal lyrics for the Green Album. The band hired Ric Ocasek, who had also produced the band&#x27;s debut album. Shortly after the release, Weezer went on another American tour. The album was supported by the singles &quot;Hash Pipe&quot;, &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Photograph&quot;. Executives suggested that &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; should be chosen as the first single. However, Cuomo continued to fight and &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; eventually became the album&#x27;s first single. &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and No. 6 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. &quot;Island In the Sun&quot; was released as the second single and became a radio hit as well as one of their biggest overseas hits. The song peaked at No. 11 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The song has gained increasing popularity over the years as it later joined the digital song sales in 2008, only to peak at No. 18 in 2022.

The label tried to postpone the release date of &quot;Weezer&quot; further until June, but they ended up sticking to the album&#x27;s original release date of May 15 release date. The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and has since been certified platinum.

After suffering a breakdown from the stress of touring, undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and drug abuse, Welsh attempted suicide and left Weezer in 2001. He later joined The Kickovers for a short stint before retiring from music. He was replaced by Scott Shriner. During this time, Spike Jonze returned to film a music video for &quot;Island In the Sun&quot;. Matt Sharp was originally intended to appear in the video, but it did not end up happening.

===&quot;Maladroit&quot; (2002)===
Weezer took an experimental approach to the recording process of its fourth album by allowing fans to download in-progress mixes of new songs from its official website in return for feedback. After the release of the album, the band said that this process was something of a failure, as the fans did not supply the group with coherent, constructive advice. Cuomo eventually delegated song selection for the album to the band&#x27;s original A&amp;R rep, Todd Sullivan, saying that Weezer fans chose the &quot;wackest songs&quot;. Only the song &quot;Slob&quot; was included on the album due to general fan advice.

The recording was also done without input from Weezer&#x27;s record label, Interscope. Cuomo had what he then described as a &quot;massive falling out&quot; with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer&#x27;s audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos.

In April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.

The fourth album, &quot;Maladroit&quot;, was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band&#x27;s trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for &quot;Dope Nose&quot; featured an obscure Japanese motorcycle gang, and was put into regular rotation. The song reached No. 8 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The music video for &quot;Keep Fishin&#x27;&quot; combined Weezer with the Muppets, and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.

Spin reviewed it as the 6th best album of 2002. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reader&#x27;s poll also from that year voted it the 90th greatest album of all time.

Weezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The &quot;Video Capture Device&quot; DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through &quot;Maladroit&quot;&#x27;s Enlightenment Tour. Compiled by the band’s assistant Karl Koch, the DVD features home video footage, music videos, commercials, rehearsals, concert performances, television performances, and band commentary. The DVD was certified &quot;gold&quot; on November 8, 2004.

===&quot;Make Believe&quot; (2003–2006)===

Before working on new material, Cuomo discovered vipassana meditation which became a large influence to his songwriting. He decided to take a more personal approach to his writing once again. One song during this process, &quot;The Other Way&quot;, was written for Cuomo&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Jennifer Chiba after her then-boyfriend, singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, presumably died by suicide. Cuomo said, &quot;I wanted to console her, but I was confused and skeptical about my own motives for wanting to do so, so I wrote that song about that.&quot;

Before recording material for their 4th album, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson worked on their own projects. Bell&#x27;s Space Twins released &quot;The End of Imagining&quot; which Rolling Stone critic, John D. Lueressen named the 7th best album of 2003. Meanwhile, Wilson&#x27;s The Special Goodness released Land Air Sea.

From December 2003 to the fall of 2004, Weezer recorded a large amount of material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band&#x27;s early recording efforts became available to the public through the band&#x27;s website. The demos were a big hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album. That album, titled &quot;Make Believe,&quot; was released on May 10, 2005. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Despite commercial success, &quot;Make Believe&quot; got a mixed reception from critics, receiving an average score of 52 on the review collator Metacritic. Although some reviews, such as AMG&#x27;s, compared it favorably to &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, others, among them &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, panned the album as predictable and lyrically poor.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Beverly Hills&quot;, became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single released from &quot;Make Believe&quot; was &quot;We Are All on Drugs&quot; which peaked at No. 10 on the Alternative Airplay chart. MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing &quot;on drugs&quot; with &quot;in love&quot; and renaming the song &quot;We Are All in Love&quot;. In early 2006, it was announced that &quot;Make Believe&quot; was certified platinum, and &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; by Gwen Stefani. &quot;Make Believe&quot;&#x27;s third single, &quot;Perfect Situation&quot;, reached No. 1 U.S. Billboard Modern Rock chart and No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;This Is Such a Pity&quot; was the band&#x27;s fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release. The &quot;Make Believe&quot; tour also found the band using additional instruments onstage, adding piano, synthesizers, pseudophones, and guitarist Bobby Schneck.

===The &quot;Red Album&quot; (2006–2008)===

After the success of &quot;Make Believe,&quot; the band decided to take a break. Cuomo returned to Harvard where he ended up graduating cum laude and as a Phi Beta Kappa in 2006. Cuomo also married Kyoko Ito on June 18, 2006, a woman he had known since March 1997. The wedding was attended by the current members of the band as well as Matt Sharp and Jason Cropper. During this break, Patrick Wilson and Brian Bell appeared in the 2006 film &quot;Factory Girl&quot; playing John Cale and Lou Reed respectively and contributing a cover of the Velvet Underground song &quot;Heroin&quot; for the film. Also during this time, Bell started a new project, The Relationship.

&quot;Weezer&quot; (also known as the Red Album) was released in June 2008. Rick Rubin produced the album and Rich Costey mixed it. The record was described as &quot;experimental&quot;, and according to Cuomo, who claimed it at the time to be Weezer&#x27;s &quot;boldest and bravest and showiest album&quot;, included longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments. Pat Wilson said the album cost about a million dollars to make, contrasting it with the budget of the Blue Album. The album was produced by Rick Rubin and Jacknife Lee. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 while receiving generally positive reviews.

Its lead single, &quot;Pork and Beans&quot;, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks charts for 11 weeks while also peaking at No. 64 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. The second single, &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, debuted at No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No. 2. In October 2008, the group announced that the third single would be &quot;The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)&quot; which was met with critical praise.

On May 30, 2008, the Toledo Free Press revealed in an interview with Shriner that Weezer would be unveiling the &quot;Hootenanny Tour&quot;, in which fans would be invited to bring their own instruments to play along with the band. Said Shriner: &quot;They can bring whatever they want... oboes, keyboards, drums, violins, and play the songs with us as opposed to us performing for them.&quot;

The band performed five dates in Japan at the beginning of September and then embarked on what was dubbed the &quot;Troublemaker&quot; tour, consisting of 21 dates around North America, including two in Canada. Angels and Airwaves and Tokyo Police Club joined the band as support at each show, and Brian Bell&#x27;s other band The Relationship also performed at a handful of dates. Shortly before the encore at each show, the band would bring on fans with various instruments and perform &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; with the band. At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, &quot;My Brain&quot;, dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again. This bizarre event later surfaced as the climax to a promo video for Cuomo&#x27;s second demo album, &quot;Alone 2&quot;.

===&quot;Raditude&quot; and &quot;Hurley&quot; (2009–2013)===

Weezer toured with Blink-182 in 2009, including an August 30 stop at the Virgin Festival at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. Drummer Josh Freese joined Weezer on a temporary basis to play drums on the tour, while Pat Wilson switched to guitar. Wilson said in an interview for Yahoo! Music that Cuomo wanted &quot;to be active and more free on stage and him having guitar on was an impediment.&quot; Freese stated he was a Weezer fan and did not want to pass up the opportunity to play with the band.

On August 18, 2009, Weezer released the first single for their upcoming album, &quot;If You&#x27;re Wondering If I Want You To&quot;. The song peaked at No. 81 on the Billboard Hot 100. The title of the album was called &quot;Raditude&quot; which was a suggestion from actor Rainn Wilson.

&quot;Raditude&quot;&#x27;s album artwork was revealed on September 11, featuring a National Geographic contest-winning photograph of a jumping dog named Sidney. The record&#x27;s release was pushed to November 3, 2009, where it debuted as the seventh best-selling album of the week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The band scheduled tour dates in December 2009 extending into early 2010 to coincide with the new album&#x27;s release. On December 6, 2009, Cuomo was injured when his tour bus crashed in Glen, New York due to black ice. Cuomo suffered three broken ribs and internal bleeding, and his assistant broke two ribs. His wife, baby daughter, and their nanny were also on the bus, but they escaped injury. Weezer cancelled the remaining 2009 tour dates the following day. The band resumed touring on January 20, 2010.

In December 2009, it was revealed that the band was no longer with Geffen Records. The band stated that new material would still be released, but the band members were unsure of the means, whether it be self-released, released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band was signed to the independent label Epitaph.

Weezer co-headlined The Bamboozle in May 2010, and performed at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In August 2010, Weezer performed at the Reading and Leeds Festival, and performed at the Voodoo Experience festival in New Orleans, LA in October 2010.

The album &quot;Hurley&quot; was released in September 2010 through Epitaph Records. The name comes from the character Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes from the television show &quot;Lost&quot;. Jorge Garcia, the actor who portrayed Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover is &quot;one of the biggest honors of [his] career.&quot; The first single, &quot;Memories&quot; was chosen as part of the Jackass 3D soundtrack with the music video featuring members of the cast contributing backing vocals.

Weezer used internet streaming service YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer loaned itself to 15 amateur online video producers, &quot;going along with whatever plans the creator could execute in about 30 minutes.&quot; The band was promoted through popular channels such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson and Fred Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers solicited musical and vocal contributions from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches by Rep. Charles Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer called the promotion &quot;The YouTube Invasion&quot;.

In November 2010, Weezer released a compilation album composed of re-recorded versions of unused recordings spanning from 1993 to 2010, &quot;Death to False Metal&quot;. The title track, &quot;Turning Up The Radio&quot; was a collaborative effort with many fans on Youtube. On the same day a deluxe version of &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, which includes &quot;25 demos, outtakes and live tracks&quot; was also released. A third volume of Cuomo&#x27;s solo &quot;&quot; series, titled &quot;Alone III: The Pinkerton Years&quot;, consisting of demos and outtakes from the &quot;Pinkerton&quot; sessions, was released on December 12, 2011. The band also contributed a cover of the Cars&#x27; &quot;You Might Think&quot; for the Disney-Pixar film &quot;Cars 2&quot; as well as a cover of The Monkees&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; for &quot;Shrek Forever After.&quot;

Weezer began working on their ninth studio album in September 2010 with the intent of a 2011 release, but the year ended without seeing a release. On October 8, 2011, former Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was found dead from a suspected heroin overdose in a Chicago hotel room. Weezer performed in Chicago the next day and dedicated the concert to Welsh, who was expected to have attended. Welsh had previously joined Weezer on stage for a few performances between 2010 and 2011.

The band headlined a four-day rock-themed Carnival Cruise from Miami to Cozumel that set sail on January 19, 2012. In July, Weezer headlined the inaugural Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio. In early 2013 the band brought its Memories Tour to Australia—the band&#x27;s first Australian tour since 1996. The band played its first two albums in full at several venues. The band also headlined the Punkspring 2013 tour in Japan and later in the year toured Canada and USA. They played multiple nights in cities around the U.S. The first night shows were dedicated to playing their hits, then the Blue album in full, front to back. The second night, they played Pinkerton in the same fashion. Koch did a &quot;Memories&quot; slide show at the Gibson amphitheater in Los Angeles (And most likely many other venues around the U.S.) The slide show consisted of photos of gigs over the years and highlighted the loss of their fan club team members Mykel and Carli Allan in 1997.

===&quot;Everything Will Be Alright in the End&quot; and the &quot;White Album&quot; (2013–2016)===

Over 200 tracks were considered for their next album, but they were able to narrow it down to 13. According to the album&#x27;s official press release, the album is organized thematically around three groups of songs: &quot;Belladonna&quot;, &quot;The Panopticon Artist&quot; and &quot;Patriarchia&quot;. &quot;Belladonna&quot; includes the songs &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got Nobody&quot;, &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, &quot;Da Vinci&quot;, &quot;Go Away&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Return to Ithaka&quot;, all of which deal with Cuomo&#x27;s relationships with women. Tracks under &quot;The Panopticon Artist&quot; include &quot;Back to the Shack&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Had It Up To Here&quot; and &quot;The Waste Land&quot; all deal with Cuomo&#x27;s relationships with fans. The final group of songs, &quot;Patriarchia&quot;, are &quot;Eulogy for a Rock Band&quot;, &quot;The British Are Coming&quot;, &quot;Foolish Father&quot; and &quot;Anonymous&quot;, which deal with relationships with father figures, &quot;with a new spin&quot;.

In January 2014, Weezer began recording with producer Ric Ocasek, who had produced the &quot;Blue Album&quot; and the &quot;Green Album&quot;. A clip of a new song was posted on the band&#x27;s official YouTube account on March 19, 2014, which confirmed previous rumors of the band being in the studio. On June 12, 2014, it was revealed that the album title would be &quot;Everything Will Be Alright in the End&quot;. It was released on October 7, 2014 to generally favorable reviews, becoming the band&#x27;s best-reviewed release since &quot;Pinkerton&quot;. The first single, &quot;Back to the Shack&quot;, reached No. 5 on the Alternative Airplay chart.

On October 26, 2015, the band released a new single, &quot;Thank God for Girls&quot;, through Apple Music and to radio the same day. The following week, the band released a second single, &quot;Do You Wanna Get High?&quot;. Cuomo claimed in an interview with Zane Lowe, that the band was not working on a new album. Later, on January 14, 2016, Weezer released a third single, &quot;King of the World&quot;, and announced the &quot;White Album&quot;, which continued the critical success of the band&#x27;s previous release.

While writing the album, Cuomo joined Tinder to meet with people to get inspired for new songs. He also started to explore other songwriting techniques including a cut-up technique, stream-of-consciousness, and writing melodies with a piano instead of guitar.

&quot;Weezer&quot; was officially released on April 1, 2016, and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. The album is considered a concept album exploring the themes of gender dynamics, modern dating experiences and references to religious iconography. Musically, the album serves as a throwback to the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Weezer&quot; (1994) and &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996), while also serving as a tribute to the Beach Boys.

The album received a grammy nomination for Best Rock Album for the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

In support of the album, the band performed on the Weezer &amp; Panic! at the Disco Summer Tour 2016 with Panic! at the Disco in 2016. The band later signed to Atlantic Records as part of a joint venture between Warner Music Group and Crush Management.

===&quot;Pacific Daydream&quot; (2017–2018)===

Soon after the release of the White Album, Cuomo discussed plans for Weezer&#x27;s next album, provisionally titled the &quot;Black Album&#x27;. Cuomo said the album would tackle &quot;more mature topics&quot; and be &quot;less summer day and more winter night&quot;, and suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016. Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more &quot;like reveries from a beach at the end of the world [... as if] the Beach Boys and the Clash fell in love by the ocean and had one hell of an amazing baby&quot;.

To write the album, Cuomo utilized various musical and lyrical fragments he had collected over time. He kept an archive of song ideas and hired programmers to organize a spreadsheet of lyric snippets by beats per minute, syllable, and key to call from whenever stuck. &quot;Instead of trying to force myself to feel inspired, I can just go into the spreadsheet and search [...] I just try them out to see which ones work magically.&quot;

On March 16, 2017, Weezer released a new song, &quot;Feels Like Summer&quot;, the lead single of the upcoming album. The song drew a mixed reaction from fans but became their biggest hit on Alternative radio in a decade (peaking at number 2 on the Alternative Airplay chart ). On August 16, Weezer announced &quot;Pacific Daydream,&quot; released on October 27. On August 17, the promotional single from the album, &quot;Mexican Fender&quot;, was released. The following month, &quot;Beach Boys&quot; was released, and the month after, they released &quot;Weekend Woman&quot; to positive reception. &quot;Happy Hour&quot; was chosen as the second official single of the album, peaking at No. 9 on the Alternative Airplay chart.

The album received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.

===The &quot;Teal Album&quot; and the &quot;Black Album&quot; (2018–2019)===

Following a persistent Twitter campaign by a fan, Weezer released a cover of Toto&#x27;s song &quot;Africa&quot; on May 29, 2018. Prior to this, the band released a cover of &quot;Rosanna&quot; to &quot;troll&quot; their fans. &quot;Africa&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart in August 2018, becoming the band&#x27;s first number-one single since &quot;Pork and Beans&quot; in 2008. Two days later, on August 10, Toto responded by releasing a cover of Weezer&#x27;s single &quot;Hash Pipe&quot;. &quot;Africa&quot; eventually peaked at No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100. The success of the &quot;Africa&quot; cover led Weezer to record an album of covers, the &quot;Teal Album&quot;, a surprise album released on January 24, 2019. The album was a commercial success as it peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. In addition, all tracks charted on the Hot Rock and Alternative Songs chart.

On September 20, 2018, Weezer released &quot;California Snow&quot; as a single for the 2018 film &quot;Spell&quot;. It was chosen as the closing track for the &quot;Black Album&quot;. On October 11, 2018, Weezer released &quot;Can&#x27;t Knock the Hustle&quot;, the lead single from their upcoming album. On November 21, they released the second single, &quot;Zombie Bastards&quot;, and announced the &quot;Black Album&quot;, produced by Dave Sitek and scheduled for March 1, 2019. An arena tour of the U.S. with the Pixies and supporting and international tour dates were also announced. On February 21, they released &quot;High as a Kite&quot; and &quot;Living in LA&quot; as the next singles. They would later play them on NPR Music to promote the album for their series of Tiny Desk Concerts.

=== &quot;OK Human&quot; and &quot;Van Weezer&quot; (2019–2021) ===

During a Beats 1 interview by Zane Lowe on Apple Music on January 24, 2019, Cuomo announced that Weezer had already recorded the &quot;basic tracks&quot; to the follow-up album to the &quot;Black Album&quot;. The album, produced by Jake Sinclair (who also produced the &quot;White Album&quot;), would feature piano and strings-based songwriting and had already been recorded at Abbey Road Studios. For the recording process, Weezer departed from the modern &quot;grid music&quot; style (music recorded via modern software using grids to organize and manipulate the individual elements of recorded music) and did not perform to a &quot;click&quot; (i.e., metronome) for a more natural style. Furthermore, Cuomo said he was currently working on an album with the working title &quot;Van Weezer&quot; that harkened back to their heavier rock sound after noticing how crowds enjoy epic guitar solos at Weezer shows.

On September 10, 2019, the band announced the Hella Mega Tour with Green Day and Fall Out Boy as headliners alongside themselves, with the Interrupters as an opening act. They also released the opening single, &quot;The End of the Game&quot;, off their upcoming fifteenth studio album, &quot;Van Weezer&quot;. The song reached No. 2 on the Alternative Airplay chart. Cuomo said that the band would return &quot;back to big guitars&quot;. He remarked that when the band would perform &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; live in concert, he would perform a guitar solo that was not present on the recorded version of the song. &quot;We noticed that, recently, the crowd just goes crazy when I do that. So it feels like maybe the audience is ready for some shredding again.&quot;

The band recorded a version of &quot;Lost in the Woods&quot; for the 2019 film &quot;Frozen II&quot;, which was included on the soundtrack album. The music video featuring the band and the &quot;Frozen&quot; voice actress Kristen Bell.

On May 6, 2020, Weezer released the single and music video &quot;Hero&quot; a tribute to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneously, they announced the delay of &quot;Van Weezer&quot; for a time to be determined. The song reached No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart. On May 10, Weezer guest-starred on an episode of The Simpsons, &quot;The Hateful Eight-Year Olds&quot;, where a snippet of their song &quot;Blue Dream&quot; from &quot;Van Weezer&quot; was played. On August 14, 2020, the band announced that the album had been delayed to May 2021 in order to coincide with the rescheduled Hella Mega Tour. That same day, the third single, &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;, was released as a part of the soundtrack for &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music.&quot;

On October 6, 2020, after Eddie Van Halen died, the album was dedicated to him. In addition to Van Halen, the album is also dedicated to Ric Ocasek, who produced the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;The Blue Album&quot;, &quot;The Green Album&quot;, and &quot;Everything Will Be Alright in the End&quot;, as Ocasek had died in September 2019.

On January 18, 2021, the band officially announced their fourteenth studio album, &quot;OK Human&quot; (a play on Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;).&quot;,&quot; following cryptic promotional floppy discs and links sent to some members of the Weezer Fan Club a few days prior. The announcement came with a release date of January 29. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;All My Favorite Songs&quot;, was released as a single with an alternate version featuring indie pop-rock band AJR. The song reached No.1 on the Alternative Airplay chart and was later nominated for Best Rock Song in the 64th Annual Grammy Awards&quot;.&quot;

The album was planned to be released following &quot;Van Weezer&quot;, but when the album suffered a year-long delay following the COVID-19 pandemic, the band decided to shift their focus to completing &quot;OK Human&quot; first. Work on &quot;OK Human&quot; began as early as 2017, when the band decided to make an album that combined rock instrumentation with an orchestra. The band hired a 38-piece-orchestra and recorded the album entirely with analog equipment to achieve their desired baroque sound. The album was additionally inspired by The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and Harry Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Nilsson Sings Newman&quot; (1970).

The fourth single, &quot;I Need Some of That&quot; was released on April 21, 2021. &quot;Van Weezer&quot; was released on May 7, 2021, along with an animated music video for &quot;All the Good Ones&quot;. The album has been compared to their fourth studio album &quot;Maladroit&quot; (2002), and is inspired by 1970s and 1980s hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Kiss, Black Sabbath, Metallica and Van Halen (the last of whom inspired the album&#x27;s title).

===&quot;SZNZ&quot;, touring and 30th anniversary (2021–present)===

After delays due to the pandemic, the American leg of the Hella Mega Tour began on July 24, 2021, in Arlington, Texas. The European leg saw Weezer, Green Day and Fall Out Boy performing in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, England, Ireland, Scotland and France.

On June 20, 2022, Weezer appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, debuting &quot;Records&quot;, the lead single from &quot;&quot;, which also reached No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart. In August, a Broadway Theater residency planned for September 2022 was cancelled due to high expenses and poor ticket sales.

On September 19, 2022, Weezer performed again under the name Goat Punishment at Troubadour, Hollywood, where they played &quot;SZNZ: Winter&quot; for the first time. They also debuted the single &quot;What Happens After You?&quot; from &quot;&quot;, which was released on September 22, 2022. &quot;What Happens After You?&quot; was later performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

In November 2023, Weezer appeared in the Netflix film &quot;Family Switch&quot;.

In June 2024, Weezer began a tour of the UK and Ireland with Smashing Pumpkins. Reviewing their performance at the O2 Arena, London, the &quot;Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;Thirty years on, Weezer still dole out taut, punchy, witty powerpop with self-effacing elan ... They are patently still in love with music.&quot; In September, Weezer, along with opening acts Dinosaur Jr. and The Flaming Lips, began their Voyage to the Blue Planet tour, in which they will perform the Blue Album in its entirety for its 30th anniversary. On September 4, Weezer announced the &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; of the Blue Album, which will be &quot;the most comprehensive vision of The Blue Album ever created&quot;. It was released on November 1, 2024.

On October 18, 2025, Weezer are set to perform at When We Were Young festival in Las Vegas.

==Musical style and influences==
Weezer has been described as alternative rock, power pop, pop rock, pop-punk, geek rock, emo, indie rock, emo pop, melodic metal, and pop. Weezer&#x27;s early material was said to have &quot;embodied the self-awareness of the intelligent alternative rock slacker&quot;, and throughout its career, the band has maintained a &quot;heavy guitar-oriented sound over a steady, danceable groove&quot;. The band&#x27;s aesthetic and lyrics have been described as &quot;blurring the line between serious and humorous&quot;.

The members of Weezer have listed influences such as Kiss (with direct references in the song &quot;In the Garage&quot;), Nirvana, the Pixies, the Cars (whose member Ric Ocasek produced several Weezer records), Cheap Trick, Pavement, Oasis, the Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day and Wax. Cuomo credited the Beach Boys as a major influence, specifically &quot;Pet Sounds;&quot; Bell described Weezer&#x27;s sound as &quot;Beach Boys with Marshall stacks&quot;. Operas and musicals such as &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (1904) and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1970) influenced &quot;Pinkerton&quot; and &quot;Songs from the Black Hole.&quot; The band members&#x27; worship for hard rock and heavy metal music was the source of inspiration behind &quot;Van Weezer&quot;, including 1970s and 1980s bands like Kiss, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Slayer, Rush, and Van Halen (the last of whom inspired the album&#x27;s title).

Artists such as Paramore, Fun., Pete Wentz, Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Blink-182, Steve Lacy, Taylor Swift, Charli XCX, Mac DeMarco, Real Estate, Dinosaur Pile-Up, Cymbals Eat Guitars, DNCE, Ozma, Wavves, Joyce Manor, Origami Angel, and the Fall of Troy cite Weezer as an influence.

The Relationship&#x27;s self-titled debut was released in 2010, with a follow-up, &quot;Clara Obscura&quot;, in 2017.

Former bassist Matt Sharp started the Rentals in 1994. After releasing &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; in 1995, Sharp went on to quit Weezer in 1998 to focus more on the Rentals. Sharp has also released work under his own name. Mikey Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield and played bass for the Kickovers. Scott Shriner played bass for Anthony Green&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Avalon&quot;.

In 2010, the band recorded a cover of &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; for the movie &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;. Previously, Weezer had planned to include an early version of &quot;My Best Friend&quot; from &quot;Make Believe&quot; in &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, but it was rejected due to the song sounding &quot;too much like it was written for Shrek&quot;.

<doc id="33422" wikidata="Q209518" url="?curid=33422" title="Wayne Gretzky">
<text>Wayne Douglas Gretzky ( ; born January 26, 1961) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey player and former head coach. He played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for four teams from 1979 to 1999. Nicknamed &quot;the Great One&quot;, he has been called the greatest ice hockey player ever by the NHL based on surveys of hockey writers, ex-players, general managers and coaches. Gretzky is the leading career goal scorer, assist producer and point scorer in NHL history, and has more career assists than any other player has total points. He is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season, a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, Gretzky tallied over 100 points in 15 professional seasons. At the time of his retirement in 1999, he held 61 NHL records: 40 regular season records, 15 playoff records, and 6 All-Star records.

Born and raised in Brantford, Ontario, Gretzky honed his skills on a backyard rink and regularly played minor hockey at a level far above his peers. Despite his unimpressive size and strength, Gretzky&#x27;s intelligence, stamina, and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, consistently anticipated where the puck was going to be, and executed the right move at the right time. Gretzky became known for setting up behind his opponent&#x27;s net, an area that was nicknamed &quot;Gretzky&#x27;s office&quot;.

Gretzky was the top scorer in the 1978 World Junior Championships. In June 1978, he signed with the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four Stanley Cup championships. Gretzky&#x27;s trade to the Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on that team&#x27;s performance, ultimately leading them to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California. Gretzky played briefly for the St. Louis Blues before finishing his career with the New York Rangers. Gretzky captured nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player, 10 Art Ross Trophies for most points in a season, two Conn Smythe Trophies as playoff MVP and five Lester B. Pearson Awards (now the Ted Lindsay Award) for most outstanding player as judged by his peers. He led the league in goal-scoring five times and assists 16 times. He also won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and performance five times and often spoke out against fighting in hockey.

After his retirement in 1999, Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation&#x27;s (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000, and received the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2012. Gretzky became executive director for the Canadian national men&#x27;s hockey team during the 2002 Winter Olympics, in which the team won a gold medal. In 2000, he became part-owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, and following the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, he became the team&#x27;s head coach. In 2004, Gretzky was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. In September 2009, following the Phoenix Coyotes&#x27; bankruptcy, Gretzky resigned as head coach and relinquished his ownership share. In October 2016, he returned to the Oilers as a minority partner and vice-chairman of their parent company, Oilers Entertainment Group. He left in 2021 to become an analyst on Turner Sports&#x27; NHL coverage.

==Early life==
Wayne Douglas Gretzky was born on January 26, 1961, in Brantford, Ontario, the son of Phyllis Leone (Hockin) and Walter Gretzky. The couple married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in Brantford, where Walter worked for Bell Telephone Canada. The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because its yard was flat enough to make an ice rink. Wayne had a sister, Kim (born 1963), and brothers Keith, Glen and Brent. The family regularly visited the farm of Wayne&#x27;s grandparents, Tony and Mary, and watched &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; together. By age two, Wayne was trying to score goals against Mary using a souvenir stick. The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months.
Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen, and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the backyard of the family home, nicknamed the &quot;Wally Coliseum&quot;. Drills included skating around bleach bottles and tin cans and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able to pick up the puck again in full flight. Walter gave the advice to &quot;skate where the puck&#x27;s going, not where it&#x27;s been&quot;. Wayne was a classic prodigy whose extraordinary skills made him the target of other children&#x27;s jealous parents.

The team Gretzky played on at age six was otherwise composed of ten-year-olds. His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked that he handled the puck better than the ten-year-olds. According to Martin, &quot;Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player, and he&#x27;d get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing.&quot; The sweaters for ten-year-olds were far too large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the right side. Gretzky continued doing this throughout his NHL career.

By age ten, Gretzky had scored an astonishing 378 goals and 139 assists in just one season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers. His play attracted media attention beyond Brantford, including a profile by John Iaboni in the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; in October 1971. In the 1974 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament, Gretzky scored 26 points playing for Brantford. By age 13, he had scored over  goals.

His play attracted considerable negative attention from other players&#x27; parents, including those of his teammates, and he was often booed. According to Walter, the &quot;capper&quot; was being booed on &quot;Brantford Day&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens in February 1975. When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in Toronto, partly to further his career, and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure. The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win Wayne the right to play in a different area, which was disallowed at the time. The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the Toronto Nationals, in a league that included 20-year-olds. He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the Metro Junior B Hockey League in 1975–76, with 60 points in 28 games. The following year, as a 15–16-year-old, he had 72 points in 32 games with the same team, renamed the Seneca Nationals.
Despite his offensive statistics—scoring 132 points in 60 games in Junior B—two teams bypassed him in the 1977 Ontario Major Junior Hockey League draft of 16-year-olds. The Oshawa Generals picked Tom McCarthy first, and the Niagara Falls Flyers picked Steve Peters second overall. With the third pick, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds selected Gretzky, even though Walter Gretzky had told the team Wayne would not move to Sault Ste. Marie, a northern Ontario city that inflicts a heavy travelling schedule on its junior team. The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local family they knew and Wayne played for the Greyhounds, at age 16. It was with the Greyhounds that Gretzky first wore the number 99 on his jersey. He originally wanted to wear number 9—for his hockey hero Gordie Howe—but it was already being worn by teammate Brian Gualazzi. At coach Muzz MacPherson&#x27;s suggestion, Gretzky settled on 99.

==World Hockey Association==
By 1978, the World Hockey Association, which had competed with the established NHL since 1972, was struggling. The league, which at one point iced fourteen teams, was down to seven surviving franchises. The WHA had long sought to arrange a merger with the NHL but were constantly rebuffed by a group of hardline owners in the older league. With the WHA&#x27;s long-term survival in doubt, Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett believed the only way to gain meaningful leverage over the NHL was to sign as many young and promising superstars as possible. The NHL did not allow the signing of players under age 20, but the WHA had no such rules. Bassett saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the Bulls and the Indianapolis Racers.

Ultimately, it was Racers owner Nelson Skalbania who, on June 12, 1978, signed 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth US$1.75 million. Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because by that point it was well known that a majority of NHL owners, if not yet the ¾ required to add new NHL franchises, were willing to absorb at least some WHA teams. While Skalbania knew it was unlikely the Racers would be one of these teams (in part because the WHA insisted that all of its surviving Canadian teams be included), he still hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling the young star.

Gretzky scored his first professional goal against Dave Dryden of the Edmonton Oilers in his fifth game, and his second goal four seconds later. However, he played only eight games for Indianapolis. The Racers were losing $40,000 per game. Skalbania told Gretzky he would be moved, offering him a choice between the Edmonton Oilers and the Winnipeg Jets. On the advice of his agent, Gretzky picked the Oilers, but the move was not that simple. On November 2, Gretzky, goaltender Eddie Mio, and forward Peter Driscoll were put on a private plane, not knowing where they would land and what team they would be joining. While in the air, Skalbania worked on the deal. Skalbania offered to play a game of backgammon with Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty, the stakes being if Gobuty won, he would get Gretzky and if he lost, he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets. Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in Edmonton. Mio paid the $4,000 bill for the flight. Skalbania sold Gretzky, Mio and Driscoll to Oilers owner Peter Pocklington, a former business partner. Although the announced price was $850,000, Pocklington paid $700,000. The money was not enough to keep the Racers alive; they folded that December.

One of the highlights of Gretzky&#x27;s season was his appearance in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars and Dynamo Moscow played at Edmonton&#x27;s Northlands Coliseum. The WHA All-Stars were coached by Jacques Demers, who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie Howe and Howe&#x27;s son, Mark. In game one, the line scored seven points, and the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2. In game two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2. The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA won by a score of 4–3.

On Gretzky&#x27;s 18th birthday, January 26, 1979, Pocklington signed him to a ten-year personal services contract (the longest in hockey history at the time) worth , with options for ten more years. Gretzky finished third in the league in scoring at 110 points, behind Robbie Ftorek and Réal Cloutier. Gretzky captured the Lou Kaplan Trophy as rookie of the year, and helped the Oilers to first place in the league.

By the end of the regular season, the signings of Gretzky and other young stars in addition to other factors had compelled enough of the hardline NHL owners to change their positions, and an agreement (recognized as the 1979 expansion by the NHL) was finalized. Under the agreement, the WHA agreed to fold after the 1979 season with the Oilers and three other teams (the Hartford (New England) Whalers, the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets) joining the older league as expansion franchises. The Oilers, like the other three teams, were to be allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters from being reclaimed by the established NHL teams in the 1979 NHL Expansion Draft. The NHL also lowered its minimum age, ensuring players such as Gretzky would not need to return to the junior level, albeit with the caveat that such previously underaged players were supposed to be placed into the 1979 NHL Entry Draft pool. Nevertheless, to avoid any potential for litigation over the validity of Gretzky&#x27;s personal services contract the Oilers were allowed to keep him on their roster as one of their priority selections. In exchange for agreeing to keep Gretzky off the draft board, the NHL placed Edmonton at the bottom of the draft order.

The WHA completed the playoffs of its final season as planned. The Oilers reached the Avco World Trophy finals (the only WHA championship series appearance for the franchise), where they lost to the Winnipeg Jets in six games.

==NHL career==
===Edmonton Oilers (1979–1988)===
Gretzky&#x27;s success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would struggle in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more talented league. In his first NHL season, 1979–80, Gretzky was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (the first of eight in a row) and tied for the scoring lead with Marcel Dionne with 137 points. Although Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne&#x27;s 80, Dionne was awarded the Art Ross Trophy because he had scored more goals (53 to 51). The season still stands as the highest point total by a first-year player in NHL history. Gretzky became the youngest player to score 50 goals, but was not eligible for the Calder Memorial Trophy, given to the top NHL rookie, because of his previous year of WHA experience. The Calder was instead awarded to Boston Bruins defenceman Ray Bourque.

In his second season, Gretzky won the Art Ross (the first of seven consecutive) with a then-record 164 points, breaking both Bobby Orr&#x27;s record for assists in a season (102) and Phil Esposito&#x27;s record for points in a season (152). He won his second straight Hart Trophy. In the first game of the 1981 Stanley Cup playoffs, against the Montreal Canadiens, Gretzky had five assists, a single game playoff record.

During the 1981–82 season, Gretzky surpassed a record that had stood for 35 years: 50 goals in 50 games, first set by Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard during the 1944–45 NHL season and tied by Mike Bossy during the 1980–81 NHL season. Gretzky accomplished the feat in only 39 games. His 50th goal of the season came on December 30, 1981, in the final seconds of a 7–5 win against the Philadelphia Flyers and was his fifth of the game. Later that season, Gretzky broke Esposito&#x27;s record for most goals in a season (76) on February 24, 1982, scoring three to help defeat the Buffalo Sabres 6–3. He ended the 1981–82 season with records of 92 goals, 120 assists, and 212 points in 80 games, becoming the only player in NHL history to break the two hundred-point mark. That year, Gretzky became the first hockey player and first Canadian to be named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He was also named 1982 &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. The Canadian Press also named Gretzky Newsmaker of the Year in 1982.

The following seasons saw Gretzky break his assists record three more times (125 in 1982–83, 135 in 1984–85 and 163 in 1985–86); he also bettered that mark (120 assists) in 1986–87 with 121 and 1990–91 with 122, and his point record one more time (215, in 1985–86). By the time he finished playing in Edmonton, he held or shared 49 NHL records.

The Edmonton Oilers finished first overall in their last WHA regular season. The same success was not immediate when they joined the NHL, but within four seasons, the Oilers were competing for the Stanley Cup. The Oilers were a young, strong team featuring, in addition to Gretzky, future Hall of Famers including forwards Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson and Jari Kurri; defenceman Paul Coffey; and goaltender Grant Fuhr. Gretzky was its captain from 1983 to 1988. In 1983, they made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, only to be swept by the three-time defending champion New York Islanders. The following season, the Oilers met the Islanders in the Finals again, this time winning the Stanley Cup, their first of five in seven years.

Five times between 1981–82 and 1986–87, Gretzky led the NHL in goals scored. The Oilers also won the Stanley Cup with Gretzky three additional times: in , and .

When the Oilers joined the NHL, Gretzky continued to play under his personal services contract with Oilers owner Peter Pocklington. This arrangement came under increased scrutiny by the mid-1980s, especially following reports that Pocklington had used the contract as collateral to help secure a $31 million loan with the Alberta Treasury Branches. Amid growing concern around the NHL that a financial institution might be able to lay claim to Gretzky&#x27;s rights in the event the heavily leveraged Pocklington were to declare bankruptcy, as well as growing dissatisfaction on the part of Gretzky and his advisers, in 1987, Gretzky and Pocklington agreed to replace the personal services contract with a standard NHL contract.

====The Gretzky rule====
In June 1985, as part of a package of five rule changes to be implemented for the 1985–86 season, the NHL Board of Governors decided to introduce offsetting penalties, where neither team lost a man when coincidental penalties were called. The effect of calling offsetting penalties was felt immediately in the NHL because during the early 1980s, when the Gretzky-era Oilers entered a four-on-four or three-on-three situation with an opponent, they frequently used the space on the ice to score one or more goals. A few days later, during a press conference the day after being awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy, Gretzky criticized the NHL for punishing teams and players who previously benefited. The rule change became known as &quot;the Gretzky rule&quot;. The rule was reversed for the 1992–93 season, by which time a majority of the players from the all-time powerhouse Edmonton Oilers (the 1984–85 Oilers team, the one most directly impacted by the June 1985 rule change, was later voted the greatest NHL team ever, as part of the NHL&#x27;s centennial celebrations) had changed teams or retired from hockey.

====Strategy and effect on NHL play====
Gretzky had a major influence on the style of play of the Edmonton Oilers and the NHL as a whole, helping to inspire a more team-based strategy. Using this approach, the Oilers, led by Gretzky, became the highest-scoring team in NHL history.

&quot;He was, I think, the first Canadian forward to play a true team game&quot;, said hockey writer and former NHL goaltender Ken Dryden. The focus of the game before Gretzky&#x27;s arrival, he said, especially among the Canadian teams, was on the player with the puck—getting the puck to a star player who would make the big play. Gretzky reversed that. He knew he wasn&#x27;t big enough, strong enough, or even fast enough to do what he wanted to do if others focused on him. Like a magician, he had to direct attention elsewhere, to his four teammates on the ice with him, to create a momentary distraction to move unnoticed into the open ice where size and strength didn&#x27;t matter. ... Gretzky made his opponents compete with five players, not one, and he made his teammates full partners in the game. He made them skate to his level and pass and finish up to his level or they would be embarrassed.

Between 1982 and 1985, the Edmonton Oilers averaged 423 goals a season, when no previous team had scored 400, and Gretzky on his own had averaged 207 points when no player before had scored more than 152 in one year. Dryden wrote in his book &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;In the past, defenders and teams had learned to devise strategies to stop opponents with the puck. To stop them without it, that was interference. But now, if players without the puck skated just as hard as those with it, but faster, and dodged and darted to open ice just as determinedly, but more effectively, how did you shut them down?&quot;

In this, Gretzky added his considerable influence as the preeminent NHL star of his day to that of the Soviets, who had also developed a more team style of play and had successfully used it against the best NHL teams, beginning in the 1972 Summit Series. &quot;The Soviets and Gretzky changed the NHL game&quot;, says Dryden. &quot;Gretzky, the kid from Brantford with the Belarusian name, was the acceptable face of Soviet hockey. No Canadian kid wanted to play like Makarov or Larionov. They all wanted to play like Gretzky.&quot;

At the same time, Gretzky recognized the contributions of their coach in the success of the Oilers: &quot;Under the guidance of Glen Sather, our Oiler teams became adept at generating speed, developing finesse, and learning a transition game with strong European influences.&quot;

Gretzky explains his style of play further:
====&quot;The Trade&quot;====

Two hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team. Walter Gretzky had known for months after having been tipped off by Skalbania, but kept the news from Wayne so as not to upset him. According to Walter, Wayne was being &quot;shopped&quot; to Los Angeles, Detroit, and Vancouver, and Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well. At first, Gretzky did not want to leave Edmonton, but he received a call while on his honeymoon from Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall, who asked permission to meet and discuss the deal. Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski join him as teammates in Los Angeles. Both McNall and Pocklington quickly agreed. After the details of the trade were finalized by the two owners, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade. When Pocklington told Oilers general manager and head coach Sather about his plans to trade Gretzky to Los Angeles, Sather tried to stop the deal, but when he found out that Gretzky had been involved in the negotiations, he changed his attitude and requested Luc Robitaille in exchange. The Kings refused, instead offering Jimmy Carson.

On August 9, 1988, in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL, the Oilers traded Gretzky (along with McSorley and Krushelnyski) to the rival Kings for Carson, Martin Gélinas, $15 million in cash, and the Kings&#x27; first-round draft picks in 1989 (later traded to the New Jersey Devils, who used it to select Jason Miller), 1991, (used to select Martin Ručinský), and 1993, (used to select Nick Stajduhar). &quot;The Trade&quot;, as it came to be known, upset Canadians to the extent that New Democratic Party House Leader Nelson Riis demanded the government block it, and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside Northlands Coliseum.

In Gretzky&#x27;s first appearance in Edmonton after the trade, a game nationally televised in Canada, he received a four-minute standing ovation. The arena was sold out, and the attendance of 17,503 was the Oilers&#x27; biggest crowd ever to that date. Large cheers erupted for his first shift, his first touch of the puck, his two assists, and Mark Messier&#x27;s body check of Gretzky into the boards. After the game, Gretzky took the opportunity to confirm his patriotism: &quot;I&#x27;m still proud to be a Canadian. I didn&#x27;t desert my country. I moved because I was traded and that&#x27;s where my job is. But I&#x27;m Canadian to the core. I hope Canadians understand that.&quot; After the 1988–89 season, a life-sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected outside Northlands Coliseum, holding the Stanley Cup over his head.

===Los Angeles Kings (1988–1996)===

The Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain. He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular season game. The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight en route to qualifying for the playoffs. For only the second time in his NHL career, Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly edged the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; Mario Lemieux (who scored 199 points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP.

Despite being underdogs against the defending Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers in the Smythe Division semifinals, Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad, spearheading the Kings&#x27; return from a 3–1 series deficit to win the series 4–3. He was nervous Edmonton would greet him with boos, but they were eagerly waiting for him. The Kings were then swept by the Calgary Flames, who went on to win their first Stanley Cup.

In 1990, the Associated Press named Gretzky Male Athlete of the Decade. For the second year in a row, the Kings eliminated the defending champions in the first round when they defeated the Flames in six games, but also for the second year in a row their season ended in a second round sweep, this time at the hands of Gretzky&#x27;s former team. The Oilers went on to win their fifth Cup (and first without Gretzky). In his post-championship interview, Messier (who had replaced Gretzky as Edmonton&#x27;s captain following the trade) dedicated the Oilers&#x27; Cup win to him.

Gretzky&#x27;s first season in Los Angeles saw a marked increase in attendance and fan interest in a city not previously known for following hockey. The Kings now boasted of numerous sellouts. Many credit Gretzky&#x27;s arrival with putting non-traditional American hockey markets on &quot;the NHL map&quot;; not only did California receive two more NHL franchises (the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and San Jose Sharks) during Gretzky&#x27;s tenure in Los Angeles, but his popularity in Southern California proved to be an impetus in the league establishing teams in other parts of the US Sun Belt.

Gretzky was sidelined for much of the 1992–93 regular season with a back injury (he returned on January 6, 1993, which was also his 1,000th NHL game), and his 65-point output ended a record 13-year streak in which he recorded at least 100 points each season. However, he performed well in the playoffs, notably when he scored a hat trick in game seven of the Campbell Conference Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs. This victory propelled the Kings into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, where they faced the Montreal Canadiens. After winning the first game of the series by a score of 4–1, the team lost the next three games in overtime, and then fell 4–1 in the deciding fifth game, where Gretzky failed to get a shot on net.

The next season, Gretzky broke Howe&#x27;s career goal-scoring record of 801, and won the scoring title, but the team began a long slide, and despite numerous player and coaching moves, they failed to qualify for the playoffs again until 1998. After the financially troubled McNall was forced to sell the Kings in 1994, Gretzky&#x27;s relationship with the Kings&#x27; new owners grew strained. Under both McNall and the new ownership group, the team was fiscally unstable, to the point that paychecks to players bounced. Finally, in early 1996, Gretzky requested a trade. During the 1994–95 NHL lock-out, Gretzky and some friends (including Mark Messier, Marty McSorley, Brett Hull and Steve Yzerman) formed the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour and played eight exhibition games in various countries.

===St. Louis Blues (1996)===
On February 27, 1996, Gretzky joined the St. Louis Blues in a trade for Patrice Tardif, Roman Vopat, Craig Johnson and two draft picks (Peter Hogan and Matt Zultek). He partially orchestrated the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles. At the time of the trade, the Blues and New York Rangers emerged as front-runners, but the Blues met his salary demands. Gretzky was immediately named the team&#x27;s captain. He scored 37 points in 31 games for the team in the regular season and the playoffs, and the Blues came within one game of the Conference Finals.

However, the chemistry everyone expected with winger Brett Hull never developed. Gretzky was also forced to endure public criticism from his head coach for the first time in his career. Long before either he or Gretzky joined the Blues, Mike Keenan had refused to moderate his coaching style even while coaching Gretzky with Team Canada during international tournaments. Gretzky&#x27;s professional relationship with Keenan was thus never particularly warm, and the coach&#x27;s public rebukes effectively ended any realistic prospect of Gretzky remaining in St. Louis once he became a free agent. Gretzky rejected a three-year deal worth $15 million with the Blues, and on July 21, signed with the New York Rangers as a free agent, rejoining longtime Oilers teammate Mark Messier (and former Kings teammate Luc Robitaille) for a two-year, $8 million (plus incentives) contract.

===New York Rangers (1996–1999)===

Gretzky ended his professional playing career with the New York Rangers, where he played his final three seasons and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1997. The Rangers were defeated in the Conference Finals in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers, despite Gretzky leading the Rangers in the playoffs with 10 goals and 10 assists. For the first time in his NHL career, Gretzky was not named captain, except for a brief period as acting captain in 1998 when captain Brian Leetch was injured and out of the line-up. After the 1996–97 season, Mark Messier signed a free agent contract with the Vancouver Canucks, ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky after just one season. The 1997 playoff run was Gretzky&#x27;s last as a player, and the Rangers did not return to the playoffs until 2006, well after Gretzky retired. Along with Jaromir Jagr, he topped the NHL in the 1997–98 season with 67 assists. It was the 16th time in 19 seasons that Gretzky earned at least a share of the league lead in the statistic.

In 1997, before his retirement, &quot;The Hockey News&quot; named a committee of 50 hockey experts (former NHL players, past and present writers, broadcasters, coaches, and hockey executives) to select and rank the 50 greatest players in NHL history. The experts voted Gretzky number one. Gretzky said he would have voted Bobby Orr or Gordie Howe as the best of all time.

The 1998–99 season was his last as a professional player. He reached one milestone in this last season, breaking the professional total (regular season and playoffs) goal-scoring record of 1,071, which Gordie Howe had held. Gretzky was having difficulty scoring this season and finished with only nine goals, contributing to this being the only season in which he failed to average at least a point per game, but his last goal brought his scoring total for his combined NHL/WHA career to 1,072, one more than Howe. As the season wound down, there was media speculation that Gretzky would retire, but he refused to announce his retirement. His last NHL game in Canada was on April 15, 1999, a 2–2 tie with the Ottawa Senators and the Rangers&#x27; second-to-last game of the season. Following the contest, in a departure from the usual three stars announcement, Gretzky was awarded all three stars. Upon returning to New York, Gretzky announced he would retire after the Rangers&#x27; last game of the season.

The final game of Gretzky&#x27;s career was a 2–1 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 18, 1999, in Madison Square Garden. Although the game involved two American teams, both national anthems were played, with the lyrics slightly adjusted to accommodate Gretzky&#x27;s departure. In place of the lyrics &quot;O Canada, we stand on guard for thee&quot;, Bryan Adams ad-libbed, &quot;We&#x27;re going to miss you, Wayne Gretzky&quot;. &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, as sung by John Amirante, was altered to include the words &quot;in the land of Wayne Gretzky&quot;. Gretzky ended his career with a final point, assisting on the lone New York goal scored by Brian Leetch. At the time of his retirement, Gretzky was the second-to-last WHA player still active in professional hockey. Mark Messier, who attended the game along with other representatives of the Edmonton Oilers dynasty, was the last.

==International play==





Gretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1978 World Junior Championships in Montreal, Quebec. The Canadian coach, Punch McLean, was originally skeptical of Gretzky&#x27;s ability as he was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16. He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and Best Forward honours. His 17 points remain the most scored by a 16-year-old in the World Junior Championships. Canada finished with the bronze medal.

Gretzky debuted with the Canadian national team at the 1981 Canada Cup. He led the tournament in scoring with 12 points en route to a second-place finish to the Soviet Union, losing 8–1 in the final. Seven months later, Gretzky joined Team Canada for the 1982 World Championships in Finland. He notched 14 points in 10 games, including a two-goal, two-assist effort in Canada&#x27;s final game against Sweden to earn the bronze. Gretzky did not win his first international competition until the 1984 Canada Cup, when Canada defeated Sweden in a best-of-three finals. He led the tournament in scoring for the second consecutive time and was named to the All-Star Team.

Gretzky&#x27;s international career highlight arguably came three years later at the 1987 Canada Cup. Gretzky has called the tournament the best hockey he has played in his life. Playing on a line with Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; superstar Mario Lemieux, he recorded a tournament-best 21 points in nine games. After losing the first game of a best-of-three final series against the Soviets, Gretzky propelled Canada with a five-assist performance in the second game, including the game-winning pass to Lemieux in overtime, to extend the tournament. In the deciding game three, Gretzky and Lemieux once again combined for the game-winner. With the score tied 5–5 and 1:26 minutes to go in regulation, Lemieux one-timed a pass from Gretzky on a 3-on-1 with defenceman Larry Murphy. Lemieux scored to win the tournament for Canada; the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Canadian international competition.

The 1991 Canada Cup marked the last time the tournament was played under the &quot;Canada Cup&quot; moniker. Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with 12 points in seven games. He did not, however, compete in the final against the United States due to a back injury. Canada nevertheless won in two games by scores of 4–1 and 4–2. Five years later, the tournament was revived and renamed the World Cup in 1996. It marked the first time Gretzky did not finish as the tournament&#x27;s leading scorer; his seven points in eight games placed him fourth overall.

Leading up to the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, it was announced that NHL players would be eligible to play for the first time. Gretzky was named to the club on November 29, 1997. However, Gretzky was passed over for the captaincy, along with several other Canadian veterans including Steve Yzerman and Ray Bourque in favour of the younger Eric Lindros. Expectations were high for the Canadian team, but the team lost to the Czech Republic in the semi-finals. The game went to a shootout with a 1–1 tie after overtime, but Gretzky was controversially not selected by coach Marc Crawford as one of the five shooters, all of whom failed to score. Team Canada then lost the bronze medal game 3–2 to Finland to finish without a medal. The Olympics marked Gretzky&#x27;s eighth and final international appearance, finishing with four assists in six games. He retired from international play holding the records for most goals (20), most assists (28), and most overall points (48) in best-on-best hockey.

==Skills and influences==
===Style of play===

Gretzky&#x27;s size and strength were unimpressive—in fact, far below average for the NHL—but he is widely considered the smartest player in the history of the game. His reading of the game and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. His coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, said, &quot;He was so much more intelligent. While they were using all this energy trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling, analyzing things.&quot;

He was also considered one of the most creative players in hockey. &quot;You never knew what he was going to do&quot;, said hockey Hall of Famer Igor Larionov. &quot;He was improvising all the time. Every time he took the ice, there was some spontaneous decision he would make. That&#x27;s what made him such a phenomenal player.&quot; Gretzky&#x27;s ability to improvise came into the spotlight at the 1998 Olympics in Japan. Then an older player in the sunset of his career, he had been passed over for the captaincy of the team. But as the series continued, his unique skills made him a team leader.

The Canadians had trouble with the big ice. They had trouble with the European patterns and the lateral play and the endless, inventive cycling. ... Slowly, as game after game went by and the concern continued to rise, Wayne Gretzky began climbing through the line-up. He, almost alone among the Canadians, seemed to take to the larger ice surface as if it offered more opportunity instead of obligation ... His playing time soared, as he was being sent on not just for power plays but double shifts and even penalty kills. By the final round ... it was Wayne Gretzky who assumed the leadership both on and off the ice.
He passed and shot with prodigious skill. Hall of Fame defenceman Bobby Orr said of Gretzky, &quot;He passes better than anybody I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; In his first two seasons in the NHL, his deft passing skills helped earn him a reputation as an ace playmaker, and so opposing defencemen focused their efforts on foiling his attempts to pass the puck to other scorers. In response, Gretzky started shooting on goal himself—and with exceptional effectiveness. He had a fast and accurate shot. &quot;Wayne Gretzky was one of the most accurate scorers in NHL history&quot;, said one biography. Statistics support the contention: whereas Phil Esposito, who had set the previous goal-scoring record, needed 550 shots to score 76 goals, Gretzky netted his 76th after only 287 shots—about half as many. He scored his all-time single-season record of 92 goals with just 369 shots. Because he was so light compared to other players, goalies were often surprised by how hard Gretzky&#x27;s shot was. Goalies called his shots &quot;sneaky fast&quot;. He also had a way of never shooting the puck with the same rhythm twice, making his shots harder to time and block.

Veteran Canadian journalist Peter Gzowski wrote that Gretzky seemed to be able to slow down time. &quot;There is an unhurried grace to everything Gretzky does on the ice. Winding up for the slapshot, he will stop for an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc, like a golfer with a rhythmic swing.&quot; &quot;Gretzky uses this room to insert an extra beat into his actions. In front of the net, eyeball to eyeball with the goaltender ... he will ... hold the puck one ... extra instant, upsetting the anticipated rhythm of the game, extending the moment. ... He distorts time, and not only by slowing it down. Sometimes he will release the puck before he appears to be ready, threading the pass through a maze of players precisely to the blade of a teammate&#x27;s stick, or finding a chink in a goaltender&#x27;s armour and slipping the puck into it ... before the goaltender is ready to react.&quot;

Commentators have noted Gretzky&#x27;s uncanny ability to judge the position of the other players on the ice—so much so that many suspected he enjoyed some kind of extrasensory perception, that he played like he had &quot;eyes in the back of his head&quot;. Gretzky said he sensed other players more than he saw them. &quot;I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be&quot;, he said. &quot;A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking.&quot; Gretzky explained that what appeared to be instinct was, in large part, the effect of his relentless study and practice of the game, in co-operation with his coaches. As a result, he developed a deep understanding of its shifting patterns and dynamics. Gzowski said that Gretzky understood the game so well, that he could instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns of play: &quot;What we take to be creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored in his brain as deeply and firmly as his own phone number.&quot; Gretzky agreed with this assessment, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s a hundred percent right. It&#x27;s all practice. I got it from my Dad. . . . Nobody would ever say a doctor had learned his profession by instinct; yet in my own way I&#x27;ve put in almost as much time studying hockey as a medical student puts in studying medicine.&quot;

===Physical attributes===
When he entered the league in 1979, critics opined that Gretzky was &quot;too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the [NHL]&quot;. He weighed , compared to the NHL average of at that time. But that year, Gretzky tied for first place in scoring, and won the Hart Trophy for the league&#x27;s most valuable player. In his second year in the league, weighing just 165 pounds, he broke the previous single-season scoring record, racking up 164 points. The next year (1981–82), at 170 pounds—still &quot;a wisp compared to the average NHL player&quot;—he set the all-time goal-scoring record, putting 92 pucks in the net. He weighed &quot;about 170 pounds&quot; for the better part of his career. He consistently scored last in strength tests among the Edmonton Oilers, bench pressing only 140 pounds (64 kg).

Despite his lack of strength, Gretzky had remarkable physical stamina. Like his hero, Gordie Howe, Gretzky possessed &quot;an exceptional capacity to renew his energy resources quickly&quot;. In 1980, when an exercise physiologist tested the recuperative abilities of all of the Edmonton Oilers, Gretzky scored so high that the tester said he &quot;thought the machine had broken&quot;. His stamina is also indicated by the fact that Gretzky often scored late in the game. In the year he scored his record 92 goals, 22 of them went in the net during the first period, 30 in the second—and 40 in the third.

He also had strong general athletic skills. Growing up, he was a competitive runner and also batted .492 for the Junior Intercounty Baseball League&#x27;s Brantford CKCP Braves in the summer of 1980. As a result, he was offered a contract by the Toronto Blue Jays. Gretzky also excelled at box lacrosse, which he played during the summer. At age ten, after scoring 196 goals in his hockey league, he scored 158 goals in lacrosse.

According to Gretzky, lacrosse was where he learned to protect himself from hard checks: &quot;In those days you could be hit from behind in lacrosse, as well as cross-checked, so you had to learn how to roll body checks for self-protection.&quot; Gretzky applied this technique as a professional player, avoiding checks with such skill that a rumour circulated that there was an unwritten rule not to hit him. This was how Gretzky avoided serious injuries despite being undersized and entering the NHL during its &quot;rough and tumble time&quot;; Gretzky noted that his contemporary Mike Bossy &quot;took a beating to score goals, which consequently led him to retire because his back took a beating&quot;. Defencemen found Gretzky a most elusive target. The 205-pound (93 kg) Denis Potvin, a fellow Hall of Famer, compared attempting to hit Gretzky to &quot;wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill.&quot;

Gretzky received a good deal of cover from burly Oiler enforcers Dave Semenko and Marty McSorley. The latter was traded with Gretzky in 1988 to the Los Angeles Kings, where he played the same policeman role for several more years. But Gretzky discouraged unfair hits in another way. &quot;If a guy ran him, Wayne would embarrass that guy&quot;, said former Oiler Lee Fogolin. &quot;He&#x27;d score six or seven points on him. I saw him do it night after night.&quot;

==Post-retirement==
Gretzky was named honorary chairman of the Open Ice Summit, held in August 1999 to discuss ways to improve Canadian ice hockey. He stressed the need to play and practice hockey for the love of the game, and felt that skill was more important to develop than talent and that Canada had the potential to be world leaders in skill development.

Gretzky was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 22, 1999, becoming the tenth player to bypass the three-year waiting period. The Hall of Fame then announced that he would be the last player to do so. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000. In addition, Gretzky&#x27;s jersey number 99 was retired league-wide at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game, a decision inspired by Major League Baseball&#x27;s retirement of the number 42 worn by Jackie Robinson. In October 1999, Edmonton honoured Gretzky by renaming one of Edmonton&#x27;s busiest freeways, Capilano Drive—which passes by Northlands Coliseum—to Wayne Gretzky Drive. Also in Edmonton, the local transit authority assigned a rush-hour bus route numbered No. 99 which also runs on Wayne Gretzky Drive for its commute.
In 2002, the Kings held a jersey retirement ceremony and erected a life-sized statue of Gretzky outside the Staples Center; the ceremony was delayed until then so that Bruce McNall, who had recently finished a prison sentence, could attend. Also in 2002, Gretzky received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. His hometown of Brantford, Ontario, renamed Park Road North to &quot;Wayne Gretzky Parkway&quot; as well as renaming the North Park Recreation Centre to The Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre. Brantford further inducted Gretzky into its &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; in 2004. On May 10, 2010, he was awarded The Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports &amp; Entertainment Commission. Gretzky was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in 2017.

===Phoenix Coyotes===
Almost immediately after retirement, several NHL teams approached Gretzky about an ownership role. In May 2000, he agreed to buy a 10% stake in the Phoenix Coyotes in a partnership with majority owner Steve Ellman, taking on the roles of alternate governor, managing partner and head of hockey operations. The Coyotes were in the process of being sold and Ellman convinced Gretzky to come on board, averting a potential move to Portland, Oregon. The sale was not completed until the following year, on February 15, 2001, after two missed deadlines while securing financing and partners before Ellman and Gretzky could take over. Trucking magnate and Arizona Diamondbacks part-owner Jerry Moyes was added to the partnership. Gretzky convinced his long-time agent Michael Barnett to join the team as its General Manager.

In 2005, rumours began circulating that Gretzky was about to name himself head coach of the Coyotes, but were denied by Gretzky and the team. Ultimately, Gretzky agreed to become head coach on August 8, 2005. Gretzky made his coaching debut on October 5, and won his first game, on October 8 against the Minnesota Wild. He took an indefinite leave of absence on December 17 to be with his ill mother. Phyllis Gretzky died of lung cancer on December 19. Gretzky resumed his head-coaching duties on December 28. The Coyotes&#x27; record at the end of the 2005–06 season was 38–39–5, a 16-win improvement over 2003–04; they were 36–36–5 in games Gretzky coached.

In 2006, Moyes became majority owner of the team. There was uncertainty about Gretzky&#x27;s role until it was announced on May 31, 2006, that he had agreed to a five-year contract to remain head coach. The Coyotes&#x27; performance declined in 2006–07, as the team ended the season 15th in their conference. During Gretzky&#x27;s coaching tenure, the Coyotes did not reach the postseason, and their best finish in the Western Conference standings was 12th.

On May 5, 2009, the Coyotes&#x27; holding company, Dewey Ranch Hockey LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. An ownership dispute involving Research in Motion&#x27;s Jim Balsillie (to relocate the team to Hamilton, Ontario) and the NHL itself arose, which eventually ended up in court. Gretzky did not attend the Coyotes&#x27; training camp, leaving associate head coach Ulf Samuelsson in charge, due to an uncertain contractual status with the club, whose bankruptcy hearings were continuing. Bidders for the club had indicated that Gretzky would no longer be associated with the team after it emerged from bankruptcy, and on September 24, 2009, Gretzky stepped down as head coach and head of hockey operations of the Coyotes. Gretzky&#x27;s final head coaching record was 143–161–24.

===Winter Olympics===
Gretzky was executive director of the Canadian men&#x27;s hockey team at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. On February 18, he lashed out at the media at a press conference, frustrated with media and fan comments regarding his team&#x27;s uninspiring 1–1–1 start. His temper boiled over after Canada&#x27;s 3–3 draw versus the Czech Republic, as he launched a tirade against the perceived negative reputation of Team Canada amongst other national squads, and called rumours of dissent in the dressing room the result of &quot;American propaganda&quot;. &quot;They&#x27;re loving us not doing well&quot;, he said, referring to American hockey fans. American fans online began calling Gretzky a &quot;crybaby&quot;; defenders said he was merely borrowing a page from former coach Glen Sather to take the pressure off his players. Gretzky addressed those comments by saying he spoke out to protect the Canadian players, and the tirade was not &quot;staged&quot;. The Canadian team won the gold medal, its first in 50 years.

Gretzky again acted as executive director of Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s hockey team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, though not with the success of 2002; the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals and failed to win a medal. He was asked to manage Canada&#x27;s team at the 2005 Ice Hockey World Championships, but declined due to his mother&#x27;s poor health.

Gretzky served as an ambassador to Vancouver&#x27;s successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics, and was named Special Advisor to Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s hockey team at the Games. During the Games&#x27; opening ceremony, Gretzky, basketball player Steve Nash, skier Nancy Greene, and speed skater Catriona Le May Doan jointly lit the Olympic cauldron inside the ceremony venue of BC Place. Due to BC Place being an indoor stadium, and Olympic protocols stating that the lighting of the cauldron should be visible to the public, Gretzky was then escorted out of the stadium to light a second, outdoor cauldron outside the Vancouver Convention Centre, making him the &quot;de facto&quot; final torchbearer.

===Alumni games===

Although Gretzky had previously stated he would not participate in any &quot;old-timers exhibition games&quot;, on November 22, 2003, he took to the ice to help celebrate the Edmonton Oilers&#x27; 25th anniversary as an NHL team. The Heritage Classic, held at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, was the first regular season NHL game to be played outdoors. It was preceded by the Mega Stars game, which featured Gretzky and many of his Oiler Dynasty teammates against a group of retired Montreal Canadiens players (whose likes included Claude Lemieux, Guy Lafleur and others). Despite frigid temperatures, the crowd numbered 57,167, with an additional several million watching the game on television. The Edmonton alumni won the Megastars game 2–0, while Montreal went on to win the regular season game held later that day, 4–3.

Thirteen years later, on December 31, 2016, Gretzky participated in the Winter Classic Alumni Game, which was held between teams of former Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues players two days before the 2017 Winter Classic. Gretzky represented the Blues in the game, which his team won 8–7.

===Edmonton Oilers===
In October 2016, Gretzky returned to the Oilers as a partner and vice-chairman of the team&#x27;s parent company, Oilers Entertainment Group, to work closely with owner Daryl Katz and Oilers Entertainment Group CEO Bob Nicholson on the business side of the Oilers&#x27; operation.

On May 25, 2021, Gretzky announced that he would step down from his role with the Oilers, stating that &quot;The Oilers, their fans, and the city of Edmonton have meant the world to me and my family for over four decades—and that will never end. Given the pandemic and other life changes, I realize I will not be able to dedicate the time nor effort needed to support this world-class organization.&quot; It was subsequently reported by various outlets that Gretzky had signed with new US NHL rightsholder Turner Sports to become an analyst. He serves as a studio analyst for NHL broadcasts on TNT and TBS.

==Personal life==
Gretzky has made several TV appearances, including as a &quot;Dance Fever&quot; celebrity judge, and acted in a dramatic role alongside Victor Newman in &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 1981. In 1984, he travelled to the Soviet Union to film a television program on Russian goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. Gretzky was a guest host of the American late night variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1989. A fictional crime-fighting version of him served as one of the main characters in the cartoon &quot;ProStars&quot; in 1991. In December 2016, Gretzky made a cameo on a Christmas episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as a winter character.

Gretzky is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, having become a naturalized citizen of the latter.

===Family===

While serving as a judge on &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, Gretzky met actress Janet Jones. According to Gretzky, Jones does not recall his being on the show. They met regularly after that, but did not become a couple until 1987 when they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Lakers game. Gretzky proposed in January 1988, and they were married on July 16, 1988, in a lavish ceremony the Canadian press dubbed &quot;The Royal Wedding&quot;. Broadcast live throughout Canada from Edmonton&#x27;s St. Joseph&#x27;s Basilica, members of the Fire Department acted as ceremonial guards. The event reportedly cost Gretzky over US$1 million.

The couple have five children: Paulina, Ty, Trevor, Tristan, and Emma. Paulina and golfer Dustin Johnson announced their engagement on August 18, 2013, and married on April 23, 2022, in Tennessee. Ty played hockey at Shattuck-Saint Mary&#x27;s, but quit the sport, and attended Arizona State University. Trevor is a former minor league baseball player.

His father Walter died in 2021 at the age of 82.

===Business ventures===
Gretzky owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes. In 1985, Gretzky bought the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for . During his ownership, the team&#x27;s colours were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colours when he played for the Los Angeles Kings. For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had their training camp at the Olympiques&#x27; arena. Gretzky sold the team in 1992 for .
In 1991, McNall purchased the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) with Gretzky and John Candy as minority owners. The club won the Grey Cup championship in the first year of the partnership but struggled in the two following seasons, and the partnership sold the team before the 1994 season. Only McNall&#x27;s name was engraved on the Grey Cup as team owner, but in November 2007, the CFL corrected the oversight, adding Gretzky&#x27;s and Candy&#x27;s names. In 1992, Gretzky and McNall partnered in an investment to buy a rare T206 cigarette card of Honus Wagner for US$451,000, later selling the card. It most recently sold for US$2.8 million. The pair also owned Thoroughbred race horses; one of them, Saumarez, won France&#x27;s Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in 1990. Gretzky was a board member and executive officer of the Hespeler Hockey Company.

Gretzky&#x27;s appeal as a product endorser far surpassed that of other hockey players of his era. By 1995, he was among the five highest-paid athlete endorsers in North America, with deals from The Coca-Cola Company, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Sharp Corporation, and Upper Deck Company among others. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimates that Gretzky made US$93.8 million from 1990 to 1998. He has endorsed and launched a wide variety of products, from pillowcases to insurance. Gretzky is a partner in First Team Sports, a maker of sports equipment and Worldwide Roller Hockey, Inc., an operator of roller hockey rinks. The video game brand EA Sports included Gretzky in its 2010 title &quot;NHL Slapshot&quot;, and he had previously been an endorser for Page 44 Studios and Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s video games &quot;Gretzky NHL 2005&quot; and &quot;Gretzky NHL 06&quot;.

In 2017, as part-owner with Andrew Peller Ltd., Gretzky opened a winery and distillery named &quot;Wayne Gretzky Estates&quot; in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, with products labelled by the trademark &quot;No. 99&quot;. From 1993 to 2020, Gretzky and a business partner operated the &quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s&quot; restaurant near the Rogers Centre in downtown Toronto. Gretzky has other restaurants opened in 2016 at the Edmonton International Airport and named &quot;No. 99 Gretzky&#x27;s Wine &amp; Whisky&quot;, and in 2018 called &quot;Studio 99&quot; at Rogers Place in Edmonton, Alberta.

===Books===
Gretzky has written several books, including &quot;Gretzky: An Autobiography&quot; (1990), with Rick Reilly, and &quot;99: My Life in Pictures&quot; (1999), with John Davidson and Dan Diamond. His most recent work, &quot;99: Stories of the Game&quot; (2016), with Kirstie McLellan Day, was an in-depth look at the history of hockey. It was the best-selling Canadian book of 2016.

===Political activity===

Gretzky has aligned himself with the Conservative Party in Canada and Republican politicians in the United States.

In 2003, while not criticizing Canada for declining to participate in the invasion of Iraq, Gretzky praised US President George W. Bush and his handling of the conflict, saying: &quot;the President of the United States is a great leader, I happen to think he&#x27;s a wonderful man and if he believes what he&#x27;s doing is right, I back him 100 per cent.&quot;

In 2014, Gretzky, who has some Ukrainian heritage, was invited by Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk to speak at the United for Ukraine Gala fundraiser in Toronto in support of the country during the invasion of Crimea by Russia. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gretzky supported calls to ban Russian teams from international events as a consequence. The following month, he shared a ceremonial puck-drop with a Ukrainian hockey player.

During the 2015 Canadian federal election campaign, Gretzky endorsed the Conservative Party and Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and was featured at a campaign rally praising Harper as &quot;wonderful to the country&quot;. As a non-resident, Gretzky came under some criticism for this endorsement. In 2014, Gretzky praised Harper at a fundraiser in Toronto, calling him &quot;one of the greatest prime ministers ever&quot;. In 2015, Gretzky endorsed Patrick Brown during his successful campaign for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. 

In 2024, Wayne and his family attended the victory party for Donald Trump during the 2024 United States presidential election. Trump subsequently suggested Wayne Gretzky should be prime minister of Canada. According to Trump, when he suggested Gretzky run for prime minister, Gretzky said &quot;Am I going to run for prime minister or governor, you tell me.&quot; Trump replied, &quot;I don’t know, let’s make it governor. I like it better.&quot; Gretzky&#x27;s position also resulted in adverse reactions from fans when the NHL awarded Gretzky the honorary team captain for Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off February 2025 finals. Gretzky did not wear a Team Canada jersey, unlike the American honorary captain, who wore a Team USA jersey. Gretzky also gave a &quot;thumbs up&quot; to the American team as he came on the ice, but did not give any similar gesture to the Canadian team. Following the 4-Nations Face-Off, a petition circulated on Reddit calling for the renaming of Wayne Gretzky Drive in Edmonton due to some fans feeling Gretzky betrayed Canada.

==Legacy==
===Hockey===
Gretzky&#x27;s career achievements include a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL. Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL&#x27;s season points leader, 10 times. Gretzky was named the MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs in 1985 and 1988, receiving the Conn Smythe Trophy. In addition, he earned the Lester B. Pearson Award (now Ted Lindsay Award) on five occasions; the award is given to the NHL&#x27;s &quot;most outstanding player&quot;, as determined by National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association members. The Lady Byng Trophy, awarded for sportsmanship and performance, was presented to Gretzky five times between 1980 and 1999. Gretzky was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1999, and into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000. He was an inaugural recipient of the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2012.

The Wayne Gretzky International Award is presented by the United States Hockey Hall of Fame to honour international individuals who have made major contributions to the growth and advancement of hockey in the United States. The Wayne Gretzky 99 Award is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player in the Ontario Hockey League playoffs. The Wayne Gretzky Trophy is awarded annually to the playoff champion of the OHL&#x27;s Western Conference. The Edmonton Minor Hockey Association also has an award named for Gretzky.

In May 2021, one of his 1979 O-Pee-Chee hockey cards sold for .

===Order of Canada===
In 1984, Gretzky was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada, the mid-level grade of the order. The citation describes him as: 

The citation also mentions his philanthropy, particularly in support of CNIB Foundation. 

Gretzky did not come to Ottawa for the investiture in the Order for fourteen years. When he came, his investiture was conducted in private.

Gretzky was promoted to the highest rank, a Companion of the Order of Canada, in 2009. The citation for the promotion describes him as 

As of 2025, he has not attended in Ottawa for the investiture as a Companion. His agent stated in 2015 that Gretzky has had trouble fitting one into his schedule. Investitures are held four times a year. Gretzky has been in Canada at various times in the past fifteen years, including for political events.

One of the leading experts on Canada&#x27;s honours system, Christopher McCreery, has criticised Gretzky for not attending an investiture: &quot;I’ve probably met 1,000 recipients of the Order of Canada. It’s a highlight of their lives—their country saying thank you.&quot; McCreery added that not attending the investiture is &quot;insulting to the others who get them. All are supposed to be in the same category, yet they think they are on a plane above everybody else&quot;.

A spokesperson for the Governor General&#x27;s office confirmed in 2015 that the office had made attempts to arrange for an investiture. She also stated that between 1967 and 2015, there had been 467 individuals appointed as Companions. She added: &quot;Of this number, there are five Companions, including Mr. Gretzky, who have not been invested. Two were appointed within the last six months. Two others are deceased.&quot;

<doc id="33426" wikidata="Q193068" url="?curid=33426" title="Wave–particle duality">
<text>Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that fundamental entities of the universe, like photons and electrons, exhibit particle or wave properties according to the experimental circumstances. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts such as particle or wave to fully describe the behavior of quantum objects. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, light was found to behave as a wave then later discovered to have a particulate-like behavior, whereas electrons behaved like particles in early experiments then later discovered to have wave-like behavior. The concept of duality arose to name these seeming contradictions.

== History ==

=== Wave-particle duality of light ===
In the late 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton had advocated that light was corpuscular (particulate), but Christiaan Huygens took an opposing wave description. While Newton had favored a particle approach, he was the first to attempt to reconcile both wave and particle theories of light, and the only one in his time to consider both, thereby anticipating modern wave-particle duality. Thomas Young&#x27;s interference experiments in 1801, and François Arago&#x27;s detection of the Poisson spot in 1819, validated Huygens&#x27; wave models. However, the wave model was challenged in 1901 by Planck&#x27;s law for black-body radiation. Max Planck heuristically derived a formula for the observed spectrum by assuming that a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black-body radiation could only change its energy in a minimal increment, &quot;E&quot;, that was proportional to the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave. In 1905 Einstein interpreted the photoelectric effect also with discrete energies for photons. These both indicate particle behavior. Despite confirmation by various experimental observations, the photon theory (as it came to be called) remained controversial until Arthur Compton performed a series of experiments from 1922 to 1924 demonstrating the momentum of light. The experimental evidence of particle-like momentum and energy seemingly contradicted the earlier work demonstrating wave-like interference of light.

=== Wave-particle duality of matter ===

The contradictory evidence from electrons arrived in the opposite order. Many experiments by J. J. Thomson, Robert Millikan, and Charles Wilson among others had shown that free electrons had particle properties, for instance, the measurement of their mass by Thomson in 1897. In 1924, Louis de Broglie introduced his theory of electron waves in his PhD thesis &quot;Recherches sur la théorie des quanta&quot;. He suggested that an electron around a nucleus could be thought of as being a standing wave and that electrons and all matter could be considered as waves. He merged the idea of thinking about them as particles, and of thinking of them as waves. He proposed that particles are bundles of waves (wave packets) that move with a group velocity and have an effective mass. Both of these depend upon the energy, which in turn connects to the wavevector and the relativistic formulation of Albert Einstein a few years before.

Following de Broglie&#x27;s proposal of wave–particle duality of electrons, in 1925 to 1926, Erwin Schrödinger developed the wave equation of motion for electrons. This rapidly became part of what was called by Schrödinger &quot;undulatory mechanics&quot;, now called the Schrödinger equation and also &quot;wave mechanics&quot;.

In 1926, Max Born gave a talk in an Oxford meeting about using the electron diffraction experiments to confirm the wave–particle duality of electrons. In his talk, Born cited experimental data from Clinton Davisson in 1923. It happened that Davisson also attended that talk. Davisson returned to his lab in the US to switch his experimental focus to test the wave property of electrons.

In 1927, the wave nature of electrons was empirically confirmed by two experiments. The Davisson–Germer experiment at Bell Labs measured electrons scattered from Ni metal surfaces. George Paget Thomson and Alexander Reid at Cambridge University scattered electrons through thin metal films and observed concentric diffraction rings. Alexander Reid, who was Thomson&#x27;s graduate student, performed the first experiments, but he died soon after in a motorcycle accident and is rarely mentioned. These experiments were rapidly followed by the first non-relativistic diffraction model for electrons by Hans Bethe based upon the Schrödinger equation, which is very close to how electron diffraction is now described. Significantly, Davisson and Germer noticed that their results could not be interpreted using a Bragg&#x27;s law approach as the positions were systematically different; the approach of Bethe, which includes the refraction due to the average potential, yielded more accurate results. Davisson and Thomson were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1937 for experimental verification of wave property of electrons by diffraction experiments. Similar crystal diffraction experiments were carried out by Otto Stern in the 1930s using beams of helium atoms and hydrogen molecules. These experiments further verified that wave behavior is not limited to electrons and is a general property of matter on a microscopic scale.

== Classical waves and particles ==
Before proceeding further, it is critical to introduce some definitions of waves and particles both in a classical sense and in quantum mechanics. Waves and particles are two very different models for physical systems, each with an exceptionally large range of application. Classical waves obey the wave equation; they have continuous values at many points in space that vary with time; their spatial extent can vary with time due to diffraction, and they display wave interference. Physical systems exhibiting wave behavior and described by the mathematics of wave equations include water waves, seismic waves, sound waves, radio waves, and more.

Classical particles obey classical mechanics; they have some center of mass and extent; they follow trajectories characterized by positions and velocities that vary over time; in the absence of forces their trajectories are straight lines. Stars, planets, spacecraft, tennis balls, bullets, sand grains: particle models work across a huge scale. Unlike waves, particles do not exhibit interference.
Some experiments on quantum systems show wave-like interference and diffraction; some experiments show particle-like collisions.

Quantum systems obey wave equations that predict particle probability distributions. These particles are associated with discrete values called quanta for properties such as spin, electric charge and magnetic moment. These particles arrive one at time, randomly, but build up a pattern. The probability that experiments will measure particles at a point in space is the square of a complex-number valued wave. Experiments can be designed to exhibit diffraction and interference of the probability amplitude. Thus statistically large numbers of the random particle appearances can display wave-like properties. Similar equations govern collective excitations called quasiparticles.

== Electrons behaving as waves and particles ==

The electron double slit experiment is a textbook demonstration of wave-particle duality. A modern version of the experiment is shown schematically in the figure below.

Electrons from the source hit a wall with two thin slits. A mask behind the slits can expose either one or open to expose both slits. The results for high electron intensity are shown on the right, first for each slit individually, then with both slits open. With either slit open there is a smooth intensity variation due to diffraction. When both slits are open the intensity oscillates, characteristic of wave interference.

Having observed wave behavior, now change the experiment, lowering the intensity of the electron source until only one or two are detected per second, appearing as individual particles, dots in the video. As shown in the movie clip below, the dots on the detector seem at first to be random. After some time a pattern emerges, eventually forming an alternating sequence of light and dark bands.

The experiment shows wave interference revealed a single particle at a time—quantum mechanical electrons display both wave and particle behavior. Similar results have been shown for atoms and even large molecules.

== Observing photons as particles ==
While electrons were thought to be particles until their wave properties were discovered; for photons it was the opposite. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz observed that when light with sufficient frequency hits a metallic surface, the surface emits cathode rays, what are now called electrons. In 1902, Philipp Lenard discovered that the maximum possible energy of an ejected electron is unrelated to its intensity. This observation is at odds with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that the electron&#x27;s energy should be proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation. In 1905, Albert Einstein suggested that the energy of the light must occur a finite number of energy quanta. He postulated that electrons can receive energy from an electromagnetic field only in discrete units (quanta or photons): an amount of energy &quot;E&quot; that was related to the frequency &quot;f&quot; of the light by

: formula_1
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant (6.626×10−34 J⋅s). Only photons of a high enough frequency (above a certain &quot;threshold&quot; value which is the work function) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal he used, but photons of red light did not. One photon of light above the threshold frequency could release only one electron; the higher the frequency of a photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, but no amount of light below the threshold frequency could release an electron. Despite confirmation by various experimental observations, the photon theory (as it came to be called later) remained controversial until Arthur Compton performed a series of experiments from 1922 to 1924 demonstrating the momentum of light.

Both discrete (quantized) energies and also momentum are, classically, particle attributes. There are many other examples where photons display particle-type properties, for instance in solar sails, where sunlight could propel a space vehicle and laser cooling where the momentum is used to slow down (cool) atoms. These are a different aspect of wave-particle duality.

== Which slit experiments ==
In a &quot;which way&quot; experiment, particle detectors are placed at the slits to determine which slit the electron traveled through. When these detectors are inserted, quantum mechanics predicts that the interference pattern disappears because the detected part of the electron wave has changed (loss of coherence). Many similar proposals have been made and many have been converted into experiments and tried out. Every single one shows the same result: as soon as electron trajectories are detected, interference disappears.

A simple example of these &quot;which way&quot; experiments uses a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, a device based on lasers and mirrors sketched below.

A laser beam along the input port splits at a half-silvered mirror. Part of the beam continues straight, passes though a glass phase shifter, then reflects downward. The other part of the beam reflects from the first mirror then turns at another mirror. The two beams meet at a second half-silvered beam splitter.

Each output port has a camera to record the results. The two beams show interference characteristic of wave propagation. If the laser intensity is turned sufficiently low, individual dots appear on the cameras, building up the pattern as in the electron example.

The first beam-splitter mirror acts like double slits, but in the interferometer case we can remove the second beam splitter. Then the beam heading down ends up in output port 1: any photon particles on this path gets counted in that port. The beam going across the top ends up on output port 2. In either case the counts will track the photon trajectories. However, as soon as the second beam splitter is removed the interference pattern disappears.

<text>Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software and FormGen. Originally released on May 5, 1992, for DOS, it was inspired by the 1981 Muse Software video game &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, and is the third installment in the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; series. In &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, the player assumes the role of Allied spy William &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz during World War II as he escapes from the Nazi German prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses each of the game&#x27;s levels to find an elevator to the next level or kill a final boss, fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with a knife and a variety of guns.

&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was the second major independent release by id Software, after the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer John Carmack experimented with making a fast 3D game engine by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single plane, producing &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot; and &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly &quot;Keen&quot; to a more violent theme, programmer John Romero suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; as a fast-paced action game. He and designer Tom Hall designed the game, built on Carmack&#x27;s engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; features artwork by Adrian Carmack and sound effects and music by Bobby Prince. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the shareware model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.

&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was a critical and commercial success and is considered one of the greatest video games ever made. It garnered numerous awards and sold over 250,000 copies by the end of 1995. It has been termed the &quot;grandfather of 3D shooters&quot;, and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; series have been developed by other companies since 2001.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; is a first-person shooter presented with rudimentary 3D graphics. The game is broken up into levels, each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height. Each level is themed after Nazi bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator. Levels—ten in the original episodes—are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy. While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and health. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire chain gun. The player can also find keys that allow them to pass through locked doors. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.

The player&#x27;s health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player&#x27;s health falls to zero, they lose one life and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with four lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player&#x27;s completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.

==Plot==
&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; is divided into two sets of three episodes: &quot;Escape from Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, &quot;Operation: Eisenfaust&quot;, and &quot;Die, Führer, Die!&quot; serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled &quot;The Nocturnal Missions&quot; including &quot;A Dark Secret&quot;, &quot;Trail of the Madman&quot;, and &quot;Confrontation&quot;. The protagonist is William &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz, an American spy of Polish descent, and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In &quot;Escape&quot;, Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. &quot;Operation: Eisenfaust&quot; follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of undead mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in &quot;Die, Führer, Die!&quot; he infiltrates a bunker under the Reichstag, culminating in a battle with Adolf Hitler in a robotic suit equipped with four chain guns.

&quot;The Nocturnal Missions&quot; form a prequel storyline dealing with German plans for chemical warfare. &quot;A Dark Secret&quot; deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. &quot;Trail of the Madman&quot; takes place in Castle Erlangen, where Blazkowicz&#x27;s goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in &quot;Confrontation&quot;, which is set in Castle Offenbach as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.

===Spear of Destiny===
An additional episode, titled &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, was released as a retail game by FormGen. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the Spear of Destiny from the Nazis after it was stolen from Versailles. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, &quot;Return to Danger&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Challenge&quot;, each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to build a nuclear weapon or summon demons.

==Development==

In October–December 1990, a team of employees from programming studio Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game &quot;Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons&quot;, the first game in the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developing games for the &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edge&quot; video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December through shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game—the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack&#x27;s house on the weekends—the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edge&quot;, one every two months.

Ideas from the Deep, now formally established as id Software, used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games. Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with 3D computer graphics, which until then was largely the purview of flight simulation games such as &quot;Wing Commander&quot; (1990) or wireframe 3D in games on mainframe computers. Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of personal computers of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast action game in 3D due to the number of surfaces it needed to calculate, but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible. During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through ray casting, in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D game engine that used animated 2D sprites for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot;, in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters. In the fall of 1991, after the team—sans Wilbur—had relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, and he had largely finished the engine work for &quot;Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy&quot;, Carmack decided to implement a feature from &quot;Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss&quot;, a role-playing game in development by Blue Sky Productions. &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; was planned to display texture-mapped 3D graphics without &quot;Hovertank&quot;″s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting. Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine&#x27;s speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as &quot;Underworld&quot; was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot; for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot;. Upon seeing it, Scott Miller of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.
In November 1991, with the second &quot;Commander Keen&quot; trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially wanted to do a third &quot;Keen&quot; trilogy, recognized that Carmack&#x27;s programming focus had shifted from the 2D side-scrolling platform game series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, &quot;It&#x27;s Green and Pissed&quot;, Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;. The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack&#x27;s 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of &quot;Keen&quot; into something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a &quot;loud&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay. He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company&#x27;s designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.

Initially the team believed that they would be unable to use the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles. They contacted &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; developer Silas Warner, but learned that Muse Software had shut down in 1986, with all rights to &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; sold. The rights last belonged to someone in Michigan, and the team was able to purchase the trademark around mid-April 1992 for US$5,000. Thus they were free to use the name &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he guaranteed id a US$100,000 payment on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id&#x27;s probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; project to FormGen, which had published id&#x27;s December 1991 &quot;Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter&quot;, overcoming the publisher&#x27;s concerns over &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;″s proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.
The project officially began on December 15, 1991. Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics. Romero wanted the goal to be &quot;to mow down Nazis&quot;, with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of SS soldiers and Hitler himself, as well as dogs, blood &quot;like you never see in games&quot;, and straightforward, lethal weapons. He also composed the general storyline for the game. Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items. He also did sketches for the bosses and the title screen. Carmack programmed &quot;the core&quot; of the game&#x27;s engine in a month; he added a few features to the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine from &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot;, including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics. The game was programmed chiefly in ANSI C, with its scaling and ray casting routines written in assembly. The graphics for the game were planned to be in 16 color EGA, but were changed to 256 color VGA four months before release, which also enabled the game to have higher resolutions. Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay. The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack using Electronic Arts&#x27;s &quot;Deluxe Paint II&quot;. Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures, but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game. The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and paid homage with a hidden &quot;Pac-Man&quot; level. Romero later said in 2017 that making the levels was uninteresting compared to those from &quot;Commander Keen&quot; and had to prompt Hall to finish the maps with the promise of being able to buy himself a brand new car. The team was going to include some anti-fascist references and Nazi atrocities, but left them out to avoid controversies. They ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by &quot;Keen&quot; composer Bobby Prince to make the guns sound exciting. Prince took some inspiration from his days as a platoon soldier in the US Army. With the aid of a 16-bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder, he composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to Foley sounds. The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies. Some of the enemy shouts were based on the original &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; game.

As development continued, id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud as an assistant artist, and moved the company out to Mesquite, Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, &quot;ScubaVenture&quot;, so that id could focus on &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;. The game was intended to be released using Apogee&#x27;s shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. The level maps were designed in 2D using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which had been used for the entire &quot;Keen&quot; series as well as several other games. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.

As the game neared completion, FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode. The team also added &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, the anthem of the Nazi Party, to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. The team did a month of playtesting in the final stage of the game&#x27;s development. In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to bulletin board systems. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team&#x27;s rent and US$750 per month salaries, plus around US$6,500 for the computer John Carmack used to develop the engine and the US$5,000 to get the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; trademark.

The following summer, most of the id Software team developed &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;. The single-episode game was a prequel to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and used the same engine, but added new audio, graphics, and enemies. It was created in two months, and was published commercially by FormGen in September 1992. The publisher was concerned that the material would be controversial due to holy relics associated with World WarII, but Romero felt it was similar to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films. Instead of working on the game, John Carmack experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for &quot;ShadowCaster&quot; and became the basis of the engine for id&#x27;s next game, &quot;Doom&quot; (1993).

==Release==
The first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled &quot;The Nocturnal Missions&quot;. Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game. In 1993 Apogee also published the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades&quot; pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called &quot;WolfMaster&quot;, along with a map editor titled &quot;MapEdit&quot; and a random level generator named &quot;Wolf Creator&quot;. A retail &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled &quot;Return to Danger&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Challenge&quot;, each the same length as &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, in May 1994, and later that year published &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot; and the two mission packs together as the &quot;Spear of Destiny Super CD Package&quot;. Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through GT Software in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through Activision in 1998.

There were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release, both of which were cancelled. A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading &quot;Call Apogee and say Aardwolf&quot; (&quot;Snapity&quot; in beta versions); it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize (consisting of US$1,000 or a line of Apogee games for life), but the quick creation of level editors and cheat programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea. Additionally, after completing an episode the player is given a three-letter code in addition to their total score and time. This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high-score contest, but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced.

Imagineer bought the rights for the game, and commissioned id to port the game to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) for a US$100,000 advance. The team was busy with the development of &quot;Doom&quot;, plus their work on &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, and ignored the project for seven or eight months, finally hiring Rebecca Heineman to do the work. She made no progress on the port, however, and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March 1993. This version was written in C and compiled in the 65816 assembly language, making use of binary space partitioning rather than raycasting in order to give it speed. Carmack had to resize existing images to fit the SNES resolution. Nintendo insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies; this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it, removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips, and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats. The port was released in Japan on February 10, 1994, under the name &quot;Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust&quot; before being released in North America and Europe later that year. Using the source code of the SNES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the Atari Jaguar. Atari Corporation approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by Dave Taylor, improving the port&#x27;s graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version. He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on. The game itself, however, had to be slowed down to work properly on the console.

&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; has also been ported to numerous other platforms. In 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology licensed &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and converted it into a virtual reality arcade game. The 1994 Acorn Archimedes port was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software. By 1994, a port for the Sega Mega Drive was under development by Imagineer, who intended to release it by September, but it was cancelled due to technical problems. The 1994 Classic Mac OS version of the game had three releases: &quot;The First Encounter&quot;, a shareware release; &quot;The Second Encounter&quot;, with 30 exclusive levels; and &quot;The Third Encounter&quot;, with all 60 levels from the DOS version. An Atari Lynx version of the game was offered earlier by Atari for id, but work on the port was never started, save for a few images. A 3DO version was released in October 1995. The Apple IIGS port was started in Fall 1994 by Vitesse with Heineman as the initial developer, with later graphics assistance by Ninjaforce Entertainment, but due to licensing problems with id it was not released until February 1998. An open source iOS port programmed by John Carmack himself was released in 2009. An unofficial port for the Game Boy Color was made in 2016. An Android port titled &quot;Wolfenstein 3D Touch&quot; (later renamed &quot;ECWolf&quot;) was released and published by Beloko Games. Other releases include the Game Boy Advance (2002), Xbox Live Arcade, and PlayStation Network. These ports&#x27; sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, and a 2007 Steam release for PC, macOS, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes. Bethesda Softworks, whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;″s release by producing a free-to-play browser-based version of the game in 2012, though the website was removed a few years later.

==Reception==
The developers had no clear expectations for &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;″s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000. The game was selling at a rate of 4,000 copies a month by mail order. &quot;PC Zone&quot; quoted a shareware distributor as saying &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was the top shareware seller of 1992. By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; as well as &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot; had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space. By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id Software had sold another 150,000 retail copies of &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide. Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being banned from sale in Germany due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons in 1994, and again in 1997 for &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;. Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewed the game five months after release, describing it as: &quot;View from the character&#x27;s point of view: It&#x27;s a real shooter. The game is easy to play, and it runs well ... This is the only game of its type.&quot; The Apogee episodes&#x27; sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer&#x27;s earlier &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where &quot;Commander Keen&quot; games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; averaged $200,000 per month for the first year and a half. The game sold 250,000 copies by 1995 and grossed $2.5 million in revenue.

&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; won the 1992 Best Arcade game award from &quot;Compute!&quot;, the 1992 Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot;, the 1992 Reader&#x27;s Choice — Action/Arcade Game award from &quot;Game Bytes&quot;, the 1993 Best Action/Arcade Game, Best Entertainment Software, and People&#x27;s Choice awards at the Shareware Industry Awards, the 1993 Best Action Game award from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and a Codie award from the Software Publishers Association for Best Action/Arcade Game. It was the first shareware title to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) became the smallest company to ever receive the award. &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was noted as one of the top games of the year at the 1993 Game Developers Conference.

&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was well received by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised the &quot;sparse [but] gorgeous&quot;, &quot;frighteningly realistic&quot;, and &quot;extremely violent&quot; graphics, as well as the immersive sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned &quot;those sensitive to such things to stay home&quot;. Lombardi concluded that &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, alongside &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; released two months prior, was &quot;the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief–suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment&quot;, stating that they knew of no other game that could &quot;evoke such intense psychological responses from its players&quot;. &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; twice received 5 out of 5 stars in &quot;Dragon&quot; in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it &quot;definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC&quot;, highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the &quot;fast-paced action&quot; could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence. Sandy Petersen, in the first &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column, claimed that &quot;there is nothing else quite like &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;&quot; and that it had &quot;evolved almost beyond recognition&quot; from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it &quot;a fun game with lots of action&quot; and &quot;a fun, fairly mindless romp&quot;, though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard. The &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot; retail episode was also rated highly by &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes. Formgen&#x27;s &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot; mission packs &quot;Return to Danger&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Challenge&quot; were reviewed by Paul Hyman of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, who praised the updated graphical details and sound, as well as the smooth gameplay, but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game.

The early ports of the game also received high reviews, though their sales have been described as &quot;dismal&quot;. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; ranked the game 84th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot; list. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; rated the Jaguar version similarly to the Super NES version, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play. A &quot;GamePro&quot; review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; &quot;set a new standard for PC gaming&quot; and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic, terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games. Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild, stating that &quot;there isn&#x27;t a staggering amount of freshness here, but the action is fast, deadly, and (surprise) addictive&quot;.

Major Mike of &quot;GamePro&quot; commended the 3DO version&#x27;s complete absence of pixelation, fast scaling, &quot;rousing&quot; music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, &quot;still packs a punch as a first-person shooter&quot;. &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; won &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed &quot;The Need for Speed&quot; and &quot;D&quot;. &quot;Maximum&quot;, on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like &quot;&quot; and the PlayStation version of &quot;Doom&quot; that a new port was pointless, with the game now &quot;somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; asserted that &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was &quot;still as addictive as it ever was&quot; but essentially agreed with &quot;Maximum&quot;, contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or &quot;moved on&quot; to more advanced games in the genre. More modern reviews include one for the Xbox 360 port in 2009 by Ryan McCaffrey of &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot;, who heavily criticized it for non-existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to &quot;Doom&quot;, and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was &quot;dated and flawed&quot;, it was &quot;required playing for any first-person shooter fan&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; has been called the &quot;grandfather of 3D shooters&quot;, specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre&#x27;s popularity. It has also been called &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of shooters&quot;. Although some prior computer shooting-based games existed, they were generally scrolling shooters, while &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; helped move the market towards first-person shooters. It has also been credited with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time; &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; claimed in September 1992 that the game &quot;justified the existence of shareware&quot;, and in July 1993 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; claimed that it &quot;almost single-handedly&quot; demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing, leading to a wave of other shareware first-person shooters. The game&#x27;s high revenue compared to prior, smaller 2D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger, 3D titles built by larger development teams.

During development, id approached Sierra Entertainment, then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing &quot;Commander Keen&quot; and an early version of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams&#x27;s seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future. By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, &quot;Doom&quot;, the success of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; the 97th-best computer game ever released. 

The game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its &quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot; section 86a up through 2018. Section 86a had &quot;social adequacy&quot; allowances for works of art, but in 1998, a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; determined that video games did not fall under this allowance. The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences, &quot;this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them, which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas&quot;. Up through 2018, the Germany software ratings board, the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK) refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery, effectively banning the game for sale within the country. By May 2018, a new court ruling was made in response to a parody web browser game, in which the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office confirmed there were no breaches of the law in the game&#x27;s content. Following this, the ban was reversed by the German government in August, having determined that the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings, and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance. In November 2019, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was formally struck from the &quot;Index&quot;, the list of games banned from sale in Germany.

After the game&#x27;s release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine or derivatives of it include &quot;Blake Stone&quot;, the Capstone Software games &quot;Corridor 7&quot; and &quot;Operation Body Count&quot;, as well as &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled &quot;Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II&quot;, designed by Tom Hall using the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;. Additionally, Softdisk produced &quot;Catacomb Abyss&quot; using the prototype &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine from &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; as part of the &quot;Catacomb Adventure Series&quot; trilogy of sequels. Although &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game&#x27;s content. John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others. The modding efforts of &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games. The source code for the original &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release. The game&#x27;s technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as &quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Nitemare 3D&quot;, &quot;The Terminator: Rampage&quot;, &quot;Terminal Terror&quot; and &quot;The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki&quot;, among others.

Although id Software did not develop another &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; game, as their development focus shifted to &quot;Doom&quot; shortly after release, and has never returned to the series, multiple &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; titles have been produced by other companies, sometimes using game engines developed by id. The first of these newer &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; games was &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; in 2001, a reboot of the series, and the most recent titles are the 2019 games &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="33431" wikidata="Q360141" url="?curid=33431" title="Whidbey Island">
<text>Whidbey Island (historical spellings Whidby, Whitbey, or Whitby) is the largest of the islands composing Island County, Washington, in the United States, and the largest island in Washington state. Whidbey is about north of Seattle, and lies between the Olympic Peninsula and the I-5 corridor of western Washington. The island forms the northern boundary of Puget Sound. It is home to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. The state parks and natural forests are home to numerous old growth trees.

According to the 2000 census, Whidbey Island was home to 67,000 residents with an estimated 29,000 of those living in rural locations. This increased slightly to 69,480 residents as of the 2010 census.

Whidbey Island is approximately from north to south, and wide, with a total land area of , making it the 40th largest island in the United States. It is ranked as the fourth longest and fourth largest island in the contiguous United States, behind Long Island, New York; Padre Island, Texas (the world&#x27;s longest barrier island); and Isle Royale, Michigan. In the state of Washington, it is the largest island, followed by Orcas Island.

== History ==
Whidbey Island was inhabited by members of the Lower Skagit, Swinomish, Suquamish, Snohomish and other Native American tribes. The Salishan name for the island was Tscha-kole-chy. These were peaceful groups who lived off the sea and land, with fishing, harvesting nuts, berries and roots, which they preserved over the winter.

The first known European sighting of Whidbey Island was during the 1790 Spanish expedition of Manuel Quimper and Gonzalo López de Haro on the &quot;Princesa Real&quot;.

Captain George Vancouver fully explored the island in 1792. In May of that year, Royal Navy officers and members of Vancouver&#x27;s expedition, Joseph Whidbey (master of HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;) and Peter Puget (a lieutenant on the ship), began to map and explore the areas of what would later be named Puget Sound. After Whidbey circumnavigated the island in June 1792, Vancouver named the island in his honor. By that time, Vancouver had claimed the area for Britain. On 4 June 1792, the King&#x27;s Birthday, near Possession Point at the southern end of Whidbey Island, Vancouver took formal possession of all the coast and hinterland contiguous to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, including Puget Sound, under the name of New Georgia.

The first known overnight stay by a non-Native American was made on May 26, 1840, by a Catholic missionary, Father François Norbert Blanchet, during travel across Puget Sound. He had been invited by Chief Tslalakum. Blanchet remained on the island for nearly a year and guided the inhabitants in building a new log church.

Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–1842, sailed the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; into Penn Cove in 1841. By that time, the log church was already being built by the Native Americans beside a huge wooden cross (24 feet long) that they had erected. Wilkes ordered his men to use no force except in self-defense when dealing with the &quot;savage and treacherous inhabitants&quot;. In fact, he encountered few problems with the indigenous people who had already been poorly treated by visitors and suffered from diseases they had introduced.

Wilkes named the lower cove Holmes Harbor, after his assistant surgeon, Silas Holmes. During this time he charted Puget Sound. Other sites in the area that were given names by Wilkes included Maury Island (Vashon), Hammersley Inlet, Totten and Budd Inlets, Agate Passage between the Kitsap Peninsula, Hale Passage and Dana Passage.

The Oregon Treaty of 1846 established the boundary between Britain and the U.S.A. making Puget Sound and islands American. 

Thomas W. Glasgow filed the first land claim on Whidbey Island in 1848, attempting to become the first settler. He built a small cabin near Penn Cove, planted some crops and married a local lady, Julia Pat-Ke-Nim. Glasgow left in August of that year however, having been forced out by the local inhabitants.
Colonel Isaac N. Ebey arrived from Columbus, Ohio, in 1850 and became the first permanent white settler, claiming a square mile (2.6 km2) of prairie with a southern shoreline on Admiralty Inlet. He took advantage of the 640 acres offered free of charge to each married couple, the first to do so, on October 15, 1850. In the fall of 1851, his children, his wife, three of her brothers and the Samuel Crockett family arrived to join Ebey.
In addition to farming potatoes and wheat, Ebey was also the postmaster for Port Townsend, Washington and rowed a boat daily across the inlet in order to work at the post office there. Colonel Ebey also served as a representative in the Oregon Territory Legislative Assembly, as Island County&#x27;s first Justice of the Peace, as a probate judge and as Collector of Customs for the Puget Sound District.

On August 11, 1857, at age 39, Colonel Ebey was murdered and beheaded by Native Americans, said to be Haida who had traveled to this area from Haida Gwaii. Some sources however, refer to his killers as &quot;Russian Indians called Kakes or Kikans, [from] Kufrinoff Island, near the head of Prince Frederick&#x27;s Sound.&quot; Ebey was slain in proxy-retaliation for the killing of a Haida chief or Tyee and 27 other indigenous people at Port Gamble. Fort Ebey, named for the Colonel, was established in 1942 on the west side of the central part of the island, just northwest of Coupeville.

Admiralty Head Lighthouse is located in this area, on the grounds of Fort Casey State Park. The area around Coupeville is the federally protected Ebey&#x27;s Landing National Historical Reserve, named in honor of Isaac Ebey.

On September 25, 1959, a U.S. Navy P5M antisubmarine aircraft with an unarmed (it carried no nuclear material at the time) nuclear depth charge on board crash-landed into Puget Sound near Whidbey Island. The Mark 90 nuclear bomb casing was never recovered.

On August 8, 1970, the infamous Penn Cove capture of several orcas along with the deaths of several orcas occurred in Penn Cove off the island&#x27;s east coast.

In December 1984, the island was the site of a violent encounter between law enforcement and white nationalist and organized crime leader Robert Jay Mathews of the group The Order. A large shootout occurred between Mathews and FBI agents in which Mathews was killed during a house fire. Mathews&#x27; followers have since gathered on the island at the location where he was killed by FBI agents on the anniversary of his death to commemorate it.

On June 10, 2022, the island dedicated one of its trash cans to late night talk show host Conan O&#x27;Brien in an elaborate ceremony in which O&#x27;Brien signed the top of the trash can with a black marker. O&#x27;Brien was visiting the island to attend the premiere of a play written by Liza O&#x27;Brien (his wife).

== Government ==
Whidbey Island, along with Camano Island, Ben Ure Island and six uninhabited islands, comprises Island County, Washington. The county seat is located in the town of Coupeville on Whidbey Island.

Population centers of Whidbey Island include the City of Oak Harbor, the Town of Coupeville, the City of Langley, the Village of Freeland, the Community of Greenbank, the Village of Clinton and the Community of Bayview. Only Oak Harbor, Coupeville and Langley are incorporated, the others (with the exception of Greenbank and Bayview) are all census-designated places, and all but Bayview have their own post offices and ZIP codes.

== Economy ==

Whidbey Island is divided economically into two different regions: the northern end of the island (encompassing Oak Harbor and Whidbey Island Naval Air Station), and the remainder of the island (encompassing Coupeville, Greenbank, Freeland, Langley, Clinton and the smaller communities in-between).

The economy of the northern end of Whidbey Island is strongly influenced by the presence of Whidbey Island Naval Air Station near Oak Harbor (N.A.S. Whidbey). N.A.S. Whidbey is Oak Harbor&#x27;s largest employer; thus, Oak Harbor has a predominantly service-based economy and several national chain stores have been attracted to the Oak Harbor area.

The economy of Whidbey Island south of Oak Harbor relies heavily on tourism, small-scale agriculture, and the arts.

Tourism is especially important for both Whidbey and Camano Islands. On Whidbey, tourists find a wide range of amenities in the towns of Oak Harbor, Coupeville, Freeland and Langley. Coupeville&#x27;s Penn Cove Mussel Farm exports large quantities of its highly renowned Penn Cove Mussels. This aquaculture facility, along with a number of small farms, reflects the rural agricultural nature of most of central Whidbey Island. Many of these small farms host farm stands onsite, where customers may buy produce, flowers, meat, eggs and other locally raised products directly from the farmers.

Whidbey is home to numerous working artists, writers, and performers. These include many well-known painters, sculptors, glass artists, wood workers, metal workers, mixed media artists, photographers, authors, poets, actors, and musicians.

In addition to being a haven for artists, the southern end of Whidbey Island also serves as a minor bedroom community for the nearby cities of Everett, where the Boeing Everett Factory is located, and Seattle. Commuters to and from those areas use the Washington State Ferries system&#x27;s run between Clinton and Mukilteo.

== Geography ==
Whidbey Island is often claimed to be the longest island in the continental United States (or another similar claim), but according to the Seattle Times it cannot be correctly considered so. The island has several bays, including on its east side Oak Harbor with the town of Oak Harbor at its base, and Penn Cove with the towns of Coupeville and San de Fuca on its south and north shores respectively.

Whidbey Island has four lakes that are part of its interior hydrology: Cranberry Lake (inside Deception Pass State Park), Deer Lake, Goss Lake and Lone Lake (both near the town of Langley).

==Parks and reserve areas==
Whidbey Island contains Ebey&#x27;s Landing National Historical Reserve, the first national historic reserve in the US created by the National Park Service to preserve the rural history and culture of the island and to protect the area&#x27;s rare and sensitive plants.

Washington State Parks located on the island include Deception Pass State Park (the most visited state park in Washington), Joseph Whidbey State Park, Fort Ebey State Park, Fort Casey State Park, Possession Point State Park, and South Whidbey State Park. There is also a series of county operated parks throughout the Island including:
* Saratoga Woods, an 120-acre park on the south end of the island that has equestrian, biking and hiking trails. Its also features include an abandoned air field and a glacier erratic.
* Double Bluff County Park, a 3/4-acre park with beach access, a picnic area, and an off-leash dog park.

Earth Sanctuary is a nature reserve, sculpture garden and retreat center on Whidbey Island. The ponds and bog fen complex have been designated as a &quot;habitat of local importance&quot; by the Whidbey Audubon Society and Island County Critical Areas program.

The Price Sculpture Forest opened in October 2020 in Coupeville.

==Festivals==
Whidbey Island hosts many festivals and celebrations throughout the year.
*Whidbey Island Area Fair (&quot;Island County Fair&quot; until 2012), on the third weekend of July, includes rides, food, and animal shows. 
*Wag&#x27;n&#x27;Walk, which takes place towards the end of August, is Western Washington&#x27;s premier celebration of dogs and things dog-related. It includes vendors, games, competition, demonstrations and the Wag&#x27;n&#x27;Walk itself.
*Whidbey Island Kite Festival, in September and includes children&#x27;s kitemaking lessons, a sportkite competition, and sportkite lessons.
* Langley&#x27;s Mystery Weekend in March or February. For the weekend the Town of Langley turns into the setting of a fictional murder mystery.
* Penn Cove Mussel Festival, in March, celebrates the bounty of the sea, especially the mussel.
* Island Shakespeare Festival, July through September.
*Loganberry Festival at the Greenbank Farm in July (This was discontinued after the 2014 festival.)

*Choochokam was an annual street fair and arts festival, started in 1975, held in downtown Langley during the second weekend of July. The last Choochokam was held in 2016.
*Tour de Whidbey, in September, is an organized bike ride with varying routes around Whidbey Island.
*The Whidbey Island Marathon and Half Marathon, in April since 2002.
*Whidbey Island Race Week: a week-long sailing regatta every summer based out of Oak Harbor with daily racing in Penn Cove and/or Saratoga Passage (depending on wind conditions). Usually held third week of July, varies slightly due to tidal conditions.
*Whidbey Island Highland Games – 2nd Saturday in August. Competitions in Scottish Heavy Athletics, Highland Dancing, Pipe and drum bands. 
*Oak Harbor Music Festival – An annual music festival held in the biggest city on the island, Oak Harbor. It is held over Labor Day Weekend, and consists of a wide variety of musical acts.
*DjangoFestNW – An annual 5-day music festival held in mid-September that celebrates the music of Django Reinhardt at Whidbey Island Center for the Arts.

==Climate==

Whidbey Island lies partially in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountain Range to the west, and has a variety of climate zones. This can be observed by rainfall amounts – wettest in the south with average rainfall of , driest in the central district of Coupeville with average rainfall of , and turning moister again farther north with average rainfall of . Microclimates abound, determined by proximity to water, elevation and prevailing winds.

==Ecology==

===Flora===
Vegetation varies greatly from one end of the island to the other. Vegetation in the south is more similar to that of mainland Washington. The principal trees are Douglas fir, red alder, bigleaf maple, western red cedar, western hemlock, and Pacific madrone. Compared to the rest of western Washington state, vine maple is notably absent, except where they have been planted. Other under-story plants include the evergreen huckleberry, lower longleaf Oregon grape, elderberry, salal, oceanspray, and varieties of nettle. Non-native introduced plants such as foxglove, ivy and holly are also evident.

Farther up the island, however, the shorter Oregon-Grape and the blue Evergreen Huckleberry is seen less, while tall Oregon-grape and Red Huckleberry predominate. The native Pacific rhododendron is much more visible. Amongst the deciduous varieties, Garry oak (from which Oak Harbor takes its name) are seen more frequently in the northern portion of the island. In the conifer classification, grand fir is found more in the northern part of Whidbey Island along with Sitka spruce and shore pine. There are three open prairie areas on Whidbey Island – Smith Prairie, Crockett Prairie and Ebey Prairie. Some patches of prickly pear cactus are found along the slopes near Partridge Point.

===Fauna===
Gray whales migrate between Whidbey and Camano Islands during March and April and can be seen from both ship and shore. Orca also make use of the waters surrounding Whidbey Island, including the southern residents. Penn Cove was used as an orca-hunting area in the 1960s and 1970s by aquarium owner Ted Griffin, who captured several young southern resident orcas for sale to marine parks and killed others in the process. The southern residents did not return to Penn Cove until a sighting in 2024.

Clams and oysters are abundant locally and may be harvested from some public beaches. The Washington State Department of Health provides an online guide to assist in identifying shellfish varieties as well as providing guidance about where to find specific varieties.

According to the Whidbey Audubon Society, Approximately 230 bird species are reported to take advantage of the diverse habitats on the island.

== Education ==

=== Public school districts ===
Whidbey Island is served by three public school districts.

Oak Harbor School District operates in Oak Harbor. Within the district, there is one high school, one alternative high school, two middle schools, and five elementary schools. Within the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association, Oak Harbor High is listed as a 3-A school.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
 The only bridge that reaches Whidbey Island is the Deception Pass Bridge, State Route 20, which connects the north end of Whidbey to the mainland via Fidalgo Island. Prior to the completion of the bridge in 1935, Whidbey Island was linked to Fidalgo Island by the Deception Pass ferry, which ran from 1924 to 1935. Modern ferry service is available via State Route 20 on the Coupeville to Port Townsend ferry, and via State Route 525 on the Clinton to Mukilteo ferry service on the southern east coast.

Travel on the island involves use of an extensive county road system, or city infrastructure depending on location, all of which act as feeders to the two state highways State Route 525 and State Route 20.

Whidbey Island&#x27;s State Routes 525/20 is the only nationally designated Scenic Byway on an island. It is appropriately named the &quot;Whidbey Island Scenic Isle Way.&quot; It is also a part of the Cascade Loop.

Public transportation is provided by Island Transit, which provides a zero-fare bus service paid for by a 6/10th of 1% sales tax within the county. There are currently 11 bus routes serving Whidbey Island. No service is available on Sundays or major holidays.

Two public airports provide service to Whidbey Island. Whidbey Air Park is located southwest of Langley with a long runway. A.J. Eisenberg Airport is located southwest of Oak Harbor with a long runway. In addition, there are approximately half dozen private dirt strips on the island. Kenmore Air Express ran a scheduled airline service to Whidbey Island serving the Oak Harbor airport from 2006 to 2009.

The United States Navy operates two airports on Whidbey Island. The largest is a two-runway airport located at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station north of Oak Harbor. In addition, the Navy also operates a flight training facility named Naval Outlying Landing Field Coupeville (Coupeville OLF) located just southeast of Coupeville. The Navy named USS Whidbey Island (LSD-41) in honor of the island.

===Health systems===
Whidbey Health is the regional, county-run hospital. Located in Coupeville, the hospital has an extension clinic in Oak Harbor. The Naval Air Station in Oak Harbor has a limited service hospital for military personnel, veteran retirees, and their dependents.

<text>Writers and Illustrators of the Future is a science fiction and fantasy story and art contest that was established by L. Ron Hubbard in 1983 as Writers of the Future. A sister contest, Illustrators of the Future, was launched in 1988 and presents awards for science fiction art. Hubbard characterized the contest as a way of &quot;giving back&quot; to the field that had defined his professional writing life. The contest has no entry fee. 

Notable past winners include Robert Reed, Dave Wolverton, Nancy Farmer, James Gardner, Scott Nicholson, Ian McHugh and Randy Henderson.

==Contest==

===Writers of the Future===
In 1983, L. Ron Hubbard initiated the &quot;Writers of the Future Writing Contest&quot; with the first awards ceremony held in 1985. Since Hubbard&#x27;s death in 1986 contests have been organized by the Scientologist organization Author Services Inc. under the trade name Galaxy Press. 

The &quot;Writers of the Future&quot; contest is run quarterly and is open to authors who have no, or few, professional publications. The contest rules state that entrants cannot have had published &quot;a novel or short novel, or more than one novelette, or more than three short stories, in any medium. Professional publication is deemed to be payment and at least 5,000 copies or 5,000 hits. Works that are less than 3,000 words and for which payment was less 6c/word do not count as &quot;professional&quot; publications. Stories of up to 17,000 words in length can be submitted to the contest. Poems, screenplays, non-fiction, etc., are not eligible.

Manuscripts are judged with the authors&#x27; names deleted and are separated out in quarterfinal and semifinal award rounds by the Coordinating Judge (previously K. D. Wentworth, Dave Wolverton in 2015, and originally Algis Budrys). Eight finalists are sent to a panel of professional science fiction writers, who determine the top three awards. Prizes are $1000 (first place), $750 (second) and $500 (third). The process is repeated quarterly. At the end of the contest year, the four quarterly first place stories compete for a separate annual grand prize, the &quot;Gold Award,&quot; which includes an additional $5000. The first, second and third-place winners and often a selection of the other finalist stories are published annually, for which the writers receive additional compensation for publication rights. Thus, a grand prize-winning author can make over $6000 for a single story. 

Some finalist stories not considered among the top three (in effect, the fourth or fifth placers) may be included in the annual anthology. These are called &quot;published finalists.&quot; The writers were compensated for publication rights but are not considered winners and receive no prize money. They are eligible to re-enter the contest. 

===Illustrators of the Future===
An artists&#x27; contest, the Illustrators of the Future, was added in 1988. Like the writers&#x27; contest, the illustrators contest is only open to amateurs/beginners. The rules state: &quot;The Contest is open to those who have not previously published more than three black-and-white story illustrations, or more than one process-color painting, in media distributed nationally to the general public, such as magazines or books sold at newsstands, or books sold in stores merchandising to the general public. The submitted entry shall not have been previously published in professional media as exampled above.&quot;

Entrants submit a portfolio of three pieces of artwork, which are circulated among the judges. Up to three winners are selected every quarter, each given a prize of $500. Unlike the writers, the illustrators are not ranked. After the completion of the contest year, each of the twelve illustration winners is assigned one of the stories from among the twelve writer winners and given a month to return the finished illustration. A single grand prize, also called the Gold Award, is accompanied by a prize of $5000 - judging is based only on the final illustration, not the initial portfolio. While the art is judged according to standard artistic considerations (composition, draftsmanship, consistency of lighting, sense of wonder, facial expressions, etc.), a key consideration during the final judging is whether or not the art would make the viewer want to read the accompanying story. The art is also included in the annual anthology, and illustrators are additionally compensated.

===Awards and workshop===
No official tallies are given for the number of entrants in either contest, but it is believed that thousands enter the Writers contest every quarter, while only hundreds enter the illustration contest. Thus, the Illustration judges are sometimes often unable to find three deserving winners, and only pick one or two. Should the illustration winners number less than twelve in a year, each illustrator is - as usual - assigned a single story to illustrate for purposes of determining who wins the Gold Award. All winners and published finalists were invited to attend the annual week-long writers&#x27; and artists&#x27; workshops and awards gala at the invitation and expense of the contest administration. Various Hollywood actors are generally in attendance, in addition to prominent science fiction authors and artists. These include the present judges in addition to a famous and generally elderly writer given a Lifetime Achievement Award. While it is not required to attend the week-long festivities and seminars, it&#x27;s thought by some that those in the running for the Gold Award may advance their cause by displaying professionalism and hard work at that time, judges for the contest, however, refute (/rɪˈfjuːt/ &quot;verb 1.&quot; prove (a statement or theory) to be wrong or false; disprove. &quot;these claims have not been convincingly refuted&quot;) this. 

==Judges==
Many noted writers and artists have judged the awards or have won them themselves.

Notable writing judges have included: Kevin J. Anderson, Gregory Benford, Algis Budrys, Orson Scott Card, Brian Herbert, Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Anne McCaffrey, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Frederik Pohl, Jerry Pournelle, Tim Powers, Brandon Sanderson, Robert J. Sawyer, K. D. Wentworth, and Jack Williamson. 

Prominent art judges have included: Ciruelo Cabral, Edd Cartier, Echo Chernik, Leo and Diane Dillon, Bob Eggleton, Will Eisner, Frank Frazetta, Frank Kelly Freas, Stephen Hickman, and Stephen Youll.

==Winners==
The following is a list of Grand Prize winners in each contest year. Stories by the grand prize winner, the quarterly top-three, and selected others (&quot;published finalists&quot;), are collected into an anthology each year. Winners and published finalists in the contest have included the writers Robert Reed, Dave Wolverton, Nancy Farmer, James Gardner, Scott Nicholson, Ian McHugh and Randy Henderson, and the artist Frank Wu.


==Connections to Scientology==
The original sponsor of the contest was Bridge Publications, Inc., the publishing arm of the Church of Scientology. Prior to the 2004 contest, the sponsorship moved to Author Services Inc. under the trade name Galaxy Press, which was spun off from Bridge to publish Hubbard&#x27;s fiction and the contest anthologies.

The contest has also been characterized as a promotional vehicle for Hubbard himself, who returned to science fiction writing with &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; at about the same time as he began the contest. On the covers of the annual WOTF anthologies, Hubbard&#x27;s name appears prominently. The prominence of Hubbard&#x27;s name and the lavish funding of the contest awards, publicity and ceremonies have led some to speculate that the contest is part of a campaign by the Church of Scientology to promote Hubbard&#x27;s status in the science fiction and literary communities.

Entering or winning the contest does not appear to require or imply endorsement or membership in the Church of Scientology, and the contest itself has been endorsed by a wide range of well-known speculative fiction writers (see Judges and Winners above) who have no relationship to Scientology.

According to Director of the Writers and Illustrators Contests Joni Labaqui, the funds to underwrite the contest—including the cash prizes, the gala awards ceremony and the weeklong pre-awards festivities—come from the Hubbard estate. The Hubbard estate is separate from the Church of Scientology and earns royalties from sales of Hubbard&#x27;s books, including his fiction. Labaqui also reports that staff of Author Services Inc. is entirely made up of Scientologists.

Records with the United States Patent and Trademark Office show that the rights to the Writers of the Future name were transferred from the L. Ron Hubbard estate (&quot;Family Trust-B&quot;) to the Church of Spiritual Technology in 1989, and under the 1993 IRS closing agreement with the Church of Scientology, the L. Ron Hubbard estate became part of the Church of Spiritual Technology, a &quot;Scientology-related entity&quot;.
