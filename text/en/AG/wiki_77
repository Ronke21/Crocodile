<text>A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires are undead humanoid creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today&#x27;s gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. 

Vampiric entities have been recorded in cultures around the world; the term &quot;vampire&quot; was popularized in Western Europe after reports of an 18th-century mass hysteria of a pre-existing folk belief in Southeastern and Eastern Europe that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism.
Local variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as &quot;shtriga&quot; in Albania, &quot;vrykolakas&quot; in Greece and &quot;strigoi&quot; in Romania, cognate to Italian &quot;strega&quot;, meaning &#x27;witch&#x27;.

In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the &quot;chupacabra&quot;) still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body&#x27;s process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalize this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.

The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of &quot;The Vampyre&quot; by the English writer John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot; is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after fellow Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s 1872 novel &quot;Carmilla&quot;. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.

== Etymology and word distribution ==
The exact etymology is unclear. The term &quot;vampire&quot; is the earliest recorded in English, Latin and French and they refer to vampirism in Russia, Poland and North Macedonia. The English term was derived (possibly via French ) from the German , in turn, derived in the early 18th century from the Serbian (). Though this being a popular explanation, a pagan worship of &quot;upyri&quot; was already recorded in Old Russian in the 11–13th century. Some claim an origin from Lithuanian. Oxford and others maintain a Turkish origin (from Turkish &quot;uber,&quot; meaning &quot;witch&quot;), which passed to English via Hungarian and French derivation. In addition, others sustain that the modern word &quot;Vampire&quot; is derived from the Old Slavic and Turkic languages form &quot;онпыр (onpyr)&quot;, with the addition of the &quot;v&quot; sound in front of the large nasal vowel (on), characteristic of Old Bulgarian. Parallels are found in virtually all Slavic and Turkic languages: Bulgarian and Macedonian (), Turkish: , Tatar language: (), Chuvash language: (), Bosnian: (), Croatian , Czech and Slovak , Polish , and (perhaps East Slavic-influenced) , Ukrainian (), Russian (), Belarusian (), from Old East Slavic () (many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as &quot;vampir/wampir&quot; subsequently from the West; these are distinct from the original local words for the creature). In Albanian the words and are used; the latter seems to be derived from the Gheg Albanian words &#x27;tooth&#x27; and &#x27;to drink&#x27;. The origin of the modern word Vampire (Upiór means Hortdan, Vampire or witch in Turkic and Slavic myths.) comes from the term Ubir-Upiór, the origin of the word Ubir or Upiór is based on the regions around the Volga (Itil) River and Pontic steppes. Upiór myth is through the migrations of the Kipchak-Cuman people to the Eurasian steppes allegedly spread. The Bulgarian format is впир (vpir, other names: onpyr, vopir, vpir, upir, upierz).

Czech linguist Václav Machek proposes Slovak verb &#x27;stick to, thrust into&#x27;, or its hypothetical anagram (in Czech, the archaic verb means &#x27;to thrust violently&#x27;) as an etymological background, and thus translates as &#x27;someone who thrusts, bites&#x27;. The term was introduced to German readers by the Polish Jesuit priest Gabriel Rzączyński in 1721.

The word &quot;vampire&quot; (as &quot;vampyre&quot;) first appeared in English in 1732, in news reports about vampire &quot;epidemics&quot; in eastern Europe. After Austria gained control of northern Serbia and Oltenia with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, officials noted the local practice of exhuming bodies and &quot;killing vampires&quot;. These reports, prepared between 1725 and 1732, received widespread publicity.

== Folk beliefs ==

The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the Mesopotamians, Hebrews, Ancient Greeks, Manipuri and Romans had tales of demons and spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampiric creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century southeastern Europe, when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.

=== Description and common attributes ===

It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood, which was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin, and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Chewing sounds were reported emanating from graves. 

==== Creating vampires ====
The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.

In Albanian folklore, the dhampir is the hybrid child of the (a lycanthropic creature with an iron mail shirt) or the (a water-dwelling ghost or monster). The dhampir sprung of a &quot;karkanxholl&quot; has the unique ability to discern the &quot;karkanxholl&quot;; from this derives the expression &quot;the dhampir knows the lugat&quot;. The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually the son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. is also an Albanian surname.

==== Prevention ====
Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as scythes or sickles, near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the ancient Greek practice of placing an obolus in the corpse&#x27;s mouth to pay the toll to cross the River Styx in the underworld. The coin may have also been intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the &quot;vrykolakas&quot;, in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription &quot;Jesus Christ conquers&quot; were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.

Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampiric being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.

==== Identifying vampires ====
Many rituals were used to identify a vampire. One method of finding a vampire&#x27;s grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question. Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism.

Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-styled activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.

==== Protection ====
Apotropaics—items able to ward off revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example; a branch of wild rose and hawthorn are sometimes associated with causing harm to vampires, and in Europe, mustard seeds would be sprinkled on the roof of a house to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, such as crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Some folklore also states that vampires are unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.

Although not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic, mirrors have been used to ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire&#x27;s lack of a soul or their weakness to silver). This attribute is not universal (the Greek &quot;vrykolakas/tympanios&quot; was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in &quot;Dracula&quot; and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.

Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please. Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight.

Reports in 1693 and 1694 concerning citings of vampires in Poland and Russia claimed that when a vampire&#x27;s grave was recognized, eating bread baked with its blood mixed into the flour, or simply drinking it, granted the possibility of protection. Other stories (primarily the Arnold Paole case) claimed the eating of dirt from the vampire&#x27;s grave would have the same effect.

==== Methods of destruction ====

Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with staking the most commonly cited method, particularly in South Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, with a record of oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ&#x27;s cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia. Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of &quot;deflating&quot; the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of &quot;anti-vampire burial&quot;: burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.

Decapitation was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire&#x27;s head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.
Romani people drove steel or iron needles into a corpse&#x27;s heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse&#x27;s sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near Venice, a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006. In Bulgaria, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as plough bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.

Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In Southeastern Europe, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.

=== Ancient beliefs ===

Tales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. The term &quot;vampire&quot; did not exist in ancient times. Blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every culture associates blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India tales of vetālas, ghoulish beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the &quot;Baitāl Pacīsī&quot;; a prominent story in the &quot;Kathāsaritsāgara&quot; tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. &quot;Piśāca&quot;, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.

The Persians were one of the first civilizations to have tales of blood-drinking demons: creatures attempting to drink blood from men were depicted on excavated pottery shards. Ancient Babylonia and Assyria had tales of the mythical Lilitu, synonymous with and giving rise to Lilith (Hebrew לילית) and her daughters the Lilu from Hebrew demonology. Lilitu was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies, and estries, female shapeshifting, blood-drinking demons, were said to roam the night among the population, seeking victims. According to Sefer Hasidim, estries were creatures created in the twilight hours before God rested. An injured estrie could be healed by eating bread and salt given to her by her attacker.

Greco-Roman mythology described the Empusae, the Lamia, the Mormo and the striges. Over time the first two terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa was the daughter of the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the &quot;gelloudes&quot; or Gello. Like the Lamia, the &quot;striges&quot; feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as &quot;strix&quot;, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.

In Turkic mythology, an &quot;ubır&quot; is a vampiric creature characterized by various regional depictions. According to legends, individuals heavily steeped in sin and practitioners of black magic transform into ubırs upon their death, taking on a bestial form within their graves. Ubırs possess the ability to shape-shift, assuming the forms of both humans and various animals. Furthermore, they can seize the soul of a living being and exert control over its body. Someone inhabited by a vampire constantly experiences hunger, becoming increasingly aggressive when unable to find sustenance, ultimately resorting to drinking human blood.

=== Medieval and later European folklore ===
Many myths surrounding vampires originated during the medieval period. With the arrival of Christianity in Greece, and other parts of Europe, the vampire &quot;began to take on decidedly Christian characteristics.&quot; As various regions of the continent converted to Christianity, the vampire was viewed as &quot;a dead person who retained a semblance of life and could leave its grave-much in the same way that Jesus had risen after His death and burial and appeared before His followers.&quot; In the Middle Ages, the Christian Churches reinterpreted vampires from their previous folk existence into minions of Satan, and used an allegory to communicate a doctrine to Christians: &quot;Just as a vampire takes a sinner&#x27;s very spirit into itself by drinking his blood, so also can a righteous Christian by drinking Christ&#x27;s blood take the divine spirit into himself.&quot; The interpretation of vampires under the Christian Churches established connotations that are still associated in the vampire genre today. For example, the &quot;ability of the cross to hurt and ward off vampires is distinctly due to its Christian association.&quot;

The 12th-century British historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The Old Norse &quot;draugr&quot; is another medieval example of an undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampiric beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event to the lack of a &quot;shmirah&quot; (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.

In 1645, the Greek librarian of the Vatican, Leo Allatius, produced the first methodological description of the Balkan beliefs in vampires (Greek: vrykolakas) in his work &quot;De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus&quot; (&quot;On certain modern opinions among the Greeks&quot;). Vampires properly originating in folklore were widely reported from Eastern Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These tales formed the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England, where they were subsequently embellished and popularized. An early recording of the time came from the region of Istria in modern Croatia, in 1672; Local reports described a panic among the villagers inspired by the belief that Jure Grando had become a vampire after dying in 1656, drinking blood from victims and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart. Later, his corpse was also beheaded.
From 1679, Philippe Rohr devotes an essay to the dead who chew their shrouds in their graves, a subject resumed by Otto in 1732, and then by Michael Ranft in 1734. The subject was based on the observation that when digging up graves, it was discovered that some corpses had at some point either devoured the interior fabric of their coffin or their own limbs. Ranft described in his treatise of a tradition in some parts of Germany, that to prevent the dead from masticating they placed a mound of dirt under their chin in the coffin, placed a piece of money and a stone in the mouth, or tied a handkerchief tightly around the throat. In 1732 an anonymous writer writing as &quot;the doctor Weimar&quot; discusses the non-putrefaction of these creatures, from a theological point of view. In 1733, Johann Christoph Harenberg wrote a general treatise on vampirism and the Marquis d&#x27;Argens cites local cases. Theologians and clergymen also address the topic. 

Some theological disputes arose. The non-decay of vampires&#x27; bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Indeed, vampires were traditionally considered highly problematic within Christianity, as their apparent immortal existence ran against the Christian belief that all true believers may look forward to an eternal existence with body and soul as they were resurrected, but only at the end of time when Jesus returns to judge the living and the dead. Those who are resurrected as immortal before this are thus in no way part of the divine plan of salvation. The imperfect state of the vampire body and how they, in spite of their immortal nature, still needed to feed of the blood of the living, further reflected the problematic aspect of the vampires. Contrary to how the incorruptible saints foreshadowed the immortality promised all true Christians at the end of time, the immortality of the undead vampires was thus not a sign of salvation, but of perdition. The unholy dimension of vampirism may also be reflected in how, in parts of Russia, the very word heretic, &quot;eretik&quot;, was synonymous with a vampire. Whoever denied God or his commandments became an &quot;eretik&quot; after his death, the improperly immortal figure that wandered the night in search of people to feed on. A paragraph on vampires was included in the second edition (1749) of &quot;De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione&quot;, On the beatification of the servants of God and on canonization of the blessed, written by Prospero Lambertini (Pope Benedict XIV). In his opinion, while the incorruption of the bodies of saints was the effect of a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or the fruit of &quot;imagination, terror and fear&quot;. In other words, vampires did not exist.

====18th-century vampire controversy====

In the early 18th century, despite the decline of many popular folkloric beliefs during the Age of Enlightenment, there was a dramatic increase in the popular belief in vampires, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout much of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. The first infamous vampire case involved the corpses of Petar Blagojević from Serbia. Blagojević was reported to have died at the age of 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojević supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.

In the second case, Miloš Čečar, an ex-soldier-turned-farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area; it was widely believed that Miloš had returned to prey on the neighbours.

The Blagojević and Čečar incidents were well-documented. Government officials examined the bodies, wrote case reports, and published books throughout Europe. The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so-called vampire attacks, undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities, with locals digging up bodies and in some cases, staking them. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires.

The hysteria, commonly referred to as the &quot;vampire controversy,&quot; continued for a generation. At least sixteen contemporary treatises discussed the theological and philosophical implications of the vampire epidemic.
Dom Augustine Calmet, a French theologian and scholar, published a comprehensive treatise in 1751 titled &quot;Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants&quot; which investigated and analysed the evidence for vampirism. Numerous readers, including both Voltaire (critical) and numerous demonologists (supportive), interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.

The controversy in Austria ceased when Empress Maria Theresa sent her personal physician, Gerard van Swieten, to investigate the claims of vampiric entities. Van Swieten concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and the desecration of bodies, thus ending the vampire epidemic. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local folklore.

=== Non-European beliefs ===
Beings having many of the attributes of European vampires appear in the folklore of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and India. Classified as vampires, all share the thirst for blood.

==== Africa ====
Various regions of Africa have folktales featuring beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling &quot;asanbosam&quot;, and the Ewe people of the &quot;adze,&quot; which can take the form of a firefly and hunts children. The eastern Cape region has the &quot;impundulu,&quot; which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the &quot;ramanga&quot;, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles. In colonial East Africa, rumors circulated to the effect that employees of the state such as firemen and nurses were vampires, known in Swahili as &quot;wazimamoto&quot;.

==== Americas ====
The &quot;Rougarou&quot; is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or voodoo. The term &quot;Rougarou&quot; possibly comes from the French (meaning &quot;werewolf&quot;) and is common in the culture of Mauritius. The stories of the &quot;Rougarou&quot; are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States. Similar female monsters are the &quot;Soucouyant&quot; of Trinidad, and the &quot;Tunda&quot; and &quot;Patasola&quot; of Colombian folklore, while the Mapuche of southern Chile have the bloodsucking snake known as the &quot;Peuchen&quot;. &quot;Aloe vera&quot; hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American folklore. Aztec mythology described tales of the Cihuateteo, skull-faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.

During the late 18th and 19th centuries the belief in vampires was widespread in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term &quot;vampire&quot; was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease tuberculosis, or &quot;consumption&quot; as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old Mercy Brown, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island, in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death, cut out her heart and burned it to ashes.

Sarah Roberts (1872–1913) was an Englishwoman who died and was buried in Pisco, Peru. After her death, a legend evolved that she was a vampire and bride of Dracula. On June 9 1993, the 80th anniversary of her death, locals in Pisco feared she would come back to life and take her revenge.

==== Asia ====
Vampires have appeared in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampiric beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. There are two main vampiric creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog &quot;Mandurugo&quot; (&quot;blood-sucker&quot;) and the Visayan &quot;Manananggal&quot; (&quot;self-segmenter&quot;). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, threadlike tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim. The &quot;manananggal&quot; is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge batlike wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people.

The Malaysian &quot;Penanggalan&quot; is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung &quot;jeruju&quot; (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the &quot;Penanggalan&quot; would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A &quot;Kuntilanak&quot; or &quot;Matianak&quot; in Indonesia, or &quot;Pontianak&quot; or &quot;Langsuir&quot; in Malaysia, is a woman who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming &quot;langsuir.&quot; This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.
In Vietnam, the word used to translate Western vampires, &quot;ma cà rồng&quot;, originally referred to a type of demon that haunts modern-day Phú Thọ Province, within the communities of the Tai Dam ethnic minority. The word was first mentioned in the chronicles of 18th-century Confucian scholar Lê Quý Đôn, who spoke of a creature that lives among humans, but stuffs its toes into its nostrils at night and flies by its ears into houses with pregnant women to suck their blood. Having fed on these women, the &quot;ma cà rồng&quot; then returns to its house and cleans itself by dipping its toes into barrels of sappanwood water. This allows the &quot;ma cà rồng&quot; to live undetected among humans during the day, before heading out to attack again by night.

Jiangshi, sometimes called &quot;Chinese vampires&quot; by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence (qì) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person&#x27;s soul (魄 &quot;pò&quot;) fails to leave the deceased&#x27;s body. &quot;Jiangshi&quot; are usually represented as mindless creatures with no independent thought. This monster has greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like &quot;Encounters of the Spooky Kind&quot; and &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot; were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.

=== Modern beliefs ===
In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic villain. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons. Allegations of vampire attacks swept through Malawi during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor Eric Chiwaya, based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires. Fears and violence recurred in late 2017, with 6 people accused of being vampires killed.
In early 1970, local press spread rumours that a vampire haunted Highgate Cemetery in London. Amateur vampire hunters flocked in large numbers to the cemetery. Several books have been written about the case, notably by Sean Manchester, a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the &quot;Highgate Vampire&quot; and who later claimed to have exorcised and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area. In January 2005, rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in Birmingham, England, fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets. Local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an urban legend.

The &quot;chupacabra&quot; (&quot;goat-sucker&quot;) of Puerto Rico and Mexico is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of domesticated animals, leading some to consider it a kind of vampire. The &quot;chupacabra hysteria&quot; was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s.

In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.

== Origins of vampire beliefs ==
Commentators have offered many theories for the origins of vampire beliefs and related mass hysteria. Everything ranging from premature burial to the early ignorance of the body&#x27;s decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.

=== Pathology ===
==== Decomposition ====
Author Paul Barber stated that belief in vampires resulted from people of pre-industrial societies attempting to explain the natural, but to them inexplicable, process of death and decomposition. People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of the signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.

Corpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look &quot;plump&quot;, &quot;well-fed&quot;, and &quot;ruddy&quot;—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the Arnold Paole case, an old woman&#x27;s exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had ever looked in life. The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity. Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition. The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of flatulence when they passed through the anus. The official reporting on the Petar Blagojevich case speaks of &quot;other wild signs which I pass by out of high respect&quot;. After death, the skin and gums lose fluids and contract, exposing the roots of the hair, nails, and teeth, even teeth that were concealed in the jaw. This can produce the illusion that the hair, nails, and teeth have grown. At a certain stage, the nails fall off and the skin peels away, as reported in the Blagojevich case—the dermis and nail beds emerging underneath were interpreted as &quot;new skin&quot; and &quot;new nails&quot;.

==== Premature burial ====
Vampire legends may have also been influenced by individuals being buried alive because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time. In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape. In other cases the person would hit their heads, noses or faces and it would appear that they had been &quot;feeding&quot;. A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food, water or fresh air. An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies. Another likely cause of disordered tombs is grave robbery.

==== Disease ====
Folkloric vampirism has been associated with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.

In 1985, biochemist David Dolphin proposed a link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.

The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely. Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention and entered popular modern folklore.

Juan Gómez-Alonso, a neurologist, examined the possible link of rabies with vampire folklore. The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. It can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.

=== Psychodynamic theories ===
In his 1931 treatise &quot;On the Nightmare&quot;, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones asserted that vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel the idea of the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.

In cases where there was unconscious guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked with the development of morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect may or may not be present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.

Jones linked the innate sexuality of bloodsucking with cannibalism, with a folkloric connection with incubus-like behaviour. He added that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour.

=== Political interpretations ===
The reinvention of the vampire myth in the modern era is not without political overtones. The aristocratic Count Dracula, alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers, appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry, is symbolic of the parasitic &quot;ancien régime&quot;. In his entry for &quot;Vampires&quot; in the &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; (1764), Voltaire notices how the mid-18th century coincided with the decline of the folkloric belief in the existence of vampires but that now &quot;there were stock-jobbers, brokers, and men of business, who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight; but they were not dead, though corrupted. These true suckers lived not in cemeteries, but in very agreeable palaces&quot;.

Marx defined capital as &quot;dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks&quot;. Werner Herzog, in his &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot;, gives this political interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist Jonathan Harker, a middle-class solicitor, becomes the next vampire; in this way the capitalist bourgeois becomes the next parasitic class.

=== Psychopathology ===
A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. Serial killers Peter Kürten and Richard Trenton Chase were both called &quot;vampires&quot; in the tabloids after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. In 1932, an unsolved murder case in Stockholm, Sweden, was nicknamed the &quot;Vampire murder&quot;, because of the circumstances of the victim&#x27;s death. The late-16th-century Hungarian countess and mass murderer Elizabeth Báthory became infamous in later centuries&#x27; works, which depicted her bathing in her victims&#x27; blood to retain beauty or youth.

=== Vampire bats ===
Although many cultures have stories about them, vampire bats have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore. Vampire bats were integrated into vampire folklore after they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century. There are no vampire bats in Europe, but bats and owls have long been associated with the supernatural and omens, mainly because of their nocturnal habits.

The three species of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, and there is no evidence to suggest that they had any Old World relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The danger of rabies infection aside, the vampire bat&#x27;s bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim&#x27;s skin.

The literary Dracula transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of &quot;Dracula&quot; followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the film, where Béla Lugosi would transform into a bat. The bat transformation scene was used again by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1943&#x27;s &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;.

== In modern culture ==
The vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and continued with 19th-century short stories, the first and most influential of which was John Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819), featuring the vampire Lord Ruthven. Lord Ruthven&#x27;s exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the antihero. The vampire theme continued in penny dreadful serial publications such as &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.

Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire&#x27;s profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Count Orlok of Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula &#x27;vanish&#x27; on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire films and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for the blood of former equals.

=== Literature ===
The vampire or revenant first appeared in poems such as &quot;The Vampire&quot; (1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder, &quot;Lenore&quot; (1773) by Gottfried August Bürger, &quot;Die Braut von Corinth&quot; (&quot;The Bride of Corinth&quot;) (1797) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Robert Southey&#x27;s &quot;Thalaba the Destroyer&quot; (1801), John Stagg&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1810), Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Spectral Horseman&quot; (1810) (&quot;Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore&quot;) and &quot;Ballad&quot; in &quot;St. Irvyne&quot; (1811) about a reanimated corpse, Sister Rosa, Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Christabel&quot; and Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Giaour&quot;.

Byron was also credited with the first prose fiction piece concerned with vampires: &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819). This was in reality authored by Byron&#x27;s personal physician, John Polidori, who adapted an enigmatic fragmentary tale of his illustrious patient, &quot;Fragment of a Novel&quot; (1819), also known as &quot;The Burial: A Fragment&quot;. Byron&#x27;s own dominating personality, mediated by his lover Lady Caroline Lamb in her unflattering &quot;roman-a-clef&quot; &quot;Glenarvon&quot; (a Gothic fantasia based on Byron&#x27;s wild life), was used as a model for Polidori&#x27;s undead protagonist Lord Ruthven. &quot;The Vampyre&quot; was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.

&quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; was a popular mid-Victorian era gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest, which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 in a series of pamphlets generally referred to as &quot;penny dreadfuls&quot; because of their low price and gruesome contents. Published in book form in 1847, the story runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney. Another important addition to the genre was Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s lesbian vampire story &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampiress Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.

No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker&#x27;s work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.

Drawing on past works such as &quot;The Vampyre&quot; and &quot;Carmilla&quot;, Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century, reading works such as &quot;The Land Beyond the Forest&quot; (1888) by Emily Gerard and other books about Transylvania and vampires. In London, a colleague mentioned to him the story of Vlad Țepeș, the &quot;real-life Dracula&quot;, and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book. The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897, but it was released in 1914 as &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest&quot;.
The latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics as well as a renewed interest in the subject in books. The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross&#x27;s &quot;Barnabas Collins&quot; series (1966–71), loosely based on the contemporary American TV series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic tragic heroes rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice&#x27;s highly popular &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; (1976–2003), and Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s Twilight series (2005–2008). In the 2006 Peter Watts&#x27;s novel &quot;Blindsight&quot;, vampires are depicted as a subspecies of homo sapiens that predated on humanity until the dawn of civilization. The various supernatural characteristics and abilities traditionally assigned to vampires by folklore are justified on naturalistic and scientific basis.

=== Film and television ===


Considered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film, the vampire has proven to be a rich subject for the film, television, and gaming industries. Dracula is a major character in more films than any other but Sherlock Holmes, and many early films were either based on the novel &quot;Dracula&quot; or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 silent German Expressionist horror film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, directed by F. W. Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic &quot;Dracula&quot;″s. Universal&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count and directed by Tod Browning, was the first talking film to portray Dracula. Both Lugosi&#x27;s performance and the film overall were influential in the blossoming horror film genre, now able to use sound and special effects much more efficiently than in the Silent Film Era. The influence of this 1931 film lasted throughout the rest of the 20th century and up through the present day. Stephen King, Francis Ford Coppola, Hammer Horror, and Philip Saville each have at one time or another derived inspiration from this film directly either through staging or even through directly quoting the film, particularly how Stoker&#x27;s line &quot;Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make!&quot; is delivered by Lugosi; for example Coppola paid homage to this moment with Gary Oldman in his interpretation of the tale in 1992 and King has credited this film as an inspiration for his character Kurt Barlow repeatedly in interviews. It is for these reasons that the film was selected by the US Library of Congress to be in the National Film Registry in 2000.

The legend of the vampire continued through the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated in the pertinent Hammer Horror series of films, starring Christopher Lee as the Count. The successful 1958 &quot;Dracula&quot; starring Lee was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these and became well known in the role. By the 1970s, vampires in films had diversified with works such as &quot;Count Yorga, Vampire&quot; (1970), an African Count in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Blacula&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Count Dracula&quot; featuring French actor Louis Jourdan as Dracula and Frank Finlay as Abraham Van Helsing, and a Nosferatu-like vampire in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, and a remake of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; itself, titled Nosferatu the Vampyre with Klaus Kinski the same year. Several films featured the characterization of a female, often lesbian, vampire such as Hammer Horror&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; (1970), based on &quot;Carmilla&quot;, though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil vampire character.

The Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, on American television from 1966 to 1971, featured the vampire character Barnabas Collins, portrayed by Jonathan Frid, which proved partly responsible for making the series one of the most popular of its type, amassing a total of 1,225 episodes in its nearly five-year run. The pilot for the later 1972 television series &quot;&quot; revolved around a reporter hunting a vampire on the Las Vegas Strip. Later films showed more diversity in plotline, with some focusing on the vampire-hunter, such as Blade in the Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Blade&quot; films and the film &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. &quot;Buffy&quot;, released in 1992, foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television, with its adaptation to a series of the same name and its spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;. Others showed the vampire as a protagonist, such as 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger&quot;, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and its indirect sequel &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;, and the 2007 series &quot;Moonlight&quot;. The 1992 film &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; by Francis Ford Coppola became the then-highest grossing vampire film ever.

This increase of interest in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, the Russian &quot;Night Watch&quot; and a TV miniseries remake of &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, both from 2004. The series &quot;Blood Ties&quot; premiered on Lifetime Television in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, an illegitimate-son-of-Henry-VIII-of-England-turned-vampire, in modern-day Toronto, with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role. A 2008 series from HBO, entitled &quot;True Blood&quot;, gives a Southern Gothic take on the vampire theme, while taking on the discussion on what the actual existence of vampires would mean to for instance equality before the law and religious beliefs. In 2008 &quot;Being Human&quot; premiered in Britain and featured a vampire that shared a flat with a werewolf and a ghost. The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality.

=== Games ===
The role-playing game &quot;&quot; has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology, such as &quot;embrace&quot; and &quot;sire&quot;, appear in contemporary fiction. Popular video games about vampires include &quot;Castlevania&quot;, which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, and &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot;. The role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; features vampires.

=== Modern vampire subcultures ===

&quot;Vampire lifestyle&quot; is a term for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the Goth subculture, who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism, horror films, the fiction of Anne Rice, and the styles of Victorian England. Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, commonly referred to as &quot;sanguine vampirism&quot;, and &quot;psychic vampirism&quot;, or supposed feeding from pranic energy.

<text>Vostok 1 (, ) was the first spaceflight of the Vostok programme and the first human orbital spaceflight in history. The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 12 April 1961, with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard, making him the first human to reach orbital velocity around the Earth and to complete a full orbit around the Earth.

The orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at at its lowest point. The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at altitude.

==Background==
The Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States, the two Cold War superpowers, began just before the Soviet Union launched the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957. Both countries wanted to develop spaceflight technology quickly, particularly by launching the first successful human spaceflight. The Soviet Union secretly pursued the Vostok programme in competition with the United States&#x27; Project Mercury. Vostok launched several precursor uncrewed missions between May 1960 and March 1961, to test and develop the Vostok rocket family and space capsule. These missions had varied degrees of success, but the final two—Korabl-Sputnik 4 and Korabl-Sputnik 5—were complete successes, allowing the first crewed flight.

==Pilot==

The Vostok 1 capsule was designed to carry a single cosmonaut. Yuri Gagarin was chosen as the prime pilot of Vostok 1, with Gherman Titov and Grigori Nelyubov as backups. These assignments were formally made on April 8, four days before the mission, but Gagarin had been a favourite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months.

The final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of the head of cosmonaut training, Nikolai Kamanin. In an April 5 diary entry, Kamanin wrote that he was still undecided between Gagarin and Titov. &quot;The only thing that keeps me from picking [Titov] is the need to have the stronger person for the one day flight.&quot; Kamanin was referring to the second mission, Vostok 2, compared to the relatively short single-orbit mission of Vostok 1. When Gagarin and Titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on April 9, Gagarin was very happy, and Titov was disappointed. On 10 April, this meeting was reenacted in front of television cameras, so there would be official footage of the event. This included an acceptance speech by Gagarin. As an indication of the level of secrecy involved, one of the other cosmonaut candidates, Alexei Leonov, later recalled that he did not know who was chosen for the mission until after the spaceflight had begun.

=== Reserve ===
==Preparations==

Unlike later Vostok missions, there were no dedicated tracking ships available to receive signals from the spacecraft. Instead they relied on the network of ground stations, also called Command Points, to communicate with the spacecraft; all of these Command Points were located within the Soviet Union.

Because of weight constraints, there was no backup retrorocket engine. The spacecraft carried 13 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural orbital decay in the event the retrorockets failed. The provisions included food for Gagarin. As focus was made on food that would not form crumbs, Gagarin was provided with liver meat puree and chocolate sauce, packed in metal toothpaste-style tubes.

The letters &quot;СССР&quot; were hand-painted onto Gagarin&#x27;s helmet by engineer Gherman Lebedev during transfer to the launch site. As it had been less than a year since U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down, Lebedev reasoned that without some country identification, there was a small chance the cosmonaut might be mistaken for a spy on landing.

===Automatic control===

The entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by ground control. This was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness, and therefore it was decided to lock the pilot&#x27;s manual controls. In an unusual move, a code to unlock the controls was placed in an onboard envelope, for Gagarin&#x27;s use in case of emergency. Prior to the flight, Kamanin and others told Gagarin the code (1-2-5) anyway.

===11 April 1961===

At Baikonur Cosmodrome on the morning of 11 April 1961, the Vostok-K rocket, together with the attached &quot;Vostok 3KA&quot; space capsule, were transported several kilometers to the launch pad, in a horizontal position. Once they arrived at the launch pad, a quick examination of the booster was conducted by technicians to make sure everything was in order. When no visible problems were found, the booster was erected on LC-1. At 10:00 (Moscow Time), Gagarin and Titov were given a final review of the flight plan. They were informed that launch was scheduled to occur the following day, at 09:07 Moscow Time. This time was chosen so that when the capsule started to fly over Africa, which was when the retrorockets would need to fire for reentry, the solar illumination would be ideal for the orientation system&#x27;s sensors.

At 18:00, once various physiological readings had been taken, the doctors instructed the cosmonauts not to discuss the upcoming missions. That evening Gagarin and Titov relaxed by listening to music, playing pool, and chatting about their childhoods. At 21:50, both men were offered sleeping pills, to ensure a good night&#x27;s sleep, but they both declined. Physicians had attached sensors to the cosmonauts, to monitor their condition throughout the night, and they believed that both had slept well. Gagarin&#x27;s biographers Doran and Bizony say that neither Gagarin nor Titov slept that night. Chief Designer Sergei Korolev did not sleep that night, due to anxiety caused by the imminent spaceflight.

===Gagarin statement before the mission===
Before the mission, Gagarin made a statement to the press, addressed to the Soviet Union and to the whole world:

In his autobiography, Gagarin recalled that, looking at the spacecraft before start, he was &quot;seized with an unprecedented rise of all mental strength &lt;...&gt; some extraordinary words were born that I had never used before in everyday speech.&quot; This was not true; according to historian Asif Siddiqi, Gagarin &quot;was essentially forced to utter a stream of banalities prepared by anonymous speechwriters&quot; taped much earlier in Moscow.

==Flight==

At 05:30 Moscow time, on the morning of 12 April 1961, both Gagarin and his backup Titov were woken. They were given breakfast, assisted into their spacesuits, and then were transported to the launch pad. Gagarin entered the &quot;Vostok 1&quot; spacecraft, and at 07:10 local time (04:10 UTC), the radio communication system was turned on. Once Gagarin was in the spacecraft, his picture appeared on television screens in the launch control room from an onboard camera. Launch would not occur for another two hours, and during the time Gagarin chatted with the mission&#x27;s main CapCom, as well as Chief Designer Sergei Korolev, Nikolai Kamanin, and a few others, periodically joking and singing songs. Following a series of tests and checks, about forty minutes after Gagarin entered the spacecraft, its hatch was closed. Gagarin, however, reported that the hatch was not sealed properly, and technicians spent about 15 minutes removing all the screws and sealing the hatch again. According to a 2014 obituary, Vostok&#x27;s chief designer, Oleg Ivanovsky, personally helped rebolt the hatch. There is some disagreement over whether the hatch was in fact not sealed correctly, as a more recent account stated the indication was false.

During this time Gagarin requested some music to be played over the radio. Korolev was reportedly suffering from chest pains and anxiety, as up to this point the Soviet space launch rate was 50% (12 out of 24 launches had failed). Two Vostoks had failed to reach orbit due to launch vehicle malfunctions and another two malfunctioned in orbit. Korolev was given a pill to calm him down. Gagarin, on the other hand, was described as calm; about half an hour before launch his pulse was recorded at 64 beats per minute.

===Launch===
* 06:07 UTC Launch occurred from the Baikonur Cosmodrome Site No.1. Korolev radioed, &quot;Preliminary stage... intermediate... main... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.&quot; Gagarin replied, &quot;Let&#x27;s go! (&quot;Poyekhali!&quot;).&quot;
* 06:09 (T+ 119 s) The four strap-on boosters of the Vostok rocket used up the last of their propellant and dropped away from the core vehicle.
* 06:10 (T+ 156 s) The payload shroud covering Vostok 1 was released, uncovering a window at Gagarin&#x27;s feet, with an optical orientation device (lit. &quot;look&quot; or &quot;glance&quot;).
* 06:12 (T+ 300 s) The rocket core stage used up its propellant and fell away from the capsule and final rocket stage. The final rocket stage ignited.
* 06:13 Gagarin reported, &quot;...the flight is continuing well. I can see the Earth. The visibility is good... I almost see everything. There&#x27;s a certain amount of space under cumulus cloud cover. I continue the flight, everything is good.&quot;
* 06:14 Vostok 1 passed over central Russia. Gagarin reported, &quot;Everything is working very well. All systems are working. Let&#x27;s keep going!&quot;
* 06:15 Three minutes into the burn of the final rocket stage, Gagarin radioed, &quot;, I can&#x27;t hear you very well. I feel fine. I&#x27;m in good spirits. I&#x27;m continuing the flight...&quot; Vostok 1 started to move out of radio range of the Baikonur ground station.
* 06:17 The rocket final stage shut down and Vostok 1 reached orbit. Ten seconds later the rocket separated from the capsule.

===Time in orbit===

* 06:18 UTC (T+ 676 s) Gagarin reported, &quot;The craft is operating normally. I can see Earth in the view port of the . Everything is proceeding as planned&quot;. Vostok 1 moved on over Siberia as it passed over the Soviet Union.
* 06:21 Vostok 1 passed over the Kamchatka Peninsula and out over the North Pacific Ocean. Gagarin radioed, &quot;...the lights are on on the descent mode monitor. I&#x27;m feeling fine, and I&#x27;m in good spirits. Cockpit parameters: pressure 1; humidity 65; temperature 20; pressure in the compartment 1; first automatic 155; second automatic 155; pressure in the retro-rocket system 320 atmospheres...&quot;
* 06:25 As Vostok 1 began its diagonal crossing of the Pacific Ocean from Kamchatka Peninsula to the southern tip of South America, Gagarin requested information about his orbital parameters: &quot;What can you tell me about the flight? What can you tell me?&quot;. The ground station at Khabarovsk didn&#x27;t have his orbital parameters yet, and reported back, &quot;There are no instructions from No. 20 [code name for Korolyov], and the flight is proceeding normally.&quot; (Ground control did not know until 25 minutes after launch that a stable orbit had been achieved.)
* 06:31 Gagarin transmitted to the Khabarovsk ground station, &quot;I feel splendid, very well, very well, very well. Give me some results on the flight!&quot;. At this time, Vostok 1 was nearing the VHF radio horizon for Khabarovsk, and they responded, &quot;Repeat. I can&#x27;t hear you very well&quot;. Gagarin transmitted again, &quot;I feel very good. Give me your data on the flight!&quot; Vostok 1 then passed out of VHF range of the Khabarovsk ground station.
* 06:37 Vostok 1 continued on its journey as the sun set over the North Pacific. Gagarin crossed into night, northwest of the Hawaiian Islands. Out of VHF range with ground stations, communications continued via HF radio.
* 06:46 Khabarovsk ground station sent the message &quot;KK&quot; via telegraph (on HF radio to Vostok 1). This was a code meaning, &quot;Report the monitoring of commands,&quot; a request for Gagarin to report when the spacecraft automated descent system had received its instructions from ground control.
* 06:48 Vostok 1 crossed the equator at about 170° West in a southeast direction, and began crossing the South Pacific. Gagarin transmitted over HF radio, &quot;I am transmitting the regular report message: 9 hours 48 minutes (Moscow Time), the flight is proceeding successfully. Spusk-1 is operating normally. The mobile index of the descent mode monitor is moving. Pressure in the cockpit is 1; humidity 65; temperature 20; pressure in the compartment 1.2 ... Manual 150; First automatic 155; second automatic 155; retro rocket system tanks 320 atmospheres. I feel fine...&quot;
* 06:49 Gagarin reported he was on the night side of the Earth.
* 06:51 Gagarin reported the sun-seeking attitude control system was switched on; this oriented Vostok 1 for retrofire. The automatic/solar system was backed up by a manual/visual system; either one could operate the two redundant cold nitrogen gas thruster systems, each with of gas.
* 06:53 The Khabarovsk ground station sent Gagarin via HF radio, &quot;By order of No. 33 (General Nikolai Kamanin), the transmitters have been switched on, and we are transmitting this: the flight is proceeding as planned and the orbit is as calculated.&quot; Vostok 1 was now known to be in a stable orbit; Gagarin acknowledged.
* 06:57 Vostok 1 was over the South Pacific between New Zealand and Chile as Gagarin radioed, &quot;...I&#x27;m continuing the flight, and I&#x27;m over America. I transmitted the telegraph signal &quot;ON&quot;.
* 07:00 Vostok 1 crossed the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America. News of the Vostok 1 mission was broadcast on Radio Moscow.
* 07:04 Gagarin sent another spacecraft status message, similar to the one at 06:48. This was not received by ground stations.
* 07:09 Gagarin sent another spacecraft status message, also not received by ground stations.
* 07:10 Vostok 1 passed over the South Atlantic, into daylight again. At this point, retrofire is 15 minutes away.
* 07:13 Gagarin sent a fourth spacecraft status message; Moscow received this partial message: &quot;I read you well. The flight is going...&quot;
* 07:18 Gagarin sent another spacecraft status message, not received by ground stations.
* 07:23 Gagarin sent another spacecraft status message, not received by ground stations.

The automatic orientation system brought Vostok 1 into alignment for retrofire about 1 hour into the flight.

==Reentry and landing==

At 07:25 UTC, the spacecraft&#x27;s automatic systems brought it into the required attitude (orientation) for the retrorocket firing, and shortly afterwards, the liquid-fueled engine fired for about 42 seconds over the west coast of Africa, near Angola, about uprange of the landing point. The orbit&#x27;s perigee and apogee had been selected to cause reentry due to orbital decay within 13 days (the limit of the life support system function) in the event of retrorocket malfunction. However, the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days.

Ten seconds after retrofire, commands were sent to separate the Vostok service module from the reentry module (code name &quot;little ball&quot; ()), but the equipment module unexpectedly remained attached to the reentry module by a bundle of wires. At around 07:35 UTC, the two parts of the spacecraft began reentry and went through strong gyrations as Vostok 1 neared Egypt. At this point the wires broke, the two modules separated, and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude. Gagarin telegraphed &quot;Everything is OK&quot; despite continuing gyrations; he later reported that he did not want to &quot;make noise&quot; as he had (correctly) reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission (and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module). As Gagarin continued his descent, he remained conscious as he experienced about 8 g during reentry. (Gagarin&#x27;s own report states &quot;over 10 g&quot;.)

At 07:55 UTC, when Vostok 1 was still from the ground, the hatch of the spacecraft was released, and two seconds later Gagarin was ejected. At altitude, the main parachute was deployed from the Vostok spacecraft.

Gagarin&#x27;s parachute opened almost immediately, and about ten minutes later, at 08:05 UTC, Gagarin landed. Both he and the spacecraft landed via parachute south west of Engels, in the Saratov region at .

A kolkhoz woman Annihayat Nurskanova and her granddaughter, Rita, observed the strange scene of a figure in a bright orange suit with a large white helmet landing near them by parachute. Gagarin later recalled, &quot;When they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away in fear. I told them, don&#x27;t be afraid, I am a Soviet citizen like you, who has descended from space and I must find a telephone to call Moscow!&quot;

==Reactions and legacy==

===Soviet reaction===
Gagarin&#x27;s flight was announced while Gagarin was still in orbit, by Yuri Levitan, the leading Soviet radio personality since the 1930s. Although news of Soviet rocket launches would normally be aired only after the fact, Sergei Korolev wrote a note to the Party Central Committee to convince them that the announcement should be made as early as possible:

&quot;We consider it advisable to publish the first TASS report immediately after the satellite-spacecraft enters orbit, for the following reasons:

(a) if a rescue becomes necessary, it will facilitate rapid organization of a rescue;

(b) it precludes any foreign government declaring that the cosmonaut is a military scout.&quot;

The flight was celebrated as a great triumph of Soviet science and technology, demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was comparable to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation&#x27;s highest honour. He also became an international celebrity, receiving numerous awards and honours.

April 12 was declared Cosmonautics Day in the USSR, and is celebrated today in Russia as one of the official &quot;Commemorative Dates of Russia.&quot; In 2011, it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.

Gagarin&#x27;s informal reply &quot;Poyekhali!&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot;) became a historical phrase used to refer to the arrival of the Space Age in human history. Later it was included in the refrain of a Soviet song written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov (&quot;He said &quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot; He waved his hand&quot;) which was dedicated to the memory of Gagarin.

===American reaction===
Officially, the U.S. congratulated the Soviet Union on its accomplishments. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; shortly after the flight, however, journalist Arthur Krock described mixed feelings in the United States due to fears of the spaceflight&#x27;s potential military implications for the Cold War, and the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; wrote that &quot;the people of Washington, London, Paris and all points between might have been dancing in the streets&quot; if it were not for &quot;doubts and suspicions&quot; about Soviet intentions. Other US writers were concerned that the spaceflight had gained a propaganda victory on behalf of communism. President John F. Kennedy was quoted as saying that it would be &quot;some time&quot; before the US could match the Soviet launch vehicle technology, and that &quot;the news will be worse before it&#x27;s better.&quot; Kennedy also sent congratulations to the Soviet Union for their &quot;outstanding technical achievement.&quot; Opinion pages of many US newspapers urged renewed efforts to overtake the Soviet scientific accomplishments.

Adlai Stevenson, then the US ambassador to the United Nations, was quoted as saying, &quot;Now that the Soviet scientists have put a man into space and brought him back alive, I hope they will also help to bring the United Nations back alive,&quot; and on a more serious note urged international agreements covering the use of space (which did not occur until the Outer Space Treaty of 1967).

Astronaut Alan Shepard, who was originally scheduled to become the first person in space but had his mission delayed six times due to preparatory work, was infuriated by the news and slammed his fist down on a table.

===Other world reactions===
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India praised the Soviet Union for &quot;a great victory of man over the forces of nature&quot; and urged that it be &quot;considered as a victory for peace.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; voiced worries that orbital platforms might be used for surprise nuclear attacks. The &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; in Sweden chided &quot;free countries&quot; for &quot;splitting up and frittering away&quot; their resources, while West Germany&#x27;s &quot;Die Welt&quot; argued that America had the resources to have sent a man into space first but was beaten by Soviet purposefulness. Japan&#x27;s &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; urged &quot;that both the United States and the Soviet Union should use their new knowledge and techniques for the good of mankind,&quot; and Egypt&#x27;s &quot;Akhbar El Yom&quot; likewise expressed hopes that the cold war would &quot;turn into a peaceful race in infinite space&quot; and turn away from armed conflicts such as the Laotian Civil War.

Charles de Gaulle claimed that &quot;the success of Soviet scientists and astronauts does honor to Europe and humanity&quot;. Sukarno, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, said that &quot;that delightful event opens up new prospects for human thought and activity, which will be put at the service of the progress and well-being of people, international peace as a whole.&quot; Zhou Enlai, head of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and Kim Il Sung, Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the DPRK, described the successes of Soviet science as &quot;a brilliant symbol of the triumph of socialism and communism.&quot; The chairman of the Council of Ministers of Cuba, Fidel Castro, sent a telegram to Khrushchev as follows: &quot;Let this victory of his become the victory of all mankind, which men and women in all corners of the earth perceived as the greatest hope for the destinies of freedom, prosperity and peace.&quot;

The President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guo Moruo, wrote a poem 《歌颂东方号》 (&quot;Hymn to the Vostok Spacecraft&quot;), which was published in &quot;Pravda&quot;. Charlie Chaplin and Gianni Rodari were among those who sent congratulatory telegrams to &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda.&quot;

===World records===
FAI officially recognized three space records claimed by Gagarin: duration in orbital flight—108 minutes, greatest altitude in earth orbital flight—, greatest mass lifted in earth orbital flight—.

The FAI rules in 1961 required that a pilot must land with the spacecraft to be considered an official spaceflight for the FAI record books. Although some contemporary Soviet sources stated that Gagarin had parachuted separately to the ground, the Soviet Union officially insisted that he had landed with the Vostok; the government forced the cosmonaut to lie in press conferences, and the FAI certified the flight. The Soviet Union did not admit until 1971 that Gagarin had ejected and landed separately from the Vostok descent module. Gagarin&#x27;s spaceflight records were nonetheless certified and reaffirmed by the FAI, which revised its rules, and acknowledged that the crucial steps of the safe launch, orbit, and return of the pilot had been accomplished. Gagarin is internationally recognised as the first human in space and first to orbit the Earth.

===Legacy===

Four decades after the flight, historian Asif S. Siddiqi wrote that Vostok 1

The landing site is now a monument park. The central feature in the park is a tall monument that consists of a silver metallic rocketship rising on a curved metallic column of flame, from a wedge shaped, white stone base. In front of this is a 3-meter (9 foot) tall white stone statue of Yuri Gagarin, wearing a spacesuit, with one arm raised in greeting and the other holding a space helmet.

The &quot;Vostok 1&quot; re-entry capsule belongs to the S. P. Korolev RSC Energia Museum in Korolev City. In 2018 it was temporarily loaned to the Space Pavilion at the VDNKh in Moscow.

In 2011, documentary film maker Christopher Riley partnered with European Space Agency astronaut Paolo Nespoli to record a new film of what Gagarin would have seen of the Earth from his spaceship, by matching historical audio recordings to video from the International Space Station following the ground path taken by &quot;Vostok 1&quot;. The resulting film, &quot;First Orbit&quot;, was released online to celebrate the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight.

<text>In linguistics and philosophy, a vague predicate is one which gives rise to borderline cases. For example, the English adjective &quot;tall&quot; is vague since it is not clearly true or false for someone of middling height. By contrast, the word &quot;prime&quot; is not vague since every number is definitively either prime or not. Vagueness is commonly diagnosed by a predicate&#x27;s ability to give rise to the Sorites paradox. Vagueness is separate from ambiguity, in which an expression has multiple denotations. For instance the word &quot;bank&quot; is ambiguous since it can refer either to a river bank or to a financial institution, but there are no borderline cases between both interpretations.

Vagueness is a major topic of research in philosophical logic, where it serves as a potential challenge to classical logic. Work in formal semantics has sought to provide a compositional semantics for vague expressions in natural language. Work in philosophy of language has addressed implications of vagueness for the theory of meaning, while metaphysicists have considered whether reality itself is vague.

== Importance ==
The concept of vagueness has philosophical importance. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of &quot;right&quot; in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances precising definitions.

=== In law ===
Vagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases, judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept. Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc. Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as biological sex can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from transsexuals&#x27; gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see intersex).
In the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations. The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be &quot;void for vagueness&quot; and unenforceable. This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid &quot;explicit&quot; or &quot;objectionable&quot; contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the vagueness doctrine and in Europe as the principle of legal certainty.

=== In science ===
Many scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance species in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as ring species. Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases. As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is &quot;vague&quot; is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding huskies and wolves: are they dogs? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one&#x27;s ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.

== Approaches ==
The philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is—which is closely related to the problem of the paradox of the heap, a.k.a. sorites paradox—has been the subject of much philosophical debate.

=== Fuzzy logic ===
One theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between &quot;perfect falsity&quot;, for example, the statement &quot;Bill Clinton is bald&quot;, to &quot;perfect truth&quot;, for, say, &quot;Patrick Stewart is bald&quot;. In ordinary logics, there are only two truth-values: &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing &quot;an infinite number of truth-values&quot; along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by &quot;1&quot;, and perfect falsity by &quot;0&quot;. Borderline cases are thought of as having a &quot;truth-value&quot; anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) and Dorothy Edgington (1993).

=== Supervaluationism ===

Another theoretical approach is known as &quot;supervaluationism&quot;. This approach has been defended by Kit Fine and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of &quot;truth value gaps&quot;. He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be &quot;made precise&quot; in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.

Given a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate &quot;supertrue&quot; as meaning &quot;true on all precisifications&quot;. This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. &quot;Frank is bald&quot;, where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the tautologies of sentential logic, such as &quot;Frank is bald or Frank is not bald&quot;, will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either &quot;Frank is bald&quot; or &quot;Frank is not bald&quot; will be true. Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can &quot;rescue&quot; them is seen as a virtue.

=== Subvaluationism ===

Subvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as &#x27;supertruth&#x27;, the subvaluationist characterises truth as &#x27;subtruth&#x27;, or &quot;true on at least some precisifications&quot;.

Subvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has &quot;truth-value gluts&quot;. According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon. Of a borderline case of &quot;bald man&quot; it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.

=== Epistemicist view ===

A fourth approach, known as &quot;the epistemicist view&quot;, has been defended by Timothy Williamson (1994), R. A. Sorensen (1988) and (2001), and Nicholas Rescher (2009). They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One&#x27;s confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is due to one&#x27;s ignorance. For example, in the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old; some people are ignorant of this fact.

===As a property of objects===

One possibility is that one&#x27;s words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague. Consider Peter Unger&#x27;s example of a cloud (from his famous 1980 paper, &quot;The Problem of the Many&quot;): it is not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it is part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one will not know how to answer. So perhaps one&#x27;s term &#x27;cloud&#x27; denotes a vague object precisely. This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to Gareth Evans&#x27;s short paper &quot;Can There Be Vague Objects?&quot; (1978). Evans&#x27;s argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. &quot;Princeton = Princeton Borough&quot;), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right. Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.

Still by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving Leibniz&#x27;s law or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend ontological vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, Peter van Inwagen (1990), Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).

== Essence and functioning ==

Vagueness is primarily a filter of natural human cognition, other tasks of vagueness are derived from that, and they are secondary. The ability to cognition is the basic natural equipment of human (and other creatures) allowing him to orient and survive in the real (material) world. The task of cognition is to obtain from the epistemologically incalculable (immensely vast and deep) reality to a human its cognitive (knowledge) model, containing an only finite amount of information. For this purpose, there must be a filter performing selection and thus reduction of information. It is the vagueness with which man perceive and then remember information about the real (material) world. Some information gained with less vagueness, others with greater one, according to the distance from the center (focus) of attention occupied by man during his act of cognition. Human is unable to acquire information other than vague one by his natural vague cognition. It is necessary to distinguish the internal cognitive model, i.e. the intrapsychic, stored and processed in human consciousness (and probably also in the unconscious), in hypothetical intrapsychic languages: imaginary, emotional and natural and in their mixture, and then the external model, represented in a suitable external language of communication.

=== Vagueness internal and external ===
Cognition and language (Law of maintaining accuracy of information): Communication language should have the same amount of vagueness, as have information gained by cognition (source of the information). That means, language must be tuned to appropriate cognition considering vagueness. This is one of secondary tasks of vagueness.

A person is able to speak about his inherently vague knowledge (contained in the intrapsychic cognitive model represented in hypothetical intrapsychic languages) in natural (generally informal language, e.g. Esperanto), of course only vaguely. The vagueness of knowledge caused by the &quot;filter of knowledge&quot; is primary, we call it internal vagueness (i.e. intrapsychic). The vagueness of a person&#x27;s subsequent utterance is secondary vagueness. This utterance (transformation from intrapsychic languages to external communicative languages - it is called a &quot;formulation&quot;, see the semantic triangle) cannot reveal all the content of the personal intrapsychic cognitive model with all its inherent vagueness. The vagueness contained in the linguistic utterance (of external communication language) is called external vagueness.

Linguistically, only external vagueness can be grasped (modeled). We cannot model internal vagueness; it is part of the intrapsychic model, and this vagueness is contained in (vague, emotional, subjective and variable during time) interpretation of constructs (words, sentences) of informal language. This vagueness is hidden for the other human, he can only guess the amount of it. Informal languages, such as natural language, do not make it possible to distinguish between internal and external vagueness strictly, but only with a vague boundary.

Fortunately, however, informal languages use appropriate language constructs making meaning a little uncertain (e.g. &quot;indeterminate quantifiers&quot; POSSIBLY, SEVERAL, MAYBE, etc.). Such quantifiers allow natural language to use external vagueness more strongly and explicitly, thus allowing internal vagueness to be partially shifted up to external vagueness. It is a way to draw the addressee&#x27;s attention to the vagueness of the message more explicitly and to quantify the vagueness, thus improving understanding in communication using natural language. But the main vagueness of informal languages is the internal vagueness, and the external vagueness serves only as an auxiliary tool.

Formal languages, mathematics, formal logic, programming languages (in principle, they must have &quot;zero&quot; internal vagueness of interpretation of all language constructs, i.e. they have exact interpretation) can model external vagueness by tools of vagueness and uncertainty representation: fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, or by stochastic quantities and stochastic functions, as the exact sciences do. Principle is: If we admit more vagueness (uncertainty), we can gain more information during cognition. See e.g. possibilities of deterministic and stochastic physic. In other cases cognitive model of certain part of real world may be simplified, such a way, that certain amount of deterministic information is possible to replace by fuzzy or stochastic one.

==Reducing internal vagueness==
The internal vagueness of one person&#x27;s message is hidden from another person, he can only guess that. We either have to accept internal vagueness, which is human, or we can try to reduce it, or completely eliminate it, which is scientific.

Demands on the accuracy of the formulation of scientific knowledge and its communication require minimizing the internal vagueness with which one connotes (vaguely, emotionally and subjectively interprets) linguistic constructs of the communication language, and thus improve the accuracy of the message. Various scientific procedures aim to improve the credibility and accuracy of the scientific knowledge obtained.

To formulate them, however, it is necessary to build a more precise language, with less (internal) vagueness of message than is common in daily life. This is done by purposefully (branch) constructed terminology allowing to more accurately describe the researched reality and the acquired knowledge about it. People properly educated in the field of terminology know it with little internal vagueness, so they know accurately what the individual terms mean. Basic concepts are always formed on the basis of consensus, the other derived from them by definition, to avoid to Circular definition. To improve the accuracy of research and communication (reducing the internal vagueness of connotation), tools such as classification schemes are used, such as the taxonomy of organisms by Carl von Linné.

This is how descriptive (non-exact) sciences do it. Thus, they use natural human cognition (with the Russell’s filter of vagueness) and refined natural language.

There is another continuation of the reduction of internal vagueness. The method of reducing internal vagueness to the extreme, that is zero, was realized by I. Newton. It is an epochal idea, and it needs to be explained how it can be realized.
It follows from the above-mentioned Law of maintaining accuracy of information (optimization of the truthfulness of the message) saying, if we require to eliminate the internal vagueness in the knowledge completely (to zero) then of course it must first be completely eliminated in cognition (the source of information). This means that one (Newton) must avoid the intrusion of internal vagueness, that is, to choose some filter of cognition other than vagueness. Thus we pass from the natural human world to the artificial one. We call it the exact world and we will explain why.

In the case of natural language, it is not possible to completely remove (nullify) the internal vagueness, but it is possible to build artificial formal languages (mathematics, formal logics, programming languages) that have zero internal vagueness of connotation (so they have an exact interpretation) and cannot have another in principle. (Newton for this purpose has created formal language – theory of flux - theory of flowing – infinitesimal calculus). Languages with zero internal vagueness of their interpretation, i.e. the meaning of their linguistic constructions, have the property that all these constructions are understood by every appropriately educated person with absolutely precise, i.e. exact meaning. That is why they are part of the exact world. Thus, we have some language that is able to represent knowledge with zero internal vagueness. But these must first be acquired by adequate cognition, providing cognition also with zero internal vagueness, i.e. also from the exact world. And it is already evident that we are on the way to the creation of the scientific method that creates science belonging to the exact world, that is, an exact science is born.

It is still necessary to explain how to realize Newton`s exact cognition, that is, the cognition when the knowledge obtained from the real world is part of the exact world. The miraculous bridge between the real and exact worlds that makes this possible is called a quantity (e.g. electric field intensity, velocity, nitric acid concentration, etc.). It is common to both worlds, because in the exact world it is precisely delineated (every knowing person knows them with no doubts, so exactly), and in the real world it is an elemental measurable probe into that, and thus its elemental measurable representative. The quantity is the elementary building block of exact science. In exact sciences, it is always precisely defined, either consensually (basic set) or the other derived - International System of Units.
And what about the artificial filter that allows Newton to avoid internal vagueness? For every problem of the real world that is to be grasped by Newton’s method of the exact science, it is necessary to choose a group of suitable quantities, find the natural laws that apply in the real world between them, and describe them in mathematical language. We get a mathematical knowledge (cognitive) model of a given part of the real world. A group of selected quantities forms a discrete Newtonian filter (sieve) through which man ‘’look’’ at a given part of the real world. Thus, in exact science, a given part of the real world is represented by a group of suitably chosen quantities and mathematically (programming language) described relations between them (more precisely between their names – symbols denoting them).

Exact science &quot;is a method that allows knowledge about the real world to be acquired and recorded so that it is part of the exact world. That is the method of modeling the real world by means of exact world, in other words, a method to mathematize the science.&quot;

Even exact science needs to have a tool, with which it can describe the uncertainty of the results (obtained – knowledge), whether out of necessity or the need to abandon excessive precision. Since that cannot (must not) be an internal vagueness, it can only use linguistically graspable uncertainty (external vagueness). For this purpose it has for its disposal a description of fuzzy or stochastic values of quantities, and fuzzy or stochastic relations (represented by mathematical functions) between quantities.
The difference between the non-exact sciences (called descriptive) and the exact sciences is that the former use natural human cognition (with the Russell’s filter of vagueness) and refined natural language, and the exact sciences use cognition based on the use of Newtonian discrete filter and thus the use of quantities, and artificial formal language. Artificial formal language also brings a powerful tool to exact science, which is formal inference (information formal processing) known from mathematics.

The above-mentioned tools of exact and non-exact science are general principles, and different branches of science use them in combination with both. They have their parts exact and inexact. Purely exact sciences, such as theoretical physics or mathematics, use natural language as meta-language.

Exact science provides most trustworthy knowledge. The question can certainly be raised as to whether all science can be transformed into an exact science. The answer is not. The condition for the establishment of an exact science is to find suitable quantities, and this is possible only for a small part of the real world and for specific views of it. In other words, the filter of vagueness makes it possible to vaguely know many; Newton&#x27;s discrete filter makes it possible to know only little but exactly.

<text>In mathematics and physics, a vector space (also called a linear space) is a set whose elements, often called &quot;vectors&quot;, can be added together and multiplied (&quot;scaled&quot;) by numbers called &quot;scalars&quot;. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called &quot;vector axioms&quot;. Real vector spaces and complex vector spaces are kinds of vector spaces based on different kinds of scalars: real numbers and complex numbers. Scalars can also be, more generally, elements of any field.

Vector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities (such as forces and velocity) that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrices, which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations.

Vector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces over a given field and with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are isomorphic). A vector space is &quot;finite-dimensional&quot; if its dimension is a natural number. Otherwise, it is &quot;infinite-dimensional&quot;, and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.

Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures. This is the case of algebras, which include field extensions, polynomial rings, associative algebras and Lie algebras. This is also the case of topological vector spaces, which include function spaces, inner product spaces, normed spaces, Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.

==Definition and basic properties==
In this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.

A vector space over a field is a non-empty set  together with a binary operation and a binary function that satisfy the eight axioms listed below. In this context, the elements of are commonly called &quot;vectors&quot;, and the elements of  are called &quot;scalars&quot;.

* The binary operation, called &quot;vector addition&quot; or simply &quot;addition&quot; assigns to any two vectors  and in a third vector in which is commonly written as , and called the &quot;sum&quot; of these two vectors.

* The binary function, called &quot;scalar multiplication&quot;, assigns to any scalar  in and any vector  in another vector in , which is denoted .

To have a vector space, the eight following axioms must be satisfied for every , and in , and and in .

When the scalar field is the real numbers, the vector space is called a &quot;real vector space&quot;, and when the scalar field is the complex numbers, the vector space is called a &quot;complex vector space&quot;. These two cases are the most common ones, but vector spaces with scalars in an arbitrary field are also commonly considered. Such a vector space is called an &quot;vector space&quot; or a &quot;vector space over &quot;.

An equivalent definition of a vector space can be given, which is much more concise but less elementary: the first four axioms (related to vector addition) say that a vector space is an abelian group under addition, and the four remaining axioms (related to the scalar multiplication) say that this operation defines a ring homomorphism from the field into the endomorphism ring of this group.

Subtraction of two vectors can be defined as
formula_1

Direct consequences of the axioms include that, for every formula_2 and formula_3 one has
*formula_4
*formula_5
*formula_6
*formula_7 implies formula_8 or formula_9

Even more concisely, a vector space is a module over a field.

== Bases, vector coordinates, and subspaces ==
;Linear combination
: Given a set of elements of a -vector space , a linear combination of elements of is an element of of the form formula_10 where formula_11 and formula_12 The scalars formula_13 are called the &quot;coefficients&quot; of the linear combination.
;Linear independence
:The elements of a subset of a -vector space are said to be &quot;linearly independent&quot; if no element of can be written as a linear combination of the other elements of . Equivalently, they are linearly independent if two linear combinations of elements of define the same element of if and only if they have the same coefficients. Also equivalently, they are linearly independent if a linear combination results in the zero vector if and only if all its coefficients are zero.
;Linear subspace
:A &quot;linear subspace&quot; or &quot;vector subspace&quot; of a vector space is a non-empty subset of that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, the sum of two elements of and the product of an element of by a scalar belong to . This implies that every linear combination of elements of belongs to . A linear subspace is a vector space for the induced addition and scalar multiplication; this means that the closure property implies that the axioms of a vector space are satisfied.&lt;br&gt;The closure property also implies that &quot;every intersection of linear subspaces is a linear subspace.&quot;
;Linear span
:Given a subset of a vector space , the &quot;linear span&quot; or simply the &quot;span&quot; of is the smallest linear subspace of that contains , in the sense that it is the intersection of all linear subspaces that contain . The span of is also the set of all linear combinations of elements of .&lt;br&gt; If is the span of , one says that &quot;spans&quot; or &quot;generates&quot; , and that is a &quot;spanning set&quot; or a &quot;generating set&quot; of .
;Basis and dimension
:A subset of a vector space is a &quot;basis&quot; if its elements are linearly independent and span the vector space. Every vector space has at least one basis, or many in general (see ). Moreover, all bases of a vector space have the same cardinality, which is called the &quot;dimension&quot; of the vector space (see Dimension theorem for vector spaces). This is a fundamental property of vector spaces, which is detailed in the remainder of the section.

&quot;Bases&quot; are a fundamental tool for the study of vector spaces, especially when the dimension is finite. In the infinite-dimensional case, the existence of infinite bases, often called Hamel bases, depends on the axiom of choice. It follows that, in general, no base can be explicitly described. For example, the real numbers form an infinite-dimensional vector space over the rational numbers, for which no specific basis is known. 

Consider a basis formula_14 of a vector space of dimension over a field . The definition of a basis implies that every formula_15 may be written 
formula_16 
with formula_17 in , and that this decomposition is unique. The scalars formula_18 are called the &quot;coordinates&quot; of on the basis. They are also said to be the &quot;coefficients&quot; of the decomposition of on the basis. One also says that the -tuple of the coordinates is the coordinate vector of on the basis, since the set formula_19 of the -tuples of elements of is a vector space for componentwise addition and scalar multiplication, whose dimension is .

The one-to-one correspondence between vectors and their coordinate vectors maps vector addition to vector addition and scalar multiplication to scalar multiplication. It is thus a vector space isomorphism, which allows translating reasonings and computations on vectors into reasonings and computations on their coordinates.

==History==

Vector spaces stem from affine geometry, via the introduction of coordinates in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, French mathematicians René Descartes and Pierre de Fermat founded analytic geometry by identifying solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve. To achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced, in 1804, certain operations on points, lines, and planes, which are predecessors of vectors. introduced the notion of barycentric coordinates. introduced an equivalence relation on directed line segments that share the same length and direction which he called equipollence. A Euclidean vector is then an equivalence class of that relation. 

Vectors were reconsidered with the presentation of complex numbers by Argand and Hamilton and the inception of quaternions by the latter. They are elements in R2 and R4; treating them using linear combinations goes back to Laguerre in 1867, who also defined systems of linear equations.

In 1857, Cayley introduced the matrix notation which allows for harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products are present. Grassmann&#x27;s 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces as well since his considering multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Italian mathematician Peano was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888, although he called them &quot;linear systems&quot;. Peano&#x27;s axiomatization allowed for vector spaces with infinite dimension, but Peano did not develop that theory further. In 1897, Salvatore Pincherle adopted Peano&#x27;s axioms and made initial inroads into the theory of infinite-dimensional vector spaces. 

An important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of function spaces by Henri Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of &quot;p&quot;-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces.

==Examples==
===Arrows in the plane===

The first example of a vector space consists of arrows in a fixed plane, starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe forces or velocities. Given any two such arrows, and , the parallelogram spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the &quot;sum&quot; of the two arrows, and is denoted . In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive real number , the arrow that has the same direction as , but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by , is called &quot;multiplication&quot; of by . It is denoted . When is negative, is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction instead.

The following shows a few examples: if , the resulting vector has the same direction as , but is stretched to the double length of (the second image). Equivalently, is the sum . Moreover, has the opposite direction and the same length as (blue vector pointing down in the second image).

===Ordered pairs of numbers===
A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers and . The order of the components and is significant, so such a pair is also called an ordered pair. Such a pair is written as . The sum of two such pairs and the multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:
formula_20

The first example above reduces to this example if an arrow is represented by a pair of Cartesian coordinates of its endpoint.

===Coordinate space===
The simplest example of a vector space over a field is the field itself with its addition viewed as vector addition and its multiplication viewed as scalar multiplication. More generally, all -tuples (sequences of length ) 
formula_21
of elements of form a vector space that is usually denoted and called a coordinate space. 
The case is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case and (so R2) reduces to the previous example.

===Complex numbers and other field extensions===
The set of complex numbers , numbers that can be written in the form for real numbers and where is the imaginary unit, form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: and for real numbers , , , and . The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic. The example of complex numbers is essentially the same as (that is, it is &quot;isomorphic&quot; to) the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number as representing the ordered pair in the complex plane then we see that the rules for addition and scalar multiplication correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.

More generally, field extensions provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and algebraic number theory: a field containing a smaller field is an -vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of . For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over , and the field extension formula_22 is a vector space over . 

===Function spaces===

Functions from any fixed set to a field also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions and is the function formula_23 given by
formula_24
and similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when is the real line or an interval, or other subsets of . Many notions in topology and analysis, such as continuity, integrability or differentiability are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property. Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces, whose study belongs to functional analysis.

===Linear equations===

Systems of homogeneous linear equations are closely tied to vector spaces. For example, the solutions of 
formula_25
are given by triples with arbitrary formula_26 formula_27 and formula_28 They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. Matrices can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely
formula_29
where formula_30 is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, formula_31 is the vector formula_32 formula_33 denotes the matrix product, and formula_34 is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous &quot;linear differential equations&quot; form vector spaces. For example,
formula_35
yields formula_36 where formula_37 and formula_38 are arbitrary constants, and formula_39 is the natural exponential function.

==Linear maps and matrices==

The relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by &quot;linear map&quot; or &quot;linear transformation&quot;. They are functions that reflect the vector space structure, that is, they preserve sums and scalar multiplication:
formula_40 
for all formula_41 and formula_42 in formula_43 all formula_37 in formula_45

An &quot;isomorphism&quot; is a linear map such that there exists an inverse map , which is a map such that the two possible compositions and are identity maps. Equivalently, is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective). If there exists an isomorphism between and , the two spaces are said to be &quot;isomorphic&quot;; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in are, via , transported to similar ones in , and vice versa via .
For example, the arrows in the plane and the ordered pairs of numbers vector spaces in the introduction above (see ) are isomorphic: a planar arrow departing at the origin of some (fixed) coordinate system can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the - and -component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair , the arrow going by to the right (or to the left, if is negative), and up (down, if is negative) turns back the arrow .

Linear maps between two vector spaces form a vector space , also denoted , or . The space of linear maps from to is called the &quot;dual vector space&quot;, denoted . Via the injective natural map , any vector space can be embedded into its &quot;bidual&quot;; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.

Once a basis of is chosen, linear maps are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them. If , a 1-to-1 correspondence between fixed bases of and gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of to the corresponding basis element of . It is an isomorphism, by its very definition. Therefore, two vector spaces over a given field are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space over a given field is &quot;completely classified&quot; (up to isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any &quot;n&quot;-dimensional -vector space is isomorphic to . However, there is no &quot;canonical&quot; or preferred isomorphism; an isomorphism is equivalent to the choice of a basis of , by mapping the standard basis of to , via . 

===Matrices===
&quot;Matrices&quot; are a useful notion to encode linear maps. They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any -by- matrix formula_46 gives rise to a linear map from to , by the following
formula_47 
where formula_48 denotes summation, or by using the matrix multiplication of the matrix formula_46 with the coordinate vector formula_31:
formula_51
Moreover, after choosing bases of and , &quot;any&quot; linear map is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.
The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero. The linear transformation of corresponding to a real &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix is orientation preserving if and only if its determinant is positive.

===Eigenvalues and eigenvectors===

Endomorphisms, linear maps , are particularly important since in this case vectors can be compared with their image under , . Any nonzero vector satisfying , where is a scalar, is called an &quot;eigenvector&quot; of with &quot;eigenvalue&quot; . Equivalently, is an element of the kernel of the difference (where Id is the identity map . If is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants: having eigenvalue is equivalent to
formula_52
By spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in , called the characteristic polynomial of . If the field is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for algebraically closed, such as ) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space may or may not possess an eigenbasis, a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the Jordan canonical form of the map. The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of forms a vector space known as the &quot;eigenspace&quot; corresponding to the eigenvalue (and ) in question.

==Basic constructions==
In addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones. 

===Subspaces and quotient spaces===

A nonempty subset formula_53 of a vector space formula_54 that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the formula_55-vector of formula_54) is called a &quot;linear subspace&quot; of formula_57, or simply a &quot;subspace&quot; of formula_57, when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space. Subspaces of formula_54 are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set formula_60 of vectors is called its span, and it is the smallest subspace of formula_54 containing the set formula_60. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of formula_60.

Linear subspace of dimension 1 and 2 are referred to as a &quot;line&quot; (also &quot;vector line&quot;), and a &quot;plane&quot; respectively. If &quot;W&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space, any subspace of dimension 1 less, i.e., of dimension formula_64 is called a &quot;hyperplane&quot;.

The counterpart to subspaces are &quot;quotient vector spaces&quot;. Given any subspace formula_65, the quotient space formula_66 (&quot;formula_54 modulo formula_53&quot;) is defined as follows: as a set, it consists of
formula_69
where formula_41 is an arbitrary vector in formula_54. The sum of two such elements formula_72 and formula_73 is formula_74, and scalar multiplication is given by formula_75. The key point in this definition is that formula_76 if and only if the difference of formula_77 and formula_78 lies in formula_53. This way, the quotient space &quot;forgets&quot; information that is contained in the subspace formula_53.

The kernel formula_81 of a linear map formula_82 consists of vectors formula_41 that are mapped to formula_55 in formula_53. The kernel and the image formula_86 are subspaces of formula_54 and formula_53, respectively. 

An important example is the kernel of a linear map formula_89 for some fixed matrix formula_46. The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors formula_31 such that formula_92, which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to formula_46. This concept also extends to linear differential equations
formula_94
where the coefficients formula_95 are functions in formula_96 too.
In the corresponding map
formula_97
the derivatives of the function formula_98 appear linearly (as opposed to formula_99, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (that is, formula_100 and formula_101 for a constant formula_102) this assignment is linear, called a linear differential operator. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation formula_103 form a vector space (over or ).

The existence of kernels and images is part of the statement that the category of vector spaces (over a fixed field formula_104) is an abelian category, that is, a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a category) that behaves much like the category of abelian groups. Because of this, many statements such as the first isomorphism theorem (also called rank–nullity theorem in matrix-related terms)
formula_105
and the second and third isomorphism theorem can be formulated and proven in a way very similar to the corresponding statements for groups.

===Direct product and direct sum===

The &quot;direct product&quot; of vector spaces and the &quot;direct sum&quot; of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.

The &quot;direct product&quot; formula_106 of a family of vector spaces formula_107 consists of the set of all tuples formula_108, which specify for each index formula_109 in some index set formula_110 an element formula_111 of formula_107. Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise. A variant of this construction is the &quot;direct sum&quot; formula_113 (also called coproduct and denoted formula_114), where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are allowed. If the index set formula_110 is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.

===Tensor product===

The &quot;tensor product&quot; formula_116 or simply formula_117 of two vector spaces formula_54 and formula_53 is one of the central notions of multilinear algebra which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map formula_120 from the Cartesian product formula_121 is called bilinear if formula_122 is linear in both variables formula_41 and formula_124 That is to say, for fixed formula_42 the map formula_126 is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed formula_127
The tensor product is a particular vector space that is a &quot;universal&quot; recipient of bilinear maps formula_128 as follows. It is defined as the vector space consisting of finite (formal) sums of symbols called tensors
formula_129
subject to the rules
formula_130
These rules ensure that the map formula_98 from the formula_121 to formula_133 that maps a tuple formula_134 to formula_135 is bilinear. The universality states that given &quot;any&quot; vector space formula_136 and &quot;any&quot; bilinear map formula_137 there exists a unique map formula_138 shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose composition with formula_98 equals formula_140 formula_141 This is called the universal property of the tensor product, an instance of the method—much used in advanced abstract algebra—to indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.

==Vector spaces with additional structure==
From the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space over a given field is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces &quot;per se&quot; do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions converges to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with infinite series, since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. Therefore, the needs of functional analysis require considering additional structures.

A vector space may be given a partial order formula_142 under which some vectors can be compared. For example, formula_143-dimensional real space formula_144 can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. Ordered vector spaces, for example Riesz spaces, are fundamental to Lebesgue integration, which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions
formula_145
where formula_146 denotes the positive part of formula_98 and formula_148 the negative part.

===Normed vector spaces and inner product spaces===

&quot;Measuring&quot; vectors is done by specifying a norm, a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an inner product, which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted formula_149 and respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as &quot;normed vector spaces&quot; and &quot;inner product spaces&quot;, respectively.

Coordinate space formula_19 can be equipped with the standard dot product:
formula_151
In formula_152 this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors formula_31 and formula_154 by the law of cosines:
formula_155
Because of this, two vectors satisfying formula_156 are called orthogonal. An important variant of the standard dot product is used in Minkowski space: formula_157 endowed with the Lorentz product
formula_158
In contrast to the standard dot product, it is not positive definite: formula_159 also takes negative values, for example, for formula_160 Singling out the fourth coordinate—corresponding to time, as opposed to three space-dimensions—makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of special relativity. Note that in other conventions time is often written as the first, or &quot;zeroeth&quot; component so that the Lorentz product is written formula_161

===Topological vector spaces===

Convergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces formula_54 carrying a compatible topology, a structure that allows one to talk about elements being close to each other. Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be continuous maps. Roughly, if formula_31 and formula_164 in formula_54, and formula_37 in formula_104 vary by a bounded amount, then so do formula_168 and formula_169 To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field formula_104 also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice is the reals or the complex numbers.

In such &quot;topological vector spaces&quot; one can consider series of vectors. The infinite sum
formula_171
denotes the limit of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence formula_172 of elements of formula_173 For example, the formula_174 could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some function space formula_43 in which case the series is a function series. The mode of convergence of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, pointwise convergence and uniform convergence are two prominent examples.
A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any Cauchy sequence has a limit; such a vector space is called complete. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval formula_176 equipped with the topology of uniform convergence is not complete because any continuous function on formula_177 can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the Weierstrass approximation theorem. In contrast, the space of &quot;all&quot; continuous functions on formula_177 with the same topology is complete. A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors formula_179 converges to formula_41 if and only if
formula_181
Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of functional analysis—focuses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence. The image at the right shows the equivalence of the formula_182-norm and formula_183-norm on formula_184 as the unit &quot;balls&quot; enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.

From a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called functionals) formula_185 maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous. In particular, the (topological) dual space formula_186 consists of continuous functionals formula_187 (or to formula_188). The fundamental Hahn–Banach theorem is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.

====Banach spaces====

&quot;Banach spaces&quot;, introduced by Stefan Banach, are complete normed vector spaces.

A first example is the vector space formula_189 consisting of infinite vectors with real entries formula_190
whose formula_191-norm formula_192 given by 
formula_193
formula_194
The topologies on the infinite-dimensional space formula_189 are inequivalent for different formula_196 For example, the sequence of vectors formula_197 in which the first formula_198 components are formula_199 and the following ones are formula_200 converges to the zero vector for formula_201 but does not for formula_202
formula_203 
but 
formula_204

More generally than sequences of real numbers, functions formula_205 are endowed with a norm that replaces the above sum by the Lebesgue integral 
formula_206

The space of integrable functions on a given domain formula_207 (for example an interval) satisfying formula_208 and equipped with this norm are called Lebesgue spaces, denoted formula_209

These spaces are complete. (If one uses the Riemann integral instead, the space is complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue&#x27;s integration theory.) Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions formula_210 with formula_211 satisfying the condition
formula_212
there exists a function formula_213 belonging to the vector space formula_214 such that
formula_215

Imposing boundedness conditions not only on the function, but also on its derivatives leads to Sobolev spaces.
====Hilbert spaces====
Complete inner product spaces are known as &quot;Hilbert spaces&quot;, in honor of David Hilbert. The Hilbert space formula_216 with inner product given by
formula_217
where formula_218 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_219 is a key case.

By definition, in a Hilbert space, any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit. Conversely, finding a sequence of functions formula_220 with desirable properties that approximate a given limit function is equally crucial. Early analysis, in the guise of the Taylor approximation, established an approximation of differentiable functions formula_98 by polynomials. By the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, every continuous function on formula_222 can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial. A similar approximation technique by trigonometric functions is commonly called Fourier expansion, and is much applied in engineering. More generally, and more conceptually, the theorem yields a simple description of what &quot;basic functions&quot;, or, in abstract Hilbert spaces, what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space formula_223 in the sense that the &quot;closure&quot; of their span (that is, finite linear combinations and limits of those) is the whole space. Such a set of functions is called a &quot;basis&quot; of formula_223 its cardinality is known as the Hilbert space dimension. Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes, but also together with the Gram–Schmidt process, it enables one to construct a basis of orthogonal vectors. Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite-dimensional Euclidean space.

The solutions to various differential equations can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces. For example, a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations, and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions, often orthogonal. As an example from physics, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a partial differential equation, whose solutions are called wavefunctions. Definite values for physical properties such as energy, or momentum, correspond to eigenvalues of a certain (linear) differential operator and the associated wavefunctions are called eigenstates. The spectral theorem decomposes a linear compact operator acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues.

===Algebras over fields===
General vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an &quot;algebra over a field&quot; (or &quot;F&quot;-algebra if the field &quot;F&quot; is specified).

For example, the set of all polynomials formula_225 forms an algebra known as the polynomial ring: using that the sum of two polynomials is a polynomial, they form a vector space; they form an algebra since the product of two polynomials is again a polynomial. Rings of polynomials (in several variables) and their quotients form the basis of algebraic geometry, because they are rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects.

Another crucial example are &quot;Lie algebras&quot;, which are neither commutative nor associative, but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints (formula_226 denotes the product of formula_227 and formula_228):
* formula_229 (anticommutativity), and
* formula_230 (Jacobi identity).
Examples include the vector space of formula_143-by-formula_143 matrices, with formula_233 the commutator of two matrices, and formula_234 endowed with the cross product.

The tensor algebra formula_235 is a formal way of adding products to any vector space formula_54 to obtain an algebra. As a vector space, it is spanned by symbols, called simple tensors
formula_237
where the degree formula_143 varies.
The multiplication is given by concatenating such symbols, imposing the distributive law under addition, and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product ⊗, much the same way as with the tensor product of two vector spaces introduced in the above section on tensor products. In general, there are no relations between formula_239 and formula_240 Forcing two such elements to be equal leads to the symmetric algebra, whereas forcing formula_241 yields the exterior algebra.

==Related structures==

===Vector bundles===
A &quot;vector bundle&quot; is a family of vector spaces parametrized continuously by a topological space &quot;X&quot;. More precisely, a vector bundle over &quot;X&quot; is a topological space &quot;E&quot; equipped with a continuous map 
formula_242
such that for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, the fiber π−1(&quot;x&quot;) is a vector space. The case dim is called a line bundle. For any vector space &quot;V&quot;, the projection makes the product into a &quot;trivial&quot; vector bundle. Vector bundles over &quot;X&quot; are required to be locally a product of &quot;X&quot; and some (fixed) vector space &quot;V&quot;: for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, there is a neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that the restriction of π to π−1(&quot;U&quot;) is isomorphic to the trivial bundle . Despite their locally trivial character, vector bundles may (depending on the shape of the underlying space &quot;X&quot;) be &quot;twisted&quot; in the large (that is, the bundle need not be (globally isomorphic to) the trivial bundle ). For example, the Möbius strip can be seen as a line bundle over the circle &quot;S&quot;1 (by identifying open intervals with the real line). It is, however, different from the cylinder , because the latter is orientable whereas the former is not.

Properties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the tangent bundle consists of the collection of tangent spaces parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle &quot;S&quot;1 is globally isomorphic to , since there is a global nonzero vector field on &quot;S&quot;1. In contrast, by the hairy ball theorem, there is no (tangent) vector field on the 2-sphere &quot;S&quot;2 which is everywhere nonzero. K-theory studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space. In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real division algebras: R, C, the quaternions H and the octonions O.

The cotangent bundle of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the cotangent space. Sections of that bundle are known as differential one-forms.

===Modules===

&quot;Modules&quot; are to rings what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring &quot;R&quot; instead of a field &quot;F&quot;, yield modules. The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have multiplicative inverses. For example, modules need not have bases, as the Z-module (that is, abelian group) Z/2Z shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as free modules. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a module over a ring which is a field, with the elements being called vectors. Some authors use the term &quot;vector space&quot; to mean modules over a division ring. The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their spectrum allows the development of concepts such as locally free modules, the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.

===Affine and projective spaces===
Roughly, &quot;affine spaces&quot; are vector spaces whose origins are not specified. More precisely, an affine space is a set with a free transitive vector space action. In particular, a vector space is an affine space over itself, by the map
formula_243
If &quot;W&quot; is a vector space, then an affine subspace is a subset of &quot;W&quot; obtained by translating a linear subspace &quot;V&quot; by a fixed vector ; this space is denoted by (it is a coset of &quot;V&quot; in &quot;W&quot;) and consists of all vectors of the form for An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations
formula_244
generalizing the homogeneous case discussed in the above section on linear equations, which can be found by setting formula_245 in this equation. The space of solutions is the affine subspace where x is a particular solution of the equation, and &quot;V&quot; is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation (the nullspace of &quot;A&quot;).

The set of one-dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; is known as &quot;projective space&quot;; it may be used to formalize the idea of parallel lines intersecting at infinity. Grassmannians and flag manifolds generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension &quot;k&quot; and flags of subspaces, respectively.

<text>Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a country on the northern coast of South America, consisting of a continental landmass and many islands and islets in the Caribbean Sea. It comprises an area of , and its population was estimated at 29 million in 2022. The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas. The continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. Venezuela is a presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela&#x27;s offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital.

The territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from Indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part of the first federal Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. From 1958, the country had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity.

Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. The government&#x27;s populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices, temporarily increasing social spending, and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. However, poverty began to rapidly increase in the 2010s. The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day. 

Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state. It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption. Venezuela is a developing country, has the world&#x27;s largest known oil reserves, and has been one of the world&#x27;s leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela&#x27;s entire economy. The country struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, environmental issues, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan refugee crisis in which more than 7.7 million people had fled the country by June 2024. By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation.

==Etymology==

According to the most popular and accepted version, in 1499, an expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda visited the Venezuelan coast. The stilt houses in the area of Lake Maracaibo reminded the Italian navigator, Amerigo Vespucci, of the city of Venice, Italy, so he named the region &quot;Veneziola&quot;, or &quot;Little Venice&quot;. The Spanish version of &quot;Veneziola&quot; is .

Martín Fernández de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew, gave a different account. In his work , he states that the crew found Indigenous peoples who called themselves the &quot;Veneciuela.&quot; Thus, the name &quot;Venezuela&quot; may have evolved from the native word.

Previously, the official name was (1830–1856), (1856–1864), (1864–1953), and again (1953–1999).

== History ==
===Pre-Columbian history===
Evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. Tools have been found on the high riverine terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela. Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela; according to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.

It is unknown how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at one million. In addition to Indigenous peoples known today, the population included groups such as the Kalina (Caribs), Auaké, Caquetio, Mariche, and Timoto–Cuicas. The Timoto–Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. Their houses were made of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and ullucos. They left behind art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the arepa, a staple in Venezuelan cuisine.

After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of infectious diseases from Europe. Two main north–south axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and manioc in the east. Large parts of the &quot;llanos&quot; were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture.

=== Colonization ===
In 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus sailed near the Orinoco Delta and landed in the Gulf of Paria. Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise):
Spain&#x27;s colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the city of Cumaná.

==== German colonization ====
In the 16th century, the king of Spain granted a concession to the German Welser family. Klein-Venedig became the most extensive initiative in the German colonization of the Americas from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who was King of Spain and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his Imperial election.

In 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of El Dorado. The first expedition was led by Ambrosius Ehinger, who established Maracaibo in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then Nikolaus Federmann, and Georg von Speyer (1540), Philipp von Hutten persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint a governor. On Hutten&#x27;s return to the capital, Santa Ana de Coro, in 1546, the Spanish governor Juan de Carvajal had Hutten and Bartholomeus VI. Welser executed. Subsequently, Charles V revoked Welser&#x27;s concession. The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African slaves to plant sugar cane plantations. Many German colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no immunity, or through wars with the Indigenous inhabitants.

=== Late 15th century to early 17th century ===
Native &quot;caciques&quot; (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro () and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.

In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as the Mariches, themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to Roman Catholicism. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, Chacao and Los Teques. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast, but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the Orinoco River. Here, the Ye&#x27;kuana organized resistance in 1775–76.

Spain&#x27;s eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into New Andalusia Province. Administered by the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous Captaincy General starting in 1777. Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of La Guaira and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against pirates and a more fertile and healthy climate.

=== Independence and 19th century ===

After unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan marshal who had fought in the American and French Revolutions, declared independence as the First Republic of Venezuela on 5 July 1811. This began the Venezuelan War of Independence. A devastating 1812 Caracas earthquake, together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan &quot;llaneros&quot;, helped bring down the republic. Simón Bolívar, new leader of the independentist forces, launched his Admirable Campaign in 1813 from New Granada, retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as &quot;El Libertador&quot; (&quot;The Liberator&quot;). A Second Republic of Venezuela was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed by royalist caudillo José Tomás Boves and his personal army of &quot;llaneros&quot;.

The end of the French invasion of homeland Spain in 1814 allowed a large expeditionary force to come under general Pablo Morillo, with the goal to regain the lost territory in Venezuela and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bolívar reestablished the Third Republic of Venezuela on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the Guayana and Llanos regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the Congress of Angostura of 1819, the union of Venezuela with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of Colombia. The war continued until full victory and sovereignty was attained after the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. On 24 July 1823, José Prudencio Padilla and Rafael Urdaneta helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo. New Granada&#x27;s congress gave Bolívar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia).

Sucre went on to liberate Ecuador and become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by José Antonio Páez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela, on 22 September; Páez became the first president of the new State of Venezuela. Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela&#x27;s population was lost during these two decades of war (including about half the Venezuelans of European descent), which by 1830, was estimated at 800,000. In the Flag of Venezuela, the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence.

Slavery in Venezuela was abolished in 1854. Much of Venezuela&#x27;s 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader José Antonio Páez, who gained the presidency three times and served 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the Federal War (1859–63). In the latter half of the century, Antonio Guzmán Blanco, another &quot;caudillo&quot;, served 13 years, between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.

In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the Essequibo territory, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela&#x27;s lobbyist, William L. Scruggs, sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the United States&#x27; Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere. Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.

In 1899, Cipriano Castro, assisted by his friend Juan Vicente Gómez, seized power in Caracas. Castro defaulted on Venezuela&#x27;s considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela&#x27;s civil wars. This led to the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903, in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade before international arbitration at the new Permanent Court of Arbitration was agreed. In 1908, another dispute broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by Juan Vicente Gómez (1908–35).

=== 20th century ===

The discovery of massive oil deposits in Lake Maracaibo during World War I proved pivotal for Venezuela and transformed its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela&#x27;s per capita gross domestic product was Latin America&#x27;s highest. Gómez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority.

Gómez remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935. The &quot;gomecista&quot; dictatorship (1935–1945) system largely continued under Eleazar López Contreras, but from 1941, under Isaías Medina Angarita, was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.

In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in a period of democratic rule (1945–1948) under the mass membership party Democratic Action, initially under Rómulo Betancourt, until Rómulo Gallegos won the 1947 Venezuelan presidential election (the first free and fair elections in Venezuela). Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate , Marcos Pérez Jiménez, and Gallegos&#x27; Defense Minister, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, in the 1948 Venezuelan &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.
The most powerful man in the military &quot;junta&quot; (1948–58) was Pérez Jiménez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the 1952 presidential election, it ignored the results and Jiménez was installed as president Jiménez was forced out on 23 January 1958. In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties (Acción Democrática (AD), COPEI and Unión Republicana Democrática (URD), with the notable exception of the Communist Party of Venezuela), signed the Puntofijo Pact power-sharing agreement. AD and COPEI dominated the political landscape for four decades.

During the presidencies of Rómulo Betancourt (1959–64, his second term) and Raúl Leoni (1964–69), substantial guerilla movements occurred. Most laid down their arms under Rafael Caldera&#x27;s first presidency (1969–74). Caldera had won the 1968 election for COPEI, the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt suffered an attack planned by the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an insurgency by organizing themselves into the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and Fidel Castro. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts. Betancourt promoted a foreign policy, the Betancourt Doctrine, in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.
The 1973 Venezuelan presidential election of Carlos Andrés Pérez coincided with an oil crisis, in which Venezuela&#x27;s income exploded as oil prices soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, until the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in 1983 to face its financial obligations, standards of living fell dramatically. Failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.

In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.

Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis. Hundreds of people were killed by security forces and the military in the &quot;Caracazo&quot; riots of 1989, during the second presidential term of Carlos Andrés Pérez (1989–1993) and after the implementation of economic austerity measures. Hugo Chávez, who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments, used the growing anger at economic austerity measures to justify a coup attempt in February 1992; a second coup d&#x27;état attempt occurred in November. President Carlos Andrés Pérez (re-elected in 1988) was impeached under embezzlement charges in 1993, leading to the interim presidency of Ramón José Velásquez (1993–1994). Coup leader Chávez was pardoned in March 1994 by president Rafael Caldera (1994–1999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Chávez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004.

=== Bolivarian government under Chávez: 1999–2013 ===
A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to Hugo Chávez being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a &quot;Bolivarian Revolution&quot;, beginning with a 1999 constituent assembly to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a left-wing populism social movement and political process led by Chávez, who founded the Fifth Republic Movement in 1997 and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007. The &quot;Bolivarian Revolution&quot; is named after Simón Bolívar. According to Chávez and other supporters, the &quot;Bolivarian Revolution&quot; sought to build a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism—popular democracy, economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bolívar&#x27;s ideas from a populist perspective, using socialist rhetoric. This led to formation of the Fifth Republic of Venezuela, commonly known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that continues to the present day. Venezuela has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new Constitution of 1999. Following Chávez&#x27;s election, Venezuela developed into a dominant-party system, dominated by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly ousted from power in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt following popular demonstrations by his opponents, but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Chávez supporters and actions by the military. Chávez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA. Capital flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency controls. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into currency devaluations. These devaluations did not improve the situation of the people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs, while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the majority of exports. The profits of the oil industry have been lost to &quot;social engineering&quot; and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.

Chávez survived further political tests, including an August 2004 recall referendum. He was elected for another term in December 2006 and for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in due to medical complications; he died in March 2013.

=== Bolivarian government under Maduro: 2013–present ===
The presidential election that took place in April 2013, was the first since Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.
Under the Bolivarian government, Venezuela went from being one of the richest countries in Latin America to one of the poorest. Hugo Chávez&#x27;s socioeconomic policies of relying on oil sales and importing goods resulted in large amounts of debt, no change to corruption in Venezuela and culminated into a crisis in Venezuela. As a result, the Venezuelan refugee crisis, the largest emigration of people in Latin America&#x27;s history, occurred, with over 7 million – about 20% of the country&#x27;s population – emigrating. Chávez initiated Bolivarian missions, programs aimed at helping the poor.

Poverty began to increase into the 2010s. Nicolás Maduro was picked by Chavez as his successor, appointing him vice president in 2013.

Maduro has been president of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, when he won the presidential election after Chavez&#x27; death, with 51% of the vote, against Henrique Capriles on 49%. The Democratic Unity Roundtable contested Maduro&#x27;s election as fraud, but an audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies, and the Supreme Court of Venezuela ruled Maduro was the legitimate president. Opposition leaders and some international media consider Maduro&#x27;s government a dictatorship. Since February 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to government policies. Demonstrations and riots have resulted in over 40 fatalities in the unrest between Chavistas and opposition protesters and opposition leaders, including Leopoldo López and Antonio Ledezma were arrested. Human rights groups condemned the arrest of López. In the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the opposition gained a majority.

Venezuela devalued its currency in February 2013 due to rising shortages, which included milk and other necessities. This led to an increase in malnutrition, especially among children. The economy had become dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude accounting for 86% of exports, and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the price of oil plummeted from over $100 to $40. This placed pressure on the economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. The Government began taking more money from PDVSA, the state oil company, resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. Production decreased from its height of nearly per day. In 2014, Venezuela entered a recession, and in 2015, had the world&#x27;s highest inflation, surpassing 100%. In 2017, Donald Trump&#x27;s administration imposed more economic sanctions against PDVSA and Venezuelan officials. Economic problems, as well as crime, were the causes of the 2014–present Venezuelan protests. Since 2014, roughly 5.6 million people have fled Venezuela.

In January 2016, Maduro decreed an &quot;economic emergency&quot;, revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers. In July 2016, Colombian border crossings were temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase food and basic health items. In September 2016, a study indicated 15% of Venezuelans were eating &quot;food waste discarded by commercial establishments&quot;. 200 prison riots had occurred by October 2016.
The Maduro-aligned Supreme Tribunal, which had been overturning National Assembly decisions since the opposition took control, took over the functions of the assembly, creating the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis. In August 2017, the 2017 Constituent National Assembly was elected and stripped the National Assembly of its powers. The election raised concerns of an emerging dictatorship. In December 2017, Maduro declared opposition parties barred from the following year&#x27;s presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.

Maduro won the 2018 election with 68% of the vote. The result was challenged by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, France and the US who deemed it fraudulent and recognized Juan Guaidó as president. Other countries continued to recognize Maduro, although China, facing financial pressure over its position, began hedging by decreasing loans, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties. In August 2019, Trump imposed an economic embargo against Venezuela. In March 2020, Trump indicted Maduro and Venezuelan officials, on charges of drug trafficking, narcoterrorism, and corruption.

In June 2020, a report documented enforced disappearances that occurred in 2018–19. 724 enforced disappearances of political detainees were reported. The report stated that security forces subjected victims to torture. The report stated the government used enforced disappearances to silence opponents and other critical voices.
Maduro ran for a third consecutive term in the 2024 presidential election, while former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia represented the Unitary Platform (; PUD), the main opposition political alliance. Polls conducted before the election indicated that González would win by a wide margin. After the government-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) announced partial results showing a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July, world leaders predominantly expressed skepticism of the claimed results and did not recognize the CNE claims with only some exceptions. Both González and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the Carter Center and Organization of American States due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by poll watchers from a majority of polling centers as proof.

In the aftermath of the announcement of results by the election authorities, protests broke out across the country.

== Geography ==

Venezuela is located in the north of South America; geologically, its mainland rests on the South American Plate. It has a total area of and a land area of , making Venezuela the 33rd largest country in the world. The territory it controls lies between latitudes 0° and 16°N and longitudes 59° and 74°W.

Shaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well defined topographical regions: the Maracaibo lowlands in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east–west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the Guiana Highlands in the southeast.

The northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America&#x27;s Andes mountain range. Pico Bolívar, the nation&#x27;s highest point at , lies in this region. To the south, the dissected Guiana Highlands contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and Angel Falls, the world&#x27;s highest waterfall, as well as &quot;tepuis&quot;, large table-like mountains. The country&#x27;s center is characterized by the &quot;llanos&quot;, which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River delta in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich alluvial soils, binds the largest and most important river system of the country; it originates in one of the largest watersheds in Latin America. The Caroní and the Apure are other major rivers.

Venezuela borders Colombia to the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Curaçao, Aruba, and the Leeward Antilles lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly United Kingdom, largely concerning the Essequibo area and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a &quot;neutral&quot; commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela&#x27;s claim.

=== Climate ===
Venezuela is entirely located in the tropics over the Equator to around 12° N. Its climate varies from humid low-elevation plains, where average annual temperatures range as high as , to glaciers and highlands (the &quot;páramos&quot;) with an average yearly temperature of . Annual rainfall varies from in the semiarid portions of the northwest to over in the Orinoco Delta of the far east and the Amazonian Jungle in the south. The precipitation level is lower in the period from August through April. These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout the country by the existence of a mountain range called &quot;Cordillera de la Costa&quot; which crosses the country from east to west. The majority of the population lives in these mountains.

The country falls into four horizontal temperature zones based primarily on elevation, having tropical, dry, temperate with dry winters, and polar (alpine tundra) climates, amongst others. In the tropical zone—below —temperatures are hot, with yearly averages ranging between . The temperate zone ranges between with averages from ; many of Venezuela&#x27;s cities, including the capital, lie in this region. Colder conditions with temperatures from are found in the cool zone between , especially in the Venezuelan Andes, where pastureland and permanent snowfield with yearly averages below cover land above in the &quot;páramos&quot;.

The highest temperature recorded was in Machiques, and the lowest temperature recorded was , reported from an uninhabited high altitude at Páramo de Piedras Blancas (Mérida state).

=== Biodiversity and conservation ===

Venezuela lies within the Neotropical realm; large portions of the country were originally covered by moist broadleaf forests. One of 17 megadiverse countries, Venezuela&#x27;s habitats range from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive &quot;llanos&quot; plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. They include xeric scrublands in the extreme northwest and coastal mangrove forests in the northeast. Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.

Animals of Venezuela are diverse and include manatees, three-toed sloth, two-toed sloth, Amazon river dolphins, and Orinoco Crocodiles, which have been reported to reach up to in length. Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic. Important birds include ibises, ospreys, kingfishers, and the yellow-orange Venezuelan troupial, the national bird. Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world&#x27;s largest rodent. More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.

For the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G. Dennis which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database. That database includes nearly 3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.

Among plants of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country&#x27;s cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems. These include the &quot;flor de mayo&quot; orchid (&quot;Cattleya mossiae&quot;), the national flower. Venezuela&#x27;s national tree is the araguaney. The tops of the tepuis are also home to several carnivorous plants including the marsh pitcher plant, Heliamphora, and the insectivorous bromeliad, Brocchinia reducta.

Venezuela is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism. Among its animals, 23% of reptilian and 50% of amphibian species, including the Trinidad poison frog, are endemic. Although the available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Venezuela: 1334 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possibly endemic. Some 38% of the over 21,000 plant species known from Venezuela are unique to the country.

Venezuela is one of the 10 most biodiverse countries on the planet, yet it is one of the leaders of deforestation due to economic and political factors. Each year, roughly 287,600 hectares of forest are permanently destroyed, and other areas are degraded by mining, oil extraction, and logging. Between 1990 and 2005, Venezuela officially lost 8.3% of its forest cover, which is about 4.3 million ha. In response, federal protections for critical habitat were implemented; for example, 20% to 33% of forested land is protected. The country&#x27;s biosphere reserve is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention. In 2003, 70% of the nation&#x27;s land was under conservation management in over 200 protected areas, including 43 national parks. Venezuela&#x27;s 43 national parks include Canaima National Park, Morrocoy National Park, and Mochima National Park. In the far south is a reserve for the country&#x27;s Yanomami tribes. Covering , the area is off-limits to farmers, miners, and all non-Yanomami settlers.

Venezuela was one of the few countries that did not enter an INDC at COP21. Many terrestrial ecosystems are considered endangered, specially the dry forest in the northern regions of the country and the coral reefs in the Caribbean coast.

There are 105 protected areas in Venezuela, which cover around 26% of the country&#x27;s continental, marine and insular surface.

=== Hydrography ===

The country is made up of three river basins: the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Valencia, which forms an endorheic basin.

On the Atlantic side it drains most of Venezuela&#x27;s river waters. The largest basin in this area is the extensive Orinoco basin whose surface area, close to one million km2, is greater than that of the whole of Venezuela, although it has a presence of 65% in the country.

The size of this basin - similar to that of the Danube - makes it the third largest in South America, and it gives rise to a flow of some 33,000 m3/s, making the Orinoco the third largest in the world, and also one of the most valuable from the point of view of renewable natural resources. The Rio or Brazo Casiquiare is unique in the world, as it is a natural derivation of the Orinoco that, after some 500 km in length, connects it to the Negro River, which in turn is a tributary of the Amazon. 

The Orinoco receives directly or indirectly rivers such as the Ventuari, the Caura, the Caroní, the Meta, the Arauca, the Apure and many others. Other Venezuelan rivers that empty into the Atlantic are the waters of the San Juan and Cuyuní basins. Finally, there is the Amazon River, which receives the Guainía, the Negro and others. Other basins are the Gulf of Paria and the Esequibo River.
The second most important watershed is the Caribbean Sea. The rivers of this region are usually short and of scarce and irregular flow, with some exceptions such as the Catatumbo, which originates in Colombia and drains into the Maracaibo Lake basin. Among the rivers that reach the Maracaibo lake basin are the Chama, the Escalante, the Catatumbo, and the contributions of the smaller basins of the Tocuyo, Yaracuy, Neverí and Manzanares rivers.

A minimum drains to the Lake Valencia basin. Of the total extension of the rivers, a total of 5400 km are navigable. Other rivers worth mentioning are the Apure, Arauca, Caura, Meta, Barima, Portuguesa, Ventuari and Zulia, among others.The country&#x27;s main lakes are Lake Maracaibo -the largest in South America- open to the sea through the natural channel, but with fresh water, and Lake Valencia with its endorheic system. Other noteworthy bodies of water are the Guri reservoir, the Altagracia lagoon, the Camatagua reservoir and the Mucubají lagoon in the Andes.

=== Relief ===
The Venezuelan natural landscape is the product of the interaction of tectonic plates that since the Paleozoic have contributed to its current appearance. On the formed structures, seven physical-natural units have been modeled, differentiated in their relief and in their natural resources.

The relief of Venezuela has the following characteristics: coastline with several peninsulas and islands, adenas of the Andes mountain range (north and northwest), Lake Maracaibo (between the chains, on the coast); Orinoco river delta, region of peneplains and plateaus (tepui, east of the Orinoco) that together form the Guyanas massif (plateaus, southeast of the country).

The oldest rock formations in South America are found in the complex basement of the Guyanas highlands and in the crystalline line of the Maritime and Cordillera massifs in Venezuela. The Venezuelan part of the Guyanas Altiplano consists of a large granite block of gneiss and other crystalline Archean rocks, with underlying layers of sandstone and shale clay.

The core of granite and cordillera is, to a large extent, flanked by sedimentary layers from the Cretaceous, folded in an anticline structure. Between these orographic systems there are plains covered with tertiary and quaternary layers of gravel, sands and clayey marls. The depression contains lagoons and lakes, among which is that of Maracaibo, and presents, on the surface, alluvial deposits from the Quaternary.
*Coastal Mountain Range
Also known as the Cordillera de la Costa, stretches along Venezuela&#x27;s northern coast. This region is known for its lush tropical rainforests, stunning coastal views, and a rich variety of flora and fauna. The intermountain depressions, or valleys, between the mountain ranges are often home to fertile agricultural land and vibrant communities. These valleys offer a stark contrast to the rugged mountains that rise dramatically from the coast.
*Lara-Falcón Highlands

Situated in northwestern Venezuela, the Lara-Falcón Highlands exhibit a terrain defined by plateaus and rolling hills. These highlands provide a significant contrast to the surrounding lowlands and coastal areas. The relief is characterized by gently sloping plateaus that support agriculture, including coffee and cacao cultivation. This region&#x27;s semi-arid climate and picturesque landscapes make it an important agricultural and tourism center.
*Lake Maracaibo Lowlands
Encompass the basin of Lake Maracaibo and the plains surrounding the Gulf of Venezuela. This region offers two distinct plains—the northern one is relatively dry, while the southern one is humid and dotted with swamps. The relief here is primarily characterized by flat terrain, with the exception of some elevated areas near the lake. Lake Maracaibo itself sits in a depression, surrounded by oil-rich lands and productive agricultural areas.
*The Andes
The Venezuelan Andes, part of the broader Andes mountain range, offer a striking relief with towering peaks, deep valleys, and fertile intermontane basins. Dominated by these corpulent mountain ranges, including Venezuela&#x27;s highest peak, Bolívar Peak, the region&#x27;s rugged and picturesque landscapes are defined by its high-altitude terrain. 

The unique relief of this area finds its origins in the Last Glacial Period, where the interplay of repeated glacier advances and retreats sculpted the landscape, shaped by the cold, high-altitude climate. This glacial heritage has left a lasting imprint, with glaciers carving deep valleys and polishing rugged peaks, while sheltered intramontane valleys offer fertile soils and temperate microclimates, creating ideal conditions for agriculture and human settlement.
*Los Llanos
Los Llanos, or &quot;the plains&quot;, are expansive sedimentary basins characterized by predominantly flat relief. However, the eastern Llanos feature low-plateaus and the Unare depression, created through mesa erosion, adding diversity to the terrain. This region is subject to seasonal flooding, transforming the flat plains into a vast wetland during the rainy season. The relief here influences the region&#x27;s unique ecosystems, including extensive grasslands and abundant wildlife.
* Guiana Shield
The Guiana Shield boasts a varied relief shaped by geological processes over millions of years. This region encompasses peneplains, rugged mountain ranges, foothills, and the iconic tepuis, or table-top mountains. The tepuis stand as isolated, flat-topped plateaus that rise dramatically from the surrounding terrain. This unique relief contributes to the region&#x27;s remarkable biodiversity and scientific significance.
*Orinoco Delta
The Orinoco Delta&#x27;s relief is characterized by a complex system of lands and waters. It consists of numerous channels, islands, and shifting sedimentary deposits. While the relief may appear relatively uniform, it conceals a dynamic environment influenced by seasonal flooding and sediment deposition. This complex deltaic relief supports diverse aquatic life and the livelihoods of Indigenous communities adapted to its ever-changing landscapes.

=== Valleys ===

The valleys are undoubtedly the most important type of landscape in the Venezuelan territory, not because of their spatial extension, but because they are the environment where most of the country&#x27;s population and economic activities are concentrated. On the other hand, there are valleys throughout almost all the national space, except in the great sedimentary basins of the Llanos and the depression of the Maracaibo Lake, except also in the Amazonian peneplains. By their modeling, the valleys of the Venezuelan territory belong mainly to two types: valleys of fluvial type and valleys of glacial type. Much more frequent, the former largely dominate the latter, which are restricted to the highest parts of the Andes. Moreover, most glacial valleys are relics of a past geologic epoch, which culminated some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.

The deep and narrow Andean valleys are very different from the wide depressions of Aragua and Carabobo, in the Cordillera de la Costa, or from the valleys nestled in the Mesas de Monagas. These examples indicate that the configuration of the local relief is decisive in identifying regional types of valleys. Likewise, due to their warm climate, the Guayana valleys are distinguished from the temperate or cold Andean valleys by their humid environment. Both are, in turn, different from the semi-arid depressions of the states of Lara and Falcón.

The Andean valleys, essentially agricultural, precociously populated but nowadays in loss of speed, do not confront the same problems of space occupation as the strongly urbanized and industrialized valleys of the central section of the Cordillera de la Costa. On the other hand, the unpopulated and practically untouched Guiana valleys are another category this area is called the Lost World (&quot;Mundo Perdido&quot;).

The Andean valleys are undoubtedly the most impressive of the Venezuelan territory because of the energy of the encasing reliefs, whose summits often dominate the valley bottoms by 3,000 to 3,500 meters of relative altitude. They are also the most picturesque in terms of their style of habitat, forms of land use, handicraft production and all the traditions linked to these activities.

=== Deserts ===
Venezuela has a great diversity of landscapes and climates, including arid and dry areas. The main desert in the country is in the state of Falcon near the city of Coro. It is now a protected park, the Médanos de Coro National Park. The park is the largest of its kind in Venezuela, covering 91 square kilometres. The landscape is dotted with cacti and other xerophytic plants that can survive in humidity-free conditions near the desert.

Desert wildlife includes mostly lizards, iguanas and other reptiles. Although less frequent, the desert is home to some foxes, giant anteaters and rabbits. There are also some native bird populations, such as the sparrowhawk, tropical mockingbird, scaly dove and crested quail.

Other desert areas in the country include part of the Guajira Desert in the Guajira Municipality in the north of Zulia State and facing the Gulf of Venezuela, the Médanos de Capanaparo in the Santos Luzardo National Park in Apure State, the Medanos de la Isla de Zapara in Zulia State, the so-called Hundición de Yay in the Andrés Eloy Blanco Municipality of Lara State, and the Urumaco Formation also in Falcón State.

== Government and politics ==

Two major blocs of political parties are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies Fatherland for All (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática. This includes A New Era (UNT) together with allied parties Project Venezuela, Justice First, Movement for Socialism (MAS) and others.

The Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and universal suffrage, and is both head of state and head of government. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the cabinet and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.

The president may ask the National Assembly to pass an enabling act granting the ability to rule by decree in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers.

The unicameral Venezuelan parliament is the &quot;Asamblea Nacional&quot; (&quot;National Assembly&quot;). The number of members is variable – each state and the Capital district elect three representatives plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population of the country. Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela&#x27;s Indigenous peoples. For the 2011–2016 period the number of seats is 165. All deputies serve five-year terms.

The voting age in Venezuela is 18. Voting is not compulsory.

The legal system of Venezuela belongs to the Continental Law tradition. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Tribunal of Justice or &quot;Tribunal Supremo de Justicia&quot;, whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single twelve-year term. The National Electoral Council (&quot;Consejo Nacional Electoral&quot;, or &quot;CNE&quot;) is in charge of electoral processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly. Supreme Court president Luisa Estela Morales said in December 2009 that Venezuela had moved away from &quot;a rigid division of powers&quot; toward a system characterized by &quot;intense coordination&quot; between the branches of government. Morales clarified that each power must be independent.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Venezuela is divided into 23 states (&quot;estados&quot;), a capital district (&quot;distrito capital&quot;) corresponding to the city of Caracas, and the Federal Dependencies (&quot;Dependencias Federales&quot;, a special territory). Venezuela is further subdivided into 335 municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;); these are subdivided into over one thousand parishes (&quot;parroquias&quot;). The states are grouped into nine administrative regions (&quot;regiones administrativas&quot;), which were established in 1969 by presidential decree.

The country can be further divided into ten geographical areas, some corresponding to climatic and biogeographical regions. In the north are the Venezuelan Andes and the Coro region, a mountainous tract in the northwest, holds several sierras and valleys. East of it are lowlands abutting Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela.

The Central Range runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of Sucre and northern Monagas. The Insular Region includes all of Venezuela&#x27;s island possessions: Nueva Esparta and the various Federal Dependencies. The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.

The country maintains a claim on the territory it calls &quot;Guayana Esequiba&quot;, the territory administered by Guyana west of the Esequibo River. In 1966 the British and Venezuelan governments signed the Geneva Agreement to resolve the conflict peacefully. The Port of Spain Protocol of 1970 set a deadline to try to resolve the issue, without success to date.

=== Suspension of constitutional rights ===
The 2015 parliamentary elections were held on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three Indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. In 2014, a series of protest and demonstrations began in Venezuela, attributed to inflation, violence and shortages in Venezuela. The protests were largely peaceful. The government has accused the protest of being motivated by fascists, opposition leaders, capitalism and foreign influence, President Maduro acknowledged PSUV defeat but attributed the opposition&#x27;s victory to an intensification of an economic war. Despite this, Maduro said, &quot;I will stop by hook or by crook the opposition coming to power, whatever the costs, in any way&quot;. In the following months, Maduro fulfilled his promise of preventing the elected National Assembly from legislating. The first steps taken by PSUV and government were the substitution of the entire Supreme Court a day after the parliamentary elections, contrary to the Constitution of Venezuela, acclaimed as a fraud by the majority of the Venezuelan and international press. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; described the function of the Supreme Court in Venezuela as &quot;rubber stamping executive whims and vetoing legislation&quot;. The PSUV government used this violation to suspend several elected opponents. Maduro said that &quot;the Amnesty law (approved by the Parliament) will not be executed&quot; and asked the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional.

On 16 January 2016, Maduro approved an unconstitutional economic emergency decree, relegating to his own figure the legislative and executive powers, while also holding judiciary power through the fraudulent designation of judges the day after the election on 6 December 2015. From these events, Maduro effectively controls all three branches of government. On 14 May 2016, constitutional guarantees were in fact suspended when Maduro decreed the extension of the economic emergency decree for another 60 days and declared a State of Emergency, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Venezuela in the Article 338th: &quot;The approval of the extension of States of emergency corresponds to the National Assembly.&quot; Thus, constitutional rights in Venezuela are considered suspended in fact by many publications and public figures.

On 14 May 2016, the Organization of American States was considering the application of the Inter-American Democratic Charter sanctions for non-compliance to its own constitution.

In March 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court took over law making powers from the National Assembly but reversed its decision the following day.

=== Foreign relations ===

Throughout most of the 20th century, Venezuela maintained friendly relations with most Latin American and Western nations. Relations between Venezuela and the United States government worsened in 2002, after the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt during which the U.S. government recognized the short-lived interim presidency of Pedro Carmona. In 2015, Venezuela was declared a national security threat by U.S. president Barack Obama. Correspondingly, ties to various Latin American and Middle Eastern countries not allied to the U.S. have strengthened.

Venezuela seeks alternative hemispheric integration via such proposals as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas trade proposal and the newly launched Latin American television network teleSUR. Venezuela is one of five nations in the world—along with Russia, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria—to have recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Venezuela was a proponent of OAS&#x27;s decision to adopt its Anti-Corruption Convention and is actively working in the Mercosur trade bloc to push increased trade and energy integration. Globally, it seeks a &quot;multi-polar&quot; world based on strengthened ties among undeveloped countries.

On 26 April 2017, Venezuela announced its intention to withdraw from the OAS. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez said that President Nicolás Maduro plans to publicly renounce Venezuela&#x27;s membership on 27 April 2017. It will take two years for the country to formally leave. During this period, the country does not plan on participating in the OAS.

Venezuela is involved in a long-standing disagreement about the control of the Guayana Esequiba area.

Venezuela may suffer a deterioration of its power in international affairs if the global transition to renewable energy is completed. It is ranked 151 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).

Venezuela is a charter member of the United Nations (UN), Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI).

=== Military ===
The Bolivarian National Armed Forces (&quot;Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana&quot;, FANB) are the unified military forces of Venezuela. It includes over 320,150 men and women, under Article 328 of the Constitution, in five components of ground, sea and air. The components of the FANB are: the Venezuelan Army, the Venezuelan Navy, the Venezuelan Air Force, the Venezuelan National Guard, and the Venezuelan National Militia. , a further 600,000 soldiers were incorporated into a new branch, known as the Armed Reserve.

The president of Venezuela is the commander-in-chief of the FANB. Its main purposes are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, fight against drug trafficking, search and rescue and, in the case of a natural disaster, civil protection. All male citizens of Venezuela have a constitutional duty to register for the military service at 18, which is the age of majority.

=== Law and crime ===

In Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 minutes. Violent crimes have been so prevalent in Venezuela that the government no longer produces the crime data. In 2013, the homicide rate was approximately 79 per 100,000, one of the world&#x27;s highest, having quadrupled in the past 15 years with over 200,000 people murdered. By 2015, it had risen to 90 per 100,000. The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents. In 2008, polls indicated that crime was the number one concern of voters. Attempts at fighting crime such as Operation Liberation of the People were implemented to crack down on gang-controlled areas but, of reported criminal acts, less than 2% are prosecuted. In 2017, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted that some of the arms procured by the government over the previous two decades had been diverted to paramilitary civilian groups and criminal syndicates.

Venezuela is especially dangerous for foreign travelers and investors who are visiting. The United States Department of State and the Government of Canada have warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping and murder, and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles. The United Kingdom&#x27;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel to Venezuela. Visitors have been murdered during robberies.

There are approximately 33 prisons holding about 50,000 inmates. Venezuela&#x27;s prison system is heavily overcrowded; its facilities have capacity for only 14,000 prisoners.

===Human rights===

Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have increasingly criticized Venezuela&#x27;s human rights record, with the former organization noting in 2017 that the Chavez and subsequently the Maduro government have increasingly concentrated power in the executive branch, eroded constitutional human rights protections and allowed the government to persecute and repress its critics and opposition. Other persistent concerns as noted by the report included poor prison conditions, the continuous harassment of independent media and human rights defenders by the government. In 2006, the Economist Intelligence Unit rated Venezuela a &quot;hybrid regime&quot; and the third least democratic regime in Latin America on the Democracy Index. The Democracy index downgraded Venezuela to an authoritarian regime in 2017, citing continued increasingly dictatorial behaviors by the Maduro government.

===Corruption===
Corruption in Venezuela is high by world standards and was so for much of the 20th century. The discovery of oil worsened political corruption. By the late 1970s, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso&#x27;s description of oil as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s excrement&quot; had become a common expression in Venezuela. The Corruption Perceptions Index has ranked Venezuela as one of the most corrupt countries since the survey started in 1995. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, out of 178 ranked countries in government transparency. By 2016, the rank had increased to 166 out of 178. The World Justice Project ranked Venezuela 99th out of 99 countries surveyed in its 2014 Rule of Law Index.

This corruption is shown with Venezuela&#x27;s significant involvement in drug trafficking, with Colombian cocaine and other drugs transiting Venezuela towards the United States and Europe. In the period 2003–2008 Venezuelan authorities seized the fifth-largest total quantity of cocaine in the world, behind Colombia, the United States, Spain and Panama. In 2006, the government&#x27;s agency for combating illegal drug trade in Venezuela, &quot;ONA&quot;, was incorporated into the office of the vice-president. However, many major government and military officials have been known for their involvement with drug trafficking.

== Economy ==

Venezuela was &quot;once among South America&#x27;s wealthiest countries&quot; before the economic meltdown under Maduro regime.

&quot;The formerly rich petro-state has seen GDP fall by 80 percent in less than a decade, driving some seven million of its citizens to flee. Most Venezuelans live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in total disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel&quot; as of 2024, according to VOA (report from AFP).

The country has a market-based mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector, which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues. Per capita GDP for 2016 was estimated to be US$15,100, ranking 109th in the world. Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized. The private sector controls two-thirds of Venezuela&#x27;s economy.

A part of the Venezuelan economy depends on remittances.

The Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bolívar which is used as currency. The president of the Central Bank of Venezuela serves as the country&#x27;s representative in the International Monetary Fund. The U.S.-based conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation claims Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without compensation is not uncommon.

As of 2011, more than 60% of Venezuela&#x27;s international reserves was in gold, eight times more than the average for the region. Most of Venezuela&#x27;s gold held abroad was located in London. On 25 November 2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas; Chávez called the repatriation of gold a &quot;sovereign&quot; step that will help protect the country&#x27;s foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. However government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank to reassure the international bond market.

Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as steel, aluminium and cement, with production concentrated around Ciudad Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela&#x27;s electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes electronics and automobiles, as well as beverages, and foodstuffs. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela&#x27;s land area. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.

Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world&#x27;s leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of OPEC. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996. The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a major banking crisis in 1994.

The recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending. With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela initially made progress in social development in the 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty. Many of the social policies pursued by Chávez and his administration were jump-started by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000. The sustainability of the Bolivarian Missions has been questioned due to the Bolivarian state&#x27;s overspending on public works and because the Chávez government did not save funds for future economic hardships, with economic issues and poverty rising as a result of their policies in the 2010s. In 2003 the government of Hugo Chávez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to a devaluation of the currency. This led to the development of a parallel market of dollars in the subsequent years. The Great Recession led to a renewed economic downturn. Despite controversial data shared by the Venezuelan government showing that the country had halved malnutrition following one of the UN&#x27;s Millennium Development Goals, shortages of staple goods began to occur in Venezuela and malnutrition began to increase.

In early 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to growing shortages in the country. The shortages included, and still include, necessities such as toilet paper, milk, and flour. Fears rose so high due to the toilet paper shortage that the government occupied a toilet paper factory, and continued plans to nationalize other industrial aspects like food distribution. Venezuela&#x27;s bond ratings have also decreased multiple times in 2013 due to decisions by the president Nicolás Maduro. In 2016, consumer prices in Venezuela increased 800% and the economy declined by 18.6%, entering an economic depression. Venezuela&#x27;s outlook was deemed negative by most bond-rating services in 2017. For 2018 an inflation rate of 1,000,000 percent was projected, putting Venezuela in a similar situation to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000s.

===Tourism===

Tourism has been developed considerably in recent decades, particularly because of its favorable geographical position, the variety of landscapes, the richness of plant and wildlife, the culture and the tropical climate.

Margarita Island is one of the top tourist destinations. It is an island with a modern infrastructure, bordered by beaches suitable for extreme sports, and features castles, fortresses and churches of great cultural value.

Los Roques Archipelago is made up of a set of islands and keys that constitute one of the main tourist attractions in the country. With exotic crystalline beaches, Morrocoy is a national park, formed by small keys very close to the mainland, which have grown rapidly as one of the greatest tourist attractions in the Venezuelan Caribbean.

Canaima National Park extends over 30,000 km2 to the border with Guyana and Brazil; due to its size it is considered the sixth largest national park in the world. Its steep cliffs and waterfalls (including Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world, at 1,002 m) form spectacular landscapes.

The state of Mérida is one of the main tourist centers of Venezuela. It has an extensive network of hotels not only in its capital city, but also throughout the state. Starting from the same city of Mérida is the longest and highest cable car in the world, which reaches the Pico Espejo of 4,765 m.

=== Shortages ===

Shortages in Venezuela have been prevalent following the enactment of price controls and other policies during the economic policy of the Hugo Chávez government. Under the economic policy of the Nicolás Maduro government, greater shortages occurred due to the Venezuelan government&#x27;s policy of withholding United States dollars from importers with price controls.Shortages occur in regulated products, such as milk, various types of meat, coffee, rice, oil, flour, butter, and other goods including basic necessities like toilet paper, personal hygiene products, and even medicine. As a result of the shortages, Venezuelans must search for food, wait in lines for hours and sometimes do without certain products.

A drought, combined with a lack of planning and maintenance, has caused a hydroelectricity shortage. To deal with lack of power supply, in April 2016 the Maduro government announced rolling blackouts and reduced the government workweek to only Monday and Tuesday. A multi-university study found that, in 2016 alone, about 75% of Venezuelans lost weight due to hunger, with the average losing about 8.6 kg (19 lbs) due to the lack of food. In March 2017, Venezuela began having shortages of gasoline in some regions.

=== Petroleum and other resources ===

Venezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural gas reserves in the world. Compared to the preceding year another 40.4% in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type. The country&#x27;s main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River basin (eastern Venezuela), where the country&#x27;s largest reserve is located. Besides the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) approximately equal to the world&#x27;s reserves of conventional oil. The electricity sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world.

In the first half of the 20th century, U.S. oil companies were heavily involved in Venezuela, initially interested only in purchasing concessions. In 1943 a new government introduced a 50/50 split in profits between the government and the oil industry. In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.
In 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective 1 January 1976, with Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) taking over and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe. In the 1990s PDVSA became more independent from the government and presided over an &quot;apertura&quot; (opening) in which it invited in foreign investment. Under Hugo Chávez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment. PDVSA played a key role in the December 2002 – February 2003 national strike. As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company&#x27;s workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transport ===
Venezuela is connected to the world primarily via air (Venezuela&#x27;s airports include the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía, near Caracas and La Chinita International Airport near Maracaibo) and sea (with major seaports at La Guaira, Maracaibo and Puerto Cabello). In the south and east the Amazon rainforest region has limited cross-border transport; in the west, there is a mountainous border of over shared with Colombia. The Orinoco River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to inland and connects the major industrial city of Ciudad Guayana to the Atlantic Ocean.

Venezuela has a limited national railway system, which has no active rail connections to other countries. The government of Hugo Chávez tried to invest in expanding it, but Venezuela&#x27;s rail project is on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5 billion and owing China Railway nearly $500 million.
Several major cities have metro systems; the Caracas Metro has been operating since 1983. The Maracaibo Metro and Valencia Metro were opened more recently. Venezuela has a road network of nearly , placing the country around 45th in the world; around a third of roads are paved.

=== Utilities ===
The electricity sector in Venezuela is heavily dependent on hydroelectricity, with this energy source accounting for 64% of the country&#x27;s electricity generation in 2021.

== Demographics ==

Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital Caracas, which is also the largest city. About 93% of the population lives in urban areas in northern Venezuela; 73% live less than from the coastline. Though almost half of Venezuela&#x27;s land area lies south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there. The largest and most important city south of the Orinoco is Ciudad Guayana, which is the sixth most populous conurbation. Other major cities include Barquisimeto, Valencia, Maracay, Maracaibo, Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz, Mérida and San Cristóbal.

According to the total population was in . A 2014 study by sociologists of the Central University of Venezuela found over 1.5 million Venezuelans, or about 4% to 6% of the country&#x27;s population, have left Venezuela since 1999.

=== Ethnicity ===
The people of Venezuela come from a variety of ancestries. It is estimated that the majority of the population is of pardo, or mixed, ethnic ancestry. In the 2011 census, which Venezuelans were asked to identify themselves according to their customs and ancestry, the term &quot;pardo&quot; was excluded from the answers. The majority claimed to be moreno or white—51.6% and 43.6%, respectively. Slightly more than half of the population claimed to be &quot;moreno&quot;, a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means &quot;dark-skinned&quot; or &quot;brown-skinned&quot;, as opposed to having a lighter skin.

Ethnic minorities in Venezuela consist of groups that descend mainly from African or Indigenous peoples; 2.8% identified themselves as &quot;black&quot; and 0.7% as &quot;afrodescendiente&quot; (Afro-descendant), 2.6% claimed to belong to Indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered &quot;other races&quot;.

Among Indigenous people, 58% were Wayúu, 7% Warao, 5% Kariña, 4% Pemón, 3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% Añu, 3% Cumanágoto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; the remaining 9% consisted of other Indigenous nations.

According to an autosomal DNA study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasília, the composition of Venezuela&#x27;s population is 60.60% European, 23% Indigenous, and 16.30% African.

During the colonial period and until after the Second World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands and Spain with a relevant amount of Galicians and Asturians. These immigrants from Spain had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and customs of Venezuela. These influences on Venezuela have led to the nation being called the 8th island of the Canaries. With the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing with them U.S. citizens. Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were encouraged by government-established immigration programs and lenient immigration policies. During the 20th century, Venezuela, along with the rest of Latin America, received millions of immigrants from Europe. This was especially true post-World War II, as a consequence of war-ridden Europe. During the 1970s, while experiencing an oil-export boom, Venezuela received millions of immigrants from Ecuador, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. Due to the belief that this immigration influx depressed wages, some Venezuelans opposed European immigration. The Venezuelan government, however, were actively recruiting immigrants from Eastern Europe to fill a need for engineers. Millions of Colombians, as well as Middle Eastern and Haitian populations would continue immigrating to Venezuela into the early 21st century.

According to the &quot;World Refugee Survey 2008&quot;, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Venezuela hosted a population of refugee and asylum seekers from Colombia numbering 252,200 in 2007, and 10,600 new asylum seekers entered Venezuela in 2007. Between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the country.

The total Indigenous population of the country is estimated at 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), distributed among 40 Indigenous peoples. There are three uncontacted tribes living in Venezuela. The Constitution recognizes the multi-ethnic, pluri-cultural, and multilingual character of the country and includes a chapter devoted to Indigenous peoples&#x27; rights, which opened up spaces for their political inclusion at national and local level in 1999.
Most Indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela&#x27;s borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia, and the majority groups are the Wayuu in the west, the Warao in the east, the Yanomami installed in the south, and the Pemon which are mostly in the southeast of Venezuela.

=== Languages ===

Although most residents are monolingual Spanish speakers, many languages are spoken in Venezuela. In addition to Spanish, the Constitution recognizes more than thirty Indigenous languages, including Wayuu, Warao, Pemón, and many others for the official use of the Indigenous peoples, mostly with few speakers – less than 1% of the total population. Wayuu is the most spoken Indigenous language, with 170,000 speakers.

Immigrants, in addition to Spanish, speak their own languages. Chinese (400,000), Portuguese (254,000), and Italian (200,000) are the most-spoken languages in Venezuela after the official language of Spanish. Arabic is spoken by Lebanese and Syrian colonies on Isla de Margarita, Maracaibo, Punto Fijo, Puerto la Cruz, El Tigre, Maracay, and Caracas. Portuguese is spoken not only by the Portuguese community in Santa Elena de Uairén but also by much of the population due to its proximity to Brazil. The German community speaks their native language, while the people of Colonia Tovar speak mostly an Alemannic dialect of German called &quot;alemán coloniero&quot;.

English is the most widely used foreign language in demand and is spoken by many professionals, academics, and members of the upper and middle classes as a result of the oil exploration by foreign companies, in addition to its acceptance as a lingua franca. Culturally, English is common in southern towns like El Callao, and the native English-speaking (English-creole speaking) influence is evident in folk and calypso songs from the region. Various dialects of Eastern-Caribbean English-based creoles were brought to Venezuela by Trinidadian and other British West Indies immigrants, they are collectively referred to as Venezuelan English Creole. A variety of Antillean Creole is spoken by a small community in El Callao and Paria. Italian language teaching is delivered by private Venezuelan schools and institutions. Other languages spoken by large communities in the country are Basque and Galician, among others.

=== Religion ===


According to a 2011 poll, 88% of the population is Christian, primarily Roman Catholic (71%), and the remaining 17% Protestant, primarily Evangelicals (in Latin America Protestants are usually called &quot;evangélicos&quot;). 8% of Venezuelans are irreligious. Almost 3% of the population follow another religion (1% of these people practice Santería).

There are small but influential Muslim, Druze, Buddhist, and Jewish communities. The Muslim community of more than 100,000 is concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent living in Nueva Esparta state, Punto Fijo and the Caracas area. Venezuela is home of the largest Druze communities outside the Middle East, the Druze community are estimated around 60,000, and concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent. Buddhism is practiced by over 52,000 people. The Buddhist community is made up mainly of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people.

The Jewish community has shrunk in recent years due to rising economic pressures and antisemitism in Venezuela, with the population declining from 22,000 in 1999 to less than 7,000 in 2015.

== Health ==
Venezuela has a national universal health care system. The current government has created a program to expand access to health care known as Misión Barrio Adentro, although its efficiency and work conditions have been criticized. As of December 2014 an estimated 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments in Venezuela are abandoned.

Infant mortality in Venezuela was 19 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014 which was lower than the South American average (To compare: The U.S. figure was 6 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013). Child malnutrition was 17%. Delta Amacuro and Amazonas had the nation&#x27;s highest rates. According to the United Nations, 32% of Venezuelans lacked adequate sanitation, primarily those living in rural areas. Diseases ranging from diphtheria, plague, malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis D were present in the country. Obesity was prevalent in approximately 30% of the adult population.

Venezuela had a total of 150 sewage treatment plants; 13% of the population lacked access to drinking water, but this number had been dropping.

During the economic crisis observed under President Maduro&#x27;s presidency, medical professionals were forced to perform outdated treatments on patients.

== Education ==
In 2008, 95.2% of the adult population was literate. The net primary school enrollment rate was at 91% and the net secondary school enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005. Venezuela has a number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University of Venezuela founded in 1721, the University of Zulia, the University of the Andes, Simón Bolívar University, and the University of the East.

Currently, many Venezuelan graduates seek a future abroad because of the country&#x27;s troubled economy and heavy crime rate. Over 1.35 million Venezuelan college graduates have left the country since the beginning of the Bolivarian Revolution. It is believed that nearly 12% of Venezuelans live abroad, with Ireland becoming a popular destination for students. According to Claudio Bifano, president of the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, more than half of all medical graduates had left Venezuela in 2013.

By 2018, over half of all Venezuelan children had dropped out of school, with 58% of students quitting nationwide while areas near bordering countries saw more than 80% of their students leave. Nationwide, about 93% of schools do not meet the minimum requirements to operate and 77% do not have utilities such as food, water or electricity.

== Culture ==
The culture of Venezuela is a melting pot made up of three main groups: The Indigenous Venezuelans, the Africans, and the Spanish.

The Africans brought in many musical influences, especially introduction of the drum. The Spanish influence predominantes due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created. Spanish influences can be seen in the country&#x27;s architecture, music, religion, and language.

Venezuela was also enriched by immigration streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. Most recently, immigration from the United States, Spain, Italy, and Portugal has enriched the already complex cultural mosaic.

=== Architecture ===
Carlos Raúl Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitolio, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. In Venezuela, prehistoric man began to build useful architecture from approximately 1000 BC to the 15th century AD, in the period known as the &quot;Neo-Indian&quot;. Neo-Indian architecture consisted of incipient constructions, such as agricultural terraces and vaults lined by stones, called mintoyes, which were used as tombs and silos for the storage of agricultural products. The Indo-Hispanic architecture is the one that begins to develop from the year 1498 AD. Venezuelan colonial architecture is built from the 16th century, when Venezuela began to be a dependent colony of the Spanish Empire, until 1810, when the process of Venezuelan independence began.

The architecture of this period is characterized by its discreet modesty, with the exception of some cities. The explanation lies in the socioeconomic conditions of the country. Venezuela did not offer then to the colonizers the immense riches kept by nature for later times. The simplification of technical problems, the renunciation of most of the decorative elements and variegated ostentations of fanciful baroque, the impossibility of using expensive materials and the consequent lack of craftsmen, contributed to establish a modest but well-defined physiognomy of the colonial architecture of Venezuela. During the colonial period, there were eventually confrontations between the Spanish conquerors and the barbarians and pirates that sailed along the Venezuelan coasts, in order to take over the provinces located on the coasts of the country.

Christian temples from the colonial era were constituted by an almost invariable, arrangement consisting of a rectangular plan, three naves separated by arches of alfarje roofing composed of religious architecture in colonial times. The Venezuelan society dedicated a great amount of resources to erect religious monuments comparable to those of other countries of the continent. The XVII century was of reconstruction of the Catholic churches that had been destroyed by the earthquake of 1641. In the 18th century, specifically between 1728 and 1785, the prosperity that Venezuela enjoyed due to the opening of the Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas was also reflected in the construction of new architecture, especially of a religious nature.

=== Art ===

Venezuelan art was initially dominated by religious motifs. However, in the late 19th century, artists began emphasizing historical and heroic representations of the country&#x27;s struggle for independence. This move was led by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the 20th century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré; the kinetic artists Jesús Soto, Gego and Carlos Cruz-Diez; and contemporary artists such as Marisol and Yucef Merhi.

=== Literature ===

Venezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate Indigenous societies. It was originally dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente González, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andrés Eloy Blanco and Fermín Toro.

Major writers and novelists include Rómulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano González León, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Picón Salas. The great poet and humanist Andrés Bello was also an educator and intellectual (He was also a childhood tutor and mentor of Simón Bolívar). Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and José Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism.

=== Music ===

The Indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by groups like Un Solo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa. The national musical instrument is the cuatro. Traditional musical styles and songs mainly emerged in and around the llanos region, including &quot;Alma llanera&quot; (by Pedro Elías Gutiérrez and Rafael Bolívar Coronado), &quot;Florentino y el diablo&quot; (by Alberto Arvelo Torrealba), &quot;Concierto en la llanura&quot; by Juan Vicente Torrealba, and &quot;Caballo viejo&quot; (by Simón Díaz).

The Zulian gaita is also a very popular genre, generally performed during Christmas. The national dance is the joropo. Venezuela has always been a melting pot of cultures and this can be seen in the richness and variety of its musical styles and dances: calipso, bambuco, fulía, cantos de pilado de maíz, cantos de lavanderas, sebucán, and maremare. Teresa Carreño was a world-famous 19th century piano virtuoso. Recently, great classical music performances have come out of Venezuela. The Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra has hosted a number of excellent concerts in many European concert halls, most notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received several honors. The orchestra is the pinnacle of El Sistema, a publicly financed, voluntary music education program now being emulated in other countries.

In the early 21st century, a movement known as &quot;Movida Acústica Urbana&quot; featured musicians trying to save some national traditions, creating their own original songs but using traditional instruments. Some groups following this movement are Tambor Urbano, Los Sinverguenzas, C4Trío, and Orozco Jam.

Afro-Venezuelan musical traditions are most intimately related to the festivals of the &quot;black folk saints&quot; San Juan and St. Benedict the Moor. Specific songs are related to the different stages of their festivals and processions, when the saints start their yearly &quot;paseo&quot; – stroll – through the community.

=== Sport ===

The origins of baseball in Venezuela are unclear, although it is known that the sport was being played in the country by the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, North American immigrants who came to Venezuela to work in the nation&#x27;s oil industry helped to popularize the sport in Venezuela. During the 1930s, baseball&#x27;s popularity continued to rise in the country, leading to the foundation of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP) in 1945, and the sport would soon become the nation&#x27;s most popular.

The popularity of baseball in the country makes Venezuela a rarity among its South American neighbors—association football is the dominant sport in the continent. However, football, as well as basketball, are among the more popular sports played in Venezuela. Venezuela hosted the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in the Poliedro de Caracas.

Although not as popular in Venezuela as the rest of South America, football, spearheaded by the Venezuela national football team is gaining popularity as well. The sport is also noted for having an increased focus during the World Cup. Venezuela is scheduled to host the Copa América every 40 years.

Venezuela is also home to former Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado. Maldonado has increased the reception of Formula 1 in Venezuela, helping to popularize the sport in the country.

In the 2012 Summer Olympics, Rubén Limardo won a gold medal in fencing.

In the Winter Sports, Cesar Baena had represented the country since 2008 in Nordic Skiing, the first South American skier to compete in a FIS Cross Country Ski World Cup on Düsseldorf 2009.

<text>François-Marie Arouet (; 21 November 169430 May 1778), known by his &quot;nom de plume&quot; Voltaire (, ; ), was a French Enlightenment writer, philosopher (&quot;philosophe&quot;), satirist, and historian. Famous for his wit and his criticism of Christianity (especially of the Roman Catholic Church) and of slavery, Voltaire was an advocate of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and separation of church and state.

Voltaire was a versatile and prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays, histories, and even scientific expositions. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and 2,000 books and pamphlets. Voltaire was one of the first authors to become renowned and commercially successful internationally. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties and was at constant risk from the strict censorship laws of the Catholic French monarchy. His polemics witheringly satirized intolerance and religious dogma, as well as the French institutions of his day. His best-known work and &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Candide&quot;, is a novella that comments on, criticizes, and ridicules many events, thinkers and philosophies of his time, most notably Gottfried Leibniz and his belief that our world is of necessity the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot;.
== Early life ==
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of François Arouet, a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard, whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility. Some speculation surrounds Voltaire&#x27;s date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Guérin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune. Two of his older brothers—Armand-François and Robert—died in infancy, and his surviving brother Armand and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively. Nicknamed &quot;Zozo&quot; by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with , and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother&#x27;s cousin, standing as godparents. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Collège Louis-le-Grand (1704–1711), where he was taught Latin, theology, and rhetoric; later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish, and English.

By the time he left school, Voltaire had decided he wanted to be a writer, against the wishes of his father, who wanted him to become a lawyer. Voltaire, pretending to work in Paris as an assistant to a notary, spent much of his time writing poetry. When his father found out, he sent Voltaire to study law, this time in Caen, Normandy. But the young man continued to write, producing essays and historical studies. Voltaire&#x27;s wit made him popular among some of the aristocratic families with whom he mixed. In 1713, his father obtained a job for him as a secretary to the new French ambassador in the Netherlands, the , the brother of Voltaire&#x27;s godfather. At The Hague, Voltaire fell in love with a French Protestant refugee named Catherine Olympe Dunoyer (known as &#x27;Pimpette&#x27;). Their affair, considered scandalous, was discovered by de Châteauneuf and Voltaire was forced to return to France by the end of the year.

Most of Voltaire&#x27;s early life revolved around Paris. From early on, Voltaire had trouble with the authorities for critiques of the government. As a result, he was twice sentenced to prison and once to temporary exile to England. One satirical verse, in which Voltaire accused the Régent of incest with his daughter, resulted in an eleven-month imprisonment in the Bastille. The &quot;Comédie-Française&quot; had agreed in January 1717 to stage his debut play, &quot;Œdipe&quot;, and it opened in mid-November 1718, seven months after his release. Its immediate critical and financial success established his reputation. Both the Régent and King George I of Great Britain presented Voltaire with medals as a mark of their appreciation.

Voltaire mainly argued for religious tolerance and freedom of thought. He campaigned to eradicate priestly and aristo-monarchical authority, and supported a constitutional monarchy that protects people&#x27;s rights.

=== Name ===
Arouet adopted the name Voltaire in 1718, following his incarceration at the Bastille. Its origin is unclear. It is an anagram of &quot;AROVET LI&quot;, the Latinized spelling of his surname, Arouet, and the initial letters of (&quot;the young&quot;). According to a family tradition among the descendants of his sister, he was known as (&quot;determined little thing&quot;) as a child, and he resurrected a variant of the name in his adult life. The name also reverses the syllables of Airvault, his family&#x27;s home town in the Poitou region.

Richard Holmes supports the anagrammatic derivation of the name, but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey connotations of speed and daring. These come from associations with words such as (acrobatics on a trapeze or horse), &quot;volte-face&quot; (a spinning about to face one&#x27;s enemies), and &quot;volatile&quot; (originally, any winged creature). &quot;Arouet&quot; was not a noble name fit for his growing reputation, especially given that name&#x27;s resonance with (&quot;to be beaten up&quot;) and (a &quot;débauché&quot;).

In a letter to Jean-Baptiste Rousseau in March 1719, Voltaire concludes by asking that, if Rousseau wishes to send him a return letter, he do so by addressing it to Monsieur de Voltaire. A postscript explains: &quot;&quot;, (&quot;I was so unhappy under the name of Arouet that I have taken another, primarily so as to cease to be confused with the poet Roi.&quot;) This probably refers to Adenes le Roi, and the &#x27;oi&#x27; diphthong was then pronounced like modern &#x27;ouai&#x27;, so the similarity to &#x27;Arouet&#x27; is clear, and thus, it could well have been part of his rationale. Voltaire is known also to have used at least 178 separate pen names during his lifetime.

== Career ==
=== Early fiction ===
Voltaire&#x27;s next play, &quot;Artémire&quot;, set in ancient Macedonia, opened on 15 February 1720. It was a flop and only fragments of the text survive. He instead turned to an epic poem about Henry IV of France that he had begun in early 1717. Denied a licence to publish, in August 1722 Voltaire headed north to find a publisher outside France. On the journey, he was accompanied by his mistress, Marie-Marguerite de Rupelmonde, a young widow.

At Brussels, Voltaire and Rousseau met up for a few days, before Voltaire and his mistress continued northwards. A publisher was eventually secured in The Hague. In the Netherlands, Voltaire was struck and impressed by the openness and tolerance of Dutch society. On his return to France, he secured a second publisher in Rouen, who agreed to publish &quot;La Henriade&quot; clandestinely. After Voltaire&#x27;s recovery from a month-long smallpox infection in November 1723, the first copies were smuggled into Paris and distributed. While the poem was an instant success, Voltaire&#x27;s new play, &quot;Mariamne&quot;, was a failure when it first opened in March 1724. Heavily reworked, it opened at the &quot;Comédie-Française&quot; in April 1725 to a much-improved reception. It was among the entertainments provided at the wedding of Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska in September 1725.

=== Great Britain ===
In early 1726, the aristocratic chevalier de Rohan-Chabot taunted Voltaire about his change of name, and Voltaire retorted that his name would win the esteem of the world, while Rohan would sully his own. The furious Rohan arranged for his thugs to beat up Voltaire a few days later. Seeking redress, Voltaire challenged Rohan to a duel, but the powerful Rohan family arranged for Voltaire to be arrested and imprisoned without trial in the Bastille on 17 April 1726. Fearing indefinite imprisonment, Voltaire asked to be exiled to England as an alternative punishment, which the French authorities accepted. On 2 May, he was escorted from the Bastille to Calais and embarked for Britain.

In England, Voltaire lived largely in Wandsworth, with acquaintances including Everard Fawkener. From December 1727 to June 1728 he lodged at Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, now commemorated by a plaque, to be nearer to his British publisher. Voltaire circulated throughout English high society, meeting Alexander Pope, John Gay, Jonathan Swift, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and many other members of the nobility and royalty. Voltaire&#x27;s exile in Great Britain greatly influenced his thinking. He was intrigued by Britain&#x27;s constitutional monarchy in contrast to French absolutism, and by the country&#x27;s greater freedom of speech and religion. He was influenced by the writers of the time, and developed an interest in English literature, especially Shakespeare, who was still little known in continental Europe. Despite pointing out Shakespeare&#x27;s deviations from neoclassical standards, Voltaire saw him as an example for French drama, which, though more polished, lacked on-stage action. Later, however, as Shakespeare&#x27;s influence began growing in France, Voltaire tried to set a contrary example with his own plays, decrying what he considered Shakespeare&#x27;s barbarities. Voltaire may have been present at the funeral of Isaac Newton, and met Newton&#x27;s niece Catherine Conduitt. In 1727, Voltaire published two essays in English, &quot;Upon the Civil Wars of France, Extracted from Curious Manuscripts&quot; and &quot;Upon Epic Poetry of the European Nations, from Homer Down to Milton&quot;. He also published a letter about the Quakers after attending one of their services.

After two and a half years in exile, Voltaire returned to France, and after a few months in Dieppe, the authorities permitted him to return to Paris. At a dinner, French mathematician Charles Marie de La Condamine proposed buying up the lottery that was organized by the French government to pay off its debts, and Voltaire joined the consortium, earning perhaps a million livres. He invested the money cleverly and on this basis managed to convince the Court of Finances of his responsible conduct, allowing him to take control of a trust fund inherited from his father. He was now indisputably rich.

Further success followed in 1732 with his play &quot;Zaïre&quot;, which when published in 1733 carried a dedication to Fawkener praising English liberty and commerce. He published his admiring essays on British government, literature, religion, and science in &quot;Letters Concerning the English Nation&quot; (London, 1733). In 1734, they were published in Rouen as &quot;Lettres philosophiques&quot;, causing a huge scandal. Published without approval of the royal censor, the essays lauded British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights than its French counterpart, particularly regarding religious tolerance. The book was publicly burnt and banned, and Voltaire was again forced to flee Paris.

=== Château de Cirey ===
In 1733, Voltaire met Émilie du Châtelet (Marquise du Châtelet), a mathematician and married mother of three, who was 12 years his junior and with whom he was to have an affair for 16 years. To avoid arrest after the publication of &quot;Lettres&quot;, Voltaire took refuge at her husband&#x27;s château at Cirey on the borders of Champagne and Lorraine. Voltaire paid for the building&#x27;s renovation, and Émilie&#x27;s husband sometimes stayed at the château with his wife and her lover. The intellectual paramours collected around 21,000 books, an enormous number for the time. Together, they studied these books and performed scientific experiments at Cirey, including an attempt to determine the nature of fire.

Having learned from his previous brushes with the authorities, Voltaire began his habit of avoiding open confrontation with the authorities and denying any awkward responsibility. He continued to write plays, such as &quot;Mérope&quot; (or &quot;La Mérope française&quot;) and began his long researches into science and history. Again, a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile, during which he had been strongly influenced by Newton&#x27;s works. Voltaire strongly believed in Newton&#x27;s theories; he performed experiments in optics at Cirey, and was one of the promulgators of the famous story of Newton&#x27;s inspiration from the falling apple, which he had learned from Newton&#x27;s niece in London and first mentioned in his &quot;Letters&quot;.

In the fall of 1735, Voltaire was visited by Francesco Algarotti, who was preparing a book about Newton in Italian. Partly inspired by the visit, the Marquise translated Newton&#x27;s Latin &quot;Principia&quot; into French, which remained the definitive French version into the 21st century. Both she and Voltaire were also curious about the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz, a contemporary and rival of Newton. While Voltaire remained a firm Newtonian, the Marquise adopted certain aspects of Leibniz&#x27;s critiques. Voltaire&#x27;s own book &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Newton&quot; made the great scientist accessible to a far greater public, and the Marquise wrote a celebratory review in the . Voltaire&#x27;s work was instrumental in bringing about general acceptance of Newton&#x27;s optical and gravitational theories in France, in contrast to the theories of Descartes.

Voltaire and the Marquise also studied history, particularly the great contributors to civilization. Voltaire&#x27;s second essay in English had been &quot;Essay upon the Civil Wars in France&quot;. It was followed by &quot;La Henriade&quot;, an epic poem on the French King Henri IV, glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic-Protestant massacres with the Edict of Nantes, which established religious toleration. There followed a historical novel on King Charles XII of Sweden. These, along with his &quot;Letters on the English&quot;, mark the beginning of Voltaire&#x27;s open criticism of intolerance and established religions. Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy, particularly metaphysical questions concerning the existence of God and the soul. Voltaire and the Marquise analyzed the Bible and concluded that much of its content was dubious. Voltaire&#x27;s critical views on religion led to his belief in separation of church and state and religious freedom, ideas that he had formed after his stay in England.

In August 1736, Frederick the Great, then Crown Prince of Prussia and a great admirer of Voltaire, initiated a correspondence with him. That December, Voltaire moved to Holland for two months and became acquainted with the scientists Herman Boerhaave and Willem &#x27;s Gravesande. From mid-1739 to mid-1740 Voltaire lived largely in Brussels, at first with the Marquise, who was unsuccessfully attempting to pursue a 60-year-old family legal case regarding the ownership of two estates in Limburg. In July 1740, he traveled to the Hague on behalf of Frederick in an attempt to dissuade a dubious publisher, van Duren, from printing without permission Frederick&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Machiavel&quot;. In September Voltaire and Frederick (now King) met for the first time in Moyland Castle near Cleves and in November Voltaire was Frederick&#x27;s guest in Berlin for two weeks, followed by a meeting in September 1742 at Aix-la-Chapelle. Voltaire was sent to Frederick&#x27;s court in 1743 by the French government as an envoy and spy to gauge Frederick&#x27;s military intentions in the War of the Austrian Succession.

Though deeply committed to the Marquise, Voltaire by 1744 found life at her château confining. On a visit to Paris that year, he found a new love—his niece. At first, his attraction to Marie Louise Mignot was clearly sexual, as evidenced by his letters to her (only discovered in 1957). Much later, they lived together, perhaps platonically, and remained together until Voltaire&#x27;s death. Meanwhile, the Marquise also took a lover, the Marquis de Saint-Lambert.

=== Prussia ===
After the death of the Marquise in childbirth in September 1749, Voltaire briefly returned to Paris and in mid-1750 moved to Potsdam, Prussia, at the invitation of Frederick the Great. The Prussian king (with the permission of Louis XV) made him a chamberlain in his household, appointed him to the Order of Merit, and gave him a salary of 20,000 French livres a year. He had rooms at Sanssouci and Charlottenburg Palace. Life went well for Voltaire at first, and in 1751 he completed &quot;Micromégas&quot;, a piece of science fiction involving ambassadors from another planet witnessing the follies of humankind. However, his relationship with Frederick began to deteriorate after he was accused of theft and forgery by a Jewish financier, Abraham Hirschel, who had invested in Saxon government bonds on behalf of Voltaire at a time when Frederick was involved in sensitive diplomatic negotiations with Saxony.

He encountered other difficulties: an argument with Maupertuis, the president of the Berlin Academy of Science and a former rival for Émilie&#x27;s affections, provoked Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Diatribe du docteur Akakia&quot; (&quot;Diatribe of Doctor Akakia&quot;), which satirized some of Maupertuis&#x27;s theories and his persecutions of a mutual acquaintance, Johann Samuel König. This greatly angered Frederick, who ordered all copies of the document burned. On 1 January 1752, Voltaire offered to resign as chamberlain and return his insignia of the Order of Merit; at first, Frederick refused until eventually permitting Voltaire to leave in March. On a slow journey back to France, Voltaire stayed at Leipzig and Gotha for a month each, and Kassel for two weeks, arriving at Frankfurt on 31 May. The following morning, he was detained at an inn by Frederick&#x27;s agents, who held him in the city for over three weeks while Voltaire and Frederick argued by letter over the return of a satirical book of poetry Frederick had lent to Voltaire. Marie Louise joined him on 9 June. She and her uncle only left Frankfurt in July after she had defended herself from the unwanted advances of one of Frederick&#x27;s agents, and Voltaire&#x27;s luggage had been ransacked and valuable items taken.

Voltaire&#x27;s attempts to vilify Frederick for his agents&#x27; actions at Frankfurt were largely unsuccessful, including his &quot;Mémoires pour Servir à la Vie de M. de Voltaire,&quot; published posthumously, in which he also explicitly made mention of Frederick&#x27;s homosexuality, when he described how the king regularly invited pages, young cadets or lieutenants from his regiment to have coffee with him and then withdrew with the favourite for a quickie. However, the correspondence between them continued, and though they never met in person again, after the Seven Years&#x27; War they largely reconciled.

=== Geneva and Ferney ===
Voltaire&#x27;s slow progress toward Paris continued through Mainz, Mannheim, Strasbourg, and Colmar, but in January 1754 Louis XV banned him from Paris, and he turned for Geneva, near which he bought a large estate (&quot;Les Délices&quot;) in early 1755. Though he was received openly at first, the law in Geneva, which banned theatrical performances, and the publication of &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot; against his will soured his relationship with Calvinist Genevans. In late 1758, he bought an even larger estate at Ferney, on the French side of the Franco-Swiss border. The town would adopt his name, calling itself Ferney-Voltaire, and this became its official name in 1878.

Early in 1759, Voltaire completed and published &quot;Candide, ou l&#x27;Optimisme&quot; (&quot;Candide, or Optimism&quot;). This satire on Leibniz&#x27;s philosophy of optimistic determinism remains Voltaire&#x27;s best-known work. He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life, frequently entertaining distinguished guests, such as James Boswell (who recorded their conversations in his journal and memoranda), Adam Smith, Giacomo Casanova, and Edward Gibbon. In 1764, he published one of his best-known philosophical works, the &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot;, a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas, a few of which were originally written in Berlin.

From 1762, as an unmatched intellectual celebrity, he began to champion unjustly persecuted individuals, most famously the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas. Calas had been tortured to death in 1763, supposedly because he had murdered his eldest son for wanting to convert to Catholicism. His possessions were confiscated, and his two daughters were taken from his widow and forced into Catholic convents. Voltaire, seeing this as a clear case of religious persecution, managed to overturn the conviction in 1765.

Voltaire was initiated into Freemasonry a little over a month before his death. On 4 April 1778, he attended &quot;la Loge des Neuf Sœurs&quot; in Paris, and became an Entered Apprentice Freemason. According to some sources, &quot;Benjamin Franklin ... urged Voltaire to become a freemason; and Voltaire agreed, perhaps only to please Franklin.&quot; However, Franklin was merely a visitor at the time Voltaire was initiated, the two only met a month before Voltaire&#x27;s death, and their interactions with each other were brief.

== Death and burial ==
In February 1778, Voltaire returned to Paris for the first time in over 25 years, partly to see the opening of his latest tragedy, &quot;Irene&quot;. The five-day journey was too much for the 83-year-old, and he believed he was about to die on 28 February, writing &quot;I die adoring God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting superstition.&quot; However, he recovered, and in March he saw a performance of &quot;Irene&quot;, where he was treated by the audience as a returning hero.

He soon became ill again and died on 30 May 1778. The accounts of his deathbed have been numerous and varying, and it has not been possible to establish the details of what precisely occurred. His enemies related that he repented and accepted the last rites from a Catholic priest, or that he died in agony of body and soul, while his adherents told of his defiance to his last breath. According to one story of his last words, when the priest urged him to renounce Satan, he replied, &quot;This is no time to make new enemies.&quot;

Because of his well-known criticism of the Church, which he had refused to retract before his death, Voltaire was denied a Christian burial in Paris, but friends and relations managed to bury his body secretly at the in Champagne, where Marie Louise&#x27;s brother was &quot;abbé&quot;. His heart and brain were embalmed separately.


On 11 July 1791, the National Assembly of France, regarding Voltaire as a forerunner of the French Revolution, had his remains brought back to Paris and enshrined in the Panthéon. An estimated million people attended the procession, which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony, including music composed for the event by André Grétry.

== Writings ==
=== History ===
Voltaire had an enormous influence on the development of historiography through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:
Voltaire&#x27;s best-known histories are &quot;History of Charles XII&quot; (1731), &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot; (1751), and his &quot;Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations&quot; (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. The &quot;Essay on Customs&quot; traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context, rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference. Influenced by Bossuet&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Universal History&quot; (1682), he was the first scholar to attempt seriously a history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. He treated Europe as a whole rather than a collection of nations. He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization, but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and expanding literacy would lead to progress.
Voltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on &quot;History&quot; in Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;: &quot;One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.&quot; Voltaire&#x27;s histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past, but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism, Eurocentrism, religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare. Yale professor Peter Gay says Voltaire wrote &quot;very good history&quot;, citing his &quot;scrupulous concern for truths&quot;, &quot;careful sifting of evidence&quot;, &quot;intelligent selection of what is important&quot;, &quot;keen sense of drama&quot;, and &quot;grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study&quot;.

=== Poetry ===
From an early age, Voltaire displayed a talent for writing verse, and his first published work was poetry. He wrote two book-long epic poems, including the first ever written in French, the &quot;Henriade&quot;, and later, &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot;, besides many other smaller pieces.

The &quot;Henriade&quot; was written in imitation of Virgil, using the alexandrine couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century, with sixty-five editions and translations into several languages. The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes. &quot;La Pucelle&quot;, on the other hand, is a burlesque on the legend of Joan of Arc.

=== Prose ===
Many of Voltaire&#x27;s prose works and romances, usually composed as pamphlets, were written as polemics. &quot;Candide&quot; attacks the passivity inspired by Leibniz&#x27;s philosophy of optimism through the character Pangloss&#x27;s frequent refrain that, because God created it, this is of necessity the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Homme aux quarante ecus&quot; (&quot;The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver&quot;) addresses social and political ways of the time; &quot;Zadig&quot; and others, the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy; and some were written to deride the Bible. In these works, Voltaire&#x27;s ironic style, free of exaggeration, is apparent, particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment. &quot;Candide&quot; in particular is the best example of his style. Voltaire also has—in common with Jonathan Swift—the distinction of paving the way for science fiction&#x27;s philosophical irony, particularly in his &quot;Micromégas&quot; and the vignette &quot;Plato&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1756).

In general, his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaire&#x27;s other works. Almost all of his more substantive works, whether in verse or prose, are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another, which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone. In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings, he displays his skills at journalism. In pure literary criticism his principal work is the &quot;Commentaire sur Corneille&quot;, although he wrote many more similar works—sometimes (as in his &quot;Life and Notices of Molière&quot;) independently and sometimes as part of his &quot;Siècles&quot;.

Voltaire&#x27;s works, especially his private letters, frequently urge the reader: &quot;&quot;, or &quot;crush the infamous&quot;. The phrase refers to contemporaneous abuses of power by royal and religious authorities, and the superstition and intolerance fomented by the clergy. He had seen and felt these effects in his own exiles, the burnings of his books and those of many others, and in the atrocious persecution of Jean Calas and François-Jean de la Barre. He stated in one of his most famous quotes that &quot;Superstition sets the whole world in flames; philosophy quenches them&quot; ().

The most oft-cited Voltaire quotation is apocryphal. He is incorrectly credited with writing, &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot; These were not his words, but rather those of Evelyn Beatrice Hall, written under the pseudonym S. G. Tallentyre in her 1906 biographical book &quot;The Friends of Voltaire&quot;. Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaire&#x27;s attitude towards Claude Adrien Helvétius and his controversial book &quot;De l&#x27;esprit&quot;, but her first-person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaire&#x27;s attitude towards Helvétius; it had been said Hall&#x27;s summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche, in which he was reported to have said, &quot;I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write.&quot; Nevertheless, scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation, as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.

Voltaire&#x27;s first major philosophical work in his battle against &quot;&quot; was the &quot;Traité sur la tolérance&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Tolerance&quot;), exposing the Calas affair, along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras (for example, by the Jews, the Romans, the Greeks and the Chinese). Then, in his &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot;, containing such articles as &quot;Abraham&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Church Council&quot;, he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs, as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects. Amongst other targets, Voltaire criticized France&#x27;s colonial policy in North America, dismissing the vast territory of New France as &quot;a few acres of snow&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

=== Letters ===
Voltaire also engaged in an enormous amount of private correspondence during his life, totalling over 20,000 letters. Theodore Besterman&#x27;s collected edition of these letters, completed only in 1964, fills 102 volumes. One historian called the letters &quot;a feast not only of wit and eloquence but of warm friendship, humane feeling, and incisive thought.&quot;

In Voltaire&#x27;s correspondence with Catherine the Great he derided democracy. He wrote, &quot;Almost nothing great has ever been done in the world except by the genius and firmness of a single man combating the prejudices of the multitude.&quot;

== Religious and philosophical views ==
Like other key Enlightenment thinkers, Voltaire was a deist. He challenged orthodoxy by asking: &quot;What is faith? Is it to believe that which is evident? No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary, eternal, supreme, and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith, but of reason.&quot;

In a 1763 essay, Voltaire supported the toleration of other religions and ethnicities: &quot;It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?&quot;

In one of his many denunciations of priests of every religious sect, Voltaire describes them as those who &quot;rise from an incestuous bed, manufacture a hundred versions of God, then eat and drink God, then piss and shit God.&quot;

=== Christianity ===
Historians have described Voltaire&#x27;s description of the history of Christianity as &quot;propagandistic&quot;. His &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; is responsible for the myth that the early Church had fifty gospels before settling on the standard canonical four as well as propagating the myth that the canon of the New Testament was decided at the First Council of Nicaea. Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression &quot;Credo quia absurdum&quot; to the Church Fathers. Furthermore, despite the death of Hypatia being the result of finding herself in the crossfires of a mob (likely Christian) during a political feud in 4th-century Alexandria, Voltaire promoted the theory that she was stripped naked and murdered by the minions of the bishop Cyril of Alexandria, concluding by stating that &quot;when one finds a beautiful woman completely naked, it is not for the purpose of massacring her.&quot; Voltaire meant for this argument to bolster one of his anti-Catholic tracts. In a letter to Frederick the Great, dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about Christianity:
In &quot;La bible enfin expliquée&quot;, he expressed the following attitude to lay reading of the Bible: It is characteristic of fanatics who read the holy scriptures to tell themselves: God killed, so I must kill; Abraham lied, Jacob deceived, Rachel stole: so I must steal, deceive, lie. But, wretch, you are neither Rachel, nor Jacob, nor Abraham, nor God; you are just a mad fool, and the popes who forbade the reading of the Bible were extremely wise.

Voltaire&#x27;s opinion of the Bible was mixed. Although influenced by Socinian works such as the &quot;Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum&quot;, Voltaire&#x27;s skeptical attitude to the Bible separated him from Unitarian theologians like Fausto Sozzini or even Biblical-political writers like John Locke. His statements on religion also brought down on him the fury of the Jesuits and in particular Claude-Adrien Nonnotte. This did not hinder his religious practice, though it did win for him a bad reputation in certain religious circles. The deeply Christian Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote to his father the year of Voltaire&#x27;s death, saying, &quot;The arch-scoundrel Voltaire has finally kicked the bucket ...&quot; Voltaire was later deemed to influence Edward Gibbon in claiming that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire in his book &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;:As Christianity advances, disasters befall the [Roman] empire—arts, science, literature, decay—barbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumph—and the unwary reader is conducted, with matchless dexterity, to the desired conclusion—the abominable Manicheism of &quot;Candide&quot;, and, in fact, of all the productions of Voltaire&#x27;s historic school—viz., &quot;that instead of being a merciful, ameliorating, and benignant visitation, the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil.&quot;

However, Voltaire also acknowledged the self-sacrifice of Christians. He wrote: &quot;Perhaps there is nothing greater on earth than the sacrifice of youth and beauty, often of high birth, made by the gentle sex in order to work in hospitals for the relief of human misery, the sight of which is so revolting to our delicacy. Peoples separated from the Roman religion have imitated but imperfectly so generous a charity.&quot; Yet, according to Daniel-Rops, Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;hatred of religion increased with the passage of years. The attack, launched at first against clericalism and theocracy, ended in a furious assault upon Holy Scripture, the dogmas of the Church, and even upon the person of Jesus Christ Himself, who [he] depicted now as a degenerate.&quot; Voltaire&#x27;s reasoning may be summed up in his well-known saying, &quot;.&quot;

=== Judaism ===
According to Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin, the most significant Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire; 30 of the 118 articles in his &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; dealt with Jews or Judaism, describing them in consistently negative ways. For example, in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;A Philosophical Dictionary&quot;, he wrote of Jews: &quot;In short, we find in them only an ignorant and barbarous people, who have long united the most sordid avarice with the most detestable superstition and the most invincible hatred for every people by whom they are tolerated and enriched.&quot; Telushkin states that Voltaire did not limit his attack to aspects of Judaism that Christianity used as a foundation, repeatedly making it clear that he despised Jews.

On the other hand, Peter Gay, a contemporary authority on the Enlightenment, points to Voltaire&#x27;s remarks (for instance, that the Jews were more tolerant than the Christians) in the &quot;Traité sur la tolérance&quot; and surmises that &quot;Voltaire struck at the Jews to strike at Christianity&quot;. Whatever anti-semitism Voltaire may have felt, Gay suggests, derived from negative personal experience.

Arthur Hertzberg, a Conservative Rabbi, claims that Gay&#x27;s second suggestion is untenable, as Voltaire himself denied its validity when he remarked that he had &quot;forgotten about much larger bankruptcies through Christians&quot;. However, Bertram Schwarzbach&#x27;s far more detailed studies of Voltaire&#x27;s dealings with Jewish people throughout his life concluded that he was anti-biblical, not anti-semitic. His remarks on the Jews and their &quot;superstitions&quot; were essentially no different from his remarks on Christians.

Voltaire said of the Jews that they &quot;have surpassed all nations in impertinent fables, in bad conduct and in barbarism. You deserve to be punished, for this is your destiny.&quot; He further said, &quot;They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race.&quot;

Some authors link Voltaire&#x27;s anti-Judaism to his polygenism. According to Joxe Azurmendi this anti-Judaism has a relative importance in Voltaire&#x27;s philosophy of history. However, Voltaire&#x27;s anti-Judaism influenced later authors like Ernest Renan.

Voltaire did have a Jewish friend, Daniel de Fonseca, whom he esteemed highly, and proclaimed him as &quot;the only philosopher, perhaps, among the Jews of his time&quot;.

Voltaire condemned the persecution of Jews on several occasions, including in &quot;Henriade&quot;, and he never advocated violence or attacks against them. According to the historian Will Durant, Voltaire praised the simplicity, sobriety, regularity, and industry of Jews, but subsequently became strongly anti-Semitic after some personal financial transactions and quarrels with Jewish financiers. In his &quot;Essai sur les moeurs&quot; Voltaire denounced the ancient Hebrews in strong language. The anti-Semitic passages in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; were criticized by Isaac De Pinto in 1762. Subsequently, Voltaire agreed with the criticism of the anti-Semitic passages and stated that De Pinto&#x27;s letter convinced him that there are &quot;highly intelligent and cultivated people&quot; among the Jews and that he had been &quot;wrong to attribute to a whole nation the vices of some individuals&quot;; he also promised to revise the objectionable passages for forthcoming editions of the &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot;, but he failed to do so.

=== Islam ===
Voltaire&#x27;s views about Islam were generally negative, and he found its holy book, the Quran, to be ignorant of the laws of physics. In a 1740 letter to Frederick the Great, Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that &quot;is assuredly nothing any man can excuse&quot; and suggests that his following stemmed from superstition; Voltaire continued, &quot;But that a camel-merchant should stir up insurrection in his village; that in league with some miserable followers he persuades them that he talks with the angel Gabriel; that he boasts of having been carried to heaven, where he received in part this unintelligible book, each page of which makes common sense shudder; that, to pay homage to this book, he delivers his country to iron and flame; that he cuts the throats of fathers and kidnaps daughters; that he gives to the defeated the choice of his religion or death: this is assuredly nothing any man can excuse, at least if he was not born a Turk, or if superstition has not extinguished all natural light in him.&quot;

In 1748, after having read Henri de Boulainvilliers and George Sale, he wrote again about Mohammed and Islam in &quot;De l&#x27;Alcoran et de Mahomet&quot; (&quot;On the Quran and on Mohammed&quot;). In this essay, Voltaire maintained that Mohammed was a &quot;sublime charlatan&quot;. Drawing on complementary information in Herbelot&#x27;s &quot;Oriental Library&quot;, Voltaire, according to René Pomeau, adjudged the Quran, with its &quot;contradictions, ... absurdities, ... anachronisms&quot;, to be &quot;rhapsody, without connection, without order, and without art&quot;. Thus he &quot;henceforward conceded&quot; that &quot;if his book was bad for our times and for us, it was very good for his contemporaries, and his religion even more so. It must be admitted that he removed almost all of Asia from idolatry&quot; and that &quot;it was difficult for such a simple and wise religion, taught by a man who was constantly victorious, could hardly fail to subjugate a portion of the earth.&quot; He considered that &quot;its civil laws are good; its dogma is admirable which it has in common with ours&quot; but that &quot;his means are shocking; deception and murder&quot;.

In his &quot;Essay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations&quot; (published 1756), Voltaire deals with the history of Europe before Charlemagne to the dawn of the age of Louis XIV, and that of the colonies and the East. As a historian, he devoted several chapters to Islam, Voltaire highlighted the Arabian, Turkish courts, and conducts. Here he called Mohammed a &quot;poet&quot;, and stated that he was not an illiterate. As a &quot;legislator&quot;, he &quot;changed the face of part of Europe [and] one half of Asia.&quot; In chapter VI, Voltaire finds similarities between Arabs and ancient Hebrews, that they both kept running to battle in the name of God, and sharing a passion for the spoils of war. Voltaire continues that, &quot;It is to be believed that Mohammed, like all enthusiasts, violently struck by his ideas, first presented them in good faith, strengthened them with fantasy, fooled himself in fooling others, and supported through necessary deceptions a doctrine which he considered good.&quot; He thus compares &quot;the genius of the Arab people&quot; with &quot;the genius of the ancient Romans&quot;.

According to Malise Ruthven, as Voltaire learned more about Islam his opinion of the faith became more positive. As a result, his play &quot;Mahomet&quot; inspired Goethe, who was attracted to Islam, to write a drama on this theme, though he completed only the poem &quot;Mahomets-Gesang&quot; (&quot;Mahomet&#x27;s Singing&quot;).

==== Drama &quot;Mahomet&quot; ====
The tragedy &quot;Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet&quot; () was written in 1736 by Voltaire. The play is a study of religious fanaticism and self-serving manipulation. The character Muhammad orders the murder of his critics. Voltaire described the play as &quot;written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect.&quot;

Voltaire described Muhammad as an &quot;impostor&quot;, a &quot;false prophet&quot;, a &quot;fanatic&quot; and a &quot;hypocrite&quot;. Defending the play, Voltaire said that he &quot;tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism, led by an impostor, can plunge weak minds&quot;. When Voltaire wrote in 1742 to César de Missy, he described Muhammad as deceitful.

In his play, Muhammad is &quot;whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command.&quot; After later having judged that he had made Muhammad in his play &quot;somewhat nastier than he really was&quot;, Voltaire claimed that Muhammad stole the idea of an angel weighing both men and women from Zoroastrians, who are often referred to as &quot;Magi&quot;. Voltaire continued about Islam, saying:
In a 1745 letter recommending the play to Pope Benedict XIV, Voltaire described Muhammad as &quot;the founder of a false and barbarous sect&quot; and &quot;a false prophet&quot;. Voltaire wrote: &quot;Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful, though a zealous admirer of virtue, of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance, written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect. To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet, than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy?&quot; His view was modified slightly for &quot;Essai sur les Moeurs et l&#x27;Esprit des Nations&quot;, although it remained negative. In 1751, Voltaire performed his play &quot;Mohamet&quot; once again, with great success.

=== Hinduism ===
Commenting on the sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, Voltaire observed: The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East.

He regarded Hindus as &quot;a peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves.&quot; Voltaire was himself a supporter of animal rights and was a vegetarian. He used the antiquity of Hinduism to land what he saw as a devastating blow to the Bible&#x27;s claims and acknowledged that the Hindus&#x27; treatment of animals showed a shaming alternative to the immorality of European imperialists.

=== Confucianism ===
Works attributed to Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit missionaries stationed in China. Matteo Ricci was among the earliest to report on the teachings of Confucius, and father Prospero Intorcetta wrote about the life and works of Confucius in Latin in 1687.

Translations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period, particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who hoped to improve European morals and institutions by the serene doctrines of the East. Voltaire shared these hopes, seeing Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma. He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.

With the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; of Europe. Voltaire wrote favourably of the idea, claiming that the Chinese had &quot;perfected moral science&quot; and advocating an economic and political system after the Chinese model.

== Views on race and slavery ==
Voltaire rejected the biblical Adam and Eve story and was a polygenist who speculated that each race had entirely separate origins. According to William Cohen, like most other polygenists, Voltaire believed that because of their different origins, Black Africans did not entirely share the natural humanity of white Europeans. According to David Allen Harvey, Voltaire often invoked racial differences as a means to attack religious orthodoxy, and the Biblical account of creation. Other historians, instead, have suggested that Voltaire&#x27;s support for polygenism was more heavily encouraged by his investments in the French Compagnie des Indes and other colonial enterprises that engaged in the slave trade.

His most famous remark on slavery is found in &quot;Candide&quot;, where the hero is horrified to learn &quot;at what price we eat sugar in Europe&quot; after coming across a slave in French Guiana who has been mutilated for escaping, who opines that, if all human beings have common origins as the Bible taught, it makes them cousins, concluding that &quot;no one could treat their relatives more horribly&quot;. Elsewhere, he wrote caustically about &quot;whites and Christians [who] proceed to purchase negroes cheaply, in order to sell them dear in America&quot;. Voltaire has been accused of supporting the slave trade as per a letter attributed to him, although it has been suggested that this letter is a forgery &quot;since no satisfying source attests to the letter&#x27;s existence.&quot;

In his &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot;, Voltaire endorses Montesquieu&#x27;s criticism of the slave trade: &quot;Montesquieu was almost always in error with the learned, because he was not learned, but he was almost always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery.&quot;

Zeev Sternhell argues that despite his shortcomings, Voltaire was a forerunner of liberal in his approach to history and non-European cultures. Voltaire wrote, &quot;We have slandered the Chinese because their metaphysics is not the same as ours ... This great misunderstanding about Chinese rituals has come about because we have judged their usages by ours, for we carry the prejudices of our contentious spirit to the end of the world.&quot; In speaking of Persia, he condemned Europe&#x27;s &quot;ignorant audacity&quot; and &quot;ignorant credulity&quot;. When writing about India, he declares, &quot;It is time for us to give up the shameful habit of slandering all sects and insulting all nations!&quot; In &quot;Essai sur les mœurs et l&#x27;esprit des nations&quot;, he defended the integrity of the Native Americans and wrote favorably of the Inca Empire.

== Appreciation and influence ==

According to Victor Hugo: &quot;To name Voltaire is to characterize the entire eighteenth century.&quot; Goethe regarded Voltaire as the greatest literary figure of modern times, and possibly of all time. According to Diderot, Voltaire&#x27;s influence would extend far into the future. Napoleon commented that till he was sixteen he &quot;would have fought for Rousseau against the friends of Voltaire, today it is the opposite ... The more I read Voltaire the more I love him. He is a man always reasonable, never a charlatan, never a fanatic&quot; (though he later criticized Voltaire&#x27;s work &quot;Mahomet&quot; during his captivity on Saint Helena). Frederick the Great commented on his good fortune for having lived in the age of Voltaire, and corresponded with him throughout his reign until Voltaire&#x27;s death. On 12 May 1760, Frederick wrote: &quot;For my part I shall go to Hades and tell Virgil that a Frenchman has surpassed him in his own art. I shall say as much to Sophocles and Euripides; I shall speak to Thucydides of your histories, to Quintus Curtius of your &quot;Charles XII&quot;; and perhaps I shall be stoned by these jealous dead because a single man has united all their different merits in himself.&quot; In England, Voltaire&#x27;s views influenced Godwin, Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Bentham, Byron and Shelley. Macaulay made note of the fear that Voltaire&#x27;s very name incited in tyrants and fanatics.

In Russia, Catherine the Great had been reading Voltaire for sixteen years prior to becoming Empress in 1762. In October 1763, she began a correspondence with the philosopher that continued till his death. The content of these letters has been described as being akin to a student writing to a teacher. Upon Voltaire&#x27;s death, the Empress purchased his library, which was then transported and placed in The Hermitage. Alexander Herzen remarked that &quot;The writings of the egoist Voltaire did more for liberation than those of the loving Rousseau did for brotherhood.&quot; In his famous letter to N. V. Gogol, Vissarion Belinsky wrote that Voltaire &quot;stamped out the fires of fanaticism and ignorance in Europe by ridicule.&quot;

In his native Paris, Voltaire was remembered as the defender of Jean Calas and Pierre Sirven. Although Voltaire&#x27;s campaign had failed to secure the annulment of la Barre&#x27;s execution for blasphemy against Christianity, the criminal code that sanctioned the execution was revised during Voltaire&#x27;s lifetime. In 1764, Voltaire successfully intervened and secured the release of Claude Chamont, arrested for attending Protestant services. When Comte de Lally was executed for treason in 1766, Voltaire wrote a 300-page document in his defense. Subsequently, in 1778, the judgment against de Lally was expunged just before Voltaire&#x27;s death. The Genevan Protestant minister Pomaret once said to Voltaire, &quot;You seem to attack Christianity, and yet you do the work of a Christian.&quot; Frederick the Great noted the significance of a philosopher capable of influencing judges to change their unjust decisions, commenting that this alone is sufficient to ensure the prominence of Voltaire as a humanitarian.

Under the French Third Republic, anarchists and socialists often invoked Voltaire&#x27;s writings in their struggles against militarism, nationalism, and the Catholic Church. The section condemning the futility and imbecility of war in the &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; was a frequent favorite, as were his arguments that nations can only grow at the expense of others. Following the liberation of France from the Vichy regime in 1944, Voltaire&#x27;s 250th birthday was celebrated in both France and the Soviet Union, honoring him as &quot;one of the most feared opponents&quot; of the Nazi collaborators and someone &quot;whose name symbolizes freedom of thought, and hatred of prejudice, superstition, and injustice.&quot;

Jorge Luis Borges stated that &quot;not to admire Voltaire is one of the many forms of stupidity&quot; and included his short fiction such as &quot;Micromégas&quot; in &quot;The Library of Babel&quot; and &quot;A Personal Library.&quot; Gustave Flaubert believed that France had erred gravely by not following the path forged by Voltaire instead of Rousseau. Most architects of modern America were adherents of Voltaire&#x27;s views. According to Will Durant:

== Voltaire and Rousseau ==
Voltaire&#x27;s junior contemporary Jean-Jacques Rousseau commented on how Voltaire&#x27;s book &quot;Letters on the English&quot; played a great role in his intellectual development. Having written some literary works and also some music, in December 1745 Rousseau wrote a letter introducing himself to Voltaire, who was by then the most prominent literary figure in France, to which Voltaire replied with a polite response. Subsequently, when Rousseau sent Voltaire a copy of his book &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot;, Voltaire replied, noting his disagreement with the views expressed in the book:
Subsequently, commenting on Rousseau&#x27;s romantic novel &quot;Julie, or the New Heloise&quot;, Voltaire stated:
Voltaire quipped that the first half of &quot;Julie&quot; had been written in a brothel and the second half in a lunatic asylum. In his &quot;Lettres sur La Nouvelle Heloise&quot;, written under a pseudonym, Voltaire criticized Rousseau&#x27;s grammatical mistakes:
In reviewing Rousseau&#x27;s book &quot;Emile&quot;, Voltaire dismissed it as &quot;a hodgepodge of a silly wet nurse in four volumes, with forty pages against Christianity, among the boldest ever known.&quot; He expressed admiration for the section titled &quot;Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar&quot;, calling it &quot;fifty good pages ... it is regrettable that they should have been written by ... such a knave.&quot; He went on to predict that &quot;Emile&quot; would be forgotten within a month.

In 1764, Rousseau published &quot;Lettres de la montagne&quot; on religion and politics. In the fifth letter he wondered why Voltaire had not been able to imbue the Genevan councilors, who frequently met him, &quot;with that spirit of tolerance which he preaches without cease, and of which he sometimes has need&quot;. The letter continued with an imaginary speech in the voice of Voltaire, acknowledging authorship of the heretical book &quot;Sermon of the Fifty&quot;, which the real Voltaire had repeatedly denied.

In 1772, when a priest sent Rousseau a pamphlet denouncing Voltaire, Rousseau responded by defending his rival:
In 1778, when Voltaire was given unprecedented honors at the Théâtre-Français, an acquaintance of Rousseau ridiculed the event. This was met by a sharp retort from Rousseau:
On 2 July 1778, Rousseau died one month after Voltaire. In October 1794, Rousseau&#x27;s remains were moved to the Panthéon near the remains of Voltaire.

Louis XVI, while incarcerated in the Temple, lamented that Rousseau and Voltaire had &quot;destroyed France&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Voltaire perceived the French bourgeoisie to be too small and ineffective, the aristocracy to be parasitic and corrupt, the commoners as ignorant and superstitious, and the Church as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings, although all too often, even more rapacious itself. Voltaire distrusted democracy, which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses. Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change, given the social structures of the time and the extremely high rates of illiteracy, and that it was in the king&#x27;s rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects. But his disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat, and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works, his novella &quot;Candide, ou l&#x27;Optimisme&quot; (&quot;Candide, or Optimism,&quot; 1759), which ends with a new conclusion of quietism: &quot;It is up to us to cultivate our garden.&quot; His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. &quot;Candide&quot; was also burned, and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain &#x27;Demad&#x27; in a letter, where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text.

He is remembered and honored in France as a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for civil rights (such as the right to a fair trial and freedom of religion) and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. The &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; involved an unfair balance of power and taxes between the three Estates: clergy and nobles on one side, the commoners and middle class, who were burdened with most of the taxes, on the other. He particularly had admiration for the ethics and government as exemplified by the Chinese philosopher Confucius.

Voltaire is also known for many memorable aphorisms, such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him&quot;), contained in a verse epistle from 1768, addressed to the anonymous author of a controversial work on &quot;The Three Impostors&quot;. But far from being the cynical remark it is often taken for, it was meant as a retort to atheistic opponents such as d&#x27;Holbach, Grimm, and others.

He has had his detractors among his later colleagues. The Scottish Victorian writer Thomas Carlyle argued that &quot;Voltaire read history, not with the eye of devout seer or even critic, but through a pair of mere anti-catholic spectacles.&quot;

The town of Ferney, where Voltaire lived out the last 20 years of his life, was officially named Ferney-Voltaire in honor of its most famous resident, in 1878. His &quot;château&quot; is a museum. Voltaire&#x27;s library is preserved intact in the National Library of Russia at Saint Petersburg. In the Zürich of 1916, the theatre and performance group who would become the early avant-garde Dada movement named their theater the Cabaret Voltaire. A late-20th-century industrial music group later adopted the same name. Astronomers have bestowed his name on the Voltaire crater on Deimos and the asteroid 5676 Voltaire.

Voltaire was also known to have been an advocate for coffee, drinking it at every turn: fifty times a day, according to Frederick the Great; three times a day, said Wagniere. It has been suggested that high amounts of caffeine stimulated his creativity. His great-grandniece was the mother of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Catholic philosopher and Jesuit priest. His book &quot;Candide&quot; was listed as one of The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written, by Martin Seymour-Smith.

In the 1950s, the bibliographer and translator Theodore Besterman started to collect, transcribe and publish all of Voltaire&#x27;s writings. He founded the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva where he began publishing collected volumes of Voltaire&#x27;s correspondence. On his death in 1976, he left his collection to the University of Oxford, where the Voltaire Foundation became established as a department. The Foundation has published the &quot;Complete Works of Voltaire&quot;, a chronological series in 205 volumes completed in 2022, more than fifty years after the first volume appeared. It also publishes the series &quot;Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment&quot;, begun by Bestermann as &quot;Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century&quot;, which has reached more than 500 volumes.

<text>[[Vietnam]] is located on the eastern margin of the Indochinese peninsula and occupies about , of which about 25% was under cultivation in 1987. It borders the Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Thailand, and Pacific Ocean, along with China, Laos, and Cambodia. The elongated roughly &quot;S&quot; shaped country has a north-to-south distance of and is about wide at the narrowest point. With a coastline of , excluding islands, Vietnam claims as the limit of its territorial waters, an additional as a contiguous customs and security zone. It has an exclusive economic zone of with .

The boundary with Laos was settled on both an ethnic and geographical basis between the rulers of Vietnam and Laos in the mid-seventeenth century. The Annamite Range as a reference, was formally defined by a delimitation treaty signed in 1977 and ratified in 1986. The frontier with Cambodia, defined at the time of French annexation of the western part of the Mekong Delta in 1867, remained essentially unchanged, according to Hanoi, until some unresolved border issues were finally settled in the 1982–85 period. The land and sea boundary with China, delineated under the France-China treaties of 1887 and 1895, is &quot;the frontier line&quot; accepted by Hanoi. China agreed in 1957–1958 to respect that border line. However, in February 1979, following the Sino-Vietnamese War, Hanoi complained that from 1957 onward China had provoked numerous border incidents as part of its anti-Vietnam policy and expansionist designs in Southeast Asia. Among the territorial infringements cited was the Chinese occupation in January 1974 of the Paracel Islands, claimed by both countries in a dispute left unresolved in the 1980s.

==Physiography==
The country is divided into the highlands and the Hong River Delta in the north, the Annamite Range along with the coastal lowlands in the centre, and the Mekong Delta in the south.

==Terrain==
Vietnam is a country of subtropical and tropical lowlands, hills, and densely forested highlands, with level land covering less than 20% of the area.

===Red River Delta===

The joined Delta of Hong River (Red River) and Thái Bình River is a flat, triangular region of . The Hong River Delta is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong Delta. Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in by the enormous alluvial deposits of the rivers over a period of millennia, and it advances one hundred meters into the Gulf annually. The ancestral home of the ethnic Vietnamese, the delta accounted for almost 70% of the agriculture and 80% of the industry of North Vietnam before 1975.

The Red River, rising in China&#x27;s Yunnan province, is about long. Its two main tributaries, the Sông Lô (also called the Lo River, the Riviere Claire, or the Clear River) and the Sông Đà (also called the Black River or Riviere Noire), contribute to its high water volume, which averages per second.

The entire delta region, backed by the steep rises of the forested highlands, is no more than three meters above sea level, and much of it is one meter or less. The area is subject to frequent flooding; at some places the high-water mark of floods is fourteen meters above the surrounding countryside. For centuries flood control has been an integral part of the delta&#x27;s culture and economy. An extensive system of dikes and canals has been built to contain the Red River and to irrigate the rich rice-growing delta. Modeled on that of China&#x27;s, this ancient system has sustained a highly concentrated population and has made double-cropping wet-rice cultivation possible throughout about half the region.

===Mountainous===
The mountain plateaus in the north and northwest are inhabited mainly by tribal minority groups. The Dãy Trường Sơn (Annamite Range) originates in the Tibetan and Yunnan regions of southwest China and forms Vietnam&#x27;s border with Laos. It terminates in the Mekong River Delta north of Hồ Chí Minh City (formerly Saigon).

These central mountains, which have several high plateaus, are irregular in elevation and form. The northern section is narrow and very rugged; the country&#x27;s highest peak, Fan Si Pan, rises to 3,142 meters in the extreme northwest. The southern portion has numerous spurs that divide the narrow coastal strip into a series of compartments. For centuries these topographical features not only rendered north–south communication difficult, but also formed an effective natural barrier for the containment of the people living in the Mekong basin.

===Central Highlands===
Within the southern portion of Vietnam is a plateau known as the Central Highlands (Tây Nguyên), approximately 51,800 square kilometers of rugged mountain peaks, extensive forests, and rich soil. Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil spread over the provinces of Đắk Lắk (or &quot;Dac Lac&quot;), Gia Lai, and Kon Tum, the highlands account for 16% of the country&#x27;s arable land and 22% of its total forested land. Before 1975, North Vietnam had maintained that the Central Highlands and the Day Truong Son were strategic areas of paramount importance, essential to the domination not only of South Vietnam but also of the southern part of Indochina. Since 1975, the highlands have provided an area in which to relocate people from the densely populated lowlands.

===Coastal lowlands===

The narrow, flat coastal lowlands extend from south of the Red River Delta to the Mekong River basin. On the landward side, the Dãy Trường Sơn rises precipitously above the coast, its spurs jutting into the sea at several places. Generally the coastal strip is fertile and rice is cultivated intensively.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 3,069 km2 of tidal flats in Vietnam, making it the 10th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.

===Mekong River Delta===

The Mekong Delta, covering about 40,000 square kilometers, is a low-level plain not more than three meters above sea level at any point and criss-crossed by a maze of canals and rivers. So much sediment is carried by the Mekong&#x27;s various branches and tributaries that the delta advances sixty to eighty meters into the sea every year. An official Vietnamese source estimates the amount of sediment deposited annually to be about 1 billion cubic meters, or nearly thirteen times the amount deposited by the Red River. About 10,000 square kilometers of the delta are under rice cultivation, making the area one of the major rice-growing regions of the world. The southern tip, known as the Cà Mau Peninsula is covered by dense jungle and mangrove swamps.

The Mekong, which is 4,220 kilometers long, is one of the 12 great rivers of the world. From its source in the Tibetan Plateau, it flows through the Tibetan and Yunnan regions of China, forms the boundary between Laos and Myanmar as well as between Laos and Thailand. At Phnom Penh it merges with the Tonlé Sap and divides into two branches – the Sông Hậu Giang (Hậu Giang river) (known as the Bassac River on the Cambodian side) and the Sông Tiền Giang (Tiền Giang river) – and continues through Cambodia and the Mekong basin before draining into the South China Sea through nine mouths known as the &quot;Cửu Long&quot; (nine dragons). The river is heavily silted and is navigable by seagoing craft of shallow draft as far as Kompong Cham in Cambodia. A tributary entering the river at Phnom Penh drains the Tonlé Sap, a shallow freshwater lake that acts as a natural reservoir to stabilize the flow of water through the lower Mekong. When the river is in flood stage, its silted delta outlets are unable to carry off the high volume of water. Floodwaters back up into the Tonlé Sap, causing the lake to inundate as much as 10,000 square kilometers. As the flood subsides, the flow of water reverses and proceeds from the lake to the sea. The effect is to reduce significantly the danger of devastating floods in the Mekong delta, where the river floods the surrounding fields each year to a level of one to two meters.

==Climate==


Vietnam&#x27;s climate, being located in the tropics and strongly influenced by the South China Sea has a monsoon-influenced climate typical of that of mainland Southeast Asia. In the north, the climate is humid subtropical and monsoonal and with four distinct seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter) while in the central and south, the climate is tropical monsoon with two seasons (rainy and dry). In addition, temperate climate exists in mountainous areas, which are found in Sa Pa and Da Lat, while a more continental climate exists in Lai Châu province and Sơn La province. The diverse topography, wide range of latitudes (Vietnam spans over 15° of latitude), and influences from the South China Sea lead to climatic conditions varying significantly between regions.

Based on geographic and climatic conditions, there are seven different climatic regions in Vietnam: Northwest, Northeast, North Delta (Red River Delta), North Central (North Central Coast), South Central (South Central Coast), Central Highlands, and the South. The South is subdivided into the Southeast for the southeastern provinces and the Mekong Delta for the southwestern provinces. Generally, these seven different climatic regions are grouped into two main types: The North (includes Northwest, Northeast, North Delta (Red River Delta), North Central (North Central Coast)) which includes all areas north of the Hải Vân Pass and the South (South Central Coast, Central Highlands and the extreme south) which includes all areas south of the Hải Vân Pass. These climatic regions are based on time of rainy season and other climatic elements such as insolation, sunshine, temperature, precipitation, and humidity.

During winter, polar air originating from the Siberian High penetrate deeply into the low latitudes, facilitated by the eastern Tibetan Plateau that funnels the air southwards in a northeast direction (the cool air is a wind coming from the northeast). Many cold fronts can penetrate into Vietnam during winter of which there are three to four occurrences every month in northern Vietnam. This leads to cold temperatures where temperatures drop by . Cold weather, occasionally extreme cold can persist for a long time, being characterized by a long stretch of cloudless or partly cloudy days in the first half of winter or a long stretch of cloudy and drizzly conditions in the latter half of winter. Cold weather occurs more frequently in the north than in the south due to cold fronts penetrate the north more frequently.

In summer, the general wind pattern are southwesterly winds in the southern parts of Vietnam and southeasterly winds in northern Vietnam. The predominantly air blocks in Vietnam are the equatorial and tropical blocks that originate from high pressure systems in the Southern Hemisphere, and a maritime tropical block originating from the subtropical high pressure system in the Pacific Ocean (Pacific subtropical high pressure). In addition, during summer, Vietnam is influenced by tropical air from the Bay of Bengal which occurs when a continental low pressure originating from South Asia (South Asian continental low) moves eastwards towards Vietnam, covering almost all of Vietnam and southern China; this causes hot, dry weather in the North Central Coast as westerly winds descend and warm adiabatically on the eastern slopes of the Annamite Range (Truong Son Range). On average, eleven storms and tropical low pressures develop in the South China sea during summer of which half are tropical cyclones that originate from the western Pacific. These storms and cyclones then move westwards towards Vietnam. On average, Vietnam is affected by six to eight typhoons or tropical cyclones per year.

Spring and Fall are transitional seasons. The atmospheric circulation in these seasons represent a transition between winter–summer and summer–winter respectively.

Mean annual temperatures in the country, based on meteorological data from weather stations range from in Hoang Lien Son. At the highest altitudes in the Hoang Lien Son range, mean annual temperatures is only . As temperatures vary by altitude, temperatures decrease by for every increase in altitude. The lowest mean annual temperatures are found in the mountainous areas where the altitude is higher and in northern areas due to their higher latitudes. Many mountainous areas in the north have experienced subzero conditions. In contrast, temperatures in the Spratly Islands never falls below . Because Vietnam is strongly influenced by the monsoon, the mean temperatures in Vietnam are lower than other countries located at the same latitude in Asia. The highest temperatures normally occurs in March–May in the south and May–July in the north. Temperatures in summer are relatively equal among the northern and southern parts of the country with differences being mostly due to altitude (the decrease in temperature is predominantly due to altitude).

Mean annual rainfall in the country ranges from although most places in Vietnam receive between . The majority of rainfall occurs during the rainy season, which is responsible for 80%–90% of the annual precipitation. Generally, northern parts of the country receive more rainfall than southern parts of the country. Drizzle is a weather phenomenon that is characteristic of the weather in winter in the north and north central coast. Depending on the region, the onset of the rainy season (defined as when the monthly average precipitation exceeds ) differs.

<text>Demographic features of the population of Vietnam include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Originating in northern Vietnam, the Vietnamese people pushed southward over two millennia to occupy the entire eastern seacoast of the Indochinese Peninsula. Ethnic Vietnamese, or Viet (known officially as Kinh), live in the lowlands and speak the Vietnamese language, as opposed to the many ethnic groups of Vietnam who are known to occupy the mountainous regions. The Kinh group does represent much of the cultural and political landscape of Vietnam.

Vietnam&#x27;s population may be expected to approach to 100 million by the end of 2023, making it the 15th largest country by population in the world. It is predicted that by 2035, Vietnam will become an aged society.

== Ethnic groups ==
The Vietnamese government recognizes 54 ethnic groups, of which the Viet (Kinh) is the largest; according to official Vietnamese figures (2019 census), ethnic Vietnamese account for 85.3% of the nation&#x27;s population and the non-Vietnamese ethnic groups account for the remaining portion. The ethnic Vietnamese inhabit a little less than half of Vietnam, while the ethnic minorities inhabit the majority of Vietnam&#x27;s land (albeit the least fertile parts of the country).

The relation between China and Vietnam also declined following reunification in 1976, with Vietnam siding with the Soviet Union against China in the Chinese-Soviet split. Tensions peaked when Vietnam and Cambodia started a war, Cambodia led by Pol Pot being a Chinese ally, resulting in a Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979. In 1978–79, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China. In recent years the government has performed an about turn and is encouraging overseas Hoa to return and invest, but the ethnic Chinese population has been in continuous decline since the 1970s due to assimilation and low birth rates.

The central highland peoples commonly termed Degar or Montagnards (mountain people) comprise two main ethnolinguistic groups – Malayo-Polynesian and Mon–Khmer. About 30 groups of various cultures and dialects are spread over the highland territory.

Other minority groups include the Cham—remnants of the once-mighty Champa Kingdom, conquered by the Vietnamese in the 15th century, Hmong, and Thái.

== Languages ==

Vietnamese is the official language of the country. It belongs to the Austroasiatic language family, which also includes languages such as Khmer and Mon. Vietnamese was spoken by 85–90 million people in Vietnam at the 1999 census. In the early 21st century, around another four million Vietnamese speakers are found outside of Vietnam, mostly refugees from the Vietnam-American War. Thus Vietnamese is the most spoken language of the Austroasiatic family, being spoken by three times more people than the second most spoken language of the family, Khmer. Both languages, however, are extremely different: Vietnamese is a tonal, monosyllabic language while Khmer has remained non-tonal. Vietnamese was heavily influenced by Chinese, with up to around 50–70% words having Chinese origins, whilst Khmer was heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Pali, uses a abugida writing system, and has a great part of its vocabulary originating from Indian languages. Since the early 20th century, the Vietnamese have used a Romanized script introduced by the French, developed by Jesuit missionaries led by Alexandre de Rhodes and later on, refined by Vietnamese scholars to produce what is now known as the Vietnamese alphabet.

==Religion==
According to the 2019 Census, the religious demographics of Vietnam are as follows:
*86.32% Vietnamese folk religion or non religious 
*6.1% Catholicism
*4.79% Buddhism (mainly Mahayana)
*1.02% Hoahaoism
*1% Protestantism
*&lt;1% Caodaism
*0.77 Others
It is worth noting here that the data is highly skewed, as a large majority of Vietnamese may declare themselves atheist yet practice forms of traditional folk religion or Mahayana Buddhism.

Estimates for the year 2010 published by the Pew Research Center:

* Vietnamese folk religion, 45.3%
* Unaffiliated, 29.6%
* Buddhism, 16.4%
* Christianity, 8.2%
* Other, 0.5%

<doc id="32380" wikidata="Q1154750" url="?curid=32380" title="Politics of Vietnam">
<text>The politics of Vietnam is dominated by a single party under an authoritarian system, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The President of Vietnam (Vietnamese: ) is the head of state, and the Prime Minister of Vietnam is the head of government. Both of these offices are separate from the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, who leads the CPV and is head of the Politburo and the Central Military Commission. The General Secretary is thus the &quot;de facto&quot; highest position in the Vietnamese politics.

Executive power is exercised by the government and the President of Vietnam. Legislative power is vested in the National Assembly of Vietnam (Quốc hội Việt Nam). The Judiciary is independent of the executive. The parliament adopted the current Constitution of Vietnam, Vietnam&#x27;s fifth, on 28 November 2013.

After 1986 Vietnam reduced its totalitarian government to an authoritarian one and has inherited many legacies of the past, with the freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted. There are no freely elected national leaders, political opposition is suppressed, all religious activity is controlled by the CPV, dissent is not permitted, and civil rights are curtailed. Elections in Vietnam occur under a single-party authoritarian political system. Vietnam is among the few contemporary party-led dictatorships to not hold any direct multiparty elections at the national level. The competitive nature of the elections is highly constrained by the Communist Party&#x27;s monopoly on power in Vietnam, limitations on free speech, and government interference with the elections.

The National Assembly is a rubber stamp unicameral legislative body. The National Assembly has 500 members, indirectly elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The legislature is, according to the constitution, the highest organ of the state. Its powers includes the enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws; the adoption of the government budget; supervising the Government of Vietnam and other holders of public powers responsible to the National Assembly; and appointing members of the judiciary. The Vietnamese constitution and legislation provides for regular elections for the office of the President of the Socialist Republic, the National Assembly and the People&#x27;s Councils.

The President is elected by National Assembly for a five-year term and acts as the &quot;de jure&quot; commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Armed Forces and Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. However, the president has the right to decide on executive brands. The government (), the main executive state power of Vietnam, is headed by the Prime Minister, who has several Deputy Prime Ministers and several ministers in charge of particular activities. The executive branch is responsible for the implementation of political, economic, cultural, social, national defence, security and external activities of the state.

Vietnam has a judicial system governed by the Constitution of Vietnam and national legislation enacted by National Assembly. The Supreme People&#x27;s Court () is the highest court of appeal in Vietnam. There are other specialised courts in Vietnam, including the Central Military Court, the Criminal Court, the Civil Court and the Appeal Court. The Supreme People&#x27;s Procuracy observes the implementation of state organs and makes sure that Vietnamese citizens follow the law.

== Key figures ==
Practically, a four-person collective leadership is responsible for governing Vietnam. Unofficially referred as the four pillars (, ), the collection consists of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, President of Vietnam, Prime Minister of Vietnam and Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam, being four key figures in the Vietnamese political system. It is instrumented to avoid consolidating too much power into a single position, thus avoiding dictatorship.

==Legal framework==

Vietnam is a one-party socialist republic. The current Vietnamese state traces its direct lineage back to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the 1945 August Revolution led by Hồ Chí Minh. The current constitution was adopted on 28 November 2013 by the National Assembly of Vietnam. There have been four other constitutions in Vietnamese history: the 1946, 1959, 1980, and 1992 constitutions. The Communist Party of Vietnam, the leading non-State organ, operates in accordance with the laws. Government powers in Vietnam are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers. Vietnam&#x27;s legal system is based upon socialist legality according to Article 12 of the constitution.

==State ideology==
Vietnam is a socialist republic with a one-party system led by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The CPV espouses Marxism–Leninism and Hồ Chí Minh Thought, the political philosophy and ideology of the late Hồ Chí Minh. The two ideologies function as a firm ideological basis and serve as guidance for the activities of the Party and state. According to the Constitution, Vietnam is &quot;in the period of transition to socialism&quot;. Marxism–Leninism was introduced to Vietnam in the 1920s and 1930s, and Vietnamese culture has been led under the banner of patriotism and Marxism–Leninism. Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s beliefs were not systematised during his life, nor quickly following his death. Trường Chinh&#x27;s biography of &quot;Chairman Hồ&quot; in 1973 emphasised his revolutionary policies. The thoughts of Hồ Chí Minh were systematised in 1989, under the leadership of Nguyễn Văn Linh. Hồ Chí Minh Thought, alongside Marxism–Leninism, became the official ideology of the CPV and the state in 1991. The CPV&#x27;s claim to legitimacy was retained following the collapse of communism in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 by its commitment to the thoughts of Hồ Chí Minh, according to Sophie Quinn-Judge. According to Pierre Brocheux, the author of &quot;Ho Chi Minh: a Biography&quot;, the current state ideology is Hồ Chí Minh Thought, with Marxism–Leninism playing a secondary role. While some claim that Hồ Chí Minh Thought is used as a veil for the Party leadership since they, according to this version, have stopped believing in communism, others claim this is not true considering that Hồ Chí Minh was an avid supporter of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Others see Hồ Chí Minh Thought as a political umbrella term whose main function is to smuggle in non-socialist ideas and policies without challenging socialist legality.

Since its foundation, the key ideology has been Marxism–Leninism, but since the introduction of a mixed economy in the late 1980s and 1990s, it has lost its monopolistic ideological and moral legitimacy. As became clear because of the Đổi Mới reforms, the Party could not base its rule on defending only the workers and the peasants, which was officially referred to as the &quot;working class-peasant alliance&quot;. In the constitution introduced in 1992, the State represented the &quot;workers, peasants and intellectuals&quot;. In recent years, the Party has stopped representing a specific class, but instead the &quot;interests of the entire people&quot;, which includes entrepreneurs. The final class barrier was removed in 2002, when party members were allowed to engage in private activities. In the face of de-emphasising the role of Marxism–Leninism, the Party has acquired a broader ideology, placing more emphasis on nationalism, developmentalism, and becoming the protector of tradition.

==Communist Party of Vietnam==
According to the official version, the Communist Party of Vietnam () is leading the Vietnamese people &quot;in carrying out the country&#x27;s renovation, modernisation and industrialisation.&quot; According to the Party&#x27;s statute, amended at the 9th National Congress on 22 April 2001, the CPV was &quot;established and trained by President Hồ Chí Minh, has led the Vietnamese people to carry out successfully the August Revolution, establishing the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam, now the Socialist Republic of Việt Nam, to defeat foreign invaders, to abolish the colonial and feudalist regime, to liberate and reunify the country, and then carry out the cause of renovation and socialist construction and firmly defend national independence.&quot; It believes in socialist internationalism of the working class, and supports the &quot;struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress of the world&#x27;s people.&quot; The CPV acts as the vanguard of the working people and the whole nation by representing their interests. Its aim is to create &quot;a strong, independent, prosperous and democratic country with an equitable and civilized society, to realise socialism and ultimately, communism.&quot; The Party&#x27;s ideological foundation is Marxism–Leninism and Hồ Chí Minh Thoughts. These ideologies guide the activities of the Party, while promoting &quot;the nation&#x27;s traditions, and absorbing other nations&#x27; essential ideas.&quot;

The CPV is organised on the principles of democratic centralism. It practices &quot;criticism, self-criticism, and strict discipline&quot; and pursues &quot;collective leadership and individual responsibility, and promoting comradeship and solidarity in line with the Party&#x27;s political programs and statutes.&quot; The CPV is subject to Vietnamese laws and the Constitution. It is the country&#x27;s ruling party and promotes the &quot;mastery of the people over the country&quot;. The Party is under the supervision of the people. It is dependent on having the people contribute to the party, by strengthening, uniting, and leading the people in the revolutionary cause. The political system in Vietnam is led by the CPV, and it &quot;leads, respects and promotes the role of the State, the Vietnamese Fatherland Front (VFF) and other socio-political organisations.&quot;

In 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he is Vietnam&#x27;s most powerful leader in decades.

===Congress===

The National Congress is the party&#x27;s highest organ. The direction of the Party and the Government is decided at the National Congress, held every fifth year. The Central Committee is elected by the National Congress. Delegates vote on policies and candidate posts within the central party leadership. Following ratification of the decisions taken at the National Congress, the National Congress dissolves itself. The Central Committee, which is elected by the National Congress every fifth year, implements the decisions of the National Congress in the five-year period. Since the Central Committee only meets twice a year, the Politburo implements the policies of the National Congress.

===Central Committee===
The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV&#x27;s most powerful institution. It delegates some of its powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo when it is not in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh&#x27;s reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The former President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Trương Tấn Sang (2011–2016) was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held in 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo&#x27;s motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu&#x27;s rule.

The Central Committee elects the Politburo in the aftermath of the Party Congress. Since the full Central Committee meets only once a year, the Politburo functions as the Party&#x27;s leading collective decision-making body. The Secretariat is also elected by the Central Committee, and is headed by the General Secretary (). It is responsible for solving organizational problems and implementing the demands of the Central Committee. The Secretariat oversees the work of the Commissions of the Central Committee. The General Secretary is the de facto leader of Vietnam.

==Fatherland Front==

The Vietnamese Fatherland Front (VFF) () is an umbrella group of pro-communist movements. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the VFF and its members constitute &quot;the political base of people&#x27;s power&quot;. The state must create a favorable environment for the VFF and its member organisations. The VFF is a voluntary mass organisation of political, socio-political and social organisations and &quot;individuals from all classes, social strata, ethnic groups, and religions, including overseas Vietnamese.&quot; Its main objectives are to gather and build a people unity bloc, &quot;strengthen the people&#x27;s political and spiritual consensus, encourage the people to promote their mastership, to implement the CPV&#x27;s guidelines and policies, and to abide by the Constitution and laws.&quot; The VFF is governed on the principles of &quot;democratic consensus, coordinated and united action.&quot; Its organisation has been modelled after the state structure, and the VFF has its own independent statute. Notable member organisations of the VFF include the General Confederation of Labour, the Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union and the Veteran Association, among others.

==Legislative==
The National Assembly () is a unicameral legislative body, and is governed on the basis of democratic centralism. It is the highest representative organ and the highest state organ. The National Assembly is the only organ vested with constitutional and legislative powers. It is responsible for fundamental domestic and foreign policies, socio-economic policies, defence and security issues, and it exercises supreme control over all state activities. Delegates (or members) of the National Assembly are elected through secret ballots in democratic elections which are held every fifth year. The National Assembly is convened twice a year, and its Standing Committee represents it between sessions.

The membership of the Standing Committee consists of the Chairman (), deputy chairmen and other members; these members are elected by the National Assembly. Standing Committee members cannot simultaneously be members of the Government. Members work on a full-time basis, and their terms of office correspond with the term of the National Assembly. The Standing Committee continues to function until a new National Assembly is elected. According to the constitution, the Standing Committee is responsible for 12 duties. Of these, the most important are the powers to announce, convene and chair the National Assembly sessions, to interpret the constitution, laws and ordinances, and to issue ordinances on those matters assigned by the National Assembly. It supervises and guides the People&#x27;s Councils and their activities, and directs, regulates and coordinates the activities of the Ethnic Council and the committees of the National Assembly.

There are seven committees of the National Assembly. Committee membership is determined by the National Assembly. They are responsible for the studying and examination of bills, legislative initiatives, drafts of ordinances and other drafts of legal documents and reports assigned by the National Assembly or the Standing Committee. The committees provide the National Assembly and its Standing Committee with their opinions on the legislative programme. The committees supervise and conduct investigations within their respective competency and exercise powers which are stipulated by law. The National Assembly elects the Ethnic Council, which consists of a chairman, deputy chairmen and other members. The Ethnic Council studies and recommends actions to the National Assembly; the National Assembly has to consult with the Ethnic Council before issuing any decisions on ethnic policy. The Chairman of the Ethnic Council has to attend meetings of the Government which concern ethnic policy. The powers of the Ethnic Council are comparable to those of the committees.

==Judiciary==

The Vietnamese judicial system is based upon Socialist legality. The country&#x27;s highest judicial organ is the Supreme People&#x27;s Court (SPC) (). The composition of the SPC includes the Chief Justice (), Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SPC (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, Central Military Court, Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SPC is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic has the power to nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge&#x27;s request. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front introduces People&#x27;s Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the operating principles of the courts are, during hearings, that the &quot;judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws.&quot; Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the right of defence and to hire a lawyer.

The Supreme People&#x27;s Prosecutor (SPP) (), the Vietnamese equivalent to an attorney general, observes the implementation process of the Ministries, ministerial-level agencies, government organs, local authorities, social and economic organisations, the armed forces, security forces and the Vietnamese citizens in general. The SPP respects the Constitution and state laws, practices public prosecution as stated by the law and ensures law enforcement. The head of the SPP is elected, dismissed, or removed from office by a proposal of the President. The Deputy Heads, prosecutors and inspectors appointed by the SPP head can be dismissed by the President on the Head&#x27;s request.

The SPC is the highest court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which controls the judiciary&#x27;s budget and confirms the president&#x27;s nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people&#x27;s courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people&#x27;s courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, in part because the Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party&#x27;s dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam&#x27;s judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.

==Elections==

Article 6 of the Constitution states that &quot;The people make use of state power through the agency of the National Assembly and the People&#x27;s Councils, which represent the will and aspirations of the people, are elected by them and responsible to them&quot;. Deputies (members) of the National Assembly are directly elected on a democratic basis through secret ballots. All citizens who are 18 or older, regardless of ethnic group, gender, social position, belief, religion, level of education, occupation or length of residency have the right to vote, the exceptions being the mentally disabled and those people who have been deprived of the right to vote by law. People aged 21 or older have the right to stand as a candidate at elections. Three election commissions have been established to manage elections; at the central level is the Election Council, at the provincial level and in centrally-run cities the Election Committee is responsible for election monitoring and the Election Commission is responsible for election monitoring at constituencies.

The current 500 members of the National Assembly were elected during the 2016
 parliamentary election, and they have a five-year term. Despite foreign criticism, it is generally believed that the National Assembly has become more powerful in recent years. The last election was held, according to the authorities, in a democratic, fair, lawful and safe manner and was considered a success. Voter turnout was 99.51 percent; nearly 62 million people voted. In their respective constituencies, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the General Secretary, was elected to the National Assembly with 85.63 percent of the votes, Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was elected with 95.38 percent and President Trương Tấn Sang was elected with 80.19 percent. Outside the ruling troika, it was Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, the Chairman of the Government Office, who was elected with the highest margin, with 94.59 percent of the votes. The number of self-nominated candidates was four times higher than the previous election. Fifteen out of the 182 candidates nominated by the central government and the central party leadership were defeated in the elections. Lê Thị Thu Ba, a member of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee and Chairman of the Committee of Law during the 12th National Assembly (2007–2011), was not re-elected to the National Assembly. Several capitalists were elected to the assembly, but due to the socialist ideology of the state, they are not allowed to sit on the assembly&#x27;s Committee on Economy and Budget.

Nguyễn Sinh Hùng, the Chairman of the National Assembly, nominated Trương Tấn Sang for the Presidency. 487 deputies of the National Assembly, meaning 97.4 percent, voted in favour of Trương Tấn Sang. In his victory speech, Trương Tấn Sang said, &quot;I pledge to improve my moral quality and study the example of the late President Hồ Chí Minh to cooperate with the government to bring Vietnam to become a fully industrialized country by 2015.&quot;

==Local government==

Provinces and municipalities are subdivided into towns, districts and villages. Provinces and municipalities are centrally controlled by the national government. Towns, districts and villages are locally accountable to some degree through elected people&#x27;s councils. Certain cities and provinces are under direct control of the central government. The provinces are divided into districts, provincial cities and towns; cities under direct rule are divided into towns, urban and rural districts. In turn, the district is divided into communes and townlets. In the words of Article 118 of the Constitution, the &quot;provincial city and the town are divided into wards and communes; the urban district is divided into wards.&quot; The establishment of People&#x27;s Council and People&#x27;s Committees is determined by law.

In the provinces, the People&#x27;s Council is the &quot;local organ of State power&quot;, and it represents the &quot;aspirations, and mastery of the people&quot;. The People&#x27;s Council is democratically elected, and is accountable to the people and to superior organs of the state. It must pass resolutions which are formal orders of superior organs of state, and it acts on behalf of the constitution. The People&#x27;s Council decides the plans for socio-economic development, decides the budget and is responsible for national defence and security at the local level. The deputy (member) of the People&#x27;s Council acts on the behalf of the people, and has the right to make proposals to the People&#x27;s Council and other local State organs. In turn, officials of these local organs have the responsibility to receive and to examine them.

The People&#x27;s Council appoint a People&#x27;s Committee, the executive organ of the People&#x27;s Council. It is the People&#x27;s Committee which has the responsibility to implement &quot;the Constitution, the law, the formal written orders of superior State organs and the resolutions of the People&#x27;s Council.&quot; The People&#x27;s Committee is headed by a chairman, who acts as the body&#x27;s leader. All decisions of the People&#x27;s Committee are taken through a collegial decision-making process, and have to &quot;conform to the will of the majority.&quot; The chairman has the power to annul decisions of lower standing organs.

Local officials of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, its local head, and officials from other mass organisations in the locality have the right to attend the meetings of the People&#x27;s Council and the People&#x27;s Committee if relevant problems are discussed. According to Article 125 of the constitution, &quot;The People&#x27;s Council and the People&#x27;s Committee shall make regular reports on the local situation in all fields to the Fatherland Front and the mass organisations; shall listen to their opinions and proposals on local power building and socio-economic development; shall cooperate with them in urging the people to work together with the State for the implementation of socio-economic, national-defence, and security tasks in the locality.&quot;

<text>The economy of Vietnam is a developing mixed socialist-oriented market economy. It is the 33rd-largest economy in the world by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and the 26th-largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity (PPP). It is a lower-middle income country with a low cost of living. Vietnam is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the World Trade Organization.

Since the mid-1980s, through the Đổi Mới reform period, Vietnam has made a shift from a highly centralized planned economy to a mixed economy. Before, South Vietnam was reliant on U.S. aid, while North Vietnam and reunified Vietnam relied on communist aid until the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution. 

The economy uses both directive and indicative planning through five-year plans, with support from an open market-based economy. Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in Southeast Asia. 

According to a forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers in February 2017, Vietnam may be the fastest-growing of the world&#x27;s economies, with a potential annual GDP growth rate of about 5.1 percent, which would make its economy the 10th-largest in the world by 2050. Vietnam has also been named among the so-called Next Eleven and CIVETS countries.

==History==
=== Before 1858 ===
Civilization in Vietnam had been built on agriculture. The feudal dynasties always considered agriculture as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on physiocracy. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as dykes were constructed in the Red River Delta to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term . Thang Long (Hanoi) was the main handicraft manufacturing center of the country. Chinese noted that the Vietnamese were doing business just like the same with in the Chinese Song dynasty. From the 9th to 13th century, the Vietnamese traded ceramics and silks with regional powers such as China, Champa, Western Xia, Java among others. Further archeological evidence suggests that Muslim traders had lived in Hanoi from around the 9th to 10th centuries, based on Muslim ceramics found in the Old Quarter of Hanoi.

However, from the 16th century, Confucianism was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary pre-capitalism economy began to develop. During the Lê–Mạc period, the state encouraged semi-industrial business and sea-traders, as the Vietnamese economy would mainly depended on them for the next 250 years. Cities such as Dong Kinh, Hội An and others grew quickly under rapid urbanization. They were later constrained when foreign nations saw them as an economic threat.

During the 17th century, Vietnam&#x27;s economy had reached its peak as the country was the third-largest economic power in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In the late 18th century, the economy suffered depression because of a series of diseases and disaster such as the Tay Son peasant rebellion which devastated the country. This policy led to stagnation of the Vietnamese economy in the early-19th century, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.

=== 1858–1975 ===
Until the French colonization in the mid-19th century, Vietnam&#x27;s economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the South for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the North for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports—coal from the North, rice from the South—and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.

The separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi; railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.

When the North and South were divided politically in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: socialism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the Second Indochina War from 1955 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country&#x27;s 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers out of the millions of war refugees.

=== 1975–1997 ===

The government&#x27;s Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1981) aimed for solid high annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained. The economy remained dominated by small-scale production, low labor productivity, material and technological shortfalls, and insufficient food and consumer goods. The more modest goals of the Third Five-Year Plan (1981–85) were a compromise between ideological and pragmatic factions; they emphasized the development of agriculture and industry. Efforts were also made to decentralize planning and improve the managerial skills of government officials.

After reunification in 1975, the economy of Vietnam was plagued by enormous difficulties in production, imbalances in supply and demand, inefficiencies in distribution and circulation, soaring inflation rates, and rising debt problems. Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam&#x27;s gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).

From the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the Comecon, and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the Soviet Union and its allies. Following the dissolution of the Comecon and the loss of its traditional trading partners, Vietnam was forced to liberalize trade, devalue its exchange rate to increase exports, and embark on a policy of economic development. Between 1975 and 1994, the United States imposed a trade embargo on Vietnam, forbidding any trade during the 19-year period.

In 1986, Vietnam launched a political and economic renewal campaign (&quot;Đổi Mới&quot;) that introduced reforms to facilitate the transition from a centralized economy to a &quot;socialist-oriented market economy&quot;. &quot;Đổi Mới&quot; combined government planning with free-market incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including foreign-owned enterprises. Furthermore, the Vietnam government stressed the necessity to lower birth rates when developing the economic and social rights of the population by implementing a policy that restricted the number of children per household to two, called the two-child policy. By the late 1990s, the success of the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under &quot;Đổi Mới&quot; was evident. More than 30,000 private businesses had been created, the economy was growing at an annual rate of more than 7%, and poverty was nearly halved.

Since the early 1990s, Vietnam had structurally changed away from agriculture, but without industrialisation (service-oriented globalisation).

In 1990, the state sector was the key hoped-for site of industrialisation. The state sector transitioned away from the processes of bottom-up commercialisation of the 1980s. This created a supply capacity. The supply capacity allowed Vietnam to avoid negative shock as Soviet aid was removed, and the supply capacity allowed the economy of Vietnam to grow rapidly in the 1990s.

Throughout the 1990s, exports increased by as much as 20% to 30% in some years. In 1999, exports accounted for 40% of GDP, an impressive performance in the midst of the economic crisis that hit other countries in Asia. Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007, which freed Vietnam from textile quotas enacted worldwide as part of the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) in 1974. The MFA placed restrictions on the import by industrialized countries of textiles from developing countries. For China and other WTO members, however, textile quotas under the MFA expired at the end of 2004 as agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994. A 2019 study found that Vietnam&#x27;s WTO entry led to substantial gains in productivity for private firms, but had no impact on state-owned enterprises. In the absence of state-owned enterprises, &quot;the overall productivity gains would have been about 40% larger in a counterfactual Vietnamese economy.&quot;

===Development since 1997===
Vietnam&#x27;s economic policy following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis has been a cautious one, emphasizing macroeconomic stability rather than growth. While the country shifted toward a more market-oriented economy, the Vietnamese government still continues to hold a tight rein over major state sectors, such as the banking system, state-owned enterprises and foreign trade. GDP growth fell to 6% in 1998 and 5% in 1999. The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2000.

The signing of the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between the United States and Vietnam on July 13, 2000, was a significant milestone. The BTA provided for &quot;normal trade relations&quot; status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a manufacturing-based, export-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from Europe, Asia and other regions.

In 2001, the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state. Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global recession, making it the world&#x27;s second fastest-growing economy. At the same time, investment grew threefold and domestic savings quintupled.

In 2003, the private sector accounted for more than one-quarter of all industrial output. However, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam fell dramatically in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s global competitiveness report rankings, largely due to negative perceptions of the effectiveness of government institutions. Official corruption is endemic, and Vietnam lags in property rights, efficient regulation of markets, and labor and financial market reforms.

Vietnam had an average GDP growth of 7.1% a year from 2000 to 2004. The GDP growth was 8.4% in 2005, the second-largest in Asia, trailing only China&#x27;s. The government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8.17%. According to the Minister of Planning and Investment, the government targeted a GDP growth of around 8.5% in 2007.

On November 7, 2006, the General Council at the World Trade Organization (WTO) approved Vietnam&#x27;s accession package. On January 11, 2007, Vietnam officially became the WTO&#x27;s 149th member, after 11 years of preparation, including eight years of negotiation. The country&#x27;s access to the WTO was intended to provide an important boost to the economy, as it ensured that the liberalizing reforms continue and created options for trade expansion. However, the accession also brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition.

Vietnam&#x27;s economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base, as it suffered the crippling effect of the Vietnam War from the 1950s to the 1970s, the punitive embargoes of the United States and its allies, as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath. In 2012, the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after large numbers of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose. The main danger has been over the bad debt in the banks totalling to 15% and forecast growth is 5.2% for 2012 but this is also due to the global economic crisis. The government has launched schemes to reform the economy, however, such as lifting foreign ownership cap from 49% and partially privatizing the country&#x27;s state-owned companies that have been responsible for the recent economic downturn. By the end of 2013, the government is expected to privatize 25–50% of SOEs, only maintaining control on public services and military. The recent reforms have created a major boom in the Vietnamese stock market as confidence in the Vietnamese economy is returning.

Vietnam&#x27;s current economic turmoil has given rise to question of a new period of changing political economy, however. Poverty remains to be the main concern on the national performance index as of 2018. The Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) found that 28% of survey respondents cited poverty as their main problem. Most respondents agreed with the statement that &quot;[P]overty reduction is imperative to ensuring that Vietnam becomes an advanced, developed country. The percentage of the poorest Vietnamese respondents who believed that their economic situation would worsen increased from 13% in 2016 to 26% in 2017. The percentage of respondents with health insurance increased from 74% in 2016 to 81% in 2017, with strongest gains in the rural population groups.

In 2017, Transparency International, a non-profit that tracks graft ranked Vietnam as 113th worst out of 176 countries and regions for perceptions of corruption. Several graft cases found in 2016 and 2017 led to the corruption crackdown which prosecuted many bankers, businesspeople, and government officials under charges of corruption. PAPI found that bribery at public district hospital services decreased from 17% in 2016 to 9% in 2017. Reports of land seizures went down from an average of about 9% before 2013, to less than 7% in 2017. The number of respondents who believed that their land was sold at a fair market value decreased from 26% in 2014 to 21% in 2017. Land-use graft and petty graft, such as police officers accepting bribes, are common. According to Ralph Jennings, Vietnam has been privatizing many of its state-owned operations to reduce corruption and increase efficiency.

As of March 2018, Vietnam&#x27;s economy continued to grow, achieving the best annual growth rate in over a decade; which has led media outlets to speculate if in the near future it could be one of the Asian tigers.

According to DBS Bank in 2019, Vietnam&#x27;s economy has the potential to grow at a pace of about 6.0%–6.5% by 2029. Vietnam can overpower Singapore&#x27;s economy by the next decade because of its strong foreign investment inflow and productivity growth. However, Vietnam has surpassed Singapore just a year later.

In the early 2020s, despite trade wars with Vietnam&#x27;s major trade partners, a pandemic and the increasing trend in deglobalisation, Vietnam has still managed to become Asia&#x27;s top-performing economy. Since 2000, Vietnam has now managed to manufacture higher-value goods with better paying jobs due to its more highly skilled workers. These workers now produce electronics which makes up 38% (in 2020) of Vietnam&#x27;s exports (compared to 14% in 2010). The country had achieved an average of 6.2% in economic growth (faster than any other country in Asia after China). Foreign investment on the luxury hotels sector and resorts will rise to support the tourist industry.

==Economic sectors==

===Agriculture, fishery and forestry===

In 2003, Vietnam produced an estimated 30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to dwindling forests, Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.

Vietnam&#x27;s fishing industry, which has abundant resources given the country&#x27;s long coastline and extensive network of rivers and lakes, has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by shrimp farms in the South and &quot;catfish&quot;, which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered antidumping complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.

Vietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer. Vietnam is also the world&#x27;s second-largest exporter of coffee, trailing behind Brazil.

Vietnam produced in 2018:

* 44.0 million tons of rice (5th largest producer in the world, behind China, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh);
* 17.9 million tons of sugarcane (16th largest producer in the world);
* 14.8 million tons of vegetable;
* 9.8 million tons of cassava (7th largest producer in the world);
* 4.8 million tonnes of maize;
* 2.6 million tonnes of cashew nut (largest producer in the world);
* 2.0 million tons of banana (20th largest producer in the world);
* 1.6 million tons of coffee (2nd largest producer in the world, only behind Brazil);
* 1.5 million tons of coconut (6th largest producer in the world);
* 1.3 million tons of sweet potato (9th largest producer in the world);
* 1.2 million tons of watermelon;
* 1.1 million tons of natural rubber (3rd largest producer in the world, behind Thailand and Indonesia);
* 852 thousand tons of orange (18th largest producer in the world);
* 779 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava);
* 654 thousand tons of pineapple (12th largest producer in the world);
* 270 thousand tons of tea (6th largest producer in the world);

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

In 2018, Vietnam was the world&#x27;s 5th largest producer of pork (3.8 million tonnes). This year the country also produced 839 thousand tons of chicken meat, 334 thousand tons of beef, 936 million liters of cow&#x27;s milk, 20 thousand tons of honey, among others.

===Energy, mining and minerals===

Petroleum is the main source of energy, followed by coal, which contributes about 25% of the country&#x27;s energy (excluding biomass). Vietnam&#x27;s oil reserves are in the range of 270–500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually.

In 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports. Also mined are antimony, bauxite, chromium, gold, iron, natural phosphates, tin, and zinc.

In 2019, Vietnam was the 9th largest world producer of antimony; 10th largest producer of tin; 11th largest producer of bauxite; 12th largest world producer of titanium; 13th largest world producer of manganese and 9th largest producer of phosphate in the world. The country is also one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of ruby, sapphire, topaz and spinel.

Crude oil was Vietnam&#x27;s leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings. Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity. Vietnam&#x27;s only operational refinery, a facility at Cat Hai near Ho Chi Minh City, has a capacity of only . Refined petroleum accounted for 10.2% of total imports in 2002. As of 2012, Vietnam had only one refinery, the Dung Quat refinery, but a second one, the Nghi Son Refinery was planned and was scheduled for construction in May 2013.

Vietnam&#x27;s anthracite coal reserves are estimated at 3.7 billion tons. Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam&#x27;s potential natural gas reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Hydroelectric power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a nuclear power plant with Russian assistance, and a second by a Japanese group.

From 2019 onwards, renewable energy deployment in Vietnam accelerated, by far surpassing the other Southeast Asian countries. Most of the newly deployed renewable energy was in the form of solar and wind power plants. By 2023, however, this development had slowed down, mainly due to limited electrical grid capacity and reduced government support.
===Industry and manufacturing===

Although the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. 

From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors — electronics, food processing, cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods — experienced rapid growth. Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese firms. For instance, Samsung produces about 40% of its phones in Vietnam. 

In the past decade, a significant automotive industry has been developed. As of 2019, Samsung employs over 200,000 employees in the Hanoi-area of Vietnam to produce smartphones, while offsourcing some manufacturing to China and manufacturing large portions of its phones in India. LG Electronics moved smartphone production to Vietnam from South Korea, in order to stay competitive. LG said that &quot;Vietnam provides an &quot;abundant labor force&quot;, as motivation for the move.

Of note, Samsung accounted for 15 percent of Vietnam&#x27;s exports in the first seven months of 2024. Although significant, this is a fall from 2017 during which Samsung accounted for 22.7 percent of Vietnam&#x27;s exports.

===Services and tourism===
In 2004, services accounted for 38.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). From 1994 to 2004, GDP attributable to the service sector grew at an average annual rate of 6.0%.

====Tourism====
In 2012, Vietnam received 6.8 million international visitors and the number is expected to reach over 7 million in 2013. Vietnam keeps emerging as an attractive destination. In TripAdvisor&#x27;s list of top 25 destinations Asia 2013 by travelers&#x27; choice, there are four cities of Vietnam, namely Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hoi An and Ha Long.

2016 was the first year ever which Vietnam received over 10 million international visitors. Since then, this figure has continued to rise. In 2019, Vietnam with 18 million international visitors was fifth most visited country in the Asia-Pacific region as per World Tourism rankings released by the United Nations World Tourism Organization.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam, the country suspended issuance of all tourist visas from March 2020 and recorded a 98% year-on-year drop in foreign visitors for April 2020. Furthermore, Total tourism revenues dropped by over 60% year-on-year for July 2020. The country reopened to international arrivals in March of 2022.

In the first six months of 2024, Vietnam received 6,943,961 tourist arrivals representing an increase over the same period in 2023 of 65.7 percent.

===Export of labour===

The export of labour, that is the sending of Vietnamese workers to work in other countries, is also key to the Vietnamese economy, with much of their earnings being sent back to Vietnam. This labour export was disrupted due to the Covid pandemic, however by 2022, Vietnam hopes to send 90,000 workers abroad. Traditional destinations have included South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Republic of China, and now Vietnam is aiming for Germany, Russia, and Israel.

===Banking and finance===


====Banking====

The most important banks are the state-owned VietinBank, BIDV, and Vietcombank, which dominate the banking sector. There is also a trend of foreign investment into profitable banks. For example, VietinBank is currently owned by Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ (19.73%) while Vietcombank is owned by Mizuho (15%).

&quot;(NOTE: Average exchange rates of 2020. Source: tradingeconomics.com. 1 USD = 23,286 VND)&quot;

====Finance====
Vietnam has two stock trading centers, the Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center and the Hanoi Securities Trading Center, which run the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) and the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX), respectively. However, there is also a third market, the Unlisted Public Companies market (UPCOM) which is a part of the Hanoi Stock Exchange. Together these two trading centres and three exchanges come under the purview of the Vietnam Stock Exchange (VSE). The VSE is a legislated body overseen by the State Securities Commission (SSC) which is a branch of the Ministry of Finance. This structure was established through the Law on Securities 2019.

==Currency, exchange rate and inflation==

The currency used in Vietnam is the đồng, shortened as VND or đ.

===Exchange rate===
The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Vietnamese đồng is important because the dong, although not freely convertible, is loosely pegged to the dollar through an arrangement known as a &quot;crawling peg&quot;. This mechanism allows the dollar–dong exchange rate to adjust gradually to changing market conditions. This was set at 3 percent either side of a fixed rate set each day by the SBV, however, it was increased to 5 percent in October of 2022.

As of December 27, 2024, a US dollar is worth 25,448 Vietnamese đồng.

Gold still maintains its position as a physical currency to a certain extent, although it has seen its economic role declining in recent years.

===Inflation===
Vietnam saw high inflation in 1980s. During this period, there was excessive demand for the industrial sector development, food, and other commodities. In order to stimulate supply, government attempted co-integration of parallel and planned market. Though the initial reform in the 1980s raised the total output, due to the report being partial, it also led to the CPI inflation rate being pushed to 200% in 1982. To tackle this, the government introduced forced savings, which can be understood as the accumulation of unspent money to make the monetary overhang.

Vietnam&#x27;s economy experienced a hyperinflation period in its early years of the extensive reform program, especially from 1987 to 1992.

In 2008, inflation was tracking at 20.3% for the first half of the year, higher than the 3.4% in 2000, but down significantly from 160% in 1988.

In 2010, inflation stood at 11.5%, and 18.58% in 2011.

At the end of 2012, inflation stood at 7.5%, a substantial decrease from 2011.

In 2013, inflation stood at 6%, and 4.09% in 2014. In 2016, it was only 2%.

==Mergers and acquisitions==
With 1,120 inbound deals with a cumulated value of almost 15 billion USD, there is a demonstrated interest by foreign companies to access the Vietnamese market or continue expansion using mergers and acquisitions. From 1991 to February 2018, Vietnamese companies were involved as either an acquiror or an acquired company in 4,000 mergers and acquisitions with a total value of 40.6 billion USD. The mergers and acquisitions activities faced many obstacles, lowering the rate of success of the transaction. Common obstacles come from culture, transparency and legal aspects. The Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances that has been active in Vietnam since 2006 and its M&amp;A expert Christopher Kummer think that after the peak in 2016 and 2017 the trend will decrease in 2018. Among the largest and most prominent transactions since 2000 are:

All of the top 10 deals are inbound into Vietnam and none are outbound.

==Trade==

Economic relations with the United States are improving but are not without challenges. Although the United States and Vietnam reached a landmark bilateral agreement in December 2001, which helped increase Vietnam&#x27;s exports to the United States, disagreements over textile and catfish exports are hindering full implementation of the agreement. Further disrupting the economic relations between the two countries were efforts in Congress to link non-humanitarian aid to Vietnam&#x27;s human rights record. Barriers to trade and intellectual property are also within the purview of bilateral discussions.

Given neighboring China&#x27;s rapid economic ascendancy, Vietnam highly values its economic relationship with China. Following the resolution of most territorial disputes, trade with China is growing rapidly, and in 2004, Vietnam imported more products from China than from any other country. In November 2004, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Vietnam is a member, and China announced plans to establish the world&#x27;s largest free-trade area by 2010.

Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on January 11, 2007.

In December 2015, Vietnam joined the ASEAN Economic Community along with the 9 other ASEAN members. The community&#x27;s goal is to integrate the 10 members of ASEAN and bring a freer flow of labor, investment and trade to the region.

Currently, Vietnam is being tugged in multiple directions from multiple powers, namely, Russia, China and the U.S. in its attempts to achieve economic multilateralization. Alternatively in the region, it is also pulled by either China, South Korea, Japan or ASEAN countries, as well as other constituents such as Taiwan &amp; Hong Kong as well as Australia/New Zealand and India in the region (ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6).

===Foreign trade===
Since Đổi Mới in 1986, Vietnam has increased trading, growing both exports and imports in double digits ever since. More recently, alarms on trade account deficits have been raised domestically, especially after joining the WTO in 2007. Throughout the next five years after 2007, Vietnam ran a trade deficit with the rest of the world in the tens of billions of dollars, with the record trade deficit in 2008 of US$18 billion.

The account deficit has since decreased. In 2012, Vietnam recorded a trade surplus of US$780 million, the first trade surplus since 1993. Total trade reached US$228.13 billion, an increase of 12.1% from 2011. In 2013, Vietnam recorded the second year of trade surplus of US$863 million. In 2014, Vietnam recorded the third year of trade surplus of US$2.14 billion, the largest trade surplus ever in history. Three years later, in 2017, it surpassed itself with a record of $2.92 billion.

====Exports====

In 2004, Vietnam&#x27;s exports of merchandise were valued at US$26.5 billion, and were growing rapidly along with imports. Vietnam&#x27;s principal exports were crude oil (22.1%), textiles and garments (17.1%), footwear (10.5%), fisheries products (9.4%) and electronics (4.1%). The main destinations of Vietnam&#x27;s exports were the United States (18.8%), Japan (13.2%), China (10.3%), Australia (6.9%), Singapore (5.2%), Germany (4.0%), and the United Kingdom (3.8%).

In 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion. Vietnam&#x27;s main export market included the EU with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, ASEAN with $US 17.8 billion, Japan with US$13.9 billion, China with US$14.2 billion, and South Korea with US$7 billion.

In 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam&#x27;s export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.

In 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The United States continued to be Vietnam&#x27;s largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The EU is second with US$27.9 billion, ASEAN is third, China is fourth and Japan is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.

====Imports====
In 2004, Vietnam&#x27;s merchandise imports were valued at US$31.5 billion and growing rapidly. Vietnam&#x27;s principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam&#x27;s imports were China (13.9%), Taiwan (11.6%), Singapore (11.3%), Japan (11.1%), South Korea (10.4%), Thailand (5.8%), and Malaysia (3.8%).

Vietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion. Major import countries were China US$29.2 billion, ASEAN with US$22.3 billion, South Korea with US$16.2 billion, Japan with US$13.7 billion, EU with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.

In 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export. China continued to be Vietnam&#x27;s largest import partner, with US$43.7 billion. The ASEAN is second with US$23.1 billion, South Korea is third, Japan is fourth and the EU is the fifth largest import partner of Vietnam.

===External debt, foreign aid and foreign investment===

In 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.

From 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. In 2003, new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and construction. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the Japan External Trade Organization of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International&#x27;s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004. A study was conducted to examine the effect foreign investment had on corruption in Vietnam. The study concluded that the propensity of foreign firms to bribe at entry is higher in restricted sectors. Also, the removal of investment restrictions leads to reductions in bribery as a result of more Foreign Investment Enterprises, and consequently more competition entering that sector.

The World Bank&#x27;s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam&#x27;s transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and sustainable development and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of official development assistance (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of ODA.

Pledged foreign direct investment was US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record US$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008. Mergers and acquisitions have gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy, especially after 2005.

In 2023, Vietnam realised foreign direct investment in the amount of US$23.2 billion and recorded a further US$36.6 billion in registered FDI commitments.

==Economic development strategy==
===Guiding principle===
====Industrialization and Modernization (IM)====
&quot;Industrialization and modernization is a process of fundamental and all-rounded change of production, business, services and social and economic management from the predominant use of artisanal labor to a predominant use of labor power with technology, methods and ways of working that are advanced, modern and rely upon the development of industry and scientific – technical progress to create high labor productivity. So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country […]&quot;

- 7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)

====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====
&quot;The nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:&quot;
* &quot;It is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system&quot;
* &quot;It is not a free market capitalist economy&quot;
* &quot;It is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors&quot;

- 7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)

===Development strategy===
====Trade liberalization====
Over the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country&#x27;s GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department). Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)

====Domestic reform====
The government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. Between 1981 and 2005, Vietnam created a new intellectual property law that gradually moved away from the Soviet-style concept of collective ownership. A milestone in this evolution was the &quot;Copyright Agreement&quot; that Vietnam concluded with the US in 1997, serving primarily the US interest of preventing Vietnam from becoming an international center for illegal copying. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006. In the World Bank&#x27;s Ease of Doing Business rankings, Vietnam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.

====Human and physical capital investment====
Vietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population – 100 million as of 2024, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35– Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country&#x27;s export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessities like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operations in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam&#x27;s strategic positioning in the eyes of the international business community.

====Sustainable growth====
Economic growth in Vietnam was considered as broadly in line with other developing countries. The Inclusive Development Index by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world&#x27;s most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011–2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.

In 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the &quot;One Strategic Plan&quot;, integrating the SDGs with the nation&#x27;s Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.

<text>The People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), officially the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army (VPA; , , ), also recognized as the Vietnamese Army (), the People&#x27;s Army () or colloquially the Troops ( ), is the national military force of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the armed wing of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The PAVN is the backbone component of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Armed Forces and includes: Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, Border Guard and Coast Guard. Vietnam does not have a separate and formally-structured Ground Force or Army service. Instead, all ground troops, army corps, military districts and special forces are designated under the umbrella term [[combined arms]] () and are belonged to the Ministry of National Defence, directly under the command of the CPV Central Military Commission, the Minister of National Defence, and the General Staff of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army. The military flag of the PAVN is the National flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam defaced with the motto &quot;Quyết thắng (Determination to win)&quot; added in yellow at the top left (or by the side of the flagpole).

During the French Indochina War (1946–1954), the PAVN was often referred to as the Việt Minh. In the context of the Vietnam War (1955–1975), the army was referred to by its opposition forces as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA; ), serving as the military force of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This allowed writers, the U.S. military, and the general public, to distinguish northern communists from the southern communists, called Viet Cong (VC), or more formally the National Liberation Front. However, both groups ultimately worked under the same command structure. The Viet Cong had its own military forces called the Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV). It was practically considered a branch of the PAVN by the North Vietnamese. In 1976, following the political reunification of Vietnam, LASV was officially disbanded and merged into the so-called NVA to form the existing incarnation of PAVN, serving as the national military of the unified state of Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

==History==

===Before 1945===

The first historical record of Vietnamese military history dates back to the era of Hồng Bàng, the first recorded state in ancient Vietnam to have assembled military force. Since then, military plays a crucial role in developing Vietnamese history due to its turbulent history of wars against China, Champa, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.

The Southern expansion of Vietnam resulted in the destruction of Champa as an independent nation to a level that it did not exist anymore; total destruction of Luang Prabang; the decline of Cambodia which resulted in Vietnam&#x27;s annexation of Mekong Delta and wars against Siam. In most of its history, the Royal Vietnamese Armed Forces was often regarded to be one of the most professional, battle-hardened and heavily trained armies in Southeast Asia as well as Asia in a large extent.

===Establishment===

The PAVN was first conceived in September 1944 at the first Revolutionary Party Military Conference as the Information, Communication and Education Unit of the Liberation Army (alternatively translated as the Vietnam Information, Communication and Education Liberation Army, ) to educate, recruit and mobilise the Vietnamese to create a main force to drive the French colonial and Japanese occupiers from Vietnam. Under the guidelines of Hồ Chí Minh, Võ Nguyên Giáp was given the task of establishing the brigades and the Propaganda Unit of the Liberation Army came into existence on 22 December 1944. The first formation was made up of thirty-one men and three women, armed with two revolvers, seventeen rifles, one light machine gun, and fourteen breech-loading flintlocks. It fought the PAVN&#x27;s first ever engagement at the Battles of Khai Phat and Na Ngan against French soldiers in late 1944. The United States&#x27; OSS agents, led by Archimedes Patti – who was sometimes referred as the first instructor of the PAVN due to his role - had provided ammunitions as well as logistic intelligence and equipment. They also helped train these soldiers, who formed the backbone of the Vietnamese military to successfully fight the Japanese and other opponents. For instance, the PAVN&#x27;s July 19, 1945 attack at Tam Dao internment camp in Tonkin saw 500 soldiers kill fifty Japanese soldiers and officials, freeing French civilian captives and escorting them to the Chinese border. The PAVN also fought the Japanese 21st Division in Thai Nguyen that year, and regularly raided rice storehouses to alleviate an ongoing famine.

There was another separate communist army called the National Salvation Army (&quot;Cứu quốc quân&quot;) which was founded and commanded by Chu Văn Tấn on 23/2/1941.

On 15/5/1945 the Propaganda Liberation Army merged with the National Salvation Army into the Vietnam Liberation Army (&quot;Việt Nam Giải phóng Quân&quot;) on 15 May 1945. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed in Hanoi by Ho Chi Minh and Vietminh on 2 September 1945. Then in September, the army was renamed the Vietnam National Defence Force (&quot;Việt Nam Vệ quốc Đoàn&quot;). At this point, it had about 1,000 soldiers. On 22 May 1946, the army was called the National Army of Vietnam (&quot;Quân đội Quốc gia Việt Nam&quot;, not to be confused with the opposite Vietnamese National Army of the France-associated State of Vietnam which had a synonymous English name and exactly the same Vietnamese name). Lastly, in 1950, it officially became the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (or Vietnam People&#x27;s Army, &quot;Quân đội Nhân dân Việt Nam&quot;).

Võ Nguyên Giáp went on to become the first full general of the PAVN on 28 May 1948, and famous for leading the PAVN in victory over French forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and being in overall command against U.S. backed South Vietnam at the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.

===French Indochina War===
On 7 January 1947, its first regiment, the 102nd &#x27;Capital&#x27; Regiment, was created for operations around Hanoi. Over the next two years, the first division, the 308th Division, later well known as the Pioneer Division, was formed from the 88th Tu Vu Regiment and the 102nd Capital Regiment. By late 1950 the 308th Division had a full three infantry regiments, when it was supplemented by the 36th Regiment. At that time, the 308th Division was also backed by the 11th Battalion that later became the main force of the 312th Division. In late 1951, after launching three campaigns against three French strongpoints in the Red River Delta, the PAVN refocused on building up its ground forces further, with five new divisions, each of 10–15,000 men, created: the 304th Glory Division at Thanh Hóa, the 312th Victory Division in Vinh Phuc, the 316th Bong Lau Division in the northwest border region, the 320th Delta Division in the north Red River Delta, the 325th Binh Tri Thien Division in Binh Tri Thien province. Also in 1951, the first artillery Division, the 351st Division was formed, and later, before Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, for the first time in history, it was equipped with 24 captured 105mm US howitzers supplied by the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army. The first six divisions (308th, 304th, 312th, 316th, 320th, 325th) became known as the original PAVN &#x27;Steel and Iron&#x27; divisions. In 1954, four of these divisions (the 308th, 304th, 312nd, 316th, supported by the 351st Division&#x27;s captured US howitzers) defeated the French Union forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, ending 83 years of French rule in Indochina.

The French Foreign Legion had been deployed to combat the Vietnamese insurgency during the First Indochina War. However, some of the legionnaires, such as Stefan Kubiak, deserted after witnessing torture of Vietnamese peasants at the hands of French troops and began fighting for the Việt Minh, volunteering to join the PAVN.

===Vietnam War===


Soon after the 1954 Geneva Accords, the 330th and 338th Divisions were formed by southern Viet Minh members who had moved north in conformity with that agreement, and by 1955, six more divisions were formed: the 328th, 332nd and 350th in the north of the North Vietnam, the 305th and the 324th near the DMZ, and the 335 Division of soldiers repatriated from Laos. In 1957, the theatres of the war with the French were reorganised as the first five military regions, and in the next two years, several divisions were reduced to brigade size to meet the manpower requirements of collective farms.

By 1958, it was becoming increasingly clear that the South Vietnamese government was solidifying its position as an independent republic under Ngô Đình Diệm, who staunchly opposed the terms of the Geneva Accords, which required a national referendum on unification of north and south Vietnam under a single national government. North Vietnam prepared to settle the issue of unification by force.

In May 1959, the first major steps to prepare infiltration routes into South Vietnam were taken; Group 559 was established, a logistical unit charged with establishing routes into the south via Laos and Cambodia, which later became famous as the Ho Chi Minh trail. At about the same time, Group 579 was created as its maritime counterpart to transport supplies into the South by sea. Most of the early infiltrators were members of the 338th Division, former southerners who had been settled at Xuan Mai from 1954 onwards.

Regular formations were sent to South Vietnam from 1965 onwards; the 325th Division&#x27;s 101B Regiment and the 66th Regiment of the 304th Division met U.S. forces on a large scale, a first for the PAVN, at the Battle of Ia Drang in November 1965. The 308th Division&#x27;s 88A Regiment, the 312th Division&#x27;s 141A, 141B, 165A, 209A, the 316th Division&#x27;s 174A, the 325th Division&#x27;s 95A, 95B, the 320A Division also faced the U.S. forces which included the 1st Cavalry Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the 4th Infantry Division, the 1st Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division. Many of those formations later became main forces of the 3rd Division (Yellow Star Division) in Binh Dinh (1965), the 5th Division (1966) of 7th Military Zone (Capital Tactical Area of ARVN), the 7th (created by 141st and 209th Regiments originated in the 312th Division in 1966) and 9th Divisions (first Division of National Liberation Front of Vietnam in 1965 in Mekong Delta), the 10th Dakto Division in Dakto – Central Highlands in 1972.

On 20 December 1960, anti-government forces in South Vietnam joined to form a united front called National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (&quot;Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng Miền Nam Việt Nam&quot;) or simply known as the Vietcong in the United States. On 15 December 1961, the NLF established its own military called Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV) to fight against the American supported Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The LASV was controlled and equipped by the PAVN.

General Trần Văn Trà, one-time commander of the B2 Front (Saigon) HQ confirms that even though the PAVN and the LASV were confident in their ability to defeat the regular ARVN forces, U.S. intervention in Vietnam forced them to reconsider their operations. The decision was made to continue to pursue &quot;main force&quot; engagements even though &quot;there were others in the South – they were not military people – who wanted to go back to guerrilla war,&quot; but the strategic aims were adjusted to meet the new reality.

We had to change our plan and make it different from when we fought the Saigon regime, because we now had to fight two adversaries — the United States and South Vietnam. We understood that the U.S. Army was superior to our own logistically, in weapons and in all things. So strategically we did not hope to defeat the U.S. Army completely. Our intentions were to fight a long time and cause heavy casualties to the United States, so the United States would see that the war was unwinnable and would leave.

During the Vietnamese Lunar New Year Tết holiday starting on 30 January 1968, the PAVN/VC launched a general offensive in more than 60 cities and towns throughout south of Vietnam against the US Army and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), beginning with operations in the border region to try and draw US forces and ARVN troops out of the major cities. In coordinated attacks, the U.S Embassy in Saigon, Presidential Palace, Headquarters of the Joint General Staff and Republic of Vietnam Navy, TV and Radio Stations, Tan Son Nhat Air Base in Saigon were attacked by commando forces known as &quot;đặc công&quot;. This offensive became known as the &quot;Tet Offensive&quot;. The PAVN sustained heavy losses of its main forces in southern military zones. Some of its regular forces and command structure had to escape to Laos and Cambodia to avoid counterattacks from US forces and ARVN, while local guerrillas forces and political organisations in South Vietnam were exposed and had a hard time remaining within the Mekong Delta area due to the extensive use of the Phoenix Program.

Although the PAVN lost militarily to the US forces and ARVN in the south, the political impact of the war in the United States was strong. Public demonstrations increased in ferocity and quantity after the Tet Offensive. During 1970, the 5th, 7th and 9th Divisions fought in Cambodia against U.S., ARVN, and Cambodian Khmer National Armed Forces but they had gained new allies: the Khmer Rouge and guerrilla fighters supporting deposed Prime Minister Sihanouk. In 1975 the PAVN were successful in aiding the Khmer Rouge in toppling Lon Nol&#x27;s U.S.-backed regime, despite heavy US bombing.

After the withdrawal of most U.S. combat forces from Indochina because of the Vietnamization strategy, the PAVN launched the ill-fated Easter Offensive in 1972. Although successful at the beginning, the South Vietnamese repulsed the main assaults with U.S. air support. Still North Vietnam retained some South Vietnamese territory.

Nearly two years after the full U.S. withdrawal from Indochina in accordance with the terms of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the PAVN launched a Spring offensive aimed at overthrowing the South Vietnamese government and uniting Vietnam under communist rule. Without direct support of the U.S., and suffering from stresses caused by dwindling aid, the ARVN was ill-prepared to confront the highly motivated PAVN, and despite the on paper superiority of the ARVN, the PAVN quickly secured victory within two months and captured Saigon on 30 April 1975, ending the 20 year Vietnam war.

After national reunification, the LASV was officially merged into PAVN on 2 July 1976.

===Sino-Vietnamese conflicts (1975–1991)===

Towards the second half of the 20th century the armed forces of Vietnam would participate in organised incursions to protect its citizens and allies against aggressive military factions in the neighbouring Indochinese countries of Laos and Cambodia, and the defensive border wars with China.
* The PAVN had forces in Laos to secure the Ho Chi Minh trail and to militarily support the Pathet Lao. In 1975 the Pathet Lao and PAVN forces succeeded in toppling the Royal Laotian regime and installing a new, and pro-Hanoi government, the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic, that rules Laos to this day.
* Parts of Sihanouk&#x27;s neutral Cambodia were occupied by troops as well. A pro US coup led by Lon Nol in 1970 led to the foundation pro-US Khmer Republic state. This marked the beginning of the Cambodian Civil War. The PAVN aided Khmer Rouge forces in toppling Lon Nol&#x27;s government in 1975. In 1978, along with the FUNSK Cambodian Salvation Front, the Vietnamese and Ex-Khmer Rouge forces succeeded in toppling Pol Pot&#x27;s Democratic Kampuchea regime and installing a new government, the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea.
* During the Sino-Vietnamese War and the Sino-Vietnamese conflicts (1979–1991), Vietnamese forces would conduct cross-border raids into Chinese territory to destroy artillery ammunition. This greatly contributed to the outcome of the Sino-Vietnamese War, as the Chinese forces ran out of ammunition already at an early stage and had to call in reinforcements.
* While occupying Cambodia, Vietnam launched several armed incursions into Thailand in pursuit of Cambodian guerrillas that had taken refuge on the Thai side of the border.

==Modern deployment ==

The PAVN has been actively involved in Vietnam&#x27;s workforce to develop the economy of Vietnam by co-ordinating national defence. It has regularly sent troops to aid with natural disasters such as flooding, landslides etc. The PAVN is also involved in such areas as industry, agriculture, forestry, fishery and telecommunications. The PAVN has numerous small firms which have become quite profitable in recent years. However, recent decrees have effectively prohibited the commercialisation of the military. Conscription is in place for theoretically every male, age 18 to 25 years old, with the exception of the disabled and men who attended universities right after high school.

===International presence &amp; operations===

The Foreign Relations Department of the Ministry of National Defence organises international operations of the PAVN.

Apart from its occupation of half of the disputed Spratly Islands, which have been claimed as Vietnamese territory since the 17th century, Vietnam has not officially had forces stationed internationally since its withdrawal from Cambodia and Laos in early 1990.

==== Allegations of Vietnamese assistance for overseas leftist insurgencies ====
The effectiveness of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam Special Operation Forces during the Vietnam War saw them instruct various other countries and Marxist rebel groups. From the 1970s to 1990s, they covertly provided training at the PAVN Sapper Training School in via Vietnamese sapper advisors assigned to the Cuban Army&#x27;s Sapper School in Cuba, and, during the 1980s, by a secret Vietnamese sapper training team stationed in Nicaragua. In addition to training Cambodian, Laotian, Soviet, and Cuban military personnel, their publications revealed that among the foreign revolutionary forces that received training in sapper tactics, bomb-making, and the use of weapons and explosives, were members of the Marxist El Salvadoran FMLN (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front), the Chilean MIR (Movement of the Revolutionary Left) fighting against the dictatorial regime of Augusto Pinochet, as well as the Colombian FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) movement, a Marxist guerilla group.

==== Allegations of Vietnamese intervention in Lao security crises ====

The Center for Public Policy Analysis and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as Laotian and Hmong human rights organisations, including the Lao Human Rights Council, Inc. and the United League for Democracy in Laos, Inc., have provided evidence that since the end of the Vietnam War, significant numbers of Vietnamese military and security forces continue to be sent to Laos, on a repeated basis, to quell and suppress Laotian political and religious dissident and opposition groups including the peaceful 1999 Lao Students for Democracy protest in Vientiane in 1999 and the Hmong rebellion. In late November 2009, shortly before the start of the 2009 Southeast Asian Games in Vientiane, the PAVN undertook a major troop surge in key rural and mountainous provinces in Laos where Lao and Hmong civilians and religious believers, including Christians, have sought sanctuary.

==== Modern-era peacekeeping operations ====

In 2014, Vietnam had requested to join the United Nations peacekeeping force, which was later approved. The first Vietnamese UN peacekeeping officers were sent to South Sudan, marked the first involvement of Vietnam into a United Nations&#x27; mission abroad. Vietnamese peacekeepers were also sent to the Central African Republic.

From 2022, Vietnam has deployed its first military engineer unit to the peacekeeping missions in Abyei.

==== 2023 Turkish-Syrian earthquake ====

As an effort to help Turkey overcome the consequences of the 2023 earthquake, PAVN has sent 76 servicemen of the Border Guard, Army Medic, and Engineering Corps (alongside personnel from Public Security) to participate in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief including search-and-rescue missions.

This is the first time ever that Vietnam has officially deployed and engaged in an overseas search and rescue campaign.

==Organisation==

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces is the President of Vietnam, though this position is virtually nominal and a majority of political power over the military is assumed by the Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam. The secretary of Central Military Commission (usually the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam) is the de facto commander and now is Tô Lâm.

The Minister of National Defence oversees operations of the Ministry of Defence, and the PAVN. He also oversees such agencies as the General Staff and the General Department of Logistics. However, military policy is ultimately directed by the Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam.

* Ministry of National Defence: is the lead organisation, highest command and management of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army.
* General Staff: is leading agency all levels of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army, command all of the armed forces, which functions to ensure combat readiness of the armed forces and manage all military activities in peace and war.
* General Political Department: is the agency in charge of Communist Party affairs – political work within PAVN, which operates under the direct leadership of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Central Military Party Committee.
* General Department of Defence Intelligence: is an intelligence agency of the Vietnamese government and military.
* General Department of Logistics: is the agency in charge to ensure logistical support to units of the People&#x27;s Army.
* General Department of Technology: is the agency in charge to ensure equipped technical means of war for the army and each unit.
* General Department of Defence Industry (commercially branded as the Vietnam Defence Industry): is the agency responsible for the development of the Vietnamese national defense industry in support of the missions of the PAVN.
==Service branches==
The Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army is subdivided into the following service branches:
*Vietnam People&#x27;s Ground Force (unofficial)
(Lục quân Nhân dân Việt Nam)
*Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force
(Không quân Nhân dân Việt Nam)
*Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy
(Hải quân Nhân dân Việt Nam)
*Vietnam Border Guard
(Bộ đội Biên phòng Việt Nam)
*Vietnam Coast Guard
(Cảnh sát biển Việt Nam)
*Cyberspace Operations Command
(Bộ Tư lệnh Tác chiến không gian mạng)
*President Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum Defence Force
(Bộ Tư lệnh Bảo vệ Lăng
Chủ tịch Hồ Chí Minh)

The People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam composes of the standing (or regular) forces and the reserve forces. The standing forces include the main forces and the local forces. During peacetime, the standing forces are minimised in number, and kept combat-ready by regular physical and weapons training, and stock maintenance.

===Vietnam People&#x27;s Ground Force===
Within PAVN the Ground Force have not been established as a separate full Service Command, thus &quot;all of the ground troops, army corps, military districts and the specialised arms&quot; are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence, under the direct command of the General Staff, who serves as its &quot;de facto&quot; commander. 

====Arm badges====
====Military regions====
The following military regions are under the direct control of the General Staff and the Ministry of Defence:

* Hanoi Capital City Special High Command (Bộ Tư lệnh Thủ đô Hà Nội): special command tasked for the defense of the Hanoi Capital Region. Headquarters: Hanoi
* 1st Military Region (Quân khu 1): responsible for the North East of Vietnam. Headquarters: Thái Nguyên
* 2nd Military Region (Quân khu 2): responsible for the North West of Vietnam. Headquarters: Việt Trì, Phú Thọ
* 3rd Military Region (Quân khu 3): responsible for the defense of the Red River Delta (except Hanoi Capital Region). Headquarters: Hai Phong
* 4th Military Region (Quân khu 4): responsible for North Central Vietnam. Headquarters: Vinh, Nghệ An province
* 5th Military Region (Quân khu 5): responsible for South Central Vietnam including the Central Highlands and Southern Central coastal provinces. Headquarters: Da Nang
* 7th Military Region (Quân khu 7): responsible for Southeast Vietnam. Headquarters: Ho Chi Minh City
* 9th Military Region (Quân khu 9): responsible for the Mekong Delta. Headquarters: Cần Thơ

====Main forces====


The Main Force of the PAVN and its People&#x27;s Ground Forces consists of combat ready troops, as well as support units such as educational institutions for logistics, officer training, and technical training. In 1991, Conboy et al. stated that the PAVN Ground Force had four &#x27;Strategic Army Corps&#x27; in the early 1990s, numbering 1–4, from north to south. 1st Corps, located in the Red River Delta region, consisted of the 308th (one of the six original &#x27;Steel and Iron&#x27; divisions) and 312th Divisions, and the 309th Infantry Regiment. The other three corps, 2 SAC, 3 SAC, and 4 SAC, were further south, with 4th Corps, in Southern Vietnam, consisting of two former LASV divisions, the 7th and 9th.

From 2014 to 2016, the IISS Military Balance attributed the Vietnamese ground forces with an estimated 412,000 personnel. Formations, according to the IISS, include 8 military regions, 4 corps headquarters, 1 special forces airborne brigade, 6 armoured brigades and 3 armoured regiments, two mechanised infantry divisions, and 23 active infantry divisions plus another 9 reserve ones.

Combat support formations include 13 artillery brigades and one artillery regiment, 11 air defence brigades, 10 engineers brigades, 1 electronic warfare unit, 3 signals brigades and 2 signals regiment.

Combat service support formations include 9 economic construction divisions, 1 logistical regiment, 1 medical unit and 1 training regiment. Ross wrote in 1984 that economic construction division &quot;are composed of regular troops that are fully trained and armed, and reportedly they are subordinate to their own directorate in the Ministry of Defense. They have specific military missions; however, they are also entrusted with economic tasks such as food production or construction work. They are composed partially of older veterans.&quot;
Ross also cited 1980s sources saying that economic construction divisions each had a strength of about 3,500.

In 2017, the listing was amended, with the addition of a single Short-range ballistic missile brigade. The ground forces according to the IISS, hold Scud-B/C SRBMs.

 12th Corps

First organised on 21 November 2023, the 12th Corps was created by merging all of the units from the former 1st Corps and the 2nd Corps. It is stationed in Tam Điệp District, Ninh Bình.

 34th Corps

First organised on 10 December 2024, the 34th Corps was created by merging all of the units from the former 3rd Corps and the 4th Corps. Stationed in Pleiku, Gia Lai.

====Local forces====
Local forces are an entity of the PAVN that, together with the militia and &quot;self-defence forces&quot;, act on the local level in protection of people and local authorities. While the local forces are regular VPA forces, the people&#x27;s militia consists of rural civilians, and the people&#x27;s self-defence forces consist of civilians who live in urban areas and/or work in large groups, such as at construction sites or farms. The current number stands at 3–4 million reservists and militia personnel combined. They serve as force multipliers to the PAVN and Public Security during wartime and peacetime contingencies.

===Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy===
===Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force===
===Vietnam Border Guard===
=== Vietnam Coast Guard ===
==Ranks and insignia==
=== Commissioned officer ranks ===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
=== Other ranks ===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Equipment==
From the 1960s to 1975 the Soviet Union, along with some smaller Eastern Bloc countries, was the main supplier of military hardware to North Vietnam. After the latter&#x27;s victory in the war, it remained the main supplier of equipment to Vietnam. The United States had been the primary supplier of equipment to South Vietnam; much of the equipment left by the U.S. Army and the ARVN came under control of the re-unified Vietnamese government. The PAVN captured large numbers of ARVN weapons on 30 April 1975 after Saigon was captured.

Russia remains the largest arms-supplier for Vietnam; even after 1986, there were also increasing arms sales from other nations, notably from India, Turkey, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and France. In 2016, President Barack Obama announced the lifting of the lethal weapons embargo on Vietnam, which has increased Vietnamese military equipment choices from other countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries, which could enable a faster modernization of the Vietnamese military. Since 2018, the United States has begun to provide warships for Vietnam Coast Guard as part of the military cooperation between two states, the first of these ships arrived in 2021.

Despite Russia remaining Vietnam&#x27;s largest weapon supplier, increasing cooperation with Israel has resulted in the development of Vietnamese weaponry with a strong mixture of Russian and Israeli weapons. For examples, the STV rifles are three Vietnam-made indigenous service rifles modeled after the Galil ACE of Israel. Many new Vietnamese weapons, armor, and equipment are also greatly influenced by Israeli military doctrines, due to Vietnam&#x27;s long and problematic relations with most of its neighbors.

<text>As of September 2024, Vietnam (officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam) maintains diplomatic relationships with 191 UN member states, State of Palestine and Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. 

Since the end of the Vietnam War and the unification of Vietnam, Vietnam&#x27;s foreign policy has reflected a tension between two choices: &quot;to reject the Western-led world order and oppose Western influence, or to accept the Western-led world order and adapt Western influence.&quot; Over time, Vietnam has become more engaged in the international community. Vietnam has shifted from a fierce opponent of the United States to a discreet ally of the United States. Vietnam has for decades consistently sought to deny Chinese regional dominance. 

==History==
===Feudal Vietnam===
Vietnam has a history stretching back more than 20,000 years. In its early history, Vietnam tried to maintain good relations with its neighbours. From the Hồng Bàng dynasty to many feudal dynasties like the Ngô, Đinh, Early Lê, Lý, Trần, Later Lê, Tây Sơn and Nguyễn, Vietnam&#x27;s main diplomatic relationships were with neighboring Imperial China, Kingdom of Champa, Khmer Empire, Lan Xang kingdom and Siam. Later trading relationship were established with European Countries (such as through Dutch East India company) and Japan.

===Post-World War II===
+ Period 1945-1946: After the surrender of Japan, Both British and Chinese Kuomintang armies came into Vietnam territory to take the Japanese imperial army out of Indochina. The government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam decided to have the peace agreement with Chiang Kai-shek of Kuomintang that stationed in the north Vietnam to let them pay attention to fight the French in the south. After that, Vietnam signed the peace treaty with France in 6/3/1946.
+ Period 1947-1954 : Vietnam started to expand their foreign relation with the other countries in the world. In January, 1950, the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union were the first two countries to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Later, alliances were formed with Cambodia and Laos to make anti-French campaigns, building the friendship with the anti-colonial countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and India.

===Cold War Era===
====Vietnam War====

During the Vietnam War (1959–75), North Vietnam balanced relations with its two major allies, the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In 1964, Zhou Enlai, worried about the escalation of U.S. forces in South Vietnam, made an informal agreement with the North. The agreement stipulated that if U.S. and South Vietnamese forces invaded North Vietnam, the Chinese would respond by loaning pilots to the North. During the invasion, Mao Zedong failed to send as many trained pilots as he promised. As a result, the North became more reliant on the Soviet Union for its defense.
By 1975, tension began to grow as Beijing increasingly viewed Vietnam as a potential Soviet instrument to encircle China. Meanwhile, Beijing&#x27;s increasing support for Cambodia&#x27;s Khmer Rouge sparked Vietnamese suspicions of China&#x27;s motives.

Vietnamese-Chinese relations deteriorated significantly after Hanoi instituted a ban in March 1978 on private trade, a move that particularly affected the Sino-Vietnamese sector of the population. Following Vietnam&#x27;s December 1978 invasion of Cambodia, China launched a retaliatory invasion of Vietnam&#x27;s northern border region. Faced with severance of Chinese aid and strained international relations, Vietnam established even closer ties with the Soviet Union and its allies in the Comecon member states. Throughout the 1980s, Vietnam received nearly US$3 billion a year in economic and military aid from the Soviet Union and conducted most of its trade with the U.S.S.R. and Comecon countries. Soviet and Eastern bloc economic aid, however, ceased after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

==Đổi mới (Reform)==
Vietnam didn&#x27;t begin to emerge from international isolation until it withdrew its troops from Cambodia in 1989. Within months of the 1991 Paris Agreements, Vietnam established diplomatic and economic relations with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states and also with most countries of Western Europe and Asia&#x27;s Far East. China re-established full diplomatic ties with Vietnam in 1991. The two nations concluded a land border demarcation agreement in 1999. In 1995, the US and Vietnam re-established diplomatic ties. United States–Vietnam relations improved in August 1995, when both nations upgraded their liaison offices opened during January 1995 to embassy status, with the United States later opening a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City, and Vietnam opening a consulate in San Francisco.

Full diplomatic relations were restored with New Zealand who opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995, while Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003. Pakistan reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000. Vietnam also reopened its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005.

In the past decade, Vietnam has recognized the importance of growing global economic interdependence and has made concerted efforts to adjust its foreign relations to reflect the evolving international economic and political situation in Southeast Asia. The country has begun to integrate itself into the regional and global economy by joining international organizations. Vietnam has stepped up its efforts to attract foreign capital from the West and regularize relations with the world financial system. In the 1990s, following the lifting of the US veto on multilateral loans to the country, Vietnam became a member of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Asian Development Bank. The country has expanded trade with its East Asian neighbors as well as with countries in Western Europe and North America. Of particular significance was Vietnam&#x27;s acceptance into ASEAN in July 1995. Vietnam joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in November 1998 and also hosted the ASEAN summit the following month. In 2005, Vietnam attended the inaugural East Asia Summit. Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization in November 2006.

==Current issues==

In 2011 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, at the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, released an official statement about Vietnam&#x27;s foreign policy and a section of the statement stated: &quot;Vietnam is a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community, actively taking part in international and regional cooperation processes. Deepen, stabilize and sustain established international relations. Develop relations with countries and territories in the world, as well as international organizations, while showing: respect for each other&#x27;s independence; sovereignty and territorial integrity; non-interference in each other&#x27;s international affairs; non-use or threat of force; settlement of disagreements and disputes by means of peaceful negotiations; mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.&quot;

While Vietnam has remained relatively conflict-free since its Cambodia days, tensions have arisen in the past between Vietnam and its neighbors, especially in the case of China since both nations assert claims to the Spratly and Paracel Islands - the two archipelagos in a potentially oil-rich area of the South China Sea. Conflicting claims have produced over the years small scale armed altercations in the area. In 1988, more than 70 Vietnamese troops were killed during a confrontation with Chinese forces, when China occupied several islands under Vietnamese control in the Spratly Islands. China&#x27;s assertion of control over the Spratly Islands and the entire South China Sea has elicited concern from Vietnam and its Southeast Asia neighbors. The territorial border between the two countries is being definitively mapped pursuant to a Land Border Agreement signed in December 1999, and an Agreement on Borders in the Gulf of Tonkin signed in December 2000. Vietnam and Russia declared a strategic partnership in March 2001 during the first visit ever to Hanoi of a Russian head of state, largely as an attempt to counterbalance China&#x27;s growing profile in Southeast Asia.

Disputes – international: maritime boundary with Cambodia not defined; involved in a complex dispute over the Spratly - Paracel Islands with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), Malaysia, Philippines, and possibly Brunei; maritime boundary with Thailand resolved in August 1997; maritime boundary dispute with the PRC in the Gulf of Tonkin resolved in 2000; Paracel Islands occupied by the PRC since 1974; offshore islands and sections of boundary with Cambodia are in dispute; agreement on land border with the People&#x27;s Republic of China was signed in December 1999.

Illicit drugs: minor producer of opium poppy with 21 km2 cultivated in 1999, capable of producing 11 metric tons of opium; probably minor transit point for Southeast Asian heroin destined for the US and Europe; growing opium/heroin addiction; possible small-scale heroin production

<doc id="32388" wikidata="Q2132" url="?curid=32388" title="Victoria, British Columbia">
<text>Victoria is the capital city of the Canadian province of British Columbia, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island off Canada&#x27;s Pacific coast. The city has a population of 91,867, and the Greater Victoria area has a population of 397,237. The city of Victoria is the seventh most densely populated city in Canada with .

Victoria is the southernmost major city in Western Canada and is about southwest from British Columbia&#x27;s largest city of Vancouver on the mainland. The city is about from Seattle by airplane, seaplane, ferry, or the Victoria Clipper passenger-only ferry, and from Port Angeles, Washington, by ferry across the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Named for Queen Victoria, the city is one of the oldest in the Pacific Northwest, with British settlement beginning in 1843. The city has retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, the Parliament Buildings (finished in 1897 and home of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia) and the Empress Hotel (opened in 1908). The city&#x27;s Chinatown is the second oldest in North America, after San Francisco. The region&#x27;s Coast Salish First Nations peoples established communities in the area long before European settlement, which had large populations at the time of European exploration.

Known as &quot;the Garden City&quot;, Victoria is an attractive city and a popular tourism destination and has a regional technology sector that has risen to be its largest revenue-generating private industry. In 2019, Victoria was in the top 20 world cities for quality of life, according to Numbeo.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of European navigators in the late 1700s, the Greater Victoria area was home to several communities of Coast Salish peoples, including the Lək̓ʷəŋən (Lekwungen) and W̱SÁNEĆ (Saanich) peoples. 

===Early European exploration (1770–1871)===
The Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of Juan Pérez in 1774, and of James Cook in 1778. Although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not explored until 1790, Spanish sailors visited Esquimalt Harbour (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.

In 1841, James Douglas was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. Upon the recommendation by George Simpson a new more northerly post should be built in case Fort Vancouver fell into American hands (see Oregon boundary dispute). Douglas founded Fort Victoria on the site of present-day Victoria in anticipation of the outcome of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, extending the British North America/United States border along the 49th parallel from the Rockies to the Strait of Georgia.

Erected in 1843 as a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post on a site originally called meaning &quot;rush of water&quot;. Known briefly as &quot;Fort Albert&quot;, the settlement was renamed Fort Victoria in November 1843, in honour of Queen Victoria. The Songhees established a village across the harbour from the fort. The Songhees&#x27; village was later moved north of Esquimalt in 1911.The crown colony was established in 1849. Between 1850–1854, a series of treaty agreements known as the Douglas Treaties were made with indigenous communities to purchase certain plots of land in exchange for goods. These agreements contributed to a town being laid out on the site and made the capital of the colony, though controversy has followed about the ethical negotiation and upholding of rights by the colonial government. The superintendent of the fort, Chief Factor James Douglas, was made the second governor of the Vancouver Island Colony (Richard Blanshard was first governor, Arthur Edward Kennedy was third and last governor), and would be the leading figure in the early development of the city until his retirement in 1864.

When news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached San Francisco in 1858, Victoria became the port, supply base, and outfitting centre for miners on their way to the Fraser Canyon gold fields, mushrooming from a population of 300 to over 5,000 within a few days. Victoria was incorporated as a city in 1862. In 1862 Victoria was the epicentre of the 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic which devastated First Nations, killing about two-thirds of all natives in British Columbia. In 1865, the North Pacific home of the Royal Navy was established in Esquimalt and today is Canada&#x27;s Pacific coast naval base. In 1866 when the island was politically united with the mainland, Victoria was designated the capital of the new united colony instead of New Westminster – an unpopular move on the Mainland – and became the provincial capital when British Columbia joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871.

===Modern history (1871–present)===
In the latter half of the 19th century, the Port of Victoria became one of North America&#x27;s largest importers of opium, serving the opium trade from Hong Kong and distribution into North America. Opium trade was legal and unregulated until 1865, when the legislature issued licences and levied duties on its import and sale. The opium trade was banned in 1908.

In 1886, with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway terminus on Burrard Inlet, Victoria&#x27;s position as the commercial centre of British Columbia was irrevocably lost to the city of Vancouver. The city subsequently began cultivating an image of genteel civility within its natural setting, aided by the impressions of visitors such as Rudyard Kipling, the opening of the popular Butchart Gardens in 1904 and the construction of the Empress Hotel by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1908. Robert Dunsmuir, a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed Craigdarroch Castle in the Rockland area, near the official residence of the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor. His son, James Dunsmuir, became Premier and subsequently Lieutenant Governor of the province and built his own grand residence at Hatley Park (used for several decades as Royal Roads Military College, now civilian Royal Roads University) in the present City of Colwood.

A real-estate and development boom ended just before World War I, leaving Victoria with a large stock of Edwardian public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city&#x27;s character. With the economic crash and an abundance of unmarried men, Victoria became an excellent location for military recruiting. Two militia infantry battalions, the 88th Victoria Fusiliers and the 50th Gordon Highlanders, formed in the immediate pre-war period. Victoria was the home of Sir Arthur Currie. He had been a high-school teacher and real-estate agent prior to the war and was the Commanding Officer of the Gordon Highlanders in the summer of 1914. Before the end of the war he commanded the Canadian Corps. A number of municipalities surrounding Victoria were incorporated during this period, including the Township of Esquimalt, the District of Oak Bay, and several municipalities on the Saanich Peninsula.

Water in Greater Victoria had a reputation for excellent purity, and for several decades in the 20th century there was effective resistance to chlorination. However, drinking water has been chlorinated since March 1944.

Since World War II the Victoria area has seen relatively steady growth, becoming home to two major universities. Since the 1980s the western suburbs have been incorporated as new municipalities, such as Colwood and Langford, which are known collectively as the Western Communities.

Greater Victoria periodically experiences calls for the amalgamation of the thirteen municipal governments within the Capital Regional District. The opponents of amalgamation state that separate governance affords residents a greater deal of local autonomy. The proponents of amalgamation argue it would reduce duplication of services, while allowing for more efficient use of resources and the ability to better handle broad, regional issues and long-term planning.

==Geography==
===Topography===

The landscape of Victoria was formed by volcanism followed by water in various forms. Pleistocene glaciation put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam till. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of sand and gravel. Marine clay settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria&#x27;s soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the British Columbia Coast. Their thick dark topsoils denote a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming prior to urbanization.

===Climate===
Depending on the classification used, Victoria either has a warm-summer Mediterranean or oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Do&quot;); with fresh, dry, sunny summers, and cool, cloudy, rainy winters.

Victoria is farther north than many &quot;cold-winter&quot; cities, such as Ottawa, Quebec City, and Minneapolis. However, westerly winds and Pacific Ocean currents keep Victoria&#x27;s winter temperatures substantially higher, with an average January temperature of (Gonzales) and (University of Victoria) compared to Ottawa, the nation&#x27;s capital, with .

At the Victoria Gonzales weather station, daily temperatures rise above on average less than one day per year and fall below on average only ten nights per year. Victoria has recorded completely freeze-free winter seasons four times (in 1925–26, 1939–40, 1999–2000, and 2002–03). 1999 is the only calendar year on record without a single occurrence of frost. During this time the city went 718 days without freezing, starting on 23 December 1998 and ending 10 December 2000. The second longest frost-free period was a 686-day stretch covering 1925 and 1926, marking the first and last time the city has gone the entire season without dropping below .

During the winter, the average daily high and low temperatures are , respectively. The summer months are also relatively mild, with an average high temperature of and low of , although inland areas often experience warmer daytime highs. The highest temperature ever recorded at Victoria Gonzales was on 28 June 2021; The coldest temperature on record is , first set on 2 December 1941. The average annual temperature varies from a high of set in 2004 to a low of set in 1916.

Due to the rain shadow effect of the nearby Olympic Mountains, Victoria is the driest location on the British Columbia coast and one of the driest in the region. Average precipitation amounts in the Greater Victoria area range from at the Gonzales observatory in the City of Victoria to at the University of Victoria. The Victoria Airport, north of the city, receives about 45% more precipitation than the city proper. Regional average precipitation amounts range from as low as on the north shore of the Olympic Peninsula to in Port Renfrew just away on the more exposed southwest coast of Vancouver Island. Vancouver measures annually and Seattle is at .

One feature of Victoria&#x27;s climate is its distinct dry and rainy seasons. Over 60% of the annual precipitation falls during the four wettest months, November to February at Gonzales Heights. However, at the University of Victoria, approximately north, over 60% of the annual precipitation falls between the four wettest months, October to January. Precipitation in December, the wettest month () is nearly eight times as high as in July, the driest month (). At the University of Victoria the wettest month is November with . Victoria experiences the driest summers in Canada (outside of the extreme northern reaches of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).

Victoria averages just of snow annually, about half that of Vancouver. Roughly one third of winters see virtually no snow, with less than falling during the entire season. When snow does fall, it rarely lasts long on the ground. Victoria averages just two or three days per year with at least of snow on the ground. Every few decades Victoria receives very large snowfalls including the record breaking of snow that fell in December 1996. That amount places Victoria 3rd for biggest snowfall among major cities in Canada.

With 2,193 hours of bright sunshine annually during the last available measurement period, Victoria is effectively tied with Cranbrook as the sunniest city in British Columbia. In July 2013, Victoria received 432.8 hours of bright sunshine, which is the most sunshine ever recorded in any month in British Columbia history.

Victoria&#x27;s equable climate has also added to its reputation as the &quot;City of Gardens&quot;. The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every March, the annual Greater Victoria Flower Count kicks off while the rest of the country and most of the province is still in the dead of winter. 

Due to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, Gulf Islands, and parts of the Lower Mainland and Sunshine Coast) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including &quot;Quercus garryana&quot; (Garry oak), &quot;Arctostaphylos columbiana&quot; (hairy manzanita), and Canada&#x27;s only broad-leaf evergreen tree, &quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot; (Pacific madrone). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico.

Non-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm Trachycarpus fortunei, which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria. One of these Trachycarpus palms stands in front of City Hall.



==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Victoria had a population of 91,867 living in 49,222 of its 53,070 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 85,792. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. Victoria is one of the most gender diverse cities in Canada, with approximately 0.75% of residents identifying as transgender or non-binary in the 2021 Statistics Canada Census of Population.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Victoria CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Victoria is known for its disproportionately large retiree population. Some 23.4 percent of the population of Victoria and its surrounding area are over 65 years of age, which is higher than the overall Canadian distribution of over 65 year-olds in the population (19%).

===Ethnic origins===
Indigenous peoples made up 5 percent of Victoria&#x27;s population in 2021.

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.
* Note: These categories are those used by Statistics Canada.

=== Religion and spirituality ===
According to the 2021 census, the majority of the population of Victoria described themselves as irreligious (63.4%). Over 25% of Victoria residents are Christian, with the second largest religious group being Muslim (1.9%). A similar proportion of residents are Buddhist (1.4%) or Jewish (1.1%). Hinduism, Sikhism and Indigenous Spirituality make up under 1% of other groups.

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s chief industries are technology, tourism, education, shipyards, federal and provincial government administration and services. Other nearby employers include the Canadian Forces (the Township of Esquimalt is the home of the Pacific headquarters of the Royal Canadian Navy), and the University of Victoria (in the municipalities of Oak Bay and Saanich) and Camosun College in Saanich (which have over 33,000 faculty, staff and students combined). Other sectors of the Greater Victoria area economy include: investment and banking, online book publishing, various public and private schools, food products manufacturing, light aircraft manufacturing (in North Saanich), technology products, various high tech firms in pharmaceuticals and computers, engineering, architecture and telecommunications.

===Employment by industry===
The city&#x27;s employment has 164,000 (87%) of workers in the service sector. Top segments include health care and social assistance (28,900; 15.3%), public administration (27,800; 14.7 %), wholesale and retail trade (24,100; 12.7%), professional, scientific and technical services (19,800; 10.4%), educational services (15,000; 7.9%) and accommodation and food services (10,100; 5.3%). The goods-producing sector is dominated by construction (16,000; 8.4%) and manufacturing (6,900; 3.6%).

===Retail===
There are three major shopping malls in the City of Victoria, including the Bay Centre, Hillside Shopping Centre, and Mayfair Shopping Centre. Mayfair, one of the first major shopping centres in Victoria, first opened as an outdoor strip mall on 16 October 1963 with 27 stores. It was built on the site of a former brickyard in the Maywood district, a then-semi-rural area in the northern part of Victoria. Woodward&#x27;s was Mayfair&#x27;s original department store anchor upon the mall&#x27;s opening.

Mayfair was enclosed and renovated into an indoor mall in 1974. The mall underwent three later expansions in 1984 (with the addition of Consumers Distributing), 1985 (expansion of the mall food court) and a major expansion in 1990 that saw the addition of more retail space. The Bay (now Hudson&#x27;s Bay) replaced Woodward&#x27;s as Mayfair&#x27;s department store anchor in 1993 following Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s acquisition of the Woodward&#x27;s chain. The mall was more recently renovated in 2019. Mayfair now offers over 100 stores and services including Hudson&#x27;s Bay. It has of retail space and it also provides customers with rooftop parking.

===Technology industry===
Advanced technology is Victoria&#x27;s largest revenue-producing private industry with $3.15 billion in annual revenues generated by more than 880 tech companies that have over 15,000 direct employees. The annual economic impact of the sector is estimated at more than $4.03 billion per year. With three post-secondary institutions in Saanich, eight federal research labs in the region, and Canada&#x27;s Pacific Navy Base in Esquimalt, Victoria relies heavily upon the neighbouring communities for economic activity and as employment hubs. The region has many of the elements required for a strong technology sector, including Canada&#x27;s highest household internet usage. Over a hundred technology, software and engineering companies have an office in Victoria.

===Tourism===

Victoria is a major tourism destination with over 3.5 million overnight visitors per year who add more than a billion dollars to the local economy. As well, over 500,000 daytime visitors arrive via cruise ships which dock at Ogden Point near the city&#x27;s Inner Harbour. Many whale watching tour companies operate from this harbour due to the whales often present near its coast. The city is also close to Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt, the Canadian Navy&#x27;s primary Pacific Ocean naval base.

Downtown Victoria also serves as Greater Victoria&#x27;s regional downtown, where many night clubs, theatres, restaurants and pubs are clustered, and where many regional public events occur. Canada Day fireworks displays, Symphony Splash, and many other music festivals and cultural events draw tens of thousands of Greater Victorians and visitors to the downtown core. The Rifflandia and Electronic Music Festival are other music events that draw crowds to the downtown core. Victoria relies upon neighbouring communities for many recreational opportunities including ice rinks in Oak Bay and Saanich. Victoria has one small public pool (Crystal Pool) and many residents use larger and newer pool facilities in Oak Bay, and Saanich (Commonwealth Pool and Gordon Head Pool).

The city and metro region has hosted high-profile sports events including the 1994 Commonwealth Games which hosted track events at the Saanich-Oak Bay based University of Victoria and the Saanich Commonwealth Pool, the 2009 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the 2005 Ford World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship tournament, and 2006 Skate Canada. Victoria co-hosted the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup at Royal Athletic Park, and is the venue for the Bastion Square Grand Prix Criterium road cycling race. The city is also a destination for conventions, meetings, and conferences, including a 2007 North Atlantic Treaty Organization military chief of staff meeting held at the Hotel Grand Pacific. Every year, the Swiftsure International Yacht Race attracts boaters from around the world to participate in the boat race in the waters off of Vancouver Island, and the Victoria Dragon Boat Festival brings over 90 teams from around North America. The Tall Ships Festival brings sailing ships to the city harbour. Victoria also hosts the start of the Vic-Maui Yacht Race.

The Port of Victoria consists of three parts, the Outer Harbour, used by deep sea vessels, the Inner and Upper Harbours, used by coastal and industrial traffic. It is protected by a breakwater with a deep and wide opening. The port is a working harbour, tourist attraction and cruise destination. Esquimalt Harbour is also a well-protected harbour with a large graving dock and shipbuilding and repair facilities.

===Homelessness===
A point-in-time homeless count was conducted by volunteers between 11 March and 12 March 2020, that counted at least 1,523 homeless that night. The homeless count is considered an underestimate due to the hidden homeless that may be couch surfing or have found somewhere to stay that is not on the street or homeless shelters. The first homeless count was conducted in January 2005 by the Victoria Cool Aid Society and counted a homeless population of approximately 700 individuals.

Like many west coast cities in North America the homeless population is both concentrated in specific areas (parts of Pandora avenue in Victoria) and is often outside due to milder climates that make homelessness more visible year-round.

The 2020 point-in-time homeless count found 35% respondents identified as being Indigenous. This is over representative in the homeless population as only 4.7% of the overall population of Victoria identify as Indigenous.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many homeless people sheltered in camping tents within the city&#x27;s parks and some roadside greenspaces, including in Beacon Hill Park. In March 2021, city council reinstated a bylaw prohibiting daytime camping in parks, and with support from the provincial government, pledged to find indoor accommodation for all those camping in parks. Homeless campers from parks and other public spaces were housed temporarily in motels, the Save-on-Foods arena and a tiny home village on a portion of the Royal Athletic Park&#x27;s parking lot.

==Arts and culture==

The Victoria Symphony, led by Christian Kluxen, performs at the Royal Theatre and the Farquhar Auditorium of the Saanich-Oak Bay sited University of Victoria from September to May. Every BC Day weekend, the Symphony mounts Symphony Splash, an outdoor event that includes a performance by the orchestra sitting on a barge in Victoria&#x27;s Inner Harbour. Streets in the local area are closed, as each year approximately 40,000 people attend a variety of concerts and events throughout the day. The event culminates with the Symphony&#x27;s evening concert, with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1812 Overture as the grand finale, complete with cannon fire from Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Gunners from HMCS QUADRA, a pealing carillon and a fireworks display to honour BC Day. Pacific Opera Victoria, Victoria Operatic Society, Victoria Philharmonic Choir, Canadian Pacific Ballet and Ballet Victoria stage two or three productions each year at the Macpherson or Royal Theatres.

=== Theatre ===
The Bastion Theatre, a professional dramatic company, functioned in Victoria through the 1970s and 1980s and performed high quality dramatic productions but ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1988. Reborn as The New Bastion Theatre in 1990 the company operated for five more years before closing operations in 1996.

The Belfry Theatre started in 1974 as the Springridge Cultural Centre in 1974. The venue was renamed the Belfry Theatre in 1976 as the company began producing its own shows. The Belfry&#x27;s mandate is to produce contemporary plays with an emphasis on new Canadian plays. Other regional theatre venues include: the University of Victoria Phoenix Theatre; The Roxy Theatre, home of the Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre company; Kaleidoscope Theatre and Intrepid Theatre Company, producers of the Victoria Fringe Theatre Festival and The Uno Festival of Solo Performance.

The only Canadian Forces Primary Reserve brass/reed band on Vancouver Island is in Victoria. The 5th (British Columbia) Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery Band traces its roots back to 1864, making it the oldest, continually operational military band west of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Its mandate is to support the island&#x27;s military community by performing at military dinners, parades and ceremonies, and other events. The band performs weekly in August at Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Site where the Regiment started manning the guns of the fort in 1896, and also performs every year at the Cameron Bandshell at Beacon Hill Park.

The annual multi-day Rifflandia Music Festival is one of Canada&#x27;s largest modern rock and pop music festivals.

=== Films set in Victoria ===
Due to the proximity to Vancouver and a 6% distance location tax credit, Victoria is used as a filming location for many films, television series, and television movies. Some of these films include &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, &quot;In the Land of Women&quot;, &quot;White Chicks&quot;, &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, &quot;Final Destination&quot;, &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; and &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot;. Television series such as &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and &quot;&quot; were also filmed there. 

=== Victoria-area artists and writers ===
Canadian director Atom Egoyan was raised in neighbouring Saanich. Actors Cameron Bright (&quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;, &quot;New Moon&quot;) and Ryan Robbins (&quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;) were born in Victoria. Actor Cory Monteith from the television series &quot;Glee&quot; was raised in Victoria. Actor, artist, and athlete Duncan Regehr of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; was raised in the region. Artist, art magazine publisher and jazz saxophonist Noah Becker of &quot;Whitehot Magazine&quot; has been a long time Victoria resident.

===Attractions===

In the heart of downtown are the British Columbia Parliament Buildings, The Empress Hotel, the gothic Christ Church Cathedral, and the Royal British Columbia Museum/IMAX National Geographic Theatre, with large exhibits on local Aboriginal peoples, natural history, and modern history, along with travelling international exhibits. In addition, the heart of downtown also has the Maritime Museum of British Columbia, Emily Carr House, Victoria Bug Zoo, and Market Square. The oldest (and most intact) Chinatown in Canada is within downtown and includes the Chinese Public School built in 1909, and some cultural items and pictures displayed at the Pandora avenue entrances to Market Square. The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria is close to downtown in the Rockland neighbourhood several city blocks from Craigdarroch Castle built by industrialist Robert Dunsmuir and Government House, the official residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia.

Numerous other buildings of historic importance or interest are also in central Victoria, including: the 1845 St. Ann&#x27;s Schoolhouse; the 1852 Helmcken House built for Victoria&#x27;s first doctor; the 1863 Congregation Emanu-El, the oldest synagogue in continuous use in Canada; the 1865 Angela College built as Victoria&#x27;s first Anglican Collegiate School for Girls, now housing retired nuns of the Sisters of St. Ann; the 1871 St. Ann&#x27;s Academy built as a Catholic school; the 1874 Church of Our Lord, built to house a breakaway congregation from the Anglican Christ Church cathedral; the 1890 St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church; the 1890 Metropolitan Methodist Church (now the Victoria Conservatory of Music),

Experience, which closed down in 2006.

Downtown Victoria is a very walkable area with many midblock crosswalks, an expanding central pedestrian street, public squares, and alleys that are predominantly spaces for pedestrians. Fan Tan alley is the narrowest commercial street in North America and runs between Pandora avenue and Fisgard street in Victoria&#x27;s Chinatown. Dragon alley is also located in Chinatown and is a mix of commercial and residential units, located between Fisgard and Herald streets. Theatre alley was rebuilt in a newer condo construction in Chinatown and is a narrow alley that winds between Pandora avenue and Fisgard street just west of Fan Tan alley, but it does not include direct access to any commercial businesses. Waddington alley is uniquely paved with wooden blocks located between Yates and Johnson streets. Trounce alley is a small commercial alley located between Government and Broad streets.

Beacon Hill Park is the central city&#x27;s main urban green space. Its area of adjacent to Victoria&#x27;s southern shore includes numerous playing fields, manicured gardens, exotic species of plants and animals such as wild peacocks, a petting zoo, and views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Olympic Mountains in Washington across it. The sport of cricket has been played in Beacon Hill Park since the mid-19th century. Each summer, the City of Victoria presents dozens of concerts at the Cameron Band Shell in Beacon Hill Park.

The extensive system of parks in Victoria also includes a few areas of natural Garry oak meadow habitat, an increasingly scarce ecosystem that once dominated the region.

Private gardens that are open to the public with sometimes limited opening hours are located throughout the city and offer access at low or no cost to visitors, they include the rose garden next to the Empress Hotel, the Government House Gardens on the grounds of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia&#x27;s house (also known as Government House) on Rockland Road, and Abkahazi Garden on Fairfield Road.

Dallas Road is a waterfront trail and road with a to walk, run, bike or drive. Clover Point is its main rest area with benches, lounge chairs, picnic tables and a public washroom.

The David Foster Harbour Pathway is a predominantly a pedestrian pathway that meanders around the inner harbour between the southern start at Ogden point by the cruise ship terminal and Rock Bay at its northern terminus. The pathway has some disconnected sections that are expected to be connected with redevelopments along the pathway near the Johnson street bridge. When completed the David Foster Harbour Pathway is expected to extend over in length.

====Outside the city====

CFB Esquimalt navy base, in the adjacent municipality of Esquimalt, has a base museum dedicated to naval and military history, in the Naden part of the base.

North of the city on the Saanich Peninsula are the marine biology Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre, Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, one of the biggest tourist and local resident attractions on Vancouver Island, as well as the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, part of the National Research Council of Canada, Victoria Butterfly Gardens and Centre of the Universe planetarium.

==Sports and recreation==
Victoria&#x27;s climate, location and variety of facilities make it ideal for many recreational activities including rock climbing, hiking, kayaking, golf, water sports, informal team sports and jogging.

Victoria is also known as the Cycling Capital of Canada, with hundreds of kilometres of bicycle paths, bike lanes and bike routes in the city, including the Galloping Goose Regional Trail. There are mountain biking trails at Mount Work Regional Park in the neghbour community The District of Highlands, and Victoria is quickly becoming a bike tourism destination. Cycling advocacy groups including Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition (GVCC) and the Bike to Work Society have worked to improve Victoria&#x27;s cycling infrastructure and facilities, and to make cycling a viable transportation alternative, attracting 5% of commuters in 2005.

Greater Victoria also has a rich motorsports history, and was home to a 4/10ths mile oval race track called Western Speedway in the nearby City of Langford. Opened in 1954, Western Speedway was the oldest speedway in western Canada, and featured stock car racing, drag racing, demolition derbies and other events. Western Speedway was also home to the Victoria Auto Racing Hall of Fame and Museum.

The Greater Victoria area also serves as a headquarters for Rugby Canada, based out of Starlight Stadium in Langford, as well as a headquarters for Rowing Canada, based out of Victoria City Rowing Club at Elk Lake in Saanich. The Greater Victoria Sports Hall of Fame is at the Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre, and features numerous displays and information on the sporting history of the city.

The major sporting and entertainment complex, for Victoria and Vancouver Island Region, is the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre arena. It replaced the former Victoria Memorial Arena, which was constructed by efforts of World War II veterans as a monument to fallen comrades. World War I, World War II, Korean War, and other conflict veterans are also commemorated. Fallen Canadian soldiers in past, present, and future wars and/or United Nations, NATO missions are noted, or will be noted by the main lobby monument at the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre. The arena was the home of the ECHL (formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League) team, Victoria Salmon Kings, owned by RG Properties Limited, a real estate development firm that built the Victoria Save On Foods Memorial Centre, and Prospera Place Arena in Kelowna. The arena is the home of the Victoria Royals Western Hockey League (WHL) team that replaced the Victoria Salmon Kings (ECHL).

=== International events ===
Victoria has also been a destination for numerous high-profile international sporting events. It co-hosted the 1994 Commonwealth Games with Saanich and Oak Bay and the 2005 Ford World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship. The 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup was co-hosted by Victoria along with five other Canadian cities; (Burnaby, Toronto, Edmonton, Ottawa, Montreal). Victoria was also the first city location of the cross Canada 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay that occurred before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Victoria co-hosted the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships along with Vancouver, British Columbia. Victoria was one of four host cities for the 2020 FIBA Men&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Tournaments in June 2020.

===Sports teams===
The city has also been home to numerous high-profile sports teams in its history. The Victoria Cougars are perhaps the most famous sports franchise the city has known, existing as members of several professional leagues from 1911 to 1926, and again from 1949 to 1961. The Cougars won the Stanley Cup as members of the WCHL in 1925 after defeating the Montreal Canadiens three games to one in a best-of-five final. The Cougars were reincarnated in 1971 as a major junior hockey team in the Western Hockey League, before they moved to Prince George to become the Prince George Cougars. Today, the Cougars name and legacy continue in the form of the Junior &#x27;B&#x27; team that plays in the Vancouver Island Junior Hockey League. Minor professional hockey returned to Victoria in the form of the Victoria Salmon Kings, which played in the ECHL from 2004 to 2011, and were a minor league affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks. In baseball, Victoria was once home of the Victoria Athletics of the Western International League, a Class &#x27;A&#x27; minor league baseball affiliate of the New York Yankees. The Victoria region&#x27;s newest sports team is Pacific FC of the Canadian Premier League. Pacific FC play their home matches at Starlight Stadium in Langford.

Victoria has been home to many accomplished athletes that have participated in professional sports or the Olympics. Notable professional athletes include basketball Hall of Famer Steve Nash, twice Most Valuable Player in the National Basketball Association, who grew up in Victoria and played youth basketball at St. Michael&#x27;s University School in Saanich and Mount Douglas Secondary School in Saanich. Furthermore, there are several current NHL hockey players from Greater Victoria, including brothers Jamie Benn and Jordie Benn of the Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively who grew up in North Saanich; Tyson Barrie of the Edmonton Oilers, and Matt Irwin of the Washington Capitals. Current Boston Red Sox pitcher Nick Pivetta was born in Victoria and played summer collegiate baseball for the Victoria HarbourCats. Former professional racing cyclist and 2012 Giro d&#x27;Italia winner, Ryder Hesjedal was born in Victoria and still calls the city home. Victoria has also been home to many Olympic Games athletes, including multi-time medalists such as Silken Laumann, Ryan Cochrane, and Simon Whitfield.

Sports teams presently operating in Victoria include:

==Infrastructure==
The Jordan River Diversion Dam is Vancouver Island&#x27;s main hydroelectric power station. It was built in 1911.

The city&#x27;s water is supplied by the Capital Regional District&#x27;s Water Services Department from its Sooke Lake Reservoir. The lake is connected to a treatment plant at Japan Gulch by the Kapoor Tunnel. The lake water is very soft and requires no filtering. It is treated with chlorine, ammonia and ultraviolet light to control micro-organisms.

Until the tunnel was completed in 1967, water flowed from the lake through the circuitous, leaky and much smaller Sooke Flowline.

The Hartland landfill in Saanich is the waste disposal site for Greater Victoria area. Since 1985, it has been run by the Capital Regional District environmental services. It is on top of a hill, between Victoria and Sidney, at the end of Hartland Avenue () There is a recycling centre, a sewer solid waste collection, hazardous waste collection, and an electricity generating station. This generating station now creates 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough for 1,600 homes. The site has won international environmental awards. The CRD conducts public tours of the facility. It is predicted to be full by 2045.

As of 15 December 2020 the CRD announced that core municipalities within Greater Victoria no longer discharge screened wastewater into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The wastewater treatment facility was required to comply with federal regulations that forbid untreated discharge into waterways. The wastewater treatment project included pump stations at Clover Point and Macaulay Point in addition to the wastewater treatment plant at McLoughlin Point and the residuals treatment facility at Hartland landfill. The wastewater treatment plant serves Victoria, Esquimalt, Saanich, Oak Bay, View Royal, Langford, Colwood and the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations.

The Saanich Peninsula wastewater treatment plant serves North Saanich, Central Saanich and the Town of Sidney as well as the Victoria International Airport, the Institute of Ocean Sciences and the Tseycum and Pauquachin First Nations. This is a secondary level treatment plant which produces Class A biosolids.

==Transportation==
===Air===

Victoria International Airport in North Saanich has non-stop flights to and from Toronto, Seattle, Montreal (seasonal), select seasonal sun destinations, and many cities throughout Western Canada. Multiple scheduled helicopter and seaplane flights are available daily from Victoria Inner Harbour Airport to Vancouver International Airport, Vancouver Harbour, and Seattle.

Victoria is also home to the world&#x27;s largest all-seaplane airline, Harbour Air. Harbour air offers flights during daylight hours at least every 30 minutes between Victoria&#x27;s inner harbour and Vancouver&#x27;s downtown terminal or YVR south terminal. Harbour Air also operate scenic tour flights over the Victoria harbour and gulf islands area.

===Cycling===

The Greater Victoria area has the highest rate of bicycle commuting to work of any census metropolitan area in Canada. Greater Victoria also has an expanding system designed to facilitate cyclists, electrically assisted bicycles and other micromobility users via protected bike lanes on many roads, as well as separated multi-use paths for bicycles and pedestrians including the Galloping Goose Regional Trail, Lochside Regional Trail and the E&amp;N rail trail. These multi-use trails are designed exclusively for foot traffic, cyclists, and micro-mobility users and pass through many communities in the Greater Victoria area, beginning at the downtown core and extending into areas such as Langford and Central and North Saanich.

Victoria is currently finishing a protected bike lane network intended for all ages and abilities (AAA). The first lane opened in Spring 2017 on Pandora Avenue, between Store Street and Cook Street in the downtown core and provides an easy cycling connection across the Johnson Street Bridge to the Galloping Goose Trail and E&amp;N rail trail. The second protected bike lane in the network opened on Fort Street on 27 May 2018. The next two roads added to the downtown area bike network were Wharf and Humboldt streets, completed in 2019 and 2020 respectively, with Vancouver Street and Graham/Jackson streets added to the AAA bike network in 2021. The next round of streets upgraded starting in 2021 as &quot;complete streets&quot; with AAA cycling infrastructure included Richardson Street, Haultain Street, Government Street north of Pandora Avenue to Gorge Road, and finally Kimta Road connecting the network to the E&amp;N rail trail. Connector routes in the Fernwood and Oaklands neighbourhoods to the Vancouver Street lanes were also constructed starting in 2021, avoiding hills and adding safer pedestrian and cyclist crossings. In 2022 the city constructed further AAA bicycle connections along Montreal Street, Superior Street, Government Street (south, between Humboldt Street and Dallas Road), Fort Street (between Cook Street and up to the municipal border with Oak Bay), and Gorge Road (between Government Street and up to the municipal border with Saanich).

Go By Bike Week, previously called Bike to Work Week, is a bi-annual event held in communities throughout greater Victoria, British Columbia. It is organized by Capital Bike, a group created in 2021 by the merging of the Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition and Greater Victoria Bike to Work Society, and typically lasts one or two weeks. There is a large Spring event scheduled in late May every year, and again later during Fall typically in October. The original &quot;Bike to Work Week&quot; began in 1995 in Victoria and expanded to include other communities in BC through their local bicycle advocacy groups, all supported by the Bike to Work BC Society. The Bike to Work BC Society was formed in 2009 as a legal entity to run the event in other communities around BC, and was renamed the GoByBike BC Society to encourage cycling beyond the scope of commuting. The behaviour change (public health) model, relying on research conducted by both the provincial and federal governments that identified barriers to cycling and reasons for choosing cycling, was applied in the original Bike to Work Week event as a way to accomplish the goal of recruiting employees to bicycle to work. Since its inception, ridership in Go By Bike Week has steadily increased, and in 2017 over 7,000 people participated in Greater Victoria. The event aims to attract new riders, promote cycling for commuting, recreation, and general transportation, and advocate for expanding safe cycling networks with prizes, activities and free cycling skills workshops. Pop-up &quot;Celebration Stations&quot; are set up throughout Greater Victoria, which typically feature free snacks and local coffee for cyclists, bicycle repair stands, and local cycling-related vendors and advocacy groups. The events were cancelled during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, though individualized events were still promoted where participants could win prizes, and in-person events resumed in 2022.

Other cycling advocacy initiatives in the Greater Victoria area include the Victoria chapter of Cycling Without Age, the Bike2Farm program and several recreational cycling clubs.

===Ferries===
The CRD is served by several ferries with the Lower Mainland, Gulf Islands and the United States. BC Ferries provides service between Swartz Bay, located on the northern tip of the Saanich Peninsula, to Tsawwassen on the Lower Mainland for cars, bus, trucks, pedestrians and cyclists. The Coho ferry operates as a car and pedestrian/cyclist ferry between the inner harbour of Victoria and Port Angeles, Washington. The Victoria Clipper is a pedestrian and cyclist-only (no vehicles) ferry which operates daily, year-round between downtown Seattle and the inner harbour of Victoria. The Washington State Ferries ran a ferry until 2020 for cars, pedestrians and cyclists between Friday Harbor, Orcas Island and Anacortes in Washington State from the port at Sidney, north of Victoria on the Saanich Peninsula. However, the service was shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic and did not resume. Washington State Ferries, citing crew and vessel shortages, estimates that it will not resume until at least 2030.

===Public transit===

Local public transportation is run by the Victoria Regional Transit System, which is part of BC Transit. Since 2000, double-decker buses have been introduced to the fleet, and have become an icon for the city. Rider fare payments can be made in exact cash, using the reloadable Umo app or card, and 30-day bus passes can be purchased from one of many vendors. 

In 2024, BC transit rolled out its electronic payment system, Umo, where riders can board using the Umo app or the Umo card. Users can purchase bus passes and load money onto their accounts on the app, online, or toll-free through Umo’s customer service phone line. To board the bus, scan the Umo apps&#x27; QR code or the Umo cards&#x27; barcode on the validator. 

As of 1 April 2016 bus drivers do not provide transfers as proof of payment. Transfers were a source of disagreement and delay on the bus, due to improper transfer use, and disagreements over expired transfers or transfers used for return trips. Instead, a day-pass was added that can be purchased from the bus driver for $5. When using the Umo app or card, the Umo will halt your payments so you never pay more than the value of the day-pass. 

To improve bus reliability and reduce delays, a bike and bus priority lane was opened in 2014 during peak traffic periods with fines for motorists operating in the bus/bike lane who are not turning in the same block. The dedicated bike and bus lane on Douglas street is being expanded from Downtown to near Uptown and may be changed to be restricted to only buses and bikes 24/7 rather than just during peak traffic periods depending on direction of travel. Most buses operating in the Greater Victoria area have a bike rack installed at the front of the bus that can accommodate two bicycles.

===Rail===
Passenger rail service previously operated by Via Rail provided a single daily return trip along between Victoria – Courtenay, along the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, to the cities of Nanaimo, Courtenay, and points between. The service was discontinued along this line indefinitely on 19 March 2011, due to needed track replacement work. Prior to further inspection of the track, service along the segment between Nanaimo and Victoria was originally planned to resume on 8 April, but lack of funding has prevented any of the work from taking place and it is unclear when or if the service will resume.

===Roads===
Local roadways are not based on a grid system as they are in Vancouver or Edmonton, and many streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is no directional indication in street names that may be used in other cities with numbered roads where a street may run north–south or avenue may run east–west.

The compact size of the city with few steep hills lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as scooters, Smart Cars, motorcycles and electric bicycles. Victoria incentivizes the use of smaller modes of transport by offering smaller metered parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designated for small vehicles and motorcycles. Rush hour traffic delays along the Trans-Canada Highway to western suburban municipalities (including Langford, Colwood, Sooke and Metchosin) is commonly referred to as the &quot;Colwood Crawl&quot;.

Victoria serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada&#x27;s Trans-Canada Highway, the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero marker is at the southernmost point of Douglas Street where it meets Dallas Road along the waterfront. The Mile Zero location includes a statue to honour Terry Fox.

=== Other transportation ===
Coach bus service between downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver or the Vancouver International Airport, which includes the ferry fare is called the BC Ferries Connector run by Wilson&#x27;s Transportation Limited. The coach bus travels on the ferry to Vancouver with separate trips for the bus to downtown and a bus to the Vancouver International Airport. Average travel time between the two cities is under 4 hours with an hour and half of that time spent on the ferry crossing.

Bus service from Victoria to points up island is run by Island Link Bus or Tofino Bus. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal at 700 Douglas Street, behind the Fairmont Empress Hotel and offer trips to destinations further up island and the west coast of the island.

==Education==

The city of Victoria lies entirely within the Greater Victoria School District. Victoria High School is the only public high school located within the municipal boundaries of the city of Victoria. Opened 7 August 1876, Victoria High School is the oldest High School in North America north of San Francisco and west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Many of the elementary schools in Victoria offer both French immersion and English programs of instruction. École Victor-Brodeur in Esquimalt serves as a dedicated school for Francophones.

In addition, there are several independent schools serving the Greater Victoria community, including the Chinese School in Chinatown, the Christ Church Cathedral School Christ Church Cathedral School | primary and middle school, Glenlyon Norfolk School, Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific, St. Margaret&#x27;s School St. Margaret&#x27;s School, St. Michaels University School, St. Patrick&#x27;s Elementary School.

<text>Puzzle video games make up a broad genre of video games that emphasize puzzle solving. The types of puzzles can test problem-solving skills, including logic, pattern recognition, sequence solving, spatial recognition, and word completion. Many puzzle games involve a real-time element and require quick thinking, such as &quot;Tetris&quot; (1985) and &quot;Lemmings&quot; (1991).

== History ==

Puzzle video games owe their origins to brain teasers and puzzles throughout human history. The mathematical strategy game Nim, and other traditional thinking games such as Hangman and Bulls and Cows (commercialized as &quot;Mastermind&quot;), were popular targets for computer implementation.

In Universal Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Space Panic&quot;, released in arcades in 1980, the player digs holes in platforms to trap creatures. It is a precursor to puzzle-platform games such as &quot;Lode Runner&quot; (1983), &quot;Door Door&quot; (1983), and &quot;Doki Doki Penguin Land&quot; (1985).

&quot;Blockbuster&quot;, by Alan Griesemer and Stephen Bradshaw (Atari 8-bit, 1981), is a computerized version of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube puzzle. &quot;Snark Hunt&quot; (Atari 8-bit, 1982) is a single-player game of logical deduction, a clone of the 1970s &quot;Black Box&quot; board game.

Elements of Konami&#x27;s tile-sliding &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; (1982) were later seen in &quot;Pipe Mania&quot; from LucasArts (1989).

In &quot;Boulder Dash&quot; (1984), the goal is to collect diamonds while avoiding or exploiting rocks that fall after digging out the dirt beneath them.

&quot;Chain Shot!&quot; (1985) introduced removing groups of the same color tiles on a grid, causing the remaining tiles to fall into the gap. &quot;Uncle Henry&#x27;s Nuclear Waste Dump&quot; (1986) involves dropping colored shapes into a pit, but the goal is to keep the same color tiles from touching.

&quot;Tetris&quot; (1985) revolutionized and popularized the puzzle game genre. The game was created by Soviet game designer Alexey Pajitnov for the Electronika 60. Pajitnov was inspired by a traditional puzzle game named Pentominos in which players arrange blocks into lines without any gaps. The game was released by Spectrum Holobyte for MS-DOS in 1987, Atari Games in arcades in 1988, and sold 30 million copies for Game Boy.

In &quot;Lemmings&quot; (1991), a series of creatures walk into deadly situations, and a player assigns jobs to specific lemmings to guide the swarm to a safe destination.

The 1994 MS-DOS game &quot;Shariki&quot;, by Eugene Alemzhin, introduced the mechanic of swapping adjacent elements to tile matching games. It was little known at the time, but later had a major influence on the genre.
Interest in Mahjong video games from Japan began to grow in 1994.

When &quot;Minesweeper&quot; was released with Windows 95, players began using a mouse to play puzzle games.

=== Modern puzzle games ===
In 2000, PopCap Games released &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, a direct clone of the 1994 tile-matching game &quot;Shariki&quot; with improved visuals. It sparked interest in the match-three mechanic which became the foundation for other popular games, including &quot;Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords&quot; (2007), &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot; (2012), and &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot; (2012).

&quot;Portal&quot; (2007) was followed by other physics-based puzzle games.

== Sub-genres ==
=== Physics game ===

A physics game is a type of logical puzzle video game wherein the player must use the game&#x27;s physics and environment to complete each puzzle. Physics games use consistent physics to make games more challenging. The genre is popular in online flash games and mobile games. Educators have used these games to demonstrate principles of physics.

Physics-based logic puzzle games include &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot;, &quot;Portal&quot;, &quot;The Talos Principle&quot;, &quot;Braid&quot;, &quot;Fez&quot;, &quot;World of Goo&quot;, and &quot;Cut the Rope&quot;, as well as projectile collision games such as &quot;Angry Birds&quot;, &quot;Peggle&quot;, &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, and &quot;Crush the Castle&quot;.

=== Programming game ===
Programming games require writing code, either as text or using a visual system, to solve puzzles. Examples include &quot;Rocky&#x27;s Boots&quot; (1982), &quot;Robot Odyssey&quot; (1984), &quot;SpaceChem&quot; (2011), and &quot;Infinifactory&quot; (2015).

=== Exploration ===
This sub-genre includes point-and-click games that often overlap with adventure games and walking simulators. Unlike logical puzzle games, these games generally require inductive reasoning to solve. The defining trait is that the player must experiment with mechanisms in each level before they can solve them. Exploration games include &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;Limbo&quot;, and &quot;The Dig&quot;. Escape room games such as &quot;The Room&quot; involve detailed exploration of a single location.

=== Sokoban ===

Sokoban games, such as its 1982 namesake title, or block-pushing games, involve pushing or pulling blocks on a grid-like space to move them into designated positions without blocking the movement of other blocks. Similar games include &quot;Baba is You&quot; and &quot;Patrick&#x27;s Parabox&quot;.

=== Hidden object game ===

A hidden object game, sometimes called hidden picture or hidden object puzzle adventure (HOPA), is a genre of puzzle video game in which the player must find items from a list that are hidden within a scene. Hidden object games are a popular trend in casual gaming.

=== Tile-matching ===

In tile-matching video games, the player manipulates tiles in order to make them disappear according to a matching criterion. The genre began with 1985&#x27;s &quot;Chain Shot!&quot; and has similarities to falling-block games such as &quot;Tetris.&quot; This genre includes games that require pieces to be swapped such as &quot;Bejeweled&quot; or &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot;, games that adapt the classic tile-based game Mahjong such as &quot;Mahjong Trails&quot;, and games in which pieces are shot on the board such as &quot;Zuma&quot;. Puzzle games based on &quot;Tetris&quot; include tile-matching games where the matching criterion is to place a given number of tiles of the same type so that they adjoin each other. That number is often three, and the corresponding subset of tile-matching games is referred to as match-three games.

<doc id="32394" wikidata="Q828322" url="?curid=32394" title="Platformer">
<text>A platformer (also called a platform game, and sometimes a jump &#x27;n&#x27; run game) is a subgenre of action game in which the core objective is to move the player character between points in an environment. Platform games are characterized by levels with uneven terrain and suspended platforms that require jumping and climbing to traverse. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay, such as swinging from vines or grappling hooks, jumping off walls, gliding through the air, or bouncing from springboards or trampolines. 
The genre started with the 1980 arcade video game &quot;Space Panic&quot;, which has ladders but not jumping. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, released in 1981, established a template for what were initially called &quot;climbing games&quot;. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; inspired many clones and games with similar elements, such as &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; (1982) and &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1982), while the Sega arcade game &quot;Congo Bongo&quot; (1983) adds a third dimension via isometric graphics. Another popular game of that period, &quot;Pitfall!&quot; (1982), allows moving left and right through series of non-scrolling screens, expanding the play area. Nintendo&#x27;s flagship &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985) was a defining game for the genre, with horizontally scrolling levels and the player controlling a named character—Mario, which became Nintendo&#x27;s mascot. The terms &quot;platform game&quot; and &quot;platformer&quot; gained traction in the late 1980s.

During their peak of popularity, platformers were estimated to comprise between a quarter and a third of all console games. By 2006, sales had declined, representing a 2% market share as compared to 15% in 1998. In spite of this, platformers are still being commercially released every year, including some which have sold millions of copies.

==Concepts==
A platformer requires the player to maneuver their character across platforms to reach a goal while confronting enemies and avoiding obstacles along the way. These games are either presented from the side view, using two-dimensional movement, or in 3D with the camera placed either behind the main character or in isometric perspective. Typical platforming gameplay tends to be very dynamic and challenges a player&#x27;s reflexes, timing, and dexterity with controls.

The most common movement options in the genre are walking, running, jumping, attacking, and climbing. Jumping is central to the genre, though there are exceptions such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot; and Data East&#x27;s &quot;BurgerTime&quot;, both from 1982. In some games, such as &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, the trajectory of a jump is fixed, while in others it can be altered mid-air. Falling may cause damage or death. Many platformers contain environmental obstacles which kill the player&#x27;s character upon contact, such as lava pits or bottomless chasms. The player may be able to collect items and power-ups and give the main character new abilities for overcoming adversities.

Most games of this genre consist of multiple levels of increasing difficulty that may be interleaved by boss encounters, where the character has to defeat a particularly dangerous enemy to progress. Simple logical puzzles to resolve and skill trials to overcome are other common elements in the genre.

A modern variant of the platform game, especially significant on mobile platforms, is the endless runner, where the main character is always moving forward and the player must dodge or jump to avoid falling or hitting obstacles.

==Naming==
Various names were used in the years following the release of the first established game in the genre, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981). Shigeru Miyamoto originally called it a &quot;running/jumping/climbing game&quot; while developing it. Miyamoto commonly used the term &quot;athletic game&quot; to refer to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and later games in the genre, such as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985).

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; spawned other games with a mix of running, jumping, and vertical traversal, a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it, leaving journalists and writers to offer their own terms. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine, among others, referred to the genre as &quot;Donkey Kong-type&quot; or &quot;Kong-style&quot; games. &quot;Climbing games&quot; was used in Steve Bloom&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;Video Invaders&quot; and 1983 magazines &quot;Electronic Games&quot; (US)—which ran a cover feature called &quot;The Player&#x27;s Guide to Climbing Games&quot;—and &quot;TV Gamer&quot; (UK). Bloom defined &quot;climbing games&quot; as titles where the player &quot;must climb from the bottom of the screen to the top while avoiding and/or destroying the obstacles and foes you invariably meet along the way&quot;. Under this definition, he listed &quot;Space Panic&quot; (1980), &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, and despite the top down perspective, &quot;Frogger&quot; (1981) as climbing games.

In a December 1982 &quot;Creative Computing&quot; review of the Apple II game &quot;Beer Run&quot;, the reviewer used a different term: &quot;I&#x27;m going to call this a ladder game, as in the &#x27;ladder genre,&#x27; which includes &quot;Apple Panic&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.&quot; That label was also used by &quot;Video Games Player&quot; magazine in 1983 when it named the Coleco port of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; &quot;Ladder Game of the Year&quot;.

Another term used in the late 1980s to 1990s was &quot;character action games&quot;, in reference to games based around named protagonists, such as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, and &quot;Bubsy&quot;. It was also applied more generally to side-scrolling video games, including run and gun video games such as &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;.

&quot;Platform game&quot; became a common term for the genre by 1989, popularized by its usage in the United Kingdom press. Examples include referring to the &quot;&quot;Super Mario&quot; mould&quot; (such as &quot;Kato-chan &amp; Ken-chan&quot;) as platform games, and calling &quot;Strider&quot; a &quot;platform and ladders&quot; game.

==History==

===Single screen===

The genre originated in the early 1980s. Levels in early platform games were confined to a single screen, viewed in profile, and based on climbing between platforms rather than jumping. &quot;Space Panic&quot;, a 1980 arcade release by Universal, is sometimes credited as the first platformer. Another precursor to the genre from 1980 was Nichibutsu&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Climber&quot;, in which the player character scales vertically scrolling skyscrapers. The unreleased 1979 Intellivision game &quot;Hard Hat&quot; has a similar concept.

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, an arcade video game created by Nintendo and released in July 1981, was the first game to allow players to jump over obstacles and gaps. It is widely considered to be the first platformer. It introduced Mario under the name Jumpman. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was ported to many consoles and computers at the time, notably as the system-selling pack-in game for ColecoVision, and also a handheld version from Coleco in 1982. The game helped cement Nintendo&#x27;s position as an important name in the video game industry internationally.

The following year, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; received a sequel, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; and later &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, a platformer with two-player cooperative play. It laid the groundwork for other two-player cooperative games such as &quot;Fairyland Story&quot; and &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;.

Beginning in 1982, transitional games emerged with non-scrolling levels spanning multiple screens. David Crane&#x27;s &quot;Pitfall!&quot; for the Atari 2600, with 256 horizontally connected screens, became one of the best-selling games on the system and was a breakthrough for the genre. &quot;&quot; was released on the ColecoVision that same year, adding uneven terrain and scrolling pans between static screens. &quot;Manic Miner&quot; (1983) and its sequel &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; (1984) continued this style of multi-screen levels on home computers. &quot;&quot; won the first award for Best Platform game in 1984 from &quot;Crash&quot; magazine. Later that same year, Epyx released &quot;Impossible Mission&quot;, and Parker Brothers released &quot;Montezuma&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, which further expanded on the exploration aspect.

===Scrolling===

The first platformer to use scrolling graphics came years before the genre became popular. &quot;Jump Bug&quot; is a platform-shooter developed by Alpha Denshi under contract for Hoei/Coreland and released to arcades in 1981, only five months after &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Players control a bouncing car that jumps on various platforms such as buildings, clouds, and hills. &quot;Jump Bug&quot; offered a glimpse of what was to come, with uneven, suspended platforms, levels that scroll horizontally (and in one section, vertically), and differently themed sections, such as a city, the interior of a large pyramid, and underwater.

Irem&#x27;s 1982 arcade game &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; combines jumping over obstacles and shooting attackers. A month later, Taito released &quot;Jungle King&quot;, a side-scrolling action game some platform elements: jumping between vines, jumping or running beneath bouncing boulders. It was quickly re-released as &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; because of similarities to Tarzan.

The 1982 Apple II game &quot;Track Attack&quot; includes a scrolling platform level where the character runs and leaps along the top of a moving train.
The character is little more than a stick figure, but the acrobatics evoke the movement that games such as &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; would feature. &quot;B.C.&#x27;s Quest For Tires&quot; (1983) put a recognizable character from American comic strips into side-scrolling, jumping gameplay similar to &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;. The same year, &quot;Snokie&quot; for the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit computers added uneven terrain to a scrolling platformer.
Based on the Saturday morning cartoon rather than the maze game, Namco&#x27;s 1984 &quot;Pac-Land&quot; is a bidirectional, horizontally-scrolling, arcade video game with walking, running, jumping, springboards, power-ups, and a series of unique levels. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani described the game as &quot;the pioneer of action games with horizontally running background.&quot; According to Iwatani, Shigeru Miyamoto described &quot;Pac-Land&quot; as an influence on the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;.

Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, became the archetype for the genre. It was bundled with Nintendo systems in North America, Japan, and Europe, and sold over 40 million copies, according to the 1999 Guinness Book of World Records. Its success as a pack-in led many companies to see platformers as vital to their success, and contributed greatly to popularizing the genre during the third and fourth generations of video game consoles.

Sega attempted to emulate this success with their &quot;Alex Kidd&quot; series, which started in 1986 on the Master System with &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot;. It has horizontal and vertical scrolling levels, the ability to punch enemies and obstacles, and shops for the player to buy power-ups and vehicles. Another Sega series that began that same year is &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;. The original &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; in 1986 was inspired more by &quot;Pac-Land&quot; than &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, with skateboarding segments that gave the game a greater sense of speed than other platformers at the time, while its sequel, &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot; added action-adventure and role-playing elements. &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; in turn inspired games such as &quot;Adventure Island&quot;, &quot;Dynastic Hero&quot;, &quot;Popful Mail&quot;, and &quot;Shantae&quot;.

One of the first platformers to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character&#x27;s movement is in a vector game called &quot;Major Havoc&quot;, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer. One of the first raster-based platformers to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is 1985&#x27;s&quot; Legend of Kage&quot;.

In 1985, Enix released the action-adventure platformer &quot;Brain Breaker&quot;.
The following year saw the release of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Metroid&quot;, which was critically acclaimed for a balance between open-ended and guided exploration. Another platform-adventure released that year, Pony Canyon&#x27;s &quot;Super Pitfall&quot;, was critically panned for its vagueness and weak game design. That same year Jaleco released &quot;Esper Boukentai&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Psychic 5&quot; that scrolled in all directions and allowed the player character to make huge multistory jumps to navigate the vertically oriented levels. Telenet Japan also released its own take on the platform-action game, &quot;Valis&quot;, which contained anime-style cut scenes.

In 1987, Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Mega Man&quot; introduced non-linear level progression where the player is able to choose the order in which they complete levels. This was a stark contrast to both linear games like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and open-world games like &quot;Metroid&quot;. GamesRadar credits the &quot;level select&quot; feature of &quot;Mega Man&quot; as the basis for the non-linear mission structure found in most open-world, multi-mission, sidequest-heavy games. Another Capcom platformer that year was &quot;Bionic Commando&quot;, which popularized a grappling hook mechanic that has since appeared in dozens of games, including &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;.

Scrolling platformers went portable in the late 1980s with games such as &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, and the genre continued to maintain its popularity, with many games released for the handheld Game Boy and Game Gear systems.

====Second-generation side-scrollers====
By the time the Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 launched, platformers were the most popular genre in console gaming. There was a particular emphasis on having a flagship platform title exclusive to a system, featuring a mascot character. In 1989, Sega released &quot;Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle&quot;, which was only modestly successful. That same year, Capcom released &quot;Strider&quot; in arcades, which scrolled in multiple directions and allowed the player to summon artificial intelligence partners, such as a droid, tiger, and hawk, to help fight enemies. Another Sega release in 1989 was &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot;, which is a game that also included an AI partner: a dog who followed the player around and aid in battle. In 1990, Hudson Soft released &quot;Bonk&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, with a protagonist positioned as NEC&#x27;s mascot. The following year, Takeru&#x27;s &quot;Cocoron&quot;, a late platformer for the Famicom allowed players to build a character from a toy box filled with spare parts.

In 1990, the Super Famicom was released in Japan, along with the eagerly anticipated &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. The following year, Nintendo released the console as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America, along with &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, while Sega released &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; for the Sega Genesis. &quot;Sonic&quot; showcased a new style of design made possible by a new generation of hardware: large stages that scrolled in all directions, curved hills, loops, and a physics system allowing players to rush through its levels with well-placed jumps and rolls. Sega characterized Sonic as a teenager with a rebellious personality to appeal to gamers who saw the previous generation of consoles as being for kids. The character&#x27;s speed showed off the hardware capabilities of the Genesis, which had a CPU clock speed approximately double that of the Super NES.

Sonic&#x27;s perceived rebellious attitude became a model for game mascots. Other companies attempted to duplicate Sega&#x27;s success with their own brightly colored anthropomorphisms with attitude. These often were characterized by impatience, sarcasm, and frequent quips.

A second generation of platformers for computers appeared alongside the new wave of consoles. In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, the Amiga was a strong gaming platform with its custom video hardware and sound hardware. The Atari ST was solidly supported as well. Games like &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot; and &quot;Turrican&quot; showed that computer platformers could rival their console contemporaries. &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, originally a late release for the 8-bit Apple II in 1989, featured a high quality of animation.

The 1988 shareware game &quot;The Adventures of Captain Comic&quot; was one of the first attempts at a Nintendo-style platformer for IBM PC compatibles. It inspired &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, released by id Software in 1990, which became the first MS-DOS platformer with smooth scrolling graphics. Keen&#x27;s success resulted in numerous console-styled platformers for MS-DOS compatible operating systems, including &quot;Duke Nukem&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem II&quot;, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Cosmic Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Dark Ages&quot; all by Apogee Software. These fueled a brief burst of episodic platformers where the first was freely distributed and parts 2 and 3 were available for purchase.

====Decline of 2D====
The abundance of platformers for 16-bit consoles continued late into the generation, with successful games such as &quot;Vectorman&quot; (1995), &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; (1995), and &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; (1995), but the release of new hardware caused players&#x27; attention to move away from 2D genres. The Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 nevertheless featured a number of successful 2D platformers. The 2D &quot;Rayman&quot; was a big success on 32-bit consoles. &quot;Mega Man 8&quot; and &quot;Mega Man X4&quot; helped revitalize interest in Capcom&#x27;s Mega Man character. &quot;&quot; revitalized its series and established a new foundation for later &quot;Castlevania&quot; games. &quot;Oddworld&quot; and &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; kept the subgenre born from &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; alive.

The difficulties of adapting platformer gameplay to three dimensions led some developers to compromise by pairing the visual flash of 3D with traditional 2D side scrolling gameplay. These games are often referred to as 2.5D. The first such game was Saturn launch title, &quot;Clockwork Knight&quot; (1994). The game featured levels and boss characters rendered in 3D, but retained 2D gameplay and used pre-rendered 2D sprites for regular characters, similar to &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;. Its sequel improved upon its design, featuring some 3D effects such as hopping between the foreground and background, and the camera panning and curving around corners. Meanwhile, &quot;Pandemonium&quot; and &quot;Klonoa&quot; brought the 2.5D style to the PlayStation. In a break from the past, the Nintendo 64 had the fewest side scrolling platformers with only four; &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards&quot;, &quot;Goemon&#x27;s Great Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Mischief Makers&quot;—and most met with a tepid response from critics at the time. Despite this, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; sold over a million copies in the US, and &quot;Mischief Makers&quot; rode high on the charts in the months following its release.

===Third dimension===
The term &quot;3D platformer&quot; usually refers to games with gameplay in three dimensions and polygonal 3D graphics. Games that have 3D gameplay but 2D graphics are usually included under the umbrella of &quot;isometric platformers&quot;, while those that have 3D graphics but gameplay on a 2D plane are called &quot;2.5D&quot;, as they are a blend of 2D and 3D.

The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was Konami&#x27;s &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot;, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. Originally released in 1983 for the MSX computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year, including an arcade video game version, NES, and ColecoVision.

1986 saw the release of the sequel to forward-scrolling platformer &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot; called &quot;Penguin Adventure&quot;, which was designed by Hideo Kojima. It included more action game elements, a greater variety of levels, RPG elements such as upgrading equipment, and multiple endings.

In early 1987, Square released &quot;3-D WorldRunner&quot;, designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nasir Gebelli. Using a forward-scrolling effect similar to Sega&#x27;s 1985 third-person rail shooter &quot;Space Harrier&quot;. &quot;3-D WorldRunner&quot; was an early forward-scrolling pseudo-3D third-person platform-action game where players were free to move in any forward-scrolling direction and could leap over obstacles and chasms. It was notable for being one of the first stereoscopic 3-D games. Square released its sequel, &quot;JJ&quot;, later that year.

The earliest example of a true 3D platformer is a French computer game called &quot;Alpha Waves&quot;, created by Christophe de Dinechin and published by Infogrames in 1990 for the Atari ST, Amiga, and IBM PC compatibles.

&quot;Bug!&quot;, released in 1995 for the Saturn, has a more conservative approach. It allows players to move in all directions, but it does not allow movement along more than one axis at once; the player can move orthogonally but not diagonally. Its characters were pre-rendered sprites, much like the earlier &quot;Clockwork Knight&quot;. The game plays very similarly to 2D platformers, but lets players walk up walls and on ceilings.

In 1995, Delphine Software released a 3D sequel to their 2D platformer &quot;&quot;. Entitled &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, it was the first attempt to bring a popular 2D platformer series into 3D. While it retained the puzzle-oriented level design style and step-based control, it did not meet the criteria of a platformer, and was billed as an action adventure. It used true 3D characters and set pieces, but its environments were rendered using a rigid engine similar to the one used by &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, in that it could only render square, flat corridors, rather than suspended platforms that could be jumped between.

Sega had tasked their American studio, Sega Technical Institute, with bringing Sonic the Hedgehog into 3D. Their project, titled &quot;Sonic Xtreme&quot;, was to have featured a radically different approach for the series, with an exaggerated fisheye camera and multidirectional gameplay reminiscent of &quot;Bug!&quot;. Due in part to conflicts with Sega Enterprises in Japan and a rushed schedule, the game never made it to market.

====True 3D====
In the 1990s, platforming games started to shift from pseudo-3D to &quot;true 3D,&quot; which gave the player more control over the character and the camera. To render a 3D environment from any angle the user chose, the graphics hardware had to be sufficiently powerful, and the art and rendering model of the game had to be viewable from every angle. The improvement in graphics technology allowed publishers to make such games but introduced several new issues. For example, if the player could control the virtual camera, it had to be constrained to stop it from clipping through the environment.

In 1994, a small developer called Exact released a game for the X68000 computer called &quot;Geograph Seal&quot;, which was a 3D first-person shooter game with platforming. Players piloted a frog-like mech that could jump and then double-jump or triple-jump high into the air as the camera panned down to help players line up their landings. In addition to shooting, jumping on enemies was a primary way to attack. This was the first true 3D platform-action game with free-roaming environments, but it was never ported to another platform or released outside Japan, so it remains relatively unknown in the West.

The following year, Exact released their follow-up to &quot;Geograph Seal&quot;. An early title for Sony&#x27;s new PlayStation console, &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot;, released in April 1995, kept the gameplay from its precursor but traded the frog-like mech for a cartoony rabbit mech called Robbit. The title was successful enough to get two sequels and is remembered for being the first 3D platformer on a console. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer said &quot;Jumping Flash&quot; was perhaps &quot;one of the most important ancestors of every 3D platformer in the following decade.&quot; It holds the record of &quot;First platform videogame in true 3D&quot; according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Another early 3D platformer was &quot;Floating Runner&quot;, developed by a Japanese company called Xing and released for PlayStation in early 1996, before the release of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. &quot;Floating Runner&quot; uses D-pad controls and a behind-the-character camera perspective.

In 1996, Nintendo released &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, which is a game that set the standard for 3D platformers. It let the player explore 3D environments with greater freedom than was found in any previous game in the genre. With this in mind, Nintendo put an analog control stick on its Nintendo 64 controller, a feature that had not been seen since the Vectrex but which has since become standard. The analog stick provided the fine precision needed with a free perspective.

In most 2D platformers, the player finished a level by following a path to a certain point, but in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, the levels were open and had objectives. Completing objectives earned the player stars, and stars were used to unlock more levels. This approach allowed for more efficient use of large 3D areas and rewarded the player for exploration, but it meant less jumping and more action-adventure. Even so, a handful of boss levels offered more traditional platforming. Until then there was no settled way to make 3D platformers, but &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; inspired a shift in design. Later 3D platformers like &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; borrowed its format, and the &quot;collect-a-thon&quot; genre began to form.

In order to make this free-roaming model work, developers had to program dynamic, intelligent cameras. A free camera made it harder for players to judge the height and distance of platforms, making jumping puzzles more difficult. Some of the more linear 3D platformers like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Wario World&quot; used scripted cameras that limited player control. Games with more open environments like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Banjo Kazooie&quot; used intelligent cameras that followed the player&#x27;s movements. Still, when the view was obstructed or not facing what the player needed to see, these intelligent cameras needed to be adjusted by the player.

In the 1990s, RPGs, first-person shooters, and more complex action-adventure games captured significant market share. Even so, the platformer thrived. &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; became one of the bestselling series on the PlayStation, along with Insomniac Games&#x27; &quot;Spyro&quot; and Naughty Dog&#x27;s &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;, one of the few 3D games to stick with linear levels. Moreover, many of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s bestsellers were first- and second-party platformers like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;. On Windows and Mac, Pangea Software&#x27;s &quot;Bugdom&quot; series and BioWare&#x27;s &quot;MDK2&quot; proved successful.

Several developers who found success with 3D platformers began experimenting with titles that, despite their cartoon art style, were aimed at adults. Examples include Rare&#x27;s &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, Crystal Dynamics&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot;, and Shiny Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.

In 1998, Sega produced a 3D Sonic game, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, for its Dreamcast console. It used a hub structure like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, but its levels were more linear, fast-paced, and action-oriented.

====Into the 21st century====
Nintendo released &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; for the GameCube in 2002, the second 3D &quot;Mario&quot; platformer.

Other notable 3D platformers trickled out during this generation. &quot;&quot; was a spiritual heir to the &quot;Ghosts&#x27;n Goblins&quot; series, &quot;Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg&quot; offered Yuji Naka&#x27;s take on a &quot;Mario 64&quot;-influenced platformer, Argonaut Software returned with a new platformer named &quot;Malice&quot;, games such as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair 3D: Return to the Lair&quot; and &quot;&quot; were attempts to modernise classic video games of the 1980s using the 3D platformer genre, &quot;Psychonauts&quot; became a critical darling based on its imaginative levels and colorful characters, and several franchises that debuted during the sixth generation of consoles such as &quot;Tak&quot;, &quot;Ty the Tasmanian Tiger&quot;, and &quot;Ape Escape&quot; each developed a cult following. In Europe specifically, the &quot;Kao the Kangaroo&quot; and &quot;Hugo&quot; series achieved popularity and sold well. &quot;Rayman&quot;″s popularity continued, though the franchise&#x27;s third game was not as well received as the first two. &quot;&quot; brought the popular &quot;Oddworld&quot; franchise into the third dimension, but future sequels to this game did not opt for the 3D platform genre.

Naughty Dog moved on from &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; to &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot;, a series that became less about traditional platforming with each sequel. A hybrid platformer/shooter game from Insomniac Games called &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; further pushed the genre away from such gameplay, as did Universal Interactive Studios&#x27; rebooted &quot;Spyro&quot; trilogy and Microsoft&#x27;s attempt to create a mascot for the Xbox in &quot;&quot;. Ironically, Microsoft later found more success with their 2003 take on the genre, &quot;Voodoo Vince&quot;.

In 2008, Crackpot Entertainment released &quot;Insecticide&quot;. Crackpot, composed of former developers from LucasArts, for the first time combined influences from the point and click genre LucasArts had been known for on titles such as &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; with a platformer.

The platformer remained a vital genre, but it never regained its past popularity. Part of the reason for the platformer&#x27;s decline in the 2000s was a lack of innovation compared to other genres. Platformers were either aimed at younger players or designed to avoid the platform label. In 1998, platformers had a 15% share of the market, and an even higher share in their prime. Four years later that figure had dropped to 2%. Even the acclaimed &quot;Psychonauts&quot; saw modest sales at first, leading publisher Majesco Entertainment to withdraw from high-budget console games, though its sales in Europe were respectable.

===Recent developments===

In the seventh generation of consoles, despite the genre having a smaller presence in the gaming market, some platformers found success. In late 2007, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction&quot; were received well by both critics and fans. &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; was awarded the Best Game of 2007 by high-profile gaming websites like GameSpot, IGN, and GameTrailers. At that point, according to GameRankings, it was the most critically acclaimed game of all time. In 2008, &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; paired traditional 2D-platformer gameplay with physics simulation and user created content, earning it strong sales and good reviews. Electronic Arts released &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot;, which coupled platformer gameplay with a first-person perspective, although they did not market the game as a platformer because of the association of the label with games made for kids. &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot; featured stages with both 2D and 3D platformer gameplay, a formula used later in &quot;Sonic Colors&quot; and &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;. Moreover, two &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; platformers were released in 2007 and 2008, and in 2013, RobTop Games, an indie developer, made &quot;Geometry Dash&quot;.


The popularity of 2D platformers rose in the 2010s. Nintendo revived the genre. &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; was released in 2006 and sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and the fourth best-selling non-bundled video game of all time. &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; eventually sold over eight million units, while &quot;Super Paper Mario&quot;, &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, &quot;Sonic Rush&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island DS&quot;, &quot;Kirby Super Star Ultra&quot;, and &quot;&quot; also sold well.

After the success of &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;, there was a spate of 2D platformers. These ranged from revivals like &quot;Bionic Commando: Rearmed&quot;, &quot;Contra ReBirth&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and&quot; &quot;Rayman Origins&quot; to original titles like &quot;Splosion Man&quot; and &quot;Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure&quot;. &quot;Wario Land: The Shake Dimension&quot;, released in 2008, was a 2D platformer with a rich visual style. Later games like &quot;Limbo&quot;, &quot;Super Meat Boy&quot;, &quot;Braid&quot;, Geometry Dash, &quot;A Boy and His Blob&quot;, and The Behemoth&#x27;s &quot;BattleBlock Theater&quot; also used 2D graphics. &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; is especially notable because unlike most 2D platformers in the twenty-first century, it came out for a non-portable console and was not restricted to a content delivery network. A year after the success of &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot;, Nintendo released more 2D platformers in their classic franchises: &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot; and &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land&quot;. In 2012, they released two more 2D platformers: &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; for the 3DS and &quot;New Super Mario Bros. U&quot; for the Wii U. Nintendo also experimented with 3D platformers that had gameplay elements from 2D platformers, leading to &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; (2011) for the 3DS and &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; (2013) for the Wii U, the latter having cooperative multiplayer. Both were critical and commercial successes.

Games from independent developers in the late 2000s and the 2010s helped grow the platform-game market. These had a stronger focus on story and innovation. In 2009, Frozenbyte released &quot;Trine&quot;, a 2.5D platformer that mixed traditional elements with physics puzzles. The game sold more than 1.1 million copies, and a sequel, &quot;Trine 2&quot;, came out in 2011.

The year 2017 saw the release of several 3D platformers, including &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; and &quot;A Hat in Time&quot;, both crowdfunded on the website Kickstarter. &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;, which returned the series to the open-ended gameplay of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, became one of the best-selling and best-reviewed games in the franchise&#x27;s history. &quot;Super Lucky&#x27;s Tale&quot; came out for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One. &quot;Snake Pass&quot; was called a &quot;puzzle-platformer without a jump button.&quot; The &quot;Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&quot; for PlayStation 4 sold over 2.5 million copies in three months, despite some critics noting it was harder than the original games. The next few years saw more remakes of 3D platformers: &quot;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&quot; (2018) and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated&quot; (2020).

In the ninth generation of consoles, the platformer remains important. &quot;Astro Bot Rescue Mission&quot; (2018), a PlayStation VR game, was followed by &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot; (2020), which came pre-installed on every PlayStation 5. &quot;&quot; (2020), developed by Sumo Digital, was a PlayStation 5 launch title. &quot;Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time&quot; (2020) was released to critical praise. &quot;Bowser&#x27;s Fury&quot; (2021), a short campaign added to the Switch port of &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot;, bridged the gap between the gameplay of &quot;3D World&quot; and that of &quot;Odyssey&quot;. &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&quot; (2021) was one of the first PlayStation 5-exclusive games made by Insomniac. On August 25, 2021, the Kickstarter-funded &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot; was released to critical acclaim. &quot;Fall Guys&quot; (2020) amalgamates platforming elements into the battle royale genre, and was a critical and commercial success. In 2024, the third game in the Astro Bot series, &quot;Astro Bot&quot;, was released to widespread critical acclaim, becoming the highest-rated game of the year on OpenCritic.

==Subgenres==
This list some definable platformers in the following types, but there are also many vaguely defined subgenres games that have not been listed. These game categories are the prototypes genre that recognized by different platform styles.

===Puzzle-platformer===
Puzzle-platformers are characterized by their use of a platformer structure to drive a game whose challenge is derived primarily from puzzles.

Enix&#x27;s 1983 release &quot;Door Door&quot; and Sega&#x27;s 1985 release &quot;Doki Doki Penguin Land&quot; (for the SG-1000) are perhaps the first examples, though the genre is diverse, and classifications can vary. &quot;Doki Doki Penguin Land&quot; allowed players to run and jump in typical platform fashion, but they could also destroy blocks, and were tasked with guiding an egg to the bottom of the level without letting it break.

&quot;The Lost Vikings&quot; (1993) was a popular game in this genre. It has three characters players can switch between, each with different abilities. All three characters are needed to complete the level goals.

This subgenre has a strong presence on handheld systems. &quot;Wario Land 2&quot; moved the Wario series into the puzzle-platform genre by eliminating the element of death and adding temporary injuries, such as being squashed or lit on fire, and specialized powers. &quot;Wario Land 3&quot; continued this tradition, while &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; was more of a mix of puzzle and traditional platform elements. The Game Boy update of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was also successful and saw a sequel on Game Boy Advance: &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot;. &quot;&quot;, the first handheld title in its series, is also a puzzle-platformer.

Through independent game development, this genre has experienced a revival since 2014. &quot;Braid&quot; uses time manipulation for its puzzles, and &quot;And Yet It Moves&quot; uses frame of reference rotation. In contrast to these side-scrollers, &quot;Narbacular Drop&quot; and its successor, &quot;Portal&quot;, are first-person games that use portals to solve puzzles in 3D. Since the release of &quot;Portal&quot;, there have been more puzzle-platformers which use a first-person camera, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;Antichamber&quot;. In 2014, Nintendo released &quot;Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker&quot; which uses compact level design and camera rotation in order to reach the goal and find secrets and collectibles. Despite lacking jump ability, Toad still navigates the environment via unique movement mechanics.

===Run-and-gun platformer===

The run-and-gun platform genre was popularised by Konami&#x27;s &quot;Contra&quot;. Among the most popular games in this style are &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; and &quot;Metal Slug&quot;. Side-scrolling run-and-gun games marry platformers with shoot &#x27;em ups, with less tricky platforming and more shooting. These games are sometimes called platform shooters. The genre has arcade roots, so these games are generally linear and difficult.

There are games which have a lot of shooting but do not fall in this subgenre. &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot;, &quot;Vectorman&quot;, &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;, &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, &quot;Turrican&quot;, &quot;Cuphead&quot; and &quot;Enchanted Portals&quot; are all platformers with shooting, but unlike &quot;Contra&quot; or &quot;Metal Slug&quot;, platforming, as well as exploring and back-tracking, figures prominently. Run-and-gun games are generally pure, and while they may have vehicular sequences or other shifts in style, they have shooting throughout.

===Cinematic platformer===

Cinematic platformers are a small but distinct subgenre, usually distinguished by their relative realism. These games focus on fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platformers, and they additionally often have an absent or minimal HUD. To achieve this realism, many cinematic platformers, beginning with &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, have employed rotoscoping techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts. Jumping abilities are typically roughly within the confines of an athletic human&#x27;s capacity. To expand vertical exploration, many cinematic platformers feature the ability to grab onto ledges, or make extensive use of elevator platforms.

As these games tend to feature vulnerable characters who may die as the result of a single enemy attack or by falling a relatively short distance, they almost never have limited lives or continues. Challenge is derived from trial and error problem solving, forcing the player to find the right way to overcome a particular obstacle.

&quot;Prince of Persia&quot; was the first cinematic platformer and perhaps the most influential. &quot;Impossible Mission&quot; pioneered many of the defining elements of cinematic platformers and is an important precursor to this genre. Other games in the genre include &quot;&quot; (and its 2013 remake), &quot;ReCore&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, the first two &quot;Oddworld&quot; games, &quot;Blackthorne&quot;, &quot;Bermuda Syndrome&quot;, &quot;Generations Lost&quot;, &quot;Heart of the Alien&quot;, &quot;Weird Dreams&quot;, &quot;Limbo&quot;, &quot;Inside&quot;, &quot;onEscapee&quot;, &quot;Deadlight&quot;, &quot;The Way&quot;, &quot;Lunark&quot;, &quot;Planet of Lana&quot; and &quot;Full Void&quot;. &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was the first cinematic platformer to utilize real-time 3D graphics.

===Comical action game===
Games in the genre are most commonly called &quot;comical action games&quot; (CAGs) in Japan. The original arcade &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; is generally recognized as the originator of this genre, though &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; is also highly influential. These games are characterized by single screen, non-scrolling levels and often contain cooperative two-player action. A level is cleared when all enemies on the screen have been defeated, and vanquished foes usually drop score bonuses in the form of fruit or other items. CAGs are almost exclusively developed in Japan and are either arcade games, or sequels to arcade games, though they are also a common genre among amateur &quot;doujinshi&quot; games. Other examples include &quot;Don Doko Don&quot;, &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; and &quot;Nightmare in the Dark&quot;.

===Isometric platformer===

Isometric platformers present a three-dimensional environment using two-dimensional graphics in isometric projection. The use of isometric graphics was popularized by Sega&#x27;s arcade isometric shooter &quot;Zaxxon&quot; (1981), which Sega followed with the arcade isometric platformer &quot;Congo Bongo&quot;, released in February 1983. Another early isometric platformer, the ZX Spectrum game &quot;Ant Attack&quot;, was later released in November 1983.

&quot;Knight Lore&quot;, an isometric sequel to &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, helped to establish the conventions of early isometric platformers. This formula was repeated in later games like &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; and &quot;Monster Max&quot;. These games were generally heavily focused on exploring indoor environments, usually a series of small rooms connected by doors, and have distinct adventure and puzzle elements. Japanese developers blended this gameplay style with that of Japanese action-adventure games like &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; to create games like &quot;Land Stalker&quot; and &quot;Light Crusader&quot;. This influence later traveled to Europe with Adeline Software&#x27;s sprawling epic &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot;, which blended RPG, adventure, and isometric platforming elements.

Before consoles were able to display true polygonal 3D graphics, the ¾ isometric perspective was used to move some popular 2D platformers into three-dimensional gameplay. &quot;Spot Goes To Hollywood&quot; was a sequel to the popular &quot;Cool Spot&quot;, and &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was Sonic&#x27;s outing into the isometric subgenre.

===Platform-adventure game===

, such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, or Typically these elements include the ability to explore an area freely, with access to new areas granted by either gaining new abilities or using inventory items. Many 2D games in the &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchises are among the most popular games of this sort, and so games that take this type of approach are often labeled as &quot;Metroidvania&quot; games. Other examples of such games include &quot;Hollow Knight&quot;, both games in the &quot;Ori&quot; series (&quot;Ori and the Blind Forest&quot; and &quot;Ori and the Will of the Wisps&quot;), &quot;Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap&quot;, &quot;Tails Adventure&quot;, &quot;Cave Story&quot;, &quot;Mega Man ZX&quot;, &quot;Shadow Complex,&quot; &quot;&quot;).

Early examples of free-roaming, side-scrolling, 2D platform-adventures in the vein of &quot;Metroidvania&quot; include Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Metroid&quot; in 1986 and Konami&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot; games: &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; in 1987, &quot;The Goonies II&quot; in 1987 again by Konami, as well as Enix&#x27;s sci-fi Sharp X1 computer game &quot;Brain Breaker&quot; in 1985, Pony Canyon&#x27;s &quot;Super Pitfall&quot; in 1986, System Sacom&#x27;s &quot;Euphory&quot; in 1987, Bothtec&#x27;s &quot;The Scheme&quot; in 1988, and several &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; action RPGs by Nihon Falcom such as the 1985 release &quot;Xanadu&quot; and 1987 releases &quot;Faxanadu&quot; and &quot;Legacy of the Wizard&quot;.

Auto-runner games are platformers where the player-character is nearly always moving in one constant direction through the level, with less focus on tricky jumping but more on quick reflexes as obstacles appear on screen. The subcategory of endless runner games have levels that effectively go on forever, typically through procedural generation. Auto-runner games have found success on mobile platforms, because they are well-suited to the small set of controls these games require, often limited to a single screen tap for jumping.

Game designer Scott Rogers named side-scrolling shooters like &quot;Scramble&quot; (1981) and &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; (1982) and chase-style gameplay in platformers like &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin&quot; (1994 8-bit version) and &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; (1996) as forerunners of the genre. &quot;B.C.&#x27;s Quest for Tires&quot; (1983) has elements of runner games, keeping the jumping of &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;, but replacing the vehicle with a cartoon character.

In February 2003, Gamevil published &quot;Nom&quot; for mobile phones in Korea. The game&#x27;s designer Sin Bong-gu, stated that he wanted to create a game that was only possible on mobile phones, therefore he made the player character walk up walls and ceilings, requiring players to turn around their mobile phones while playing. To compensate for this complication, he limited the game&#x27;s controls to a single button and let the character run automatically and indefinitely, &quot;like the people in modern society, who must always look forward and keep running&quot;.

While the concept thus was long known in Korea, journalists credit &quot;Canabalt&quot; (2009) as &quot;the title that single-handedly invented the smartphone-friendly single-button running genre&quot; and spawned a wave of clones. &quot;Fotonica&quot; (2011), a one-button endless runner viewed from the first person, that was described as a &quot;hybrid of &quot;Canabalt&quot;″s running, &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot;″s perspective (and hands) and &quot;Rez&quot;″s visual style&quot;.

&quot;Temple Run&quot; (2011) and its successor &quot;Temple Run 2&quot; were popular endless running games. The latter became the world&#x27;s fastest-spreading mobile game in January 2013, with 50 million installations within thirteen days.
