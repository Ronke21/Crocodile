<text>In mathematics, a spherical coordinate system specifies a given point in three-dimensional space by using a distance and two angles as its three coordinates. These are

* the radial distance  along the line connecting the point to a fixed point called the origin;
* the polar angle  between this radial line and a given &quot;polar axis&quot;; and
* the azimuthal angle , which is the angle of rotation of the radial line around the polar axis.

(See graphic regarding the &quot;physics convention&quot;.) 

Once the radius is fixed, the three coordinates (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;), known as a 3-tuple, provide a coordinate system on a sphere, typically called the spherical polar coordinates.
The plane passing through the origin and perpendicular to the polar axis (where the polar angle is a right angle) is called the reference plane (sometimes &quot;fundamental plane&quot;).

==Terminology==
The radial distance from the fixed point of origin is also called the &quot;radius&quot;, or &quot;radial line&quot;, or &quot;radial coordinate&quot;. The polar angle may be called &quot;inclination angle&quot;, &quot;zenith angle&quot;, &quot;normal angle&quot;, or the &quot;colatitude&quot;. The user may choose to replace the inclination angle by its complement, the &quot;elevation angle&quot; (or &quot;altitude angle&quot;), measured upward between the reference plane and the radial linei.e., from the reference plane upward (towards to the positive z-axis) to the radial line. The &quot;depression angle&quot; is the negative of the elevation angle. &quot;(See graphic re the &quot;physics convention&quot;not &quot;mathematics convention&quot;.)&quot;

Both the use of symbols and the naming order of tuple coordinates differ among the several sources and disciplines. This article will use the ISO convention frequently encountered in &quot;physics&quot;, where the naming tuple gives the order as: radial distance, polar angle, azimuthal angle, or &quot;formula_1&quot;. (See graphic re the &quot;physics convention&quot;.) In contrast, the conventions in many mathematics books and texts give the naming order differently as: radial distance, &quot;azimuthal angle&quot;, &quot;polar angle&quot;, and formula_2 or formula_1which switches the uses and meanings of symbols θ and φ. Other conventions may also be used, such as &quot;r&quot; for a radius from the &quot;z-&quot;axis that is not from the point of origin. Particular care must be taken to check the meaning of the symbols. 

According to the conventions of geographical coordinate systems, positions are measured by latitude, longitude, and height (altitude). There are a number of celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees; (note 90 degrees equals π/2 radians). And these systems of the &quot;mathematics convention&quot; may measure the azimuthal angle &quot;counterclockwise&quot; (i.e., from the south direction -axis, or 180°, towards the east direction -axis, or +90°)rather than measure &quot;clockwise&quot; (i.e., from the north direction x-axis, or 0°, towards the east direction y-axis, or +90°), as done in the horizontal coordinate system. &quot;(See graphic re &quot;mathematics convention&quot;.)&quot;

The spherical coordinate system of the &quot;physics convention&quot; can be seen as a generalization of the polar coordinate system in three-dimensional space. 
It can be further extended to higher-dimensional spaces, and is then referred to as a &quot;hyperspherical coordinate system&quot;.

== Definition ==
To define a spherical coordinate system, one must designate an &quot;origin&quot; point in space, &quot;&quot;, and two orthogonal directions: the &quot;zenith reference&quot; direction and the &quot;azimuth reference&quot; direction. These choices determine a reference plane that is typically defined as containing the point of origin and the &quot;x and yaxes&quot;, either of which may be designated as the &quot;azimuth reference&quot; direction. The reference plane is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the zenith direction, and typically is designated &quot;horizontal&quot; to the zenith direction&#x27;s &quot;vertical&quot;. The spherical coordinates of a point then are defined as follows:

* The &quot;radius&quot; or &quot;radial distance&quot; is the Euclidean distance from the origin &#x27; to &#x27;.
* The &quot;inclination&quot; (or &quot;polar angle&quot;) is the signed angle from the zenith reference direction to the line segment . (&quot;Elevation&quot; may be used as the polar angle instead of &quot;inclination&quot;; see below.)
* The &quot;azimuth&quot; (or &quot;azimuthal angle&quot;) is the signed angle measured from the &quot;azimuth reference&quot; direction to the orthogonal projection of the radial line segment on the reference plane.
The sign of the azimuth is determined by designating the rotation that is the &quot;positive&quot; sense of turning about the zenith. This choice is arbitrary, and is part of the coordinate system definition. 
(If the inclination is either zero or 180 degrees (= radians), the azimuth is arbitrary. If the radius is zero, both azimuth and inclination are arbitrary.)

The &quot;elevation&quot; is the signed angle from the x-y reference plane to the radial line segment , where positive angles are designated as upward, towards the zenith reference. &quot;Elevation&quot; is 90 degrees (= radians) &quot;minus inclination&quot;. Thus, if the inclination is 60 degrees (= radians), then the elevation is 30 degrees (= radians).

In linear algebra, the vector from the origin to the point is often called the &quot;position vector&quot; of &quot;P&quot;.

=== Conventions ===
Several different conventions exist for representing spherical coordinates and prescribing the naming order of their symbols. The 3-tuple number set formula_1 denotes radial distance, the polar angle&quot;inclination&quot;, or as the alternative, &quot;elevation&quot;and the azimuthal angle. It is the common practice within the physics convention, as specified by ISO standard 80000-2:2019, and earlier in ISO 31-11 (1992). 

&quot;As stated above, this article describes the ISO &quot;physics convention&quot;unless otherwise noted.&quot;

However, some authors (including mathematicians) use the symbol &quot;ρ&quot; (rho) for radius, or radial distance, &quot;φ&quot; for inclination (or elevation) and &quot;θ&quot; for azimuthwhile others keep the use of &quot;r&quot; for the radius; all which &quot;provides a logical extension of the usual polar coordinates notation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As to order, some authors list the azimuth &quot;before&quot; the inclination (or the elevation) angle. Some combinations of these choices result in a left-handed coordinate system. The standard &quot;physics convention&quot; 3-tuple set formula_1 conflicts with the usual notation for two-dimensional polar coordinates and three-dimensional cylindrical coordinates, where is often used for the azimuth.

Angles are typically measured in degrees (°) or in radians (rad), where 360° = 2 rad. The use of degrees is most common in geography, astronomy, and engineering, where radians are commonly used in mathematics and theoretical physics. The unit for radial distance is usually determined by the context, as occurs in applications of the &#x27;unit sphere&#x27;, see applications.

When the system is used to designate physical three-space, it is customary to assign positive to azimuth angles measured in the &quot;counterclockwise&quot; sense from the reference direction on the reference planeas seen from the &quot;zenith&quot; side of the plane. This convention is used in particular for geographical coordinates, where the &quot;zenith&quot; direction is north and the positive azimuth (longitude) angles are measured eastwards from some prime meridian.
Note: Easting (), Northing (), Upwardness (). In the case of the local azimuth angle would be measured counterclockwise from to .

=== Unique coordinates ===
Any spherical coordinate triplet (or tuple) formula_1 specifies a single point of three-dimensional space. On the reverse view, any single point has infinitely many equivalent spherical coordinates. That is, the user can add or subtract any number of full turns to the angular measures without changing the angles themselves, and therefore without changing the point. It is convenient in many contexts to use negative radial distances, the convention being formula_7, which is equivalent to formula_8 or formula_9 for any , , and . Moreover, formula_10 is equivalent to formula_11.

When necessary to define a unique set of spherical coordinates for each point, the user must restrict the range, aka interval, of each coordinate. A common choice is:
* radial distance: 
* polar angle: , or ,
* azimuth : , or . 
But instead of the interval , the azimuth is typically restricted to the half-open interval , or radians, which is the standard convention for geographic longitude.

For the polar angle , the range (interval) for inclination is , which is equivalent to elevation range (interval) . In geography, the latitude is the elevation.

Even with these restrictions, if the polar angle (inclination) is 0° or 180°elevation is −90° or +90°then the azimuth angle is arbitrary; and if is zero, both azimuth and polar angles are arbitrary. To define the coordinates as unique, the user can assert the convention that (in these cases) the arbitrary coordinates are set to zero.

=== Plotting ===
To plot any dot from its spherical coordinates , where is inclination, the user would: move units from the origin in the zenith reference direction (z-axis); then rotate by the amount of the azimuth angle () about the origin &quot;from&quot; the designated &quot;azimuth reference&quot; direction, (i.e., either the x or yaxis, see Definition, above); and then rotate &quot;from&quot; the z-axis by the amount of the angle.

== Applications ==
Just as the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is usefulhas a wide set of applicationson a planar surface, a two-dimensional spherical coordinate system is useful on the surface of a sphere. For example, one sphere that is described in &quot;Cartesian coordinates&quot; with the equation can be described in &quot;spherical coordinates&quot; by the simple equation . (In this system&quot;shown here in the mathematics convention&quot;the sphere is adapted as a unit sphere, where the radius is set to unity and then can generally be ignored, see graphic.)

This (unit sphere) simplification is also useful when dealing with objects such as rotational matrices. Spherical coordinates are also useful in analyzing systems that have some degree of symmetry about a point, including: volume integrals inside a sphere; the potential energy field surrounding a concentrated mass or charge; or global weather simulation in a planet&#x27;s atmosphere.
Three dimensional modeling of loudspeaker output patterns can be used to predict their performance. A number of polar plots are required, taken at a wide selection of frequencies, as the pattern changes greatly with frequency. Polar plots help to show that many loudspeakers tend toward omnidirectionality at lower frequencies.

An important application of spherical coordinates provides for the separation of variables in two partial differential equationsthe Laplace and the Helmholtz equationsthat arise in many physical problems. The angular portions of the solutions to such equations take the form of spherical harmonics. Another application is ergonomic design, where is the arm length of a stationary person and the angles describe the direction of the arm as it reaches out. The spherical coordinate system is also commonly used in 3D game development to rotate the camera around the player&#x27;s position

=== In geography ===

Instead of inclination, the geographic coordinate system uses elevation angle (or &quot;latitude&quot;), in the range (aka domain) and rotated north from the equator plane. Latitude (i.e., &quot;the angle&quot; of latitude) may be either &quot;geocentric latitude&quot;, measured (rotated) from the Earth&#x27;s centerand designated variously by or &quot;geodetic latitude&quot;, measured (rotated) from the observer&#x27;s local vertical, and typically designated .
The polar angle (inclination), which is 90° minus the latitude and ranges from 0 to 180°, is called &quot;colatitude&quot; in geography.

The azimuth angle (or &quot;longitude&quot;) of a given position on Earth, commonly denoted by , is measured in degrees east or west from some conventional reference meridian (most commonly the IERS Reference Meridian); thus its domain (or range) is and a given reading is typically designated &quot;East&quot; or &quot;West&quot;. For positions on the Earth or other solid celestial body, the reference plane is usually taken to be the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. 

Instead of the radial distance geographers commonly use &quot;altitude&quot; above or below some local reference surface (&quot;vertical datum&quot;), which, for example, may be the mean sea level. When needed, the radial distance can be computed from the altitude by adding the radius of Earth, which is approximately .

However, modern geographical coordinate systems are quite complex, and the positions implied by these simple formulae may be inaccurate by several kilometers. The precise standard meanings of &quot;latitude, longitude&quot; and &quot;altitude&quot; are currently defined by the World Geodetic System (WGS), and take into account the flattening of the Earth at the poles (about ) and many other details.

Planetary coordinate systems use formulations analogous to the geographic coordinate system.

=== In astronomy ===
A series of astronomical coordinate systems are used to measure the elevation angle from several fundamental planes. These reference planes include: 
the observer&#x27;s horizon, the galactic equator (defined by the rotation of the Milky Way), the celestial equator (defined by Earth&#x27;s rotation), the plane of the ecliptic (defined by Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun), and the plane of the earth terminator (normal to the instantaneous direction to the Sun).

== Coordinate system conversions ==

As the spherical coordinate system is only one of many three-dimensional coordinate systems, there exist equations for converting coordinates between the spherical coordinate system and others.

=== Cartesian coordinates ===
The spherical coordinates of a point in the ISO convention (i.e. for physics: radius , inclination , azimuth ) can be obtained from its Cartesian coordinates by the formulae

formula_12

The inverse tangent denoted in must be suitably defined, taking into account the correct quadrant of , as done in the equations above. See the article on atan2.

Alternatively, the conversion can be considered as two sequential rectangular to polar conversions: the first in the Cartesian plane from to , where is the projection of onto the -plane, and the second in the Cartesian -plane from to . The correct quadrants for and are implied by the correctness of the planar rectangular to polar conversions.

These formulae assume that the two systems have the same origin, that the spherical reference plane is the Cartesian plane, that is inclination from the direction, and that the azimuth angles are measured from the Cartesian axis (so that the axis has ). If &quot;θ&quot; measures elevation from the reference plane instead of inclination from the zenith the arccos above becomes an arcsin, and the and below become switched.

Conversely, the Cartesian coordinates may be retrieved from the spherical coordinates (&quot;radius&quot; , &quot;inclination&quot; , &quot;azimuth&quot; ), where , , , by
formula_13

=== Cylindrical coordinates ===

Cylindrical coordinates (&quot;axial&quot; &quot;radius&quot; &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;azimuth&quot; &quot;φ&quot;, &quot;elevation&quot; &quot;z&quot;) may be converted into spherical coordinates (&quot;central radius&quot; &quot;r&quot;, &quot;inclination&quot; &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;azimuth&quot; &quot;φ&quot;), by the formulas

formula_14

Conversely, the spherical coordinates may be converted into cylindrical coordinates by the formulae

formula_15

These formulae assume that the two systems have the same origin and same reference plane, measure the azimuth angle in the same senses from the same axis, and that the spherical angle is inclination from the cylindrical axis.

== Generalization ==

It is also possible to deal with ellipsoids in Cartesian coordinates by using a modified version of the spherical coordinates. 

Let P be an ellipsoid specified by the level set

formula_16

The modified spherical coordinates of a point in P in the ISO convention (i.e. for physics: &quot;radius&quot; , &quot;inclination&quot; , &quot;azimuth&quot; ) can be obtained from its Cartesian coordinates by the formulae

formula_17

An infinitesimal volume element is given by

formula_18

The square-root factor comes from the property of the determinant that allows a constant to be pulled out from a column:

formula_19

== Integration and differentiation in spherical coordinates ==
The following equations (Iyanaga 1977) assume that the colatitude is the inclination from the positive axis, as in the &quot;physics convention&quot; discussed.

The line element for an infinitesimal displacement from to is
formula_20
where
formula_21
are the local orthogonal unit vectors in the directions of increasing , , and , respectively,
and , , and are the unit vectors in Cartesian coordinates. The linear transformation to this right-handed coordinate triplet is a rotation matrix,
formula_22

This gives the transformation from the Cartesian to the spherical, the other way around is given by its inverse.
Note: the matrix is an orthogonal matrix, that is, its inverse is simply its transpose.

The Cartesian unit vectors are thus related to the spherical unit vectors by:
formula_23

The general form of the formula to prove the differential line element, is
formula_24
that is, the change in formula_25 is decomposed into individual changes corresponding to changes in the individual coordinates. 

To apply this to the present case, one needs to calculate how formula_25 changes with each of the coordinates. In the conventions used, 
formula_27

Thus,
formula_28

The desired coefficients are the magnitudes of these vectors:
formula_29

The surface element spanning from to and to on a spherical surface at (constant) radius is then
formula_30

Thus the differential solid angle is
formula_31

The surface element in a surface of polar angle constant (a cone with vertex at the origin) is
formula_32

The surface element in a surface of azimuth constant (a vertical half-plane) is
formula_33

The volume element spanning from to , to , and to is specified by the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives, 
formula_34
namely 
formula_35

Thus, for example, a function can be integrated over every point in by the triple integral
formula_36

The del operator in this system leads to the following expressions for the gradient and Laplacian for scalar fields,
formula_37And it leads to the following expressions for the divergence and curl of vector fields,

formula_38formula_39

Further, the inverse Jacobian in Cartesian coordinates is
formula_40
The metric tensor in the spherical coordinate system is formula_41.

== Distance in spherical coordinates ==
In spherical coordinates, given two points with being the azimuthal coordinate
formula_42
The distance between the two points can be expressed as
formula_43

== Kinematics ==
In spherical coordinates, the position of a point or particle (although better written as a tripleformula_44) can be written as
formula_45
Its velocity is then
formula_46
and its acceleration is
formula_47

The angular momentum is 
formula_48
Where formula_49 is mass. In the case of a constant or else , this reduces to vector calculus in polar coordinates.

The corresponding angular momentum operator then follows from the phase-space reformulation of the above,
formula_50

The torque is given as
formula_51

The kinetic energy is given as
formula_52

<doc id="29185" wikidata="Q292496" url="?curid=29185" title="GAM-87 Skybolt">
<text>The Douglas GAM-87 Skybolt (AGM-48 under the 1963 Tri-service system) was an air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) developed by the United States during the late 1950s. The basic concept was to allow US strategic bombers to launch their weapons from well outside the range of Soviet defenses, as much as from their targets. To do this in an air-launched form, a lightweight thermonuclear warhead was needed. Initially, the W47 from the Polaris missile was selected, but it was later replaced by the W59 from the Minuteman missile.

The UK joined the Skybolt program in 1960, intending to use it on their V bomber force. When the design added a star tracker in addition to its inertial navigation system (INS) this meant that it could only be carried externally where the tracker could see the sky. This requirement along with the required ground clearance on takeoff limited it to the Avro Vulcan bomber. Several design decisions in the W47 led the RAF to question its safety, so they intended to use their own Red Snow warheads. This was a heavier warhead and would reduce the range to about , meaning the bombers would have to cross the Soviet coastline to attack Moscow.

Testing began in 1962 and was initially marked by a string of failures. These failures, along with a lack of mission after the successful development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), led to its cancellation in December 1962. The UK had decided to base its entire 1960s deterrent force on Skybolt, and its cancellation led to a major disagreement between the UK and US, known today as the &quot;Skybolt Crisis&quot;. This was resolved by a series of meetings that led to the Royal Navy gaining the UGM-27 Polaris missile and construction of the s to launch them.

==History==
===Background===
The US Air Force had built up an enormous fleet of strategic bombers during the 1950s, only to see them threatened by the possibility of a surprise attack by Soviet ICBMs. As the US bombers were located at only a small number of air bases, a relatively small fleet of missiles could attack all of them at once. The US had been developing its own ICBMs as well, but early models, like the SM-65 Atlas, required some time to prepare to launch from their surface launchers and were vulnerable to sneak air attack. A carefully timed attack from Soviet bombers against US missiles and their ICBMs against US bomber fields could inflict serious damage.

The one weapon system that was not open to attack was the US Navy&#x27;s Polaris missile system. The Polaris equipped submarines could cruise in large areas of the Atlantic or Pacific where the Soviet fleet was unable to find them, and launch their missiles with impunity. If the goal of the nuclear force was to maintain deterrence by ensuring that a counterstrike would be launched, Polaris met this goal in a way the existing Air Force fleet could not. This fact was more worrying to the Air Force than the Soviet arsenal and generated a number of internal reports on how to deal with this threat to their dominance in the strategic field.

===WS-199 and WS-138===
In response, in 1957 the Air Force began studying solutions to the &quot;Puzzle of Polaris&quot; under the WS-199 program. WS-199 was a grab-bag effort, studying anything that might improve the survivability of the Air Force strike capability. Primary among the concepts were two air-launched ballistic missiles, Bold Orion and High Virgo. These systems would give the Air Force a method somewhat similar to the Navy&#x27;s; in times of high alert, the bomber force would be sent to holding positions far outside the range of any Soviet defenses, and then launch their missiles on command. Using aerial refueling, a bomber might be expected to be able to loiter for as long as a day.

This system had a major advantage compared to Polaris, as the aircraft could be sent radio instructions to retarget the missiles before launch. In theory, the bombers could be used as a second-strike weapon, attacking only those targets that had been missed in a first-strike, or alternately, being switched from counterforce to countervalue targets or vice versa. Ground-based systems like Atlas and Polaris lacked this ability, and could only be retargeted with a significant amount of effort. Even the latest Air Force design, the LGM-30 Minuteman, required changes in targeting data to be loaded from magnetic tape in a process that took several weeks.

WS-199 was generally successful, but the two ALBMs had a shorter range than desired. The Air Force tendered bids for a longer-range version in early 1959. Douglas Aircraft received the prime contract in May, and in turn subcontracted to Northrop for the guidance system, Aerojet for the propulsion system, and General Electric for the reentry vehicle. The system was initially known as WS-138A and was given the official name GAM-87 Skybolt in 1960.

===British involvement===
At the same time, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was having problems with their MRBM missile project, the Blue Streak, which was long overdue. Even if this was successful it faced the serious problem of basing. No fixed land-based missile system could be credibly installed in the British Isles; they were well within the range of Soviet air strikes. The limited land mass available meant it would be relatively easy for missile sites to be spotted no matter what security measures were taken, and flying time for a jet bomber from the coast to any potential inland location would be on the order of minutes.

This left the deterrent based on their own bomber force, the V bomber fleet, which the RAF had already long concluded would be unable to penetrate Soviet defenses by about 1960. The RAF was in the process of introducing their own stand-off missile, the ranged Mach 3 Blue Steel. While capable, the missile flew at altitudes and speeds that left it vulnerable to improving SAMs, and it had a number of reliability and serviceability issues that made it less than ideal. A faster, longer-ranged version was being talked about, Blue Steel II, but it would be some time before it could enter service.

The long-range Skybolt would eliminate the need for both the Blue Streak and the Blue Steel II. Blue Steel II was canceled in December 1959 and the British Cabinet decided in February 1960 to cancel Blue Streak as well. Prime Minister Macmillan met President Eisenhower in March 1960 and agreed to purchase 144 Skybolts for the RAF. By agreement, British funding for research and development was limited to that required to modify the V bombers to take the missile, but the British were allowed to fit their own warheads. In exchange, the Americans were given nuclear submarine basing facilities in Scotland. Following the agreement, the Blue Streak program was formally canceled in April 1960 and in May 1960 an agreement for an initial order of 100 Skybolts was concluded.

Avro was made an associate contractor to manage the Skybolt program for the United Kingdom and four different schemes were submitted to find a platform for the missile. A number of different aircraft were considered, including a variant of the Vickers VC10 airliner and two of the current V bombers, the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. It was decided to use the Vulcan to initially carry two missiles each on hardpoints outboard of the main landing gear.

===Development and testing===

During development, it was decided that the system could not reach the required accuracy at the desired range without improvements to the guidance system. This led to the introduction of a star tracker platform that would enhance the existing inertial navigation system. For this role, the system had to be capable of tracking bright stars in direct sunlight, a challenging requirement. Star trackers have to be provided with a relatively accurate location in order to point their trackers at selected stars. Over a long flight, the INS would drift too much to provide the needed accuracy. Instead, the tracker has to be able to track the stars during flight, continually updating the INS.

This change meant that the missile could only be carried in locations where the front of the missile could continually observe the sky. This had always been the case on the USAF&#x27;s B-52 bombers, where they were carried under the narrow-chord wings and the nose projected out in front. But this presented a problem for some of the UK designs, especially the Victor, where the layout of the wing, engines and landing gear left the mounting point behind the massive wing&#x27;s leading edge. As Valiant had limited range, the decision was made to move forward only with Vulcan, where its mounting points allowed the nose of the missile to project in front of this aircraft&#x27;s delta wing.

By 1961, several test articles were ready for testing from B-52s, with drop tests starting in January. In January 1961 a Vulcan visited the Douglas plant at Santa Monica, California, to ensure the modifications to the aircraft were electrically compatible with the missile. In Britain, compatibility trials with mockups started on the Vulcan.

Testing started with unpowered drop tests to ensure safe separating from the launch aircraft. Powered tests started in April 1962, but the test series went badly, with the first five trials ending in failure. The first fully successful flight occurred on 19 December 1962.

===Cancellation===
By this point, the value of the Skybolt system in the US had been seriously eroded. The Polaris had recently gone into service, with overall capabilities similar to Skybolt, but with &quot;loiter&quot; times on the order of months instead of hours. The US Air Force was well into the process of developing the Minuteman missile, whose improved accuracy reduced the need for any bomber attacks. Robert McNamara was particularly opposed to the bomber force and repeatedly stated he felt that the combination of SLBMs and ICBMs would render them useless. He pressed for the cancellation of Skybolt as unnecessary.

The British had canceled all other projects to concentrate fully on Skybolt. When McNamara informed them that they were considering canceling the program in November 1962, a firestorm of protest broke out in the House of Commons. Jo Grimond noted &quot;Does not this mark the absolute failure of the policy of the independent deterrent? Is it not the case that everybody else in the world knew this, except the Conservative Party in this country?&quot; President Kennedy officially cancelled the program on 22 December 1962.

As the political row grew into a major crisis, an emergency meeting between parties from the US and UK was called, leading to the Nassau agreement. Over the next few days a new plan was hammered out that saw the UK purchase the Polaris SLBM, but equipped with British warheads that lacked the dual-key system. The UK would thus retain its independent deterrent force, although its control passed from the RAF largely to the Royal Navy. The Polaris, a much better weapon system for the UK, was a major &quot;scoop&quot; and has been referred to as &quot;almost the bargain of the century&quot;. The RAF kept a tactical nuclear capability with the WE.177 which armed V bombers and later the Panavia Tornado force.

A B-52G launched the last XGAM-87A missile at the Atlantic Missile Range a day after the program was canceled. In June 1963, the XGAM-87A was redesignated as XAGM-48A.

==Description==
The GAM-87 was powered by a two-stage solid-fuel rocket motor. The missile was fitted with a tailcone to reduce drag while on the pylon, which was ejected shortly after being dropped from the plane. After first stage burnout, the Skybolt coasted for a while before the second stage ignited. First stage control was by eight movable tail fins, while the second stage was equipped with a gimballed nozzle.

Guidance was entirely by inertial platform. The current position was constantly updated from the host aircraft through accurate fixes, meaning that the accuracy of the platform inside the missile was not as critical.

B-52s were to carry four missiles, two under each wing on the weapons pylon with a dual launcher adapter with the missiles slightly staggered (inboard missile slightly ahead of the outboard missile). The Vulcan carried two missiles, one each on smaller underwing pylons.

<text>The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), derisively nicknamed the Star Wars program, was a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic nuclear missiles. The program was announced in 1983, by President Ronald Reagan. Reagan called for a system that would render nuclear weapons obsolete, and to end the doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD), which he described as a &quot;suicide pact&quot;. Elements of the program reemerged in 2019 under the Space Development Agency (SDA).

The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the US Department of Defense to oversee development. Advanced weapon concepts, including lasers, particle-beam weapons, and ground and space-based missile systems were studied, along with sensor, command and control, and computer systems needed to control a system consisting of hundreds of combat centers and satellites spanning the globe. The US held a significant advantage in advanced missile defense systems through decades of extensive research and testing. Several concepts, technologies and insights obtained were transferred to subsequent programs. Under SDIO&#x27;s Innovative Sciences and Technology Office, investment was made in basic research at national laboratories, universities, and in industry. These programs have continued to be key sources of funding for research scientists in particle physics, supercomputing/computation, advanced materials, and other critical science and engineering disciplines.

In 1987, the American Physical Society concluded that the technologies were decades away from readiness, and at least another decade of research was required to know whether such a system was even possible. After the publication of the APS report, SDI&#x27;s budget was cut. By the late 1980s, the effort had re-focused on the &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot; concept using small orbiting missiles.

SDI was derisively nicknamed the &quot;Star Wars&quot; program, and criticized for threatening to destabilize the MAD-approach, and to re-ignite &quot;an offensive arms race&quot;. In a 1986 speech, Senator Joe Biden said, &quot;Star Wars represents a fundamental assault on the concepts, alliances and arms-control agreements that have buttressed American security for several decades, and the president’s continued adherence to it constitutes one of the most reckless and irresponsible acts in the history of modern statecraft.&quot;

Declassified intelligence material revealed that through the potential neutralization of its arsenal and resulting loss of a balancing power factor, SDI was a cause of grave concern for the Soviet Union and its successor state Russia. Following the Cold War when nuclear arsenals were shrinking, political support for SDI collapsed. SDI ended in 1993, when the Clinton administration redirected the efforts towards theatre ballistic missiles and renamed the agency the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO).

In 2019, elements, specifically the observation portions, of the program re-emerged with President Trump&#x27;s signing of the National Defense Authorization Act. The program is managed by the Space Development Agency (SDA) as part of the new National Defense Space Architecture (NDSA). CIA Director Mike Pompeo called for additional funding to achieve a full-fledged &quot;Strategic Defense Initiative for our time, the SDI II&quot; though it is unclear what this had to do with SDA.

==History==
===National BMD===
The US Army considered the issue of ballistic missile defense (BMD) after World War II. Studies suggested that attacking a V-2 rocket would be difficult because the flight time was so short that it would leave little time to forward information through command and control networks to missile batteries. Bell Labs pointed out that although longer-range missiles flew much faster, their longer flight times would ease the timing issue and their high altitudes would ease long-range radar detection.

This led to a series of projects including Nike Zeus, Nike-X, Sentinel and ultimately the Safeguard Program, all aimed at developing a system to defend against attacks by Soviet ICBMs. The programs proliferated because of the changing threat; the Soviets claimed to be producing missiles &quot;like sausages&quot;, and ever-more missiles would be needed to defend against their fleet. Low-cost countermeasures such as radar decoys required additional interceptors. An early estimate suggested $20 spent on defense would be required for every $1 the Soviets spent on offense. The addition of MIRV in the late 1960s further moved the balance in favor of offensive systems. This massively skewed cost-exchange ratio prompted observers to propose that an arms race was inevitable.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked ARPA to consider alternative concepts. Their Project Defender studied many approaches before concentrating on Project BAMBI. BAMBI used satellites carrying interceptors that would attack the Soviet ICBMs upon launch. This boost phase intercept rendered MIRV impotent; a successful attack would destroy all of the warheads. Unfortunately, the operational cost of such a system was so large that the US Air Force rejected the concepts. Development was cancelled in 1963.

During this period, the entire topic of BMD became increasingly controversial. Early deployment plans were met with little interest, but by the late 1960s, public meetings on the Sentinel system were met by thousands of angry protesters. After thirty years of effort, only one such system was built; a single base of the original Safeguard system became operational in April 1975, but was closed in February 1976.

A Soviet military A-35 anti-ballistic missile system was deployed around Moscow to intercept enemy ballistic missiles targeting the city or its surrounding areas. The A-35 was the only Soviet ABM system allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In development since the 1960s and in operation from 1971 until the 1990s, it featured the nuclear-tipped A350 exoatmospheric interceptor missile.

===Lead up to SDI===


George Shultz, Reagan&#x27;s secretary of state, suggested that a 1967 lecture by physicist Edward Teller was an important precursor to SDI. In the lecture, Teller talked about the idea of defending against nuclear missiles using nuclear weapons, principally the W65 and W71, with the latter an enhanced thermal/X-ray device used on the Spartan missile in 1975. Held at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the 1967 lecture was attended by Reagan shortly after he became governor of California.

Development of laser weapons in the Soviet Union began in 1964–1965. Though classified at the time, a detailed study on a Soviet space-based laser system began no later than 1976 with the Polyus, a 1 MW Carbon dioxide laser-based orbital weapons platform prototype. Development was also started on the anti-satellite &quot;Kaskad&quot; in-orbit missile platform.

A revolver cannon (Rikhter R-23) was mounted on the 1974 Soviet Salyut 3 space station, a satellite that successfully test-fired its cannon in orbit.

In 1979, Teller contributed to a Hoover Institution publication where he claimed that the US would be facing an emboldened USSR due to their work on civil defense. Two years later at a conference in Italy, he made the same claims about their ambitions, now emboldened by new space-based weapons. According to popular opinion, shared by author Frances FitzGerald, no evidence validated that such research was carried out. Instead, Teller was promoting his latest weapon, the X-ray laser that was finding only limited funding, his speech in Italy was a new attempt to synthsize a missile gap.

In 1979, Reagan visited the NORAD command base, Cheyenne Mountain Complex, where he was introduced to the extensive tracking and detection systems extending throughout the world and into space; however, he was struck by their comments that while they could track the attack down to the individual targets, they could not stop it. Reagan felt that in the event of an attack, this would place the president in a terrible position, having to choose between immediate counterattack or absorbing the attack while maintaining offensive dominance. Shultz suggested that this feeling of helplessness, coupled with Teller&#x27;s defensive ideas combined to motivate SDI.

In the fall of 1979, at Reagan&#x27;s request, Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham, the former head of the DIA, briefed Reagan on an updated BAMBI he called High Frontier, a missile shield composed of multi-layered ground- and space-based weapons that could track, intercept, and destroy ballistic missiles, theoretically enabled by emerging technologies. It was designed to replace the MAD doctrine. In September 1981, Graham formed a small, Virginia-based think tank called High Frontier to continue research on the missile shield. The Heritage Foundation provided High Frontier with research space, and Graham published a 1982 report entitled, &quot;High Frontier: A New National Strategy&quot; that examined in greater detail how the system would function.

Since the late 1970s, another group had been pushing for the development of a high-powered orbital chemical laser attack ICBMs, the Space Based Laser (SBL). New developments under Project Excalibur by Teller&#x27;s &quot;O-Group&quot; at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(LLNL) suggested that a single X-ray laser could shoot down dozens of missiles with a single shot. The groups began to meet in order to prepare their plans for the incoming president.

The group met with Reagan several times during 1981 and 1982, apparently with little effect, while the buildup of new offensive weaponry like the B-1 Lancer and MX missile continued. However, in early 1983, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with the president and outlined the reasons why they might consider shifting some of the funding from the offensive side to new defensive systems.

According to a 1983 US Interagency Intelligence Assessment, good evidence indicated that in the late 1960s the Soviets were devoting serious thought to both explosive and non-explosive nuclear power sources for lasers.

==Project and proposals==
=== Announcement ===
On March 23, 1983, Reagan announced SDI in a nationally televised speech, stating &quot;I call upon the scientific community in this country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.&quot;

=== Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) ===
In 1984, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was established to oversee the program, which was headed by Lt. General James Alan Abrahamson USAF, a past Director of the Space Shuttle program.

In addition to original Heritage ideas, other concepts were considered. Notable among these were particle-beam weapons, updated versions of nuclear shaped charges, and various plasma weapons. SDIO invested in computer systems, component miniaturization, and sensors.

Initially, the program focused on large-scale systems designed to defeat a massive Soviet offensive strike. For this mission, SDIO concentrated almost entirely on &quot;high tech&quot; solutions like lasers. Graham&#x27;s proposal was repeatedly rejected by members of the Heritage group as well as within SDIO; when asked about it in 1985, Abrahamson suggested that the concept was underdeveloped and was not considered.

By 1986, many of the promising ideas were failing. Teller&#x27;s X-ray laser, run under Project Excalibur, failed several key tests in 1986 and was targeted to the anti-satellite role. The particle beam concept was demonstrated to basically not work, as was the case with several other concepts. Only the Space-Based Laser seemed to have any hope of developing in the short term, but it was growing in size due to its fuel consumption.

=== APS report ===
The American Physical Society (APS) had been asked by SDIO to provide a review of the various concepts. They put together an all-star panel including many of the inventors of the laser, including a Nobel laureate. Their initial report was presented in 1986, but was released to the public (in redacted form) in early 1987.

The report considered all of the systems then under development and concluded none of them were anywhere near ready for deployment. Specifically, they noted that all of the systems had to improve their energy output by at least 100 times, and in some cases by as much as a million. In other cases, like Excalibur, they dismissed the concept entirely. Their summary stated simply:

We estimate that all existing candidates for directed energy weapons (DEWs) require two or more orders of magnitude, (powers of 10) improvements in power output and beam quality before they may be seriously considered for application in ballistic missile defense systems.

They concluded that none of the systems could be deployed as an anti-missile system until the next century.

===Strategic Defense System===
Faced with this report and accompanying negative press, SDIO changed direction. Beginning in late 1986, Abrahamson proposed that SDI would be based on the system he had previously dismissed, a version of High Frontier now named the &quot;Strategic Defense System, Phase I Architecture&quot;. The name implied that the concept would be replaced by more advanced systems in future phases.

Strategic Defense System (SDS) was the low-earth orbit (LEO) Smart Rocks concept with an added layer of ground-based missiles sited in the US. These missiles were intended to attack warheads that the Smart Rocks missed. In order to track them below the radar horizon, SDS added more LEO satellites that would feed tracking information to both the space-based &quot;garages&quot; as well as the ground-based missiles. Later ground-based systems trace derived from this concept.

LLNL then introduced the Brilliant Pebbles concept. This was essentially the combination of the sensors on the garage satellites and the tracking stations. Advancements in sensors and microprocessors allowed this to be packaged in a small missile nose cone. Subsequent studies suggested that this approach would be cheaper, easier to launch and more resistant to counterattack, and in 1990 Brilliant Pebbles was selected as the baseline model for SDS Phase 1.

=== Global Protection Against Limited Strikes ===
While SDIO pursued SDS, the Warsaw Pact was rapidly disintegrating, culminating in the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989. One of the many reports on SDS considered these events and suggested that a massive defense against a Soviet launch would become unnecessary. However, short and medium range missile technology would likely proliferate as the Soviet Union disintegrated and sold off its hardware. One of the core ideas behind Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) was that the Soviet Union would not always be the aggressor and the United States would not always be the target.

Instead of a heavy defense aimed at ICBMs, this report suggested realigning GPALS deployment. Against novel threats the Brilliant Pebbles would have limited utility, largely because the missiles fired for only a short period and the warheads did not rise high enough for them to be easily tracked by a satellite above them. GPALS thus added a mobile ground-based missile and more low-orbit satellites known as Brilliant Eyes to feed the Pebbles.

GPALS was approved by President George H.W. Bush in 1991. The system would cut the proposed costs of the SDI system from $53 billion to $41 billion over a decade. Instead of attempting to protect against thousands of incoming missiles, GPALS sought to provide protection from up to two hundred nuclear missiles. GPALS was tasked to protect the United States from attacks coming from all different parts of the world.

=== Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) ===
In 1993, the Clinton administration further shifted the focus to ground-based interceptor missiles and theater-scale systems, renaming the SDIO to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO).

In 2002, the George W. Bush administration in turn renamed the BMDO to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), indicating plans for a layered missile defence system that integrates different types of defences, including sea- and ground-based defences.

==Ground-based programs==
===Extended Range Interceptor (ERINT)===
The Extended Range Interceptor (ERINT) program was part of SDI&#x27;s Theater Missile Defense Program and was an extension of the Flexible Lightweight Agile Guided Experiment (FLAGE), which included developing hit-to-kill technology and demonstrating the guidance accuracy of a small, agile, radar-homing vehicle.

FLAGE scored a direct hit against a MGM-52 Lance missile in flight, at White Sands Missile Range in 1987. ERINT was a prototype missile similar to the FLAGE, but it used a new solid-propellant rocket motor that allowed it to fly faster and higher than FLAGE.

ERINT was later chosen as the MIM-104 Patriot (Patriot Advanced Capability-3, PAC-3) missile.

===Homing Overlay Experiment (HOE)===

Given concerns about previous programs&#x27; nuclear-tipped interceptors, in the 1980s the US Army began studies about the feasibility of kinetic hit-to-kill vehicles, i.e. interceptors that would destroy incoming ballistic missiles by colliding with them.

The Homing Overlay Experiment (HOE) was the first such system tested by the Army, and the first successful hit-to-kill intercept of a mock ballistic missile warhead outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

HOE used a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV). The KKV was equipped with an infrared seeker, guidance electronics and a propulsion system. Once in space, the KKV could extend a folded structure similar to an umbrella skeleton of diameter to enhance its effective cross section. This device was intended to destroy an ICBM reentry vehicle on collision.

Four test launches were conducted in 1983 and 1984 at Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands using first two stages of Minuteman missile, M55E1 and M56A1. For each test a Minuteman missile was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California carrying a single mock re-entry vehicle targeted for Kwajalein lagoon more than away.

After test failures with the first three flight tests because of guidance and sensor problems, the DOD reported that the fourth and final test on June 10, 1984, was successful, intercepting the Minuteman RV with a closing speed of about at an altitude of more than .

Although the fourth test was described as a success, the &quot;New York Times&quot; in August 1993 reported that the HOE4 test was rigged to increase the likelihood of success. At the urging of Senator David Pryor, the General Accounting Office investigated the claims and concluded that though steps were taken to make it easier for the interceptor to find its target (including some of those alleged by the &quot;New York Times&quot;), the available data indicated that the interceptor had been successfully guided by its onboard infrared sensors in the collision, and not by an onboard radar guidance system as alleged. Per the GAO report, the net effect of the DOD enhancements increased the infrared signature of the target vessel by 110% over the realistic missile signature initially proposed for the HOE program, but nonetheless the GAO concluded the enhancements to the target vessel were reasonable given the objectives of the program and the geopolitical consequences of its failure. Further, the report concluded that the DOD&#x27;s subsequent statements before Congress about the HOE program &quot;fairly characterize[d]&quot; the success of HOE4, but confirmed that the DOD never disclosed to Congress the enhancements made to the target vessel.

HOE technology was later expanded into the Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle Interception System program.

===ERIS and HEDI===
Developed by Lockheed as part of the ground-based interceptor portion of SDI, the Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle Interceptor Subsystem (ERIS) began in 1985, with at least two tests occurring in the early 1990s. This system was never deployed, but its technology was used in the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and the Ground-Based Interceptor currently deployed as part of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system.

==Directed-energy weapon (DEW) programs==
===X-ray laser===


An early SDI focus was an X-ray laser powered by nuclear explosions. Nuclear explosions give off a burst of X-rays, which the Excalibur concept intended to focus using a lasing medium consisting of metal rods. Many such rods would be placed around a warhead, each aimed at a different ICBM, thus destroying many ICBMs in a single attack. It would cost much less for the US to build another Excalibur than the Soviets would need to build enough new ICBMs to counter it. The idea was first based on satellites, but when it was pointed out that these could be attacked in space, the concept moved to a &quot;pop-up&quot; concept, with the device launched from a submarine off the northern Soviet coast.

However, on March 26, 1983, the first test (known as the Cabra event), was performed in an underground shaft and resulted in marginally positive readings possibly caused by a faulty detector. Since a nuclear explosion was used as the power source, the detector was destroyed during the experiment, and the results therefore could not be confirmed. Technical criticism based upon unclassified calculations suggested that the X-ray laser would be of at best marginal use. Critics often cite the X-ray laser system as SDI&#x27;s primary focus, with its apparent failure warranting opposition to the program.

Despite the apparent failure, the legacy of the X-ray laser program is the knowledge gained from the research. A parallel development program advanced laboratory X-ray lasers for biological imaging such as 3D holograms of living organisms. Other spin-offs include research on advanced materials like SEAgel and Aerogel, the Electron-Beam Ion Trap facility for physics research, and techniques for early detection of breast cancer.

===Chemical laser===
Beginning in 1985, the Air Force tested an SDIO-funded deuterium fluoride laser known as Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) at White Sands Missile Range. During a simulation, the laser successfully destroyed a Titan missile booster in 1985. However, the test setup had the booster shell pressurized and under considerable compression loads. These test conditions were used to simulate the loads a booster would be under during launch. The system was later tested for the US Navy on target drones simulating cruise missiles, with some success. After SDIO closed, MIRACL was tested on an old Air Force satellite for potential use as an anti-satellite weapon, with mixed results. The technology was also used to develop the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) that was tested against in-flight artillery shells.

During the mid-to-late 1980s panel discussions took place at various laser conferences. Proceedings include papers on the status of chemical and other high-power lasers.

The Missile Defense Agency&#x27;s Airborne Laser program used a chemical laser that intercepted a missile taking off, so an offshoot of SDI could be said to have successfully implemented one of the key goals of the program.

===Neutral particle beam===
In July 1989, the Beam Experiments Aboard a Rocket (BEAR) program launched a sounding rocket containing a neutral particle beam (NPB) accelerator. The experiment successfully demonstrated that a particle beam would operate and propagate as predicted outside the atmosphere and that no unexpected side-effects emerged when firing the beam in space. After the rocket was recovered, the particle beam was still operational. According to BMDO, the research on neutral particle beam accelerators, originally funded by SDIO, could eventually be used to reduce the half-life of nuclear waste products using accelerator-driven transmutation technology.

===Laser and mirror experiments===

The High Precision Tracking Experiment (HPTE), launched with the Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-51-G, was tested on June 21, 1985, when a Hawaii-based low-power laser successfully tracked the experiment and bounced the laser off of the HPTE mirror.

The Relay mirror experiment (RME), launched in February 1990, demonstrated critical technologies for space-based relay mirrors that would be used with an SDI directed-energy weapon system. The experiment validated stabilization, tracking, and pointing concepts and proved that a laser could be relayed from the ground to a mirror on an orbiting satellite and back to another ground station with a high degree of accuracy and for extended durations.

Launched on the same rocket as the RME, the Low-power Atmospheric Compensation Experiment (LACE) satellite was built by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to explore atmospheric distortion of lasers and real-time adaptive compensation. The LACE satellite included several other experiments to help develop and improve SDI sensors, including target discrimination using background radiation and tracking ballistic missiles using Ultraviolet Plume Imaging (UVPI). LACE was also used to evaluate ground-based adaptive optics, a technique now used in civilian telescopes to remove atmospheric distortions.

===Hypervelocity Railgun (CHECMATE)===
Research on hypervelocity railgun technology was conducted to build an information base about railguns. The SDI railgun investigation, called the Compact High Energy Capacitor Module Advanced Technology Experiment, was able to fire two projectiles per day during the initiative. This represented a significant improvement over previous efforts, which were only able to achieve about one shot per month. Hypervelocity railguns are, at least conceptually, an attractive alternative to a space-based defense system because of their envisioned ability to quickly shoot at many targets. Also, since only the projectile leaves the gun, a railgun system can potentially fire many times before needing to be resupplied.

A hypervelocity railgun works like a particle accelerator, converting electrical potential energy into kinetic energy for the projectile. A conductive pellet (the projectile) is attracted down the rails by electric current flowing through a rail. Through magnetic forces, a force is exerted on the projectile moving it down the rail. Railguns can generate muzzle-velocities in excess of .

Railguns face a host of technical challenges to be ready for battlefield deployment. First, the rails guiding the projectile must carry sufficient power. Each firing of the railgun sends tremendous current flow (almost half a million amperes) through the rails, causing rapid erosion of the rail&#x27;s surfaces (through ohmic heating), and even vaporization of the rail surface. Early prototypes were essentially single-use weapons, requiring complete rail replacement rails after each firing. Another challenge is projectile survivability. The projectiles experience acceleration force in excess of 100,000 g. To be effective, the fired projectile must first survive the mechanical stress of firing and the thermal effects of a trip through the atmosphere at many times the speed of sound hitting its target. Any on-board guidance would require the onboard navigation system to be built to the same level of sturdiness as the main mass of the projectile.

In addition to destroying ballistic missile threats, railguns were also planned for service in space platform (sensor and battle station) defense. This potential role reflected defense planner expectations that future railguns would be capable of rapid fire and on the order of tens to hundreds of shots.

==Space-based programs==
===Space-Based Interceptor===
The Space-Based Interceptor (SBI) concept involved groups of interceptors housed in orbital modules. Hover testing was completed in 1988 and demonstrated integration of the sensor and propulsion systems. It demonstrated the ability of the seeker to shift its aiming point from a rocket&#x27;s hot plume to its cool body, a first for infrared ABM seekers. Final hover testing occurred in 1992 using miniaturized components similar to those that would have been used in an operational interceptor. These prototypes eventually evolved into Brilliant Pebbles.

===Brilliant Pebbles===
Brilliant Pebbles was a non-nuclear system of satellite-based interceptors designed to use high-velocity, watermelon-sized, teardrop-shaped tungsten projectiles as kinetic warheads. It was designed to operate in conjunction with the Brilliant Eyes sensor system. The project was conceived in November 1986 by Lowell Wood at LLNL. Detailed studies were undertaken by several advisory boards, including the Defense Science Board and JASON, in 1989.

The Pebbles were designed so that autonomous operation was possible without external guidance from planned SDI sensor systems. This was attractive as a cost saving measure, as it would allow scaling back of those systems, and was estimated to save $7 to $13 billion versus the standard Phase I Architecture. Brilliant Pebbles later became the centerpiece under the Bush Administration.

John H. Nuckolls, LLNL director from 1988 to 1994, described the system as &quot;The crowning achievement of the Strategic Defense Initiative&quot;. The sensors and cameras developed for Brilliant Pebbles systems became components of the Clementine mission.

Though regarded as one of the most capable SDI systems, Brilliant Pebbles was canceled in 1994 by BMDO.

==Sensor programs==

SDIO sensor research encompassed visible light, ultraviolet, infrared, and radar technologies, and eventually led to the Clementine mission though that mission occurred just after the program transitioned to the BMDO. Like other parts of SDI, the sensor system initially was very large-scale, but after the Soviet threat diminished it was cut back.

=== Boost Surveillance and Tracking System ===
Boost Surveillance and Tracking System (BSTS) was part of SDIO in the late 1980s, and was designed to detect missile launches, especially during the boost phase; however, once the SDI program shifted toward theater missile defense in the early 1990s, the system left SDIO control and was transferred to the Air Force.

===Space Surveillance and Tracking System===

Space Surveillance and Tracking System (SSTS) was a system originally designed for tracking mid-course ballistic missiles. It was designed to work in conjunction with BSTS but was later scaled down in favor of Brilliant Eyes.

===Brilliant Eyes===
Brilliant Eyes was a simpler derivative of SSTS that focused on theater ballistic missiles rather than ICBMs and was meant to operate in conjunction with Brilliant Pebbles.

Brilliant Eyes was renamed Space and Missile Tracking System (SMTS) and scaled back further under BMDO, and in the late 1990s it became the low earth orbit component of the Air Force&#x27;s Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS).

===Other sensor experiments===
The Delta 183 program used a satellite known as Delta Star to test sensor-related technologies. Delta Star carried a thermographic camera, a long-wave infrared imager, an ensemble of imagers and photometers covering several visible and ultraviolet bands as well as a laser detector and ranging device. The satellite observed several ballistic missile launches including some releasing liquid propellant as a detection countermeasure.

==Countermeasures==
In war-fighting, countermeasures encompass multiple meanings:

* Immediate tactical action to reduce vulnerability, such as chaff, decoys, and maneuvering
* Counter strategies that exploit a weakness of an opposing system, such as adding more warheads that are less expensive than the interceptors fired against them.
* Defense suppression - that is, attacking elements of the defensive system.

Countermeasures have long been a key part of warfighting strategy; however, with SDI they attained a special prominence due to the system cost, scenario of a massive sophisticated attack, strategic consequences of a less-than-perfect defense, basing many proposed weapons systems in space, and political debate.

Whereas the United States national missile defense system targets a relatively limited and unsophisticated attack, SDI planned for a massive attack by a sophisticated opponent. This raised significant issues about economic and technical costs associated with defending against anti-ballistic missile defense countermeasures used by the attacking side.

For example, if it had been much cheaper to add attacking warheads than to add defenses, an attacker of similar economic power could have simply outproduced the defender. The &quot;cost effective at the margin&quot; requirement was first formulated by Paul Nitze in November 1985.

In addition, SDI envisioned many space-based systems in fixed orbits, ground-based sensors, command, control and communications facilities, etc. In theory, an advanced opponent could have targeted those, in turn requiring self-defense capability or increased numbers to compensate for attrition.

A sophisticated attacker having the technology to use decoys, shielding, maneuvering warheads, defense suppression, or other countermeasures would have multiplied the difficulty and cost of intercepting the real warheads. SDI design and operational planning had to factor in these countermeasures and the associated cost.

==Response from the Soviet Union==

SDI failed to dissuade the USSR from investing in development of ballistic missiles. The Soviet response to SDI from March 1983 through November 1985 provided indications of their view of the program both as a threat and as an opportunity to weaken NATO. SDI was likely seen not only as a threat to the physical security of the Soviet Union, but also as part of a larger effort by the United States to seize the strategic initiative in arms control by neutralizing the military component of Soviet strategy. The Kremlin expressed concerns that space-based missile defenses would make nuclear war inevitable.

A major objective of that strategy was the political separation of Western Europe from the United States, which the Soviets sought to facilitate by aggravating allied concern over the SDI&#x27;s potential implications for European security and economic interests. The Soviet predisposition to see deception behind SDI was reinforced by their assessment of US intentions and capabilities and the utility of military deception in furthering the achievement of political goals.

In 1986 Carl Sagan summarized what he heard Soviet commentators saying about SDI. They commonly expressed the notion that SDI was equivalent to starting an economic war through a defensive arms race to further cripple the Soviet economy with extra military spending. Another common Soviet perception suggested that SDI served as a disguise for a US desire to initiate a first strike on the Soviet Union.

Though classified at the time, a detailed study on a Soviet space-based LASER system began no later than 1976 as the &quot;Skif&quot;, a 1 MW carbon dioxide laser along with the anti-satellite &quot;Kaskad&quot;, an in-orbit missile platform. The devices were reportedly designed to pre-emptively destroy US satellites that might be launched in the future that could otherwise aid US missile defense.
Terra-3 was a Soviet laser testing centre, located on the Sary Shagan anti-ballistic missile (ABM) testing range in the Karaganda Region of Kazakhstan. It was originally built to test missile defense concepts. In 1984, officials within the United States Department of Defense (DoD) suggested it was the site of a prototypical anti-satellite weapon system.

In 1987 a disguised Mir space station module was lifted on the inaugural flight of the Energia booster as the Polyus. It was later revealed that this craft housed a number of Skif lasers, intended to be clandestinely tested in orbit. However, the spacecraft&#x27;s attitude control system malfunctioned upon separation from the booster, and it failed to reach orbit. More tentatively, it is also suggested that the Zarya module of the International Space Station, capable of station keeping and providing sizable battery power, was initially developed to power the Skif laser system.

The Polyus was a prototype of the Skif orbital weapons platform designed to destroy satellites with a megawatt carbon-dioxide laser. Soviet motivations behind attempting to launch components of the Skif laser in the form of Polyus were, according to interviews conducted years later, more for propaganda purposes in the prevailing climate of focus on US SDI, than as an effective defense technology, as the phrase &quot;Space based laser&quot; has political capital.

== Post-Soviet ==
In 2014, a declassified CIA paper stated that &quot;In response to SDI, Moscow threatened a variety of military countermeasures in lieu of developing a parallel missile defense system&quot;.

In January 2025 President Donald Trump ordered the building of a national &quot;Iron Dome&quot; missile defense shield. 

==Controversy and criticism==
Jessica Savitch reported on the technology in episode No.111 of &quot;Frontline&quot;, &quot;Space: The Race for High Ground&quot;, on November 4, 1983. The opening sequence shows Jessica Savitch seated next to a laser that she used to destroy a model of a communication satellite. The demonstration was perhaps the first televised use of a weapons-grade laser. No theatrical effects were used. The model was actually destroyed by the heat from the laser. The model and the laser were realized by Marc Palumbo, a High Tech Romantic artist from the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT.

Ashton Carter, then a board member at MIT, assessed SDI for Congress in 1984, noting difficulties in creating an adequate missile defense shield, with or without lasers. Carter said X-rays had a limited scope because they become diffused by the atmosphere, much like the beam of a flashlight spreading outward in all directions. This means the X-ray sources needed to be close to the Soviet Union, especially during the boost phase, for the Soviet missiles to be both detectable to radar and targeted by the lasers. Opponents disagreed, saying advances in technology, such as using stronger beams, and by &quot;bleaching&quot; the column of air surrounding the laser beam, could increase the distance that the X-ray could travel to successfully hit its target.

Physicists Hans Bethe and Richard Garwin, who worked with Teller on both the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos, claimed a laser defense shield was unfeasible. They said that a defensive system was costly and difficult to build yet simple to destroy and claimed that the Soviets could easily use thousands of decoys to overwhelm it during a nuclear attack. They dismissed the idea of a technical solution to the Cold War, saying that a defense shield could be viewed as threatening because it would inhibit Soviet offensive capabilities while leaving America&#x27;s offense intact. In March 1984, Bethe coauthored a 106-page report for the Union of Concerned Scientists that concluded &quot;the X-ray laser offers no prospect of being a useful component in a system for ballistic missile defense.&quot;

In response, when Teller testified before Congress he stated that &quot;instead of [Bethe] objecting on scientific and technical grounds, which he thoroughly understands, he now objects on the grounds of politics, on grounds of military feasibility of military deployment, on other grounds of difficult issues which are quite outside the range of his professional cognizance or mine.&quot;

On June 28, 1985, David Lorge Parnas resigned from SDIO&#x27;s Panel on Computing in Support of Battle Management, arguing in eight short papers that the SDI software could never be made trustworthy and that such a system would inevitably be unreliable and menace humanity in its own right. Parnas said he joined the panel with the desire to make nuclear weapons &quot;impotent and obsolete&quot; but soon concluded that the concept was &quot;a fraud&quot;.

===The nickname &quot;Star Wars&quot;===

Historians from the Missile Defense Agency attribute the term &quot;Star Wars&quot; to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article published March 24, 1983. It quoted a speech delivered by Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy the previous day, describing the proposal as &quot;reckless &quot;Star Wars&quot; schemes&quot;, a reference to the space opera film series &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Some critics used the term derisively, implying it was an impractical science fiction. In addition, the American media&#x27;s liberal use of the moniker (despite President Reagan&#x27;s request) did much to damage the program&#x27;s credibility. In comments to the media on March 7, 1986, SDIO Acting Deputy Director Dr. Gerold Yonas described &quot;Star Wars&quot; as an important tool for Soviet disinformation and asserted that the nickname gave an entirely wrong impression of SDI.

Supporters of the SDI program eventually began to use the nickname as well. George Lucas, the creator of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, sued public interest groups High Frontier (a liberal organization that supported the program) and Committee for a Strong, Peaceful America (a conservative organization) in 1985 for trademark infringement. The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Gerhard Gesell, who ruled that political application of the term was a non-commercial usage outside of the scope of trademark.

===Treaty obligations===

Another criticism of SDI argued that it would require the United States to modify existing treaties. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 required &quot;States Party to the Treaty undertake not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner.&quot; This clause forbade the US from pre-positioning in Earth orbit any devices powered by nuclear weapons and any devices capable of &quot;mass destruction&quot;. A space-stationed nuclear-pumped X-ray laser would have violated this treaty, since other SDI systems did not require the pre-positioning of nuclear explosives in space.

The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and its subsequent protocol, which limited missile defenses to one location per country at 100 missiles each (which the USSR had and the US did not), would have been violated by SDI ground-based interceptors. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty requires that &quot;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.&quot; Many viewed deployment of ABM systems as an escalation, and therefore a violation of this clause, although this view was not universal.

=== Mutual assured destruction ===
SDI threatened to disrupt the strategic equilibrium ensured by the doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). This doctrine postulated that neither the U.S. nor the USSR could attack the other without considering the strong probability that both sides would be annihilated. A defensive weapon system that could neutralize much of an adversary&#x27;s nuclear counter-strike force would potentially embolden the possessor to strike first.

During the Reykjavík talks with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986, Reagan addressed Gorbachev&#x27;s concerns about imbalance by stating that SDI technology could be provided to the entire world – including the Soviet Union – to prevent the imbalance from occurring. Gorbachev answered dismissively. When Reagan proposed technology sharing again, Gorbachev stated &quot;we cannot assume an obligation relative to such a transition&quot;, referring to the cost of implementing such a program.

===Whistleblower===
In 1992, scientist Aldric Saucier was given whistleblower protection after he was fired and complained about &quot;wasteful spending on research and development&quot; at SDI. Saucier lost his security clearance.

<text>Solomon Northup (born July 10, ; died ) was an American abolitionist and the primary author of the memoir &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot;. A free-born African American from New York, he was the son of a freed slave and a free woman of color. Northup was a professional violinist, farmer, and landowner in Washington County, New York. In 1841, he was offered a traveling musician&#x27;s job and went to Washington, D.C. (where slavery was legal); there, he was drugged and kidnapped into slavery. He was shipped to New Orleans, purchased by a planter, and held as a slave for 12 years in the Red River region of Louisiana, mostly in Avoyelles Parish. He remained enslaved until he met Samuel Bass, a Canadian working on his plantation who helped get word to New York, where state law provided aid to free New York citizens who had been kidnapped and sold into slavery. His family and friends enlisted the aid of the Governor of New York, Washington Hunt, and Northup regained his freedom on January 3, 1853.

The slave trader in Washington, D.C., James H. Birch, was arrested and tried, but acquitted because District of Columbia law at the time prohibited Northup as a black man from testifying against white people. Later, in New York State, his northern kidnappers were located and charged, but the case was tied up in court for two years because of jurisdictional challenges and finally dropped when Washington, D.C., was found to have jurisdiction. The D.C. government did not pursue the case. Those who had kidnapped and enslaved Northup received no punishment.

In his first year of freedom, Northup wrote and published a memoir, &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot; (1853). He lectured on behalf of the abolitionist movement, giving more than two dozen speeches throughout the Northeast about his experiences, to build momentum against slavery. He largely disappeared from the historical record after 1857, although a letter later reported him alive in early 1863; some commentators thought he had been kidnapped again, but historians believe it unlikely, as he would have been considered too old to bring a good price. The details of his death have never been documented.

Northup&#x27;s memoir was adapted and produced as the 1984 television film &quot;Solomon Northup&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; and the 2013 feature film &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;. The latter won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, at the 86th Academy Awards.

==Early life==
Solomon Northup was born in the town of Minerva in Essex County, New York on July 10, 1807 or July 10, 1808. His mother was a free woman of color, which meant that her sons, Solomon and his older brother Joseph, were born free according to the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;. Solomon described his mother as a quadroon, meaning that she was one-quarter African, and three-quarters European.

His father, Mintus, was a freedman who had been enslaved in his early life by the Northup family. Born in Rhode Island, he was taken with the Northups when they moved to Hoosick, New York, in Rensselaer County. His master, Henry Northrop, manumitted Mintus in his will, after which Mintus adopted the surname Northup. His surname was sometimes spelled Northrup in records. Upon attaining his freedom, Mintus married and moved to Minerva with his wife.

Northup said his father was &quot;a man respected for his industry and integrity&quot;. A farmer, Mintus was successful enough to own land and thus meet the state&#x27;s property requirements for the right to vote. His sons received what was considered to be a good education for free black people at that time. Northup and his brother worked on the family farm as boys. He spent his leisure time playing the violin and reading books.
Mintus moved his family to Washington County, New York and worked on several farms owned by the Northups. From Minerva, they moved to the farm of Clark Northup near Slyborough (Slyboro) in Granville, Washington County for several years. The family of four then lived at Alden Farm, a short distance north of Sandy Hill (now called Hudson Falls). They later moved to an area east of Fort Edward on the road from Fort Edward to Argyle, where Mintus lived until his death. Mintus died at Fort Edward on November 22, 1829, and was interred at the Hudson Falls Baker Cemetery. His mother died during Northup&#x27;s enslavement (1841 to 1852). According to her daughter-in-law Anne and Nicholas C. Northup, she died around 1846 or 1847 in Oswego County, New York.

==Marriage and family==

Solomon Northup married Anne Hampton on December 25, 1829, one month after the death of his father, or on November 22, 1829, according to sworn depositions by Anne Northup, Josiah Hand, and Timothy Eddy, the latter of whom was the Justice of the Peace who performed the wedding. They were married in Fort Edward. Anne, the daughter of William Hampton, was born March 14, 1808. She grew up in Sandy Hill. A &quot;woman of color&quot;, she was of African, European, and Native American descent. They had three children: Elizabeth (born c. 1831), Margaret (born c. 1833), and Alonzo (born c. 1835).

At the start of their marriage, the couple lived at Fort House, &quot;the old yellow house&quot;, at the southern end of Fort Edward. In 1830, they moved to Kingsbury, both of which were small communities in Washington County, New York. After selling their farm in 1834, the Northups moved 20 miles to Saratoga Springs, New York, for its employment opportunities.

Anne was known for her culinary expertise. She worked for local taverns that served food and drink, at the United States Hotel and elite hotels such as the Pavilion Hotel. When court was in session at the county seat of Fort Edward, she worked at Sherrill&#x27;s Coffee House in Sandy Hill.

After Northup was kidnapped, Anne and her oldest daughter, Elizabeth, went to work as domestic servants in New York City at Madame Jumel&#x27;s Mansion on the East River in the summer of 1841. Alonzo was with them. Margaret, their youngest daughter, went to Hoboken, New Jersey to live with a friend of Madame Jumel, who also had a young daughter.

After about two years, Anne brought the family back together in Saratoga, where she worked as a hotel cook, including at Carpenter&#x27;s Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1852, she learned of her husband&#x27;s fate and asked for Henry B. Northup&#x27;s help to have him freed. A letter was prepared to the Governor of New York, Washington Hunt, based upon a deposition given by Anne Northup to Justice of the Peace Charles Hughes on November 19, 1852. He gathered the information to prove that Northup was free and went to Louisiana to bring him back to New York.
Northup returned to Sandy Hill on January 21, 1853, and reunited with his wife and children. By 1855, he was living with his daughter Margaret Stanton and her family in Queensbury, Warren County, New York. He purchased land in Glens Falls near his daughter. In his memoir, Northup described his love for his wife as &quot;sincere and unabated&quot;, since the time of their marriage, and his children as &quot;beloved&quot;.

While Northup gave talks about his book around the country, Anne worked in Bolton Landing on Lake George at the hotel Mohican House. Author David Fiske states that Northup seems to have had a difficult time overcoming the years in which he was enslaved. He was said to have drunk a lot and did not seem to spend a lot of time with his wife. By the late 1850s, it was unknown what had become of Northup, and he was not listed with his family in the 1860 census.

After selling their land in Glens Falls, Anne Northup moved to the household of her daughter and son-in-law, Margaret and Philip Stanton, in Moreau, Saratoga County, where she again was recorded as married. However, Solomon was not with the family. Anne did laundry, cooking and chores for a Moreau man. In 1870, she worked as a cook in the household of Burton C. Dennis, who kept the Middleworth House hotel in Sandy Hill. Anne Northup lived in Kingsbury in Washington County, New York in 1875. By that time, she was identified as a widow. She died in 1876 while performing her chores in Moreau. One obituary, while praising Anne, says of Solomon Northup that &quot;after exhibiting himself through the country [he] became a worthless vagabond&quot;.

==Life==

===Canal worker, farmer, and violin player===
In the winter of the year that he married, Northup worked as a laborer repairing the Champlain Canal. He then bought two horses and contracted to tow lumber on rafts to Troy from Lake Champlain beginning the following spring. He employed two workers. He worked on other waterways in upstate New York and he traveled to northern New York and Montreal, Canada. When the canal was closed down, he cut lumber during the winter of 1831–1832. He worked as a farm laborer in the Sandy Hill area.

He arranged to farm corn and oats on part of the Alden farm where his father lived in Kingsbury. He built a fine reputation as a fiddler and was in high demand to play for dances in surrounding villages. The couple had become prosperous due to the income Anne received as a cook and that Northup made farming and playing the violin.

The couple moved to Saratoga Springs in March 1834, where he drove a horse-drawn taxi for a businessman. During the tourist season, he worked for the United States Hotel, where he was employed by Judge James M. Marvin, a part-owner of the hotel. He played his violin at several well-known hotels in Saratoga Springs. He also worked on the construction of the Troy and Saratoga Railroad. He had become a regular customer and friend of William Perry and Cephus Parker, who owned several shops in town. Over the seven years that the Northups lived in Saratoga Springs, they had made ends meet and dressed their children in fine clothes, but they had been unable to prosper as hoped.

In March 1841, Anne went 20 miles to Sandy Hill, where she ran the kitchen at Sherrill&#x27;s Coffee House during the court session. She may have taken their oldest daughter, Elizabeth, with her. Their two youngest children went to stay with their aunt. Northup stayed in Saratoga Springs to look for employment until the tourist season.

===Kidnapped and sold into slavery===
In 1841, at age 32, Northup met two men who introduced themselves as Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton. Saying they were entertainers, members of a circus company, they offered him a job as a fiddler for several performances in New York City. Expecting the trip to be brief, Northup did not notify Anne, who was working in Sandy Hill. When they reached New York City, the men persuaded Northup to continue with them for a gig with their circus in Washington, D.C., offering him a generous wage and the cost of his return trip home. They stopped so that he could get a copy of his &quot;free papers&quot;, which documented his status as a free man.

The city had one of the nation&#x27;s largest slave markets, and slave catchers were not above kidnapping free black people. At this time, 20 years before the Civil War, the expansion of cotton cultivation in the Deep South had led to a continuing high demand for healthy slaves. Kidnappers used a variety of means, from forced abduction to deceit, and frequently abducted children, who were easier to control.

It is possible that &quot;Brown&quot; and &quot;Hamilton&quot; incapacitated Northuphis symptoms suggest that he was drugged with belladonna or laudanum, or with a mixture of bothand sold him to Washington slave trader James H. Birch for $650, claiming that he was a fugitive slave. However, Northup stated in his account of the ordeal in &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot; in Chapter II, &quot;[w]hether they were accessory to my misfortunes – subtle and inhuman monsters in the shape of men – designedly luring me away from home and family, and liberty, for the sake of gold – those who read these pages will have the same means of determining as myself.&quot; Birch and Ebenezer Radburn, his jailer, severely beat Northup to stop him from saying he was a free man. Birch then wrongfully presented Northup as an enslaved man from Georgia. Northup was held in the Yellow House, the slave pen of trader William Williams, close to the United States Capitol. Birch shipped Northup and other slaves by sea to New Orleans, in what was called the coastwise slave trade, where Birch&#x27;s partner Theophilus Freeman would sell them. During the voyage, Northup and the other slaves caught smallpox.

Northup persuaded John Manning, an English sailor, to send to Henry B. Northup, upon reaching New Orleans, a letter that told of his kidnapping and illegal enslavement. Henry was a lawyer, a relative of Henry Northrop who had held and freed Solomon&#x27;s father, and a childhood friend of Solomon&#x27;s. The letter was delivered to Governor Seward by Henry, but it was not actionable because Northup&#x27;s location was unknown.

The New York State Legislature had passed a law in 1840 that made it illegal to entice or kidnap an African-American out of New York and sell them into slavery. It provided legal and financial assistance to aid the recovery of any who were kidnapped, taken out of state, and illegally enslaved.
At the New Orleans slave market, Birch&#x27;s partner Theophilus Freeman sold Northup (who had been renamed Platt) along with two other individuals, Harry and Eliza (renamed Dradey) to William Prince Ford, a preacher who engaged in small farming on Bayou Boeuf of the Red River in northern Louisiana. Ford was then a Baptist preacher. (In 1843, he led his congregation in converting to the closely related Churches of Christ after they were influenced by the writings of Alexander Campbell.) In his memoir, Northup characterized Ford as a good man who was considerate of the people he enslaved. Despite his situation, Northup wrote:

At Ford&#x27;s place in Pine Woods, Northup assessed the problem of getting timber off Ford&#x27;s farm to market. He proposed and then made a log raft to move lumber down the narrow Indian Creek, in order to transport the logs more easily. Northup built weaving looms so that fabric could be woven for clothing.

Ford came into financial difficulties and had to sell 18 enslaved people to settle his debts. In the winter of 1842, Ford sold Northup to John M. Tibaut, a carpenter who had been working for Ford on the mills. Tibaut also had helped construct a weaving house and corn mill on Ford&#x27;s Bayou Boeuf plantation. Ford owed Tibaut money for the work. Since Ford owed Tibaut less than the purchase price agreed upon for Northup, Ford held a chattel mortgage on Northup for $400, the difference between the two amounts.
Under Tibaut, Northup suffered cruel and capricious treatment. Tibaut used him to help complete construction at Ford&#x27;s plantation. At one point, Tibaut whipped Northup because he did not like the nails Northup was using. But Northup fought back, beating Tibaut severely. Enraged, Tibaut recruited two friends to lynch and hang Northup, which an enslaver was legally entitled to do. Ford&#x27;s overseer Chapin interrupted and prevented the men from killing Northup, reminding Tibaut of his debt to Ford, and chasing them off at gunpoint. Northup was left bound and noosed for hours until Ford returned home to cut him down. Northup believed that Tibaut&#x27;s debt to Ford saved his life. Historian Walter Johnson suggests that Northup may well have been the first person Tibaut ever enslaved, marking his transition from itinerant employee to property-owning enslaver.

Tibaut hired Northup out to a planter named Eldret, who lived about 38 miles south on the Red River. At what he called &quot;The Big Cane Brake&quot;, Eldret had Northup and other enslaved people clear cane, trees, and undergrowth in the bottomlands in order to develop cotton fields for cultivation. With the work unfinished, after about five weeks, Tibaut sold Northup to Edwin Epps.
Epps held Northup for almost 10 years, until 1853, in Avoyelles Parish. He was a cruel enslaver who frequently and indiscriminately punished enslaved people and drove them hard. His policy was to whip slaves if they did not meet daily work quotas he set for pounds of cotton to be picked, among other goals.

In 1852, itinerant Canadian carpenter Samuel Bass came to do some work for Epps. Hearing Bass express abolitionist views, Northup eventually decided to confide his secret to him. Bass was the first person he told of his true name and origins as a free man since he was first kidnapped and enslaved. Along with mailing a letter written by Northup, Bass wrote several letters at his request to Northup&#x27;s friends, providing general details of his location at Bayou Boeuf, in hopes of gaining his rescue.

Bass did this at great personal risk, as the local people would not take kindly to a person helping an enslaved person to the detriment of an enslaver. In addition, Bass&#x27;s help came after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which increased federal penalties against people assisting enslaved people to escape.

===Restoration of freedom===
Bass wrote several letters to people Northup knew in Saratoga Springs: one went to his former employer Judge James M. Marvin and another reached Cephas Parker and William Perry, storekeepers in Saratoga. Parker and Perry forwarded the letter to Northup&#x27;s wife, Anne, who contacted attorney Henry B. Northup, the son of Solomon&#x27;s father&#x27;s former master. Henry B. Northup contacted New York Governor Washington Hunt, who took up the case, appointing the attorney general as his legal agent. In 1840, the New York State Legislature had passed a law committing the state to help any African American residents kidnapped into slavery, as well as guaranteeing a jury trial to alleged fugitive slaves. Once Northup&#x27;s family was notified, his rescuers still had to do detective work to find the enslaved man, as he had partially tried to hide his location for protection in case the letters fell into the wrong hands, and Bass had not used his real name. They had to find documentation of his free status as a citizen and New York resident; Henry B. Northup also collected sworn affidavits from people who knew Solomon Northup. Northup did not know if Bass had reached anyone with the letters during this time. There was no means of communicating because of the secrecy they needed to maintain and the necessity of preventing Northup&#x27;s owner from knowing their plans. Bass did not reveal his own name in the letter.

Henry gathered documentation and depositions and stopped off in Washington, D.C. to meet with Pierre Soule, a legislator from Louisiana, and the Secretary of War in preparation for his rescue effort in Louisiana. Although he did not have Bass&#x27;s name, Henry still managed to find him in Marksville (the postmark on the letters), and Bass revealed that Edwin Epps held Solomon Northup on his plantation. Henry prepared legal paperwork based on the documentation proving Northup was free. The sheriff went with Henry to give the news to Epps and take Northup off the farm.

Northup later wrote, &quot;He [Epps] thought of nothing but his loss, and cursed me for having been born free.&quot; Attorney Henry B. Northup convinced Epps that it would be futile to contest the free papers in a court of law, so the planter conceded the case. He signed papers giving up all claims to Northup. Finally, on January 4, 1853, four months after meeting Bass, Northup regained his freedom.

===&quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot;===
After he made it back to New York, Solomon Northup wrote and published his memoir, &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot; (1853). The book was written in three months with the help of David Wilson, a local lawyer and writer.

Northup told the story of his kidnapping and enslavement with many verifiable details. Northup told the cruelty, treatment as chattel, and the appreciated acts of kindness he received. &quot;Its tone is much milder than we expected to see exhibited,&quot; according to the &quot;Rome Citizen&quot; of New York. The detail that he provided helped illuminate the depth of his experiences, and allowed for verification of what life was like on a plantation. Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon researched the facts from Northup&#x27;s book and were able to verify many of the events and people and published their annotated version of the book in 1968. Edwin Epps, his slaveholder, stated that a greater part of the book was the truth to soldiers from the 114th New York Infantry Regiment that Epps met during the Civil War. Northup was literate and provided the facts without hyperbole in &quot;plain and candid language&quot;, while Wilson corrected style, grammar, and inconsistencies.

It was published by Derby &amp; Miller of Auburn, New York. In the period when questions of slavery generated debate and the novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe was a bestseller, Northup&#x27;s book sold 30,000 copies within three years, also becoming a bestseller. Northup traveled and went on a lecture tour in Northeastern states to tell his story and sell books. The book became the backbone of other books about him, such as &quot;Solomon Northup: The Complete Story of the Author of Twelve Years a Slave.&quot;

===Court cases===
Northup was one of the few kidnapped free black people to regain freedom after being sold into slavery. Represented by attorneys Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, General Orville Clark, and Henry B. Northup, Solomon Northup sued Birch and other men involved in selling him into slavery in Washington, DC. The historian Carol Wilson documented 300 kidnapping cases in her 1994 book, and believes that it is likely that thousands more were kidnapped who were never documented.

As Solomon Northup and Henry Northup made their way back to New York, they first stopped in Washington, D.C., to file a legal complaint with the police magistrate against James H. Birch, the man who had first enslaved him. Birch was immediately arrested and tried on criminal charges. However, Northup could not testify at the trial due to laws in Washington, D.C., against black men testifying in court. Birch and several others who were also in the slave trade testified that Northup had approached them, saying he was an enslaved person from Georgia and was for sale. However, Birch&#x27;s accounting ledger made no note of his purchase. The prosecution consisted of Henry B. Northup and another white man asserting that they had known Northup for many years, and he was born and lived a free man in New York until his abduction. With no one legally able to testify against Birch&#x27;s tale, Birch was found not guilty. However, the sensational case immediately attracted national attention, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article about the trial on January 20, 1853, just days after its conclusion and only two weeks after Northup&#x27;s rescue.

The New York trial opened on October 4, 1854. Both Northup and St. John testified against the two men. The case brought widespread illegal practices in the domestic slave trade to light. Testimony during the court case confirmed various details of Northup&#x27;s account of his experience. The respective counsels argued over whether the crime had been committed in New York (where Northup could testify), or in Washington, DC, outside the jurisdiction of New York courts. After more than two years of appeals, a new district attorney in New York failed to continue with the case and dropped it in May 1857.

===Last years===
Northup worked again as a carpenter after he moved back to New York. He became active in the abolitionist movement and lectured on slavery in the years before the American Civil War. In the summer of 1857, he traveled to Canada to deliver a series of lectures; however, in Streetsville, Ontario, a hostile crowd prevented him from speaking.

After 1857, he was not living with family and there was speculation by family, friends, and others that he was reenslaved. The 21st-century historians Clifford Brown and Carol Wilson believe it is likely that he died of natural causes, because he was too old to be of interest to slave catchers.

According to John R. Smith, in letters written in the 1930s, his father Rev. John L. Smith, a Methodist minister in Vermont, had worked with Northup and former slave Tabbs Gross in the early 1860s, during the Civil War, aiding fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Northup was said to have visited Rev. Smith after Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation, which was made in January 1863.

There is no contemporaneous documentation of his death. Historians believe that he died in 1863 or 1864.

==Historiography==
Although the memoir is often classified among the genre of slave narratives, the scholar Sam Worley says that it does not fit the genre&#x27;s standard format. Northup was assisted in the writing by David Wilson, a white man, and, according to Worley, some believed he would have biased the material. Worley discounted concerns that Wilson was pursuing his own interests in the book. He writes of the memoir:

&quot;Twelve Years&quot; is convincingly Northup&#x27;s tale and no one else&#x27;s because of its amazing attention to empirical detail and unwillingness to reduce the complexity of Northup&#x27;s experience to a stark moral allegory.

Northup&#x27;s biographer, David Fiske, has investigated Northup&#x27;s role in the book&#x27;s writing and asserts the authenticity of authorship. Northup&#x27;s complete and descriptive account has been used by numerous historians researching slavery. His description of the &quot;Yellow House&quot; (also known as &quot;The Williams Slave Pen&quot;), in view of the Capitol, has helped researchers document the history of slavery in the District of Columbia.

==Influence among scholars==
* Ulrich B. Phillips, in his &quot;Life and Labor in the Old South&quot; (Boston, 1929) and &quot;American Negro Slavery&quot; (New York, 1918), doubted the &quot;authenticity&quot; of most narratives of ex-slaves but termed Northup&#x27;s memoir &quot;a vivid account of plantation life from the under side&quot;.
* The scholar Kenneth M. Stampp often referred to Northup&#x27;s memoir in his book on slavery, &quot;The Peculiar Institution&quot; (New York, 1956). Stanley Elkins in his book, &quot;Slavery&quot; (Chicago, 1959), like Phillips and Stampp, found Northup&#x27;s memoir to be of credible historical merit.
* Since the mid-20th century, the civil rights movement, and an increase in works of social history and in African American studies, have brought renewed interest in Northup&#x27;s memoir.
* The first scholarly edition of the memoir was published in 1968. Co-edited by professors Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon, this well-annotated LSU Press publication has been used in classrooms and by scholars since that time and is still in print.
* In 1998, a team of students at Union College in Schenectady, New York, with their political science professor Clifford Brown, documented Northup&#x27;s historic narrative. &quot;They gathered photographs, family trees, bills of sale, maps and hospital records on a trail through New York, Washington [DC] and Louisiana.&quot; Their exhibit of this material was held at the college&#x27;s Nott Memorial building.
* In his book &quot;Black Men Built the Capitol&quot; (2007), Jesse Holland notes his use of Northup&#x27;s account.

==Legacy and honors==
* In 1999, Saratoga Springs erected a historical marker at the corner of Congress and Broadway to commemorate Northup&#x27;s life. The city later established the third Saturday in July as Solomon Northup Day, to honor him, bring regional African American history to light, and educate the public about freedom and justice issues.
* In 2000, the Library of Congress accepted the program of Solomon Northup Day into the permanent archives of the American Folklife Center. The Anacostia Community Museum and the National Park Service-Network to Freedom Project have also recognized the merits of this multi-venue, multi-cultural event program. &quot;Solomon Northup Day – a Celebration of Freedom&quot; continues annually in the City of Saratoga Springs, as well as in Plattsburgh, New York, with the support of the North Country Underground Railroad Historical Association.
* Annual observances have been made to honor Solomon Northup. A 2015 conference at Skidmore College had a gathering of Northup&#x27;s descendants, and the speakers included Congressman Paul D. Tonko.

===Representation in media===
* Former U.S. poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner Rita Dove wrote the poem &quot;The Abduction&quot; about Northup, published in her first collection, &quot;The Yellow House on the Corner&quot; (1980).
* In 1984, &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot; was adapted as a PBS television movie titled &quot;Solomon Northup&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, directed by Gordon Parks. Northup was portrayed by Avery Brooks.
* In 2008, composer and saxophonist T. K. Blue, commissioned by the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), recorded &quot;Follow the North Star&quot;, a musical composition inspired by Northup&#x27;s life.
* The episode &quot;Division&quot; of the 2010 television miniseries &quot;&quot; depicts Northup&#x27;s slave auction. Significant emphasis is placed on Eliza being separated from her children, and the actor portraying Northup does voiceover of direct passages from &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot;.
* The 2013 feature film &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;, adapted from his memoir, was written by John Ridley and directed by Steve McQueen. British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays Northup, for which he earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning 3for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, for John Ridley, and Best Supporting Actress for Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, who played the slave Patsey in her debut film role.

<text>A space elevator, also referred to as a space bridge, star ladder, and orbital lift, is a proposed type of planet-to-space transportation system, often depicted in science fiction. The main component would be a cable (also called a tether) anchored to the surface and extending into space. An Earth-based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end attached to a counterweight in space beyond geostationary orbit (35,786 km altitude). The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the upward centrifugal pseudo-force (it is actually the inertia of the counterweight that creates the tension on the space side), which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth. With the tether deployed, climbers (crawlers) could repeatedly climb up and down the tether by mechanical means, releasing their cargo to and from orbit. The design would permit vehicles to travel directly between a planetary surface, such as the Earth&#x27;s, and orbit, without the use of large rockets.

==History==
===Early concept===
The idea of the space elevator appears to have developed independently in different times and places. The earliest models originated with two Russian scientists in the late nineteenth century. In his 1895 collection &quot;Dreams of Earth and Sky&quot;, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky envisioned a massive sky ladder to reach the stars as a way to overcome gravity. Decades later, in 1960, Yuri Artsutanov independently developed the concept of a &quot;Cosmic Railway&quot;, a space elevator tethered from an orbiting satellite to an anchor on the equator, aiming to provide a safer and more efficient alternative to rockets. In 1966, Isaacs and his colleagues introduced the concept of the &#x27;Sky-Hook&#x27;, proposing a satellite in geostationary orbit with a cable extending to Earth.

=== Innovations and designs ===
The space elevator concept reached America in 1975 when Jerome Pearson began researching the idea, inspired by Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1969 speech before Congress. After working as an engineer for NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory, he developed a design for an &quot;Orbital Tower&quot;, intended to harness Earth&#x27;s rotational energy to transport supplies into low Earth orbit. In his publication in &quot;Acta Astronautica&quot;, the cable would be thickest at geostationary orbit where tension is greatest, and narrowest at the tips to minimize weight per unit area. He proposed extending a counterweight to 144,000 kilometers (89,000 miles) as without a large counterweight, the upper cable would need to be longer due to the way gravitational and centrifugal forces change with distance from Earth. His analysis included the Moon&#x27;s gravity, wind, and moving payloads. Building the elevator would have required thousands of Space Shuttle trips, though material could be transported once a minimum strength strand reached the ground or be manufactured in space from asteroidal or lunar ore. Pearson&#x27;s findings, published in &quot;Acta Astronautica&quot;, caught Clarke&#x27;s attention and led to technical consultations for Clarke&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot; (1979), which features a space elevator.

The first gathering of multiple experts who wanted to investigate this alternative to space flight took place at the 1999 NASA conference &#x27;Advanced Space Infrastructure Workshop on Geostationary Orbiting Tether Space Elevator Concepts&#x27;. in Huntsville, Alabama. D.V. Smitherman, Jr., published the findings in August of 2000 under the title &quot;Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium&quot;, concluding that the space elevator could not be built for at least another 50 years due to concerns about the cable&#x27;s material, deployment, and upkeep.

Dr. B.C. Edwards suggested that a long paper-thin ribbon, utilizing a carbon nanotube composite material could solve the tether issue due to their high tensile strength and low weight The proposed wide-thin ribbon-like cross-section shape instead of earlier circular cross-section concepts would increase survivability against meteoroid impacts. With support from NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC), his work involved more than 20 institutions and 50 participants. The Space Elevator NIAC Phase II Final Report, in combination with the book &quot;The Space Elevator&quot;: &quot;A Revolutionary Earth-to-Space Transportation System&quot; (Edwards and Westling, 2003) summarized all effort to design a space elevator including deployment scenario, climber design, power delivery system, orbital debris avoidance, anchor system, surviving atomic oxygen, avoiding lightning and hurricanes by locating the anchor in the western equatorial Pacific, construction costs, construction schedule, and environmental hazards. Additionally, he researched the structural integrity and load-bearing capabilities of space elevator cables, emphasizing their need for high tensile strength and resilience. His space elevator concept never reached NIAC&#x27;s third phase, which he attributed to submitting his final proposal during the week of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.

=== 21st century advancements ===
To speed space elevator development, proponents have organized several competitions, similar to the Ansari X Prize, for relevant technologies. Among them are , which organized annual competitions for climbers, ribbons and power-beaming systems from 2005 to 2009, the Robogames Space Elevator Ribbon Climbing competition, as well as NASA&#x27;s Centennial Challenges program, which, in March 2005, announced a partnership with the Spaceward Foundation (the operator of Elevator:2010), raising the total value of prizes to US$400,000.
The first European Space Elevator Challenge (EuSEC) to establish a climber structure took place in August 2011.

In 2005, &quot;the LiftPort Group of space elevator companies announced that it will be building a carbon nanotube manufacturing plant in Millville, New Jersey, to supply various glass, plastic and metal companies with these strong materials. Although LiftPort hopes to eventually use carbon nanotubes in the construction of a space elevator, this move will allow it to make money in the short term and conduct research and development into new production methods.&quot; Their announced goal was a space elevator launch in 2010. On 13 February 2006, the LiftPort Group announced that, earlier the same month, they had tested a mile of &quot;space-elevator tether&quot; made of carbon-fiber composite strings and fiberglass tape measuring wide and (approx. 13 sheets of paper) thick, lifted with balloons. In April 2019, Liftport CEO Michael Laine admitted little progress has been made on the company&#x27;s lofty space elevator ambitions, even after receiving more than $200,000 in seed funding. The carbon nanotube manufacturing facility that Liftport announced in 2005 was never built.

In 2007, held the 2007 Space Elevator games, which featured US$500,000 awards for each of the two competitions ($1,000,000 total), as well as an additional $4,000,000 to be awarded over the next five years for space elevator related technologies. No teams won the competition, but a team from MIT entered the first 2-gram (0.07 oz), 100-percent carbon nanotube entry into the competition. Japan held an international conference in November 2008 to draw up a timetable for building the elevator.

In 2012, the Obayashi Corporation announced that it could build a space elevator by 2050 using carbon nanotube technology. The design&#x27;s passenger climber would be able to reach the level of geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) after an 8-day trip. Further details were published in 2016.

In 2013, the International Academy of Astronautics published a technological feasibility assessment which concluded that the critical capability improvement needed was the tether material, which was projected to achieve the necessary specific strength within 20 years. The four-year long study looked into many facets of space elevator development including missions, development schedules, financial investments, revenue flow, and benefits. It was reported that it would be possible to operationally survive smaller impacts and avoid larger impacts, with meteors and space debris, and that the estimated cost of lifting a kilogram of payload to GEO and beyond would be $500.

In 2014, Google X&#x27;s Rapid Evaluation R&amp;D team began the design of a Space Elevator, eventually finding that no one had yet manufactured a perfectly formed carbon nanotube strand longer than a meter. They thus put the project in &quot;deep freeze&quot; and also keep tabs on any advances in the carbon nanotube field.

In 2018, researchers at Japan&#x27;s Shizuoka University launched STARS-Me, two CubeSats connected by a tether, which a mini-elevator will travel on. The experiment was launched as a test bed for a larger structure.

In 2019, the International Academy of Astronautics published &quot;Road to the Space Elevator Era&quot;, a study report summarizing the assessment of the space elevator as of summer 2018. The essence is that a broad group of space professionals gathered and assessed the status of the space elevator development, each contributing their expertise and coming to similar conclusions: (a) Earth Space Elevators seem feasible, reinforcing the IAA 2013 study conclusion (b) Space Elevator development initiation is nearer than most think. This last conclusion is based on a potential process for manufacturing macro-scale single crystal graphene with higher specific strength than carbon nanotubes.

==Materials==
A significant difficulty with making a space elevator for the Earth is strength of materials. Since the structure must hold up its own weight in addition to the payload it may carry, the strength to weight ratio, or Specific strength, of the material it is made of must be extremely high.

Since 1959, most ideas for space elevators have focused on purely tensile structures, with the weight of the system held up from above by centrifugal forces. In the tensile concepts, a space tether reaches from a large mass (the counterweight) beyond geostationary orbit to the ground. This structure is held in tension between Earth and the counterweight like an upside-down plumb bob. The cable thickness is tapered based on tension; it has its maximum at a geostationary orbit and the minimum on the ground.

The concept is applicable to other planets and celestial bodies. For locations in the Solar System with weaker gravity than Earth&#x27;s (such as the Moon or Mars), the strength-to-density requirements for tether materials are not as problematic. Currently available materials (such as Kevlar) are strong and light enough that they could be practical as the tether material for elevators there.

Available materials are not strong and light enough to make an Earth space elevator practical. Some sources expect that future advances in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could lead to a practical design. Other sources believe that CNTs will never be strong enough. Possible future alternatives include boron nitride nanotubes, diamond nanothreads and macro-scale single crystal graphene.

==In fiction==
In 1979, space elevators were introduced to a broader audience with the simultaneous publication of Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;, in which engineers construct a space elevator on top of a mountain peak in the fictional island country of &quot;Taprobane&quot; (loosely based on Sri Lanka, albeit moved south to the Equator), and Charles Sheffield&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Web Between the Worlds&quot;, also featuring the building of a space elevator. Three years later, in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1982 novel &quot;Friday&quot;, the principal character mentions a disaster at the “Quito Sky Hook” and makes use of the &quot;Nairobi Beanstalk&quot; in the course of her travels. In Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Red Mars&quot;, colonists build a space elevator on Mars that allows both for more colonists to arrive and also for natural resources mined there to be able to leave for Earth. Larry Niven&#x27;s book &quot;Rainbow Mars&quot; describes a space elevator built on Mars. In David Gerrold&#x27;s 2000 novel, &quot;Jumping Off The Planet&quot;, a family excursion up the Ecuador &quot;beanstalk&quot; is actually a child-custody kidnapping. Gerrold&#x27;s book also examines some of the industrial applications of a mature elevator technology. The concept of a space elevator, called the Beanstalk, is also depicted in John Scalzi&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Old Man&#x27;s War.&quot; In a biological version, Joan Slonczewski&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;The Highest Frontier&quot; depicts a college student ascending a space elevator constructed of self-healing cables of anthrax bacilli. The engineered bacteria can regrow the cables when severed by space debris.

==Physics==

===Apparent gravitational field===
An Earth space elevator cable rotates along with the rotation of the Earth. Therefore, the cable, and objects attached to it, would experience upward centrifugal force in the direction opposing the downward gravitational force. The higher up the cable the object is located, the less the gravitational pull of the Earth, and the stronger the upward centrifugal force due to the rotation, so that more centrifugal force opposes less gravity. The centrifugal force and the gravity are balanced at geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). Above GEO, the centrifugal force is stronger than gravity, causing objects attached to the cable there to pull &quot;upward&quot; on it. Because the counterweight, above GEO, is rotating about the Earth faster than the natural orbital speed for that altitude, it exerts a centrifugal pull on the cable and thus holds the whole system aloft.

The net force for objects attached to the cable is called the &quot;apparent gravitational field&quot;. The apparent gravitational field for attached objects is the (downward) gravity minus the (upward) centrifugal force. The apparent gravity experienced by an object on the cable is zero at GEO, downward below GEO, and upward above GEO.

The apparent gravitational field can be represented this way:

where


At some point up the cable, the two terms (downward gravity and upward centrifugal force) are equal and opposite. Objects fixed to the cable at that point put no weight on the cable. This altitude (r1) depends on the mass of the planet and its rotation rate. Setting actual gravity equal to centrifugal acceleration gives:
This is above Earth&#x27;s surface, the altitude of geostationary orbit.

On the cable &quot;below&quot; geostationary orbit, downward gravity would be greater than the upward centrifugal force, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable downward. Any object released from the cable below that level would initially accelerate downward along the cable. Then gradually it would deflect eastward from the cable. On the cable &quot;above&quot; the level of stationary orbit, upward centrifugal force would be greater than downward gravity, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable &quot;upward&quot;. Any object released from the cable &quot;above&quot; the geosynchronous level would initially accelerate &quot;upward&quot; along the cable. Then gradually it would deflect westward from the cable.

===Cable section===
Historically, the main technical problem has been considered the ability of the cable to hold up, with tension, the weight of itself below any given point. The greatest tension on a space elevator cable is at the point of geostationary orbit, above the Earth&#x27;s equator. This means that the cable material, combined with its design, must be strong enough to hold up its own weight from the surface up to . A cable which is thicker in cross section area at that height than at the surface could better hold up its own weight over a longer length. How the cross section area tapers from the maximum at to the minimum at the surface is therefore an important design factor for a space elevator cable.

To maximize the usable excess strength for a given amount of cable material, the cable&#x27;s cross section area would need to be designed for the most part in such a way that the stress (i.e., the tension per unit of cross sectional area) is constant along the length of the cable. The constant-stress criterion is a starting point in the design of the cable cross section area as it changes with altitude. Other factors considered in more detailed designs include thickening at altitudes where more space junk is present, consideration of the point stresses imposed by climbers, and the use of varied materials. To account for these and other factors, modern detailed designs seek to achieve the largest &quot;safety margin&quot; possible, with as little variation over altitude and time as possible. In simple starting-point designs, that equates to constant-stress.

For a constant-stress cable with no safety margin, the cross-section-area as a function of distance from Earth&#x27;s center is given by the following equation:

where



Safety margin can be accounted for by dividing T by the desired safety factor.

===Cable materials===
Using the above formula, the ratio between the cross-section at geostationary orbit and the cross-section at Earth&#x27;s surface, known as taper ratio, can be calculated:
The taper ratio becomes very large unless the specific strength of the material used approaches 48 (MPa)/(kg/m3). Low specific strength materials require very large taper ratios which equates to large (or astronomical) total mass of the cable with associated large or impossible costs.

==Structure==

There are a variety of space elevator designs proposed for many planetary bodies. Almost every design includes a base station, a cable, climbers, and a counterweight. For an Earth Space Elevator the Earth&#x27;s rotation creates upward centrifugal force on the counterweight. The counterweight is held down by the cable while the cable is held up and taut by the counterweight. The base station anchors the whole system to the surface of the Earth. Climbers climb up and down the cable with cargo.

===Base station===
Modern concepts for the base station/anchor are typically mobile stations, large oceangoing vessels or other mobile platforms. Mobile base stations would have the advantage over the earlier stationary concepts (with land-based anchors) by being able to maneuver to avoid high winds, storms, and space debris. Oceanic anchor points are also typically in international waters, simplifying and reducing the cost of negotiating territory use for the base station.

Stationary land-based platforms would have simpler and less costly logistical access to the base. They also would have the advantage of being able to be at high altitudes, such as on top of mountains. In an alternate concept, the base station could be a tower, forming a space elevator which comprises both a compression tower close to the surface, and a tether structure at higher altitudes. Combining a compression structure with a tension structure would reduce loads from the atmosphere at the Earth end of the tether, and reduce the distance into the Earth&#x27;s gravity field that the cable needs to extend, and thus reduce the critical strength-to-density requirements for the cable material, all other design factors being equal.

===Cable===
A space elevator cable would need to carry its own weight as well as the additional weight of climbers. The required strength of the cable would vary along its length. This is because at various points it would have to carry the weight of the cable below, or provide a downward force to retain the cable and counterweight above. Maximum tension on a space elevator cable would be at geosynchronous altitude so the cable would have to be thickest there and taper as it approaches Earth. Any potential cable design may be characterized by the taper factor – the ratio between the cable&#x27;s radius at geosynchronous altitude and at the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The cable would need to be made of a material with a high tensile strength/density ratio. For example, the Edwards space elevator design assumes a cable material with a tensile strength of at least 100 gigapascals. Since Edwards consistently assumed the density of his carbon nanotube cable to be 1300 kg/m3, that implies a specific strength of 77 megapascal/(kg/m3). This value takes into consideration the entire weight of the space elevator. An untapered space elevator cable would need a material capable of sustaining a length of of its own weight &quot;at sea level&quot; to reach a geostationary altitude of without yielding. Therefore, a material with very high strength and lightness is needed.

For comparison, metals like titanium, steel or aluminium alloys have breaking lengths of only 20–30 km (0.2–0.3 MPa/(kg/m3)). Modern fiber materials such as kevlar, fiberglass and carbon/graphite fiber have breaking lengths of 100–400 km (1.0–4.0 MPa/(kg/m3)). Nanoengineered materials such as carbon nanotubes and, more recently discovered, graphene ribbons (perfect two-dimensional sheets of carbon) are expected to have breaking lengths of 5000–6000 km (50–60 MPa/(kg/m3)), and also are able to conduct electrical power.

For a space elevator on Earth, with its comparatively high gravity, the cable material would need to be stronger and lighter than currently available materials. For this reason, there has been a focus on the development of new materials that meet the demanding specific strength requirement. For high specific strength, carbon has advantages because it is only the sixth element in the periodic table. Carbon has comparatively few of the protons and neutrons which contribute most of the dead weight of any material. Most of the interatomic bonding forces of any element are contributed by only the outer few electrons. For carbon, the strength and stability of those bonds is high compared to the mass of the atom. The challenge in using carbon nanotubes remains to extend to macroscopic sizes the production of such material that are still perfect on the microscopic scale (as microscopic defects are most responsible for material weakness). As of 2014, carbon nanotube technology allowed growing tubes up to a few tenths of meters.

In 2014, diamond nanothreads were first synthesized. Since they have strength properties similar to carbon nanotubes, diamond nanothreads were quickly seen as candidate cable material as well.

===Climbers===
A space elevator cannot be an elevator in the typical sense (with moving cables) due to the need for the cable to be significantly wider at the center than at the tips. While various designs employing moving cables have been proposed, most cable designs call for the &quot;elevator&quot; to climb up a stationary cable.

Climbers cover a wide range of designs. On elevator designs whose cables are planar ribbons, most propose to use pairs of rollers to hold the cable with friction.

Climbers would need to be paced at optimal timings so as to minimize cable stress and oscillations and to maximize throughput. Lighter climbers could be sent up more often, with several going up at the same time. This would increase throughput somewhat, but would lower the mass of each individual payload.
The horizontal speed, i.e. due to orbital rotation, of each part of the cable increases with altitude, proportional to distance from the center of the Earth, reaching low orbital speed at a point approximately 66 percent of the height between the surface and geostationary orbit, or a height of about 23,400 km. A payload released at this point would go into a highly eccentric elliptical orbit, staying just barely clear from atmospheric reentry, with the periapsis at the same altitude as low earth orbit (LEO) and the apoapsis at the release height. With increasing release height the orbit would become less eccentric as both periapsis and apoapsis increase, becoming circular at geostationary level.

When the payload has reached GEO, the horizontal speed is exactly the speed of a circular orbit at that level, so that if released, it would remain adjacent to that point on the cable. The payload can also continue climbing further up the cable beyond GEO, allowing it to obtain higher speed at jettison. If released from 100,000 km, the payload would have enough speed to reach the asteroid belt.

As a payload is lifted up a space elevator, it would gain not only altitude, but horizontal speed (angular momentum) as well. The angular momentum is taken from the Earth&#x27;s rotation. As the climber ascends, it is initially moving slower than each successive part of cable it is moving on to. This is the Coriolis force: the climber &quot;drags&quot; (westward) on the cable, as it climbs, and slightly decreases the Earth&#x27;s rotation speed. The opposite process would occur for descending payloads: the cable is tilted eastward, thus slightly increasing Earth&#x27;s rotation speed.

The overall effect of the centrifugal force acting on the cable would cause it to constantly try to return to the energetically favorable vertical orientation, so after an object has been lifted on the cable, the counterweight would swing back toward the vertical, a bit like a pendulum. Space elevators and their loads would be designed so that the center of mass is always well-enough above the level of geostationary orbit to hold up the whole system. Lift and descent operations would need to be carefully planned so as to keep the pendulum-like motion of the counterweight around the tether point under control.

Climber speed would be limited by the Coriolis force, available power, and by the need to ensure the climber&#x27;s accelerating force does not break the cable. Climbers would also need to maintain a minimum average speed in order to move material up and down economically and expeditiously. At the speed of a very fast car or train of it will take about 5 days to climb to geosynchronous orbit.

===Powering climbers===
Both power and energy are significant issues for climbers – the climbers would need to gain a large amount of potential energy as quickly as possible to clear the cable for the next payload.

Various methods have been proposed to provide energy to the climber:
* Transfer the energy to the climber through wireless energy transfer while it is climbing.
* Transfer the energy to the climber through some material structure while it is climbing.
* Store the energy in the climber before it starts – requires an extremely high specific energy such as nuclear energy.
* Solar power – After the first 40 km it is possible to use solar energy to power the climber

Wireless energy transfer such as laser power beaming is currently considered the most likely method, using megawatt-powered free electron or solid state lasers in combination with adaptive mirrors approximately wide and a photovoltaic array on the climber tuned to the laser frequency for efficiency. For climber designs powered by power beaming, this efficiency is an important design goal. Unused energy would need to be re-radiated away with heat-dissipation systems, which add to weight.

Yoshio Aoki, a professor of precision machinery engineering at Nihon University and director of the Japan Space Elevator Association, suggested including a second cable and using the conductivity of carbon nanotubes to provide power.

===Counterweight===

Several solutions have been proposed to act as a counterweight:
* a heavy, captured asteroid
* a space dock, space station or spaceport positioned past geostationary orbit
* a further upward extension of the cable itself so that the net upward pull would be the same as an equivalent counterweight
* parked spent climbers that had been used to thicken the cable during construction, other junk, and material lifted up the cable for the purpose of increasing the counterweight.
Extending the cable has the advantage of some simplicity of the task and the fact that a payload that went to the end of the counterweight-cable would acquire considerable velocity relative to the Earth, allowing it to be launched into interplanetary space. Its disadvantage is the need to produce greater amounts of cable material as opposed to using just anything available that has mass.

==Applications==
===Launching into deep space===
An object attached to a space elevator at a radius of approximately 53,100 km would be at escape velocity when released. Transfer orbits to the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points could be attained by release at 50,630 and 51,240 km, respectively, and transfer to lunar orbit from 50,960 km.

At the end of Pearson&#x27;s cable, the tangential velocity is 10.93 kilometers per second (6.79 mi/s). That is more than enough to escape Earth&#x27;s gravitational field and send probes at least as far out as Jupiter. Once at Jupiter, a gravitational assist maneuver could permit solar escape velocity to be reached.

===Extraterrestrial elevators===
A space elevator could also be constructed on other planets, asteroids and moons.

A Martian tether could be much shorter than one on Earth. Mars&#x27; surface gravity is 38 percent of Earth&#x27;s, while it rotates around its axis in about the same time as Earth. Because of this, Martian stationary orbit is much closer to the surface, and hence the elevator could be much shorter. Current materials are already sufficiently strong to construct such an elevator. Building a Martian elevator would be complicated by the Martian moon Phobos, which is in a low orbit and intersects the Equator regularly (twice every orbital period of 11 h 6 min). Phobos and Deimos may get in the way of an areostationary space elevator; on the other hand, they may contribute useful resources to the project. Phobos is projected to contain high amounts of carbon. If carbon nanotubes become feasible for a tether material, there will be an abundance of carbon near Mars. This could provide readily available resources for future colonization on Mars.

Phobos is tide-locked: one side always faces its primary, Mars. An elevator extending 6,000 km from that inward side would end about 28 kilometers above the Martian surface, just out of the denser parts of the atmosphere of Mars. A similar cable extending 6,000 km in the opposite direction would counterbalance the first, so the center of mass of this system remains in Phobos. In total the space elevator would extend out over 12,000 km which would be below areostationary orbit of Mars (17,032 km). A rocket launch would still be needed to get the rocket and cargo to the beginning of the space elevator 28 km above the surface. The surface of Mars is rotating at 0.25 km/s at the equator and the bottom of the space elevator would be rotating around Mars at 0.77 km/s, so only 0.52 km/s (1872 km/h) of Delta-v would be needed to get to the space elevator. Phobos orbits at 2.15 km/s and the outermost part of the space elevator would rotate around Mars at 3.52 km/s.

The Earth&#x27;s Moon is a potential location for a Lunar space elevator, especially as the specific strength required for the tether is low enough to use currently available materials. The Moon does not rotate fast enough for an elevator to be supported by centrifugal force (the proximity of the Earth means there is no effective lunar-stationary orbit), but differential gravity forces means that an elevator could be constructed through Lagrangian points. A near-side elevator would extend through the Earth-Moon L1 point from an anchor point near the center of the visible part of Earth&#x27;s Moon: the length of such an elevator must exceed the maximum L1 altitude of 59,548 km, and would be considerably longer to reduce the mass of the required apex counterweight. A far-side lunar elevator would pass through the L2 Lagrangian point and would need to be longer than on the near-side; again, the tether length depends on the chosen apex anchor mass, but it could also be made of existing engineering materials.

Rapidly spinning asteroids or moons could use cables to eject materials to convenient points, such as Earth orbits; or conversely, to eject materials to send a portion of the mass of the asteroid or moon to Earth orbit or a Lagrangian point. Freeman Dyson, a physicist and mathematician, suggested using such smaller systems as power generators at points distant from the Sun where solar power is uneconomical.

A space elevator using presently available engineering materials could be constructed between mutually tidally locked worlds, such as Pluto and Charon or the components of binary asteroid 90 Antiope, with no terminus disconnect, according to Francis Graham of Kent State University. However, spooled variable lengths of cable must be used due to ellipticity of the orbits.

==Construction==
The construction of a space elevator would need reduction of some technical risk. Some advances in engineering, manufacturing and physical technology are required. Once a first space elevator is built, the second one and all others would have the use of the previous ones to assist in construction, making their costs considerably lower. Such follow-on space elevators would also benefit from the great reduction in technical risk achieved by the construction of the first space elevator.

Prior to the work of Edwards in 2000, most concepts for constructing a space elevator had the cable manufactured in space. That was thought to be necessary for such a large and long object and for such a large counterweight. Manufacturing the cable in space would be done in principle by using an asteroid or Near-Earth object for source material. These earlier concepts for construction require a large preexisting space-faring infrastructure to maneuver an asteroid into its needed orbit around Earth. They also required the development of technologies for manufacture in space of large quantities of exacting materials.

Since 2001, most work has focused on simpler methods of construction requiring much smaller space infrastructures. They conceive the launch of a long cable on a large spool, followed by deployment of it in space. The spool would be initially parked in a geostationary orbit above the planned anchor point. A long cable would be dropped &quot;downward&quot; (toward Earth) and would be balanced by a mass being dropped &quot;upward&quot; (away from Earth) for the whole system to remain on the geosynchronous orbit. Earlier designs imagined the balancing mass to be another cable (with counterweight) extending upward, with the main spool remaining at the original geosynchronous orbit level. Most current designs elevate the spool itself as the main cable is payed out, a simpler process. When the lower end of the cable is long enough to reach the surface of the Earth (at the equator), it would be anchored. Once anchored, the center of mass would be elevated more (by adding mass at the upper end or by paying out more cable). This would add more tension to the whole cable, which could then be used as an elevator cable.

One plan for construction uses conventional rockets to place a &quot;minimum size&quot; initial seed cable of only 19,800 kg. This first very small ribbon would be adequate to support the first 619 kg climber. The first 207 climbers would carry up and attach more cable to the original, increasing its cross section area and widening the initial ribbon to about 160 mm wide at its widest point. The result would be a 750-ton cable with a lift capacity of 20 tons per climber.

===Safety issues and construction challenges===

For early systems, transit times from the surface to the level of geosynchronous orbit would be about five days. On these early systems, the time spent moving through the Van Allen radiation belts would be enough that passengers would need to be protected from radiation by shielding, which would add mass to the climber and decrease payload.

A space elevator would present a navigational hazard, both to aircraft and spacecraft. Aircraft could be diverted by air-traffic control restrictions. All objects in stable orbits that have perigee below the maximum altitude of the cable that are not synchronous with the cable would impact the cable eventually, unless avoiding action is taken. One potential solution proposed by Edwards is to use a movable anchor (a sea anchor) to allow the tether to &quot;dodge&quot; any space debris large enough to track.

Impacts by space objects such as meteoroids, micrometeorites and orbiting man-made debris pose another design constraint on the cable. A cable would need to be designed to maneuver out of the way of debris, or absorb impacts of small debris without breaking.

===Economics===

With a space elevator, materials might be sent into orbit at a fraction of the current cost. As of 2022, conventional rocket designs cost about US$12,125 per kilogram (US$5,500 per pound) for transfer to geostationary orbit. Current space elevator proposals envision payload prices starting as low as $220 per kilogram ($100 per pound), similar to the $5–$300/kg estimates of the Launch loop, but higher than the $310/ton to 500 km orbit quoted to Dr. Jerry Pournelle for an orbital airship system.

Philip Ragan, co-author of the book &quot;Leaving the Planet by Space Elevator&quot;, states that &quot;The first country to deploy a space elevator will have a 95 percent cost advantage and could potentially control all space activities.&quot;

==International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC)==
The International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC) is a US Non-Profit 501(c)(3) Corporation formed to promote the development, construction, and operation of a space elevator as &quot;a revolutionary and efficient way to space for all humanity&quot;. It was formed after the Space Elevator Conference in Redmond, Washington in July 2008 and became an affiliate organization with the National Space Society in August 2013. ISEC hosts an annual Space Elevator conference at the Seattle Museum of Flight.

ISEC coordinates with the two other major societies focusing on space elevators: the Japanese Space Elevator Association and EuroSpaceward. ISEC supports symposia and presentations at the International Academy of Astronautics and the International Astronautical Federation Congress each year.

==Related concepts==
The conventional current concept of a &quot;Space Elevator&quot; has evolved from a static compressive structure reaching to the level of GEO, to the modern baseline idea of a static tensile structure anchored to the ground and extending to well above the level of GEO. In the current usage by practitioners (and in this article), a &quot;Space Elevator&quot; means the Tsiolkovsky-Artsutanov-Pearson type as considered by the International Space Elevator Consortium. This conventional type is a static structure fixed to the ground and extending into space high enough that cargo can climb the structure up from the ground to a level where simple release will put the cargo into an orbit.

Some concepts related to this modern baseline are not usually termed a &quot;Space Elevator&quot;, but are similar in some way and are sometimes termed &quot;Space Elevator&quot; by their proponents. For example, Hans Moravec published an article in 1977 called &quot;A Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhook&quot; describing a concept using a rotating cable. The rotation speed would exactly match the orbital speed in such a way that the tip velocity at the lowest point was zero compared to the object to be &quot;elevated&quot;. It would dynamically grapple and then &quot;elevate&quot; high flying objects to orbit or low orbiting objects to higher orbit.

The original concept envisioned by Tsiolkovsky was a compression structure, a concept similar to an aerial mast. While such structures might reach space (100 km, 62 mi), they are unlikely to reach geostationary orbit. The concept of a Tsiolkovsky tower combined with a classic space elevator cable (reaching above the level of GEO) has been suggested. Other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles. The vehicle is &quot;elevated&quot; up the tower, which may extend as high as above the atmosphere, and is launched from the top. Such a tall tower to access near-space altitudes of has been proposed by various researchers.

The aerovator is a concept invented by a Yahoo Group discussing space elevators, and included in a 2009 book about space elevators. It would consist of a &gt;1000 km long ribbon extending diagonally upwards from a ground-level hub and then levelling out to become horizontal. Aircraft would pull on the ribbon while flying in a circle, causing the ribbon to rotate around the hub once every 13 minutes with its tip travelling at 8 km/s. The ribbon would stay in the air through a mix of aerodynamic lift and centrifugal force. Payloads would climb up the ribbon and then be launched from the fast-moving tip into orbit.

Other concepts for non-rocket spacelaunch related to a space elevator (or parts of a space elevator) include an orbital ring, a space fountain, a launch loop, a skyhook, a space tether, and a buoyant &quot;SpaceShaft&quot;.

<text>Albert Francis &quot;Al&quot; Simmons, better known as Spawn, is a fictional antihero appearing in a monthly comic book of the same name published by American company Image Comics, as well as in a number of films, television series, and video game adaptations set in the Image Universe. Created by Todd McFarlane, Spawn first appeared in &quot;Spawn&quot; #1 (May 1992).

Simmons is a mercenary who died and went to Hell for his crimes against humanity. Following a deal with Malebolgia, Simmons is given new life as a hellspawn and the chance to see his wife Wanda once again. The deal is revealed to be a trick, as Simmons is brought back to life five years after his death, unrecognizable to his wife and missing many of his memories. With little other choice, Simmons adopts his new hell inspired identity as Spawn in an effort to atone for his past sins and use his newfound powers for good.

The series has spun off several other comic books, including &quot;Angela&quot;, &quot;Curse of the Spawn&quot;, &quot;Sam &amp; Twitch&quot;, and the Japanese manga &quot;Shadows of Spawn.&quot; Spawn was adapted into a 1997 feature film and portrayed by Michael Jai White, an HBO animated series lasting from 1997 until 1999, a series of action figures from McFarlane Toys, and an upcoming reboot film starring Jamie Foxx and Jeremy Renner. The character appears in annual compilations, mini-series specials written by guest authors and artists, and numerous crossover storylines in other comic books, including &quot;Savage Dragon&quot;, &quot;Invincible&quot;, and three DC Comics crossovers with Batman.

==Publication history==

Todd McFarlane&#x27;s hobby of drawing began at an early age, and he created the character Spawn when he was 16, spending &quot;countless hours&quot; perfecting the appearance of each component of the character&#x27;s visual design.

&quot;Spawn&quot; saw considerable popularity upon its initial release in the 1990s. Comic book collecting had a marked upswing at the time, fueled by the speculator boom looking for the next hot book that would jump in value after its release. McFarlane had enjoyed superstar status among comic fans with his work on &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, which had featured McFarlane&#x27;s name prominently as both writer and artist. McFarlane&#x27;s subsequent break with Marvel Comics and the formation of Image Comics was seen by many as a sea-change event, changing the way in which comics were produced. &quot;Wizard&quot;, in May 2008, rated &quot;The Launch of Image Comics&quot; as #1 in the list of events that rocked the comic industry from 1991 to 2008.

The first issue of &quot;Spawn&quot; was very popular, selling 1.7 million copies. During &quot;Spawn&quot;″s second year of publication, &quot;Wizard&quot; noted that &quot;The top dog at Image is undoubtedly Todd McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot;, which, without the added marketing push of fancy covers, poly bagged issues, or card inserts has become the best-selling comic on a consistent basis that is currently being published.&quot; Sales slumped around the time of &quot;Spawn&quot; #25, but by &quot;Spawn&quot; #45 it was again a consistently strong seller.

The popularity of the franchise peaked with the 1997 &quot;Spawn&quot; feature film, the pre-release publicity for which helped make &quot;Spawn&quot; the top-selling comic book for May 1997; in addition, the spin-off &quot;Curse of the Spawn&quot; #9 came in at fifth best-selling in that same month. However, the film was only a mild commercial success and failed to start a film franchise based on the character. A 2008 issue, &quot;Spawn&quot; #174, ranked 99th best-selling comic of the month with retail orders of 22,667. In October 2008, issue #185, which marked both a new creative direction and Todd McFarlane&#x27;s return to the book, sold out at the distribution level and received a second printing. By issue #191 in May 2009, with estimated sales of 19,803 copies, &quot;Spawn&quot; had dropped below Top 100 titles sold monthly to comic shops as reported by Diamond Comic Distributors. As of September 2010, Spawn was ranked at #115 in the top 300 sales figures chart reported by Diamond Comic Distributors. On the day of its release in 2011, issue #200 sold out. This issue featured work by Greg Capullo, David Finch, Michael Golden, Jim Lee, Rob Liefeld, Marc Silvestri, Danny Miki, and Ashley Wood. A second printing was released the next month. It received a negative review from &quot;IGN&quot;. &quot;Spawn&quot;&#x27;s sales continued to decline despite a series of homage covers designed to renew interest, ultimately hitting its lowest sales number of under 12,000 retail orders in &quot;Spawn&quot; #243.

&quot;Spawn&quot; began a resurgence in popularity as the title approached its 300th issue, with the title once again becoming a fixture in Diamond&#x27;s Top 100. The 300th issue made Spawn the longest-running independent comic book series of all time.

In 2021, McFarlane expanded his Spawn Universe with 3 new ongoing titles and a one-shot titled &quot;Spawn Universe No. 1&quot; which sold 211,000 copies. The first spinoff, titled &quot;King Spawn&quot;, was released in August 2021 having pre-order sales of 497,000 copies and total sales of 520,000 copies. The next title, released in October 2021, &quot;Gunslinger Spawn&quot; sold 385,000 copies, which made it the biggest launch for a new ongoing superhero title in 25 years. The final new series, &quot;The Scorched&quot;, was released in January 2022 and sold more than 270,000 copies.

McFarlane also stated in an interview that he wants Spawn to outlive him the same way characters like &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and even &quot;Disney&quot; have endured past their creators.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Albert Francis &quot;Al&quot; Simmons is the second oldest of three siblings. His father, Bernard Simmons, is a traveling salesman, and his mother, Esther Simmons, is a devil worshipper. Al Simmons eventually becomes a highly decorated officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel while serving with Force Recon. He later joins the Secret Service, becomes a high-ranking official, and is recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency. Simmons later joins the U.S. Security Group, an umbrella agency encompassing the CIA, NSA, and NSC, commanded by Director Jason Wynn, and becomes a capable assassin.

During a mission in Botswana, Wynn grows tired of Simmons&#x27; increasing sense of morality. As a result of this, Simmons&#x27; friend and partner Bruce Stinson (codename Chapel) is secretly hired to kill him. Simmons is burned to death and sent to Hell. Making a deal with the devil Malebolgia, Simmons agrees to become a Hellspawn. After swearing to serve Malebolgia, he is allowed to see his wife Wanda one last time. Malebolgia returns Simmons to the living realm with a severely burned body, and a demonic guardian named the Violator.

Simmons, now a Hellspawn, returns to Earth with a lack of understanding of his previous identity. He wanders in a state of confusion with only vague memories of his former life, including his own name, his marriage to Wanda and the fact that he was once deceased. Spawn occasionally experiences painful flashbacks and eventually remembers his deal with Malebolgia. Using CIA files, he tracks down his wife and finds her married to his former best friend Terry, with whom she has a daughter named Cyan. He realizes five years have passed since his death.

Spawn runs into a fellow Hellspawn, who informs him that his powers are fueled by Necroplasm and that once they are depleted, he will return to Hell. Not wanting to return to Hell, Spawn attempts to find a new purpose in life while using as little power as possible. Spawn is thrust into several antihero adventures, taking down street gangs and organized crime in New York City. Battling against various criminals, Spawn finds a new purpose in stopping evil.

===Early history===
In his early battles, Spawn faces street thugs and gangs, becoming a dark, sadistic antihero, and brutally murders the pedophile and child murderer Billy Kincaid. Spawn gains the attention of police detectives Sam Burke and Twitch Williams, and becomes &quot;King of Rat City&quot;, a gathering of alleys populated by the city&#x27;s homeless. There he meets Cogliostro, who knows much about Spawn and becomes his mentor.

Spawn is hunted by the warrior angel Angela, who hunts Hellspawns for sport, and battles the cyborg mob enforcer Overt-Kill. He fights the angelic warrior Anti-Spawn, also known as the Redeemer, who is really Jason Wynn.

====First metamorphosis====
Following a conflict with the Redeemer, Spawn&#x27;s costume undergoes a significant upgrade. The upgraded suit features a new cape and chains, which are able to change shape. Additionally, the boots and gloves are replaced with spikes. After this transformation, the suit starts feeding off souls.

After this, Tony Twist sends a reprogrammed Overt-Kill after Terry, and Spawn is forced to reveal his identity while saving his friend. A well-placed shot from Twitch Williams brings down Overt-Kill. Spawn is part of Angela&#x27;s trial and later travels to the South and encounters the KKK and an abusive father of two boys. After returning to New York, he is attacked by a new Redeemer, causing his costume to evolve once more. After another encounter with the Curse, the suit sends him to Hell. Malebolgia later sends him back with full control of the suit.

Spawn wears a living symbiotic costume, Leetha of the 7th House of K (also known as K7-Leetha). While wearing it, the host assumes a dominant role over the suit. His shroud, spikes, chains and skulls are all part of an organism bonded to his central nervous system that protects Spawn even if he is unconscious.

===War of Heaven and Hell===
====Battle for life====
As Spawn struggles to find a way to regain control, he notices that the attacks are coming from both Heaven and Hell. Due to increasing attacks, Spawn begins to lose himself to evil. With help from the Heap, an emissary of the Greenworld, Spawn manages to regain his goal. Greenworld, a dimension whose power is equal to both Heaven and Hell, gives new powers to Spawn to better understand the world and its people. These powers seem to give him control of all of the elements in the world.

Spawn is later attacked by Urizen. After recovering, Spawn learns the Greenworld has imbued him with a gift, which he uses to contain Urizen by splitting the ground and imprisoning him inside the earth.

After his battle, Spawn learns Malebolgia had caused Urizen&#x27;s release in an attempt to start Armageddon and conquer the forces of Heaven. Spawn and Angela journey to Hell to stop him. During the battle, Angela mortally wounds Malebolgia, who kills her in retaliation. Consumed with anger, Spawn takes Malebolgia&#x27;s head.

====King of Hell====
Upon killing Malebolgia, Spawn learns Hell&#x27;s throne is rightfully his when it is offered to him by the demon Mammon. After initially refusing, Spawn deliberates with Cogliostro and decides to turn Hell into a new paradise. During this act, Cogliostrio reveals he is Cain, who was the first person to go to Hell, having murdered his brother in envy. His true goal had always been to take over Hell using a Hellspawn. Having betrayed Spawn, Cogliostrio takes the throne but restores his former student&#x27;s human form as a parting gift.

On Earth, Spawn meets Nyx, a young Wiccan that helps him regain his suit. Using trickery, Mammon usurps Nyx&#x27;s control over Spawn&#x27;s union with his suit and removing all of Al&#x27;s memories. Amnesiac, Spawn wanders the Earth. He releases a group of angels called the Forgotten and stays neutral in the war between Heaven and Hell. He discovers Mammon is a member of the Fallen who was sent to Hell.

====Spawn in Armageddon====
Spawn regains his memories thanks to the power of the Greenworld. His suit evolves once more and seems one with his body. However, as time progresses, he begins to hate himself. Having been rejected by Heaven and Hell, he now lives in an abandoned warehouse as maggots and other insects crawl inside his body. He returns to the Dead Zone, although a Hellspawn would not be welcomed there. Upon entering, Spawn is confronted by the Disciple, who tears his brain out, throws his heart into the Greenworld, and his body into Hell. Mammon captures and tortures Spawn to learn his secrets.

When Spawn&#x27;s heart falls to the Greenworld, a soul is freed. Chris meets with his mother and travels to Hell along with Sam Burke and Twitch Williams to rescue Spawn from Mammon. Spawn escapes and returns to Earth, where signs of Armageddon begin to appear. Looking for a way to stop it, Spawn discovers Wanda&#x27;s twin children are responsible. He stops them from killing their entire family but cannot destroy them. Zera reveals Jake is God and Katie is Satan.

Due to their hatred of each other and constant fighting, the Mother removed their powers and positions and sent them to Earth. She tells him he cannot stop Armageddon. However, he has the potential to gain the power of a god and preserve the human race.

He has to eat a piece of Forbidden Fruit from the Garden of Eden to gain such power. She tells Spawn he must fight against The Disciple. It is revealed there are 12 Disciples, each one representing one of Jesus. Spawn&#x27;s power is also weakened because demons cannot enter the Garden. However, with guidance from Cyan, he defeats every Disciple but Judas, who Cyan tells Spawn not to kill. Judas then stabs Cyan in the heart but the Mother gives Spawn a piece of the fruit and resurrects him. He gains an angelic form and greater power.

Spawn returns to Earth, which has been destroyed by Four Horsemen; angels and demons are waiting to fight their final battle. After defeating Zera, Spawn finds dead warriors of Heaven, one of whom is Granny Blake, who is betrayed by her faith. Spawn battles the forces of Satan and God, destroying the forces of Heaven, Hell and humanity. He is then killed by the two, who then fight alone on Earth.

Spawn comes back and resurrects everyone with the knowledge of what happened. He leaves God and Satan to fight in their own little world and closes the doors to Heaven, Hell, and Earth. He asks to be turned into a human by the Mother but later asks to once again become a Hellspawn after remembering that, prior to his first death as Al Simmons, he had beaten Wanda and caused her to miscarry their child. This causes him to conclude he has always been a monster and does not deserve to be human again.

===Back in the mortal world===
====New Clown====
After a series of odd murders, Spawn finds the Clown has come back, possessing the body of mortal Barney Saunders, who is having an affair with a woman named Wilma Barbara. Spawn destroys and remakes the world. Saunders is rescued by the Clown so he can use his body. He then brings out the dark urges inside the tenants of an apartment building and uses this to form a doorway to Hell and bring back his brothers. However, before he can form a portal, Wilma shows up and his love for her allows Saunders to take back control. Intending to close the portal, he goes through it, and takes Wilma with him due to being angry over her leaving him in the chute.

Zera reappears as a head in a jar. Spawn is summoned by a voodoo priestess named Mambo Suzanne. Zera attempts to take over Nyx&#x27;s body and fights Spawn. However, she is killed when Suzanne throws Zera&#x27;s head into the street. Nyx is freed and she and Spawn become friends again.

Ab and Zab create a hell where visitors are forced to view their deepest fears, which are eaten by demons called sin-eaters. While confronting Ab and Zab, Spawn is faced with his own sin against Wanda and his unborn child. Unable to break free from the guilt, Spawn is parasitized by a sin eater. When Nyx interferes, he breaks the sin eater&#x27;s illusion. Spawn breaks all the other&#x27;s illusions and comes across Al Simmons&#x27; brother Richard.

Spawn decides to allow Richard to feel his sins. Mammon, as Mr. Malefick, had put an influence on Al and Richard Simmons. Only Marc Simmons saved himself from Mammon but was unable to help the others. Richard calls his brothers to help him save the drug dealer&#x27;s life. Al, instead of calling an ambulance, pulls the knife from Weasel&#x27;s body and kills him with it. Mammon appears, sending the brothers home while he hides the drug dealer&#x27;s body.

Nyx and Spawn kill the last sin eater and Spawn discovers Richard cannot remember their parents due to a spell placed by Mammon. Wanting to know more about them, Spawn finds their home under a spell placed by Mammon. His mother planned with Mammon to create the strongest Hellspawn. Al is then given a journal by his father that reveals his ancestor came across a Hellspawn in the past known as the Gunslinger Spawn.

====Morana====
There, Spawn speaks with Wanda, who cannot forgive Al for the death of their child. However, she still loves the man inside Spawn. Trying to take out Cyan&#x27;s knife, Spawn somehow suppresses the suit. Cyan and Nyx appear, and K7-Leetha appears and takes over Nyx. Now controlled by the K7, Nyx tries to kill Cyan and Wanda but is halted by Mammon. The entire group goes to a castle, where Mammon explains his plan to make a perfect Hellspawn. He wants the Rapture to occur so Satan, God, and Malebolgia will be gone. He reveals his perfect Hellspawn is Al and Wanda&#x27;s miscarried child, Morana.

After washing herself in virgin&#x27;s blood, Morana bonds with the uniform and gets ready to consume her parents&#x27; souls. Cyan taps into her powers and goes to the future. She talks with an old woman who gives her a message for Al. Returning, she has Spawn summon the last twelve members of the Legion, who are beaten by Morana. Mammon insults Al and disowns Morana. Cyan tells Nyx a spell to trap Mammon and Morana. It works, both demons are sealed away, and the others return home. Al jumps into another dimension to be reborn as a weapon against both heaven and hell.

====Endgame====
Spawn is soon ready to enter the human dimension. Making his way to the alleys, he blows his head off. Meanwhile, Jim Downing, an amnesiac man healing at a hospital, wakes up. He seems to know Spawn. A janitor tries to make money off Jim&#x27;s story and calls a lawyer, who later commits suicide. A thug is paid to capture Jim and attacks him with a flaming skull. In the ensuing fight, the hospital is set on fire and Jim transforms into Spawn. After killing his attacker, Jim escapes the burning building in human form, eventually being taken in by firefighters.

After being taken to another hospital, he leaves, reunites with his previous nurse Sara, and begins to transform. He calls Sara but leaves before she can see him. Meanwhile, a reporter begins to ask questions about the incident at the hospital. Wandering the city, Jim is attacked and kills his assailants. This draws the attention of Sam and Twitch, who recognize the chaos as Spawn&#x27;s doings.

After reuniting with Sara and telling him about his transformation, Jim wanders off again and meets Wanda Blake, Al Simmons&#x27; ex-wife. She recognizes Jim as the form Al took when he originally returned to earth.

On Wanda&#x27;s advice, Jim travels to Rat City and finds Spawn&#x27;s throne and is met by an angel. Jim beats the angel in a fight and leaves. He finds out that a man working for Gilbert Sanchez has been asking questions about him.

The angel Spawn beat is later attacked by Clown, who removes her wings. When Spawn returns, she is powerless and insane and finds Freak and Violator. Despite Freak&#x27;s warnings, Clown begins to deceive Jim and informs him his suit is a living being and then vanishes. Clown is arrested by Sam and Twitch and meets the leader of a vampire group to attempt to form a unity between the leader, Clown, and Spawn.

Mob members kill Gilbert Sanchez for his information on the new Spawn. Spawn attempts to learn more about Jim but is assaulted and uses his powers on his attacker. Jim later finds the man who had been asking Sara questions. He tracks him to his family&#x27;s home, which is bombed, killing everyone inside but Spawn. Spawn finds more mob members, questions them further and kills them.

====Resurrection====
In Resurrection, Spawn is revived and is later told by God in dog form that Wanda has died and is now trapped in Hell, where Al must rescue her. He fights Satan and saves his wife. God and Satan are no longer twins because McFarlane lost the right to use the Man of Miracles character due to a copyright dispute with Marvel. Man of Miracles is retconned out of existence, and God and Satan are based on the Abrahamic story of Creation. After saving Wanda from Satan, she goes to Heaven and Spawn continues to protect the people in Wanda&#x27;s memory from the forces of both Heaven and Hell, as well as any supernatural threats.

==Legal disputes==
===Dispute with Neil Gaiman===
In 1993, McFarlane contracted [[Neil Gaiman]] to write &quot;Spawn&quot; #9. While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters [[Cogliostro]], [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], and [[Medieval Spawn]]. All three characters were designed and co-created by [[Todd McFarlane]] and continued to be featured in the series after Gaiman&#x27;s involvement, and some had tie-ins with McFarlane&#x27;s toy company. Cogliostro had a prominent role in [[Spawn (1997 film)|the live-action movie]] in 1997. McFarlane had agreed that Gaiman was a co-creator of the characters and paid him royalties for reprints, graphic novels, and action figures. After a few years, he ceased the payment of royalties and gave Gaiman notice that he owned all rights to the characters, citing the copyright notice from #9 and claimed that Gaiman&#x27;s work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane was the sole owner.

In 2002, Gaiman filed suit against McFarlane and, in response, McFarlane counter-sued. Gaiman had partnered with [[Marvel Comics]] to form Marvels and Miracles, LLC, which bankrolled the lawsuit. The main goal was to determine the issue of ownership for another character Gaiman felt he had a stake in, Miracleman, which at the time McFarlane was believed to hold a sizable stake in after his buyout of the assets of [[Eclipse Comics]]. This issue was thrown out. Instead, the court chose to rule on the breach of contract issue, the rights of ownership and the copyrightability of the characters from &quot;Spawn&quot; #9. Several arguments were presented by McFarlane and all were rejected, leading to a sizable judgment against McFarlane and [[Image Comics]]. The matter went to appeal and the judgment was upheld in a 2004 decision.

Gaiman&#x27;s rights as co-creator and co-owner of Cogliostro, Angela, and Medieval Spawn were acknowledged. The court&#x27;s view was that Gaiman and McFarlane&#x27;s collaboration led to each contributing half of the work. Gaiman wrote the story while McFarlane illustrated the character; because of this, each held a 50% stake in the characters. Issue 9 was reprinted for the first time since the lawsuit was filed in the hardcover edition of &quot;Spawn Origins: Volume 1&quot;. In a reprint collection of the first twelve issues of &quot;Spawn&quot;, the contentious issue (along with [[Dave Sim]]&#x27;s #10, featuring copyrighted character [[Cerebus]]) was excluded, but both issues have been reprinted in the hardcover and deluxe editions of &quot;Spawn Origins Collection: Volume 1&quot;, and the black and white 2012 (and the later 2021 color edition) softcover [[omnibus edition|omnibus]] &quot;Spawn Compendium&quot; 1, collecting &quot;Spawn&quot; issues #1–50. In 2012, McFarlane and Gaiman settled their dispute, and Gaiman was given full ownership of the character Angela. Gaiman, in turn, sold all rights to the character to Marvel Comics.

===Tony Twist lawsuit===
[[Todd McFarlane]] created a mob enforcer character named &quot;Antonio &#x27;Tony Twist&#x27; Twistelli&quot;, who McFarlane acknowledged was named after hockey player [[Tony Twist]]. Twist won a $15 million verdict in 2004 when a jury found Todd McFarlane Productions had profited from Twist&#x27;s likeness. The verdict was upheld after two appeals in June 2006, but the two later settled out of court for $5 million.

== Collected editions ==
Many issues of &quot;Spawn&quot; have been gathered together in various [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] collections since the mid-nineties. The original US and UK trade releases contain issue 9, but not 10 ([[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]&#x27; appearance).

Each containing four to five issues, the original &quot;Spawn&quot; trade paperbacks started in 1995 under a different trade cover design, going up to three volumes only. After the [[Spawn (1997 film)|live-action]] 1997 movie, a new trade cover design was created, with Brent Ashe providing new covers for Books 1–7, and [[Ashley Wood]] for Books 8–12. These reissues were retitled with [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]]s. The sequential trades stopped after Book 12, but several new volumes appeared in 2006–2008, collecting various [[story arc]]s. Beginning in 2009, a new series of volumes was released, collecting the &quot;Endgame&quot; storyline. From 2015 to 2020, with &quot;Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Satan Saga Wars&quot;, &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, &quot;Dark Horror&quot;, &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;, and &quot;Vengeance&quot; volumes, the trade paperbacks have started in sequential order again collecting issues #251–297.

After a two-year gap, the line resumed with three volumes released in 2022: &quot;Spawn: Record Breaker&quot; (May 2022), &quot;Spawn: Aftermath&quot; (July 2022) and &quot;Spawn: Omega&quot; (September 2022), between them collecting &quot;Spawn&quot; issues #298-314.

=== &quot;Spawn Collection&quot; ===
In 2005, the entire &quot;Spawn&quot; series began to appear in massive trade paperback releases under the title &quot;Spawn Collection&quot; – each volume containing approximately twenty issues, except for the first one, which contains ten. Released after the Gaiman lawsuit, these editions do not contain either Issue 9 (featuring the first appearance of Angela and Cogliostro, both created by Neil Gaiman) or Issue 10 (featuring [[Dave Sim]]&#x27;s [[Cerebus]]).

&quot;Spawn Collection&quot; Volumes 1 and 2 were published in both hardcover and trade paperback formats, while Volume 3 onward were only released as trade paperbacks. As of 2009, &quot;Spawn Collection Volume 1&quot; is currently out of print, with its fourth printing released in June 2007. In 2009 it was announced that the &quot;Spawn Collection&quot; would end with Volume 6, to be replaced by a new TBP format that includes soft- and hardcover versions, reprinting the entire &quot;Spawn&quot; series from the early issues once again (&quot;Spawn Origins Collection&quot;, see below).

* &quot;Spawn Collection Volume 1&quot; – contains issues 1–8, 11–12 (December 2005)
* &quot;Spawn Collection Volume 2&quot; – contains issues 13–33 (July 2006)
* &quot;Spawn Collection Volume 3&quot; – contains issues 34–54 (March 2007)
* &quot;Spawn Collection Volume 4&quot; – contains issues 55–75 (September 2007)
* &quot;Spawn Collection Volume 5&quot; – contains issues 76–95 (April 2008)

&quot;Spawn Collection Volume 1&quot; was ranked 17 in the top 100 graphic novels for December 2005 period, with pre-order sales of 3,227.

=== &quot;Spawn Compendium&quot; ===
In 2012, in celebration of Image Comics&#x27; then 20 years as a publisher and &quot;Spawn&quot; being one of their longest running titles, &quot;Spawn Compendium&quot; was released, reprinting &quot;Spawn&quot; issues #1–50 at 1136 pages in black and white, though this volume does not collect the individual issues&#x27; covers. The book went to a second printing in March 2016.

A new edition of this volume, collected now in full color, was released in February 2021 with a different front cover art (from &quot;Spawn&quot; #95, and back cover art from &quot;Spawn&quot; #70). As with the previous edition, this book does not collect the individual issues&#x27; covers. Subsequent volumes have been released since collecting every 50 issues per tome.

=== &quot;Spawn Origins Collection&quot; ===
In 2009, a line of newly redesigned and reformatted trade paperbacks was announced, replacing the &quot;Spawn Collection&quot; line (see above) and once again collecting the early issues of &quot;Spawn&quot;. These new trades feature new cover art by [[Greg Capullo]], recreating classic &quot;Spawn&quot; covers. In addition to the 6 issue trade paperbacks, this line features three oversized 12–13 issue hardcovers, and two large 25-issue limited slipcased deluxe editions (which come in both a standard edition and a signed and numbered edition limited to 500 copies). The 12-issue hardcover edition of Volume One was the first to reprint both Issues 9 and 10, and the 25-issue deluxe editions did as well. &quot;Spawn Origins Collection&quot; Volume 20 trade paperback was the final volume released in 2014, collecting issues #117–122.

In May 2019, a new edition of &quot;Spawn Origins Collection&quot; Volume 1 TPB (6th printing) was published at the low cover price of US$9.99. The book went back to press again for a seventh printing a few months later in September 2019.

After an eight-year gap, the line resumed in April 2022 with &quot;Spawn Origins Collection Volume 21&quot; collecting issues #123–128. &quot;Spawn Origins Collection Volume 22&quot; collecting issues #129–134 was published in September 2022.

* In early 2015, McFarlane announced a new Spawn film adaptation. In February 2016 McFarlane confirmed he had completed the script for the film with a larger-than-normal page count because he was &quot;putting in details for [him]self&quot; in conjunction with his hopes to direct. In July 2017, it was confirmed that McFarlane would direct the film, which is being produced under [[Jason Blum]]&#x27;s production company [[Blumhouse Productions|Blumhouse]]. In May 2018, it was reported that [[Jamie Foxx]] would portray the title character. In July 2018, the working title was revealed to be &quot;Tony Dynamite&quot;. In November 2019, the film restarted development due to the financial success of the R-rated comic book film &quot;[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]&quot;. In August 2021, it was revealed that &quot;[[Broken City]]&quot; screenwriter [[Brian Tucker (screenwriter)|Brian Tucker]] had been hired to rewrite McFarlane&#x27;s screenplay. In October 2022, McFarlane announced that [[Scott Silver]], [[Malcolm Spellman]], and Matthew Mixon had been hired to rewrite the screenplay. In June 2023, Jason Blum announced that he is aiming for a 2025 release date. On July 22, 2024, McFarlane announced on his Twitter page that the script was completed, and that the film would be retitled &quot;King Spawn&quot;.
* Spawn appears in &quot;[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]&quot; (2018). He also appears as an avatar fighting the forces of IOI on Planet Doom during the final battle.

<doc id="29198" wikidata="Q1830735" url="?curid=29198" title="Samba (software)">
<text>Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB networking protocol, and was originally developed by Andrew Tridgell. Samba provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Microsoft Windows Server domain, either as a Domain Controller (DC) or as a domain member. As of version 4, it supports Active Directory and Microsoft Windows NT domains.

Samba runs on most Unix-like systems, such as Linux, Solaris, AIX and the BSD variants, including Apple macOS (Mac OS X 10.2 and greater) and macOS Server. Samba also runs on a number of other operating systems such as OpenVMS and IBM i. Samba is standard on nearly all distributions of Linux and is commonly included as a basic system service on other Unix-based operating systems as well. Samba is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The name &quot;Samba&quot; comes from SMB (Server Message Block), the name of the proprietary protocol used by the Microsoft Windows network file system.

==Early history==
Andrew Tridgell developed the first version of Samba Unix in December 1991 and January 1992, as a PhD student at the Australian National University, using a packet sniffer to do network analysis of the protocol used by DEC Pathworks server software. It did not have a formal name at the time of the first releases, versions 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0, all from the first half of January 1992; Tridgell simply referred to it as &quot;a Unix file server for Dos Pathworks.&quot; He understood that he had &quot;in fact implemented the netbios protocol&quot; at the time of version 1.0 and that &quot;this software could be used with other PC clients.&quot;

With a focus on interoperability with Microsoft&#x27;s LAN Manager, Tridgell released &quot;netbios for unix&quot;, observer, version 1.5 in December 1993. This release was the first to include client-software as well as a server. Also, at this time GPL2 was chosen as license.

Midway through the 1.5-series, the name was changed to &quot;smbserver&quot;. However, Tridgell got a trademark notice from the company &quot;Syntax&quot;, who sold a product named &quot;TotalNet Advanced Server&quot; and owned the trademark for &quot;SMBserver&quot;. The name &quot;Samba&quot; was derived by running the Unix command grep through the system dictionary looking for words that contained the letters S, M, and B, in that order (i.e. ).

Versions 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 followed relatively quickly, with the latter being released in January 1995. Tridgell considers the adoption of CVS in May 1996 to mark the birth of the Samba Team, though there had been contributions from other people, especially Jeremy Allison, previously.

Version 2.0.0, released in January 1999, was a major release, support for authentication from Windows NT Primary Domain Controller, 64 bit filesystem support for very large files, and exposure of OPLOCKS to unix systems. Version 2.2.0 released in April 2001.

==Version history==


==Security==
Some versions of Samba 3.6.3 and lower suffer serious security issues which can allow anonymous users to gain root access to a system from an anonymous connection, through the exploitation of an error in Samba&#x27;s remote procedure call.

On 12 April 2016, Badlock, a crucial security bug in Windows and Samba, was disclosed. Badlock for Samba is referenced by CVE|2016-2118 (SAMR and LSA man in the middle attacks possible).

On 24 May 2017, it was announced that a remote code execution vulnerability had been found in Samba named &quot;EternalRed&quot; or &quot;SambaCry&quot;, affecting all versions since 3.5.0. This vulnerability was assigned identifier CVE|2017-7494.

On 14 September 2020, a proof-of-concept exploit for the netlogon vulnerability called &quot;Zerologon&quot; (CVE|2020-1472) for which a patch exists since August was published. Some federal agencies using the software have been ordered to install the patch.

==Features==
Samba allows file and print sharing between computers running Microsoft Windows and computers running Unix. It is an implementation of dozens of services and a dozen protocols, including:
* NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT)
* SMB (known as CIFS in some versions)
** Samba supports POSIX extensions for CIFS/SMB. The initial extension was CIFS VFS (CAP_UNIX) from 2004, which has been somewhat superseded by SMB3.
* DCE/RPC or more specifically, MSRPC, the Network Neighborhood suite of protocols
* A WINS server also known as a NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS)
* The NT Domain suite of protocols which includes NT Domain Logons
* Security Account Manager (SAM) database
* Local Security Authority (LSA) service
* NT-style printing service (SPOOLSS)
* NTLM
* Active Directory Logon using modified versions of Kerberos and LDAP
* DFS server

All these services and protocols are frequently incorrectly referred to as just NetBIOS or SMB. The NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) and WINS protocols, and their underlying SMB version 1 protocol, are deprecated on Windows. Since Windows Vista the WS-Discovery protocol has been included along with SMB2 and its successors, which supersede these. (WS-Discovery is implemented on Unix-like platforms by third party daemons which allow Samba shares to be discovered when the deprecated protocols are disabled).

Samba sets up network shares for chosen Unix directories (including all contained subdirectories). These appear to Microsoft Windows users as normal Windows folders accessible via the network. Unix users can either mount the shares directly as part of their file structure using the mount.cifs command or, alternatively, can use a utility, smbclient (libsmb) installed with Samba to read the shares with a similar interface to a standard command line FTP program. Each directory can have different access privileges overlaid on top of the normal Unix file protections. For example: home directories would have read/write access for all known users, allowing each to access their own files. However they would still not have access to the files of others unless that permission would normally exist. Note that the netlogon share, typically distributed as a read only share from codice_1, is the logon directory for user logon scripts.

Samba services are implemented as two daemons:
* smbd, which provides the file and printer sharing services, and
* nmbd, which provides the NetBIOS-to-IP-address name service. NetBIOS over TCP/IP requires some method for mapping NetBIOS computer names to the IP addresses of a TCP/IP network.

Samba configuration is achieved by editing a single file (typically installed as codice_2 or codice_3). Samba can also provide user logon scripts and group policy implementation through codice_4.

Samba is included in most Linux distributions and is started during the boot process. On Red Hat, for instance, the codice_5 script runs at boot time, and starts both daemons. Samba is not included in Solaris 8, but a Solaris 8-compatible version is available from the Samba website. The OS/2-based ArcaOS includes Samba to replace the old IBM LAN Server software.

Samba includes a web administration tool called &quot;Samba Web Administration Tool&quot; (SWAT).
SWAT was removed starting with version 4.1.

==Samba TNG==
Samba TNG (The Next Generation) was forked in late 1999, after disagreements between the Samba Team leaders and Luke Leighton about the directions of the Samba project. They failed to come to an agreement on a development transition path which allowed the research version of Samba he was developing (known at the time as Samba-NTDOM) to slowly be integrated into Samba. Development has been minimal, due to a lack of developers. The Samba TNG team frequently directed potential users towards Samba because of its better support and development.

A key goal of the Samba TNG project was to rewrite all of the NT Domains services as FreeDCE projects. This was made difficult as the services were developed manually through network reverse-engineering, with limited or no reference to DCE/RPC documentation.

A key difference from Samba was in the implementation of the NT Domains suite of protocols and MSRPC services. Samba makes all the NT Domains services available from a single place, whereas Samba TNG separated each service into its own program.

ReactOS started using Samba TNG services for its SMB implementation. The developers of both projects were interested in seeing the Samba TNG design used to help get ReactOS talking to Windows networks. They worked together to adapt the network code and build system. The multi-layered and modular approach made it easy to port each service to ReactOS.

<doc id="29199" wikidata="Q727439" url="?curid=29199" title="Simple DirectMedia Layer">
<text>Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components. Software developers can use it to write high-performance computer games and other multimedia applications that can run on many operating systems such as Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

SDL manages video, audio, input devices, threads, shared object loading, networking and timers. For 3D graphics, it can handle an OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, or Direct3D11 (older Direct3D version 9 is also supported) context. A common misconception is that SDL is a game engine. However, the library is suited to building games directly, or is usable indirectly by engines built on top of it.

The library is internally written in C and possibly, depending on the target platform, C++ or Objective-C, and provides the application programming interface in C, with bindings to other languages available. It is free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the zlib License since version 2.0, and with prior versions subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License. Under the zlib License, SDL 2.0 is freely available for static linking in closed-source projects, unlike SDL 1.2, although it is possible for the user to override the statically linked library with one provided by them. SDL 2.0, released in 2013, was a major departure from previous versions, offering more opportunity for 3D hardware acceleration, but breaking backwards-compatibility, a wrapper library made to translate 1.2 calls to 2.0 was later made available.

SDL is extensively used in the industry in both large and small projects. By 2010, over 700 games, 180 applications, and 120 demos had been posted on the library website.

SDL supports Emscripten (i.e. programs that run on a web page).

SDL 3 was released, as a stable version, in January 2025. It has a migration guide, and Coccinelle tool support to help migrate to the new major version. SDL 3 has a new way to control the entry point of your program, and you can optionally control execution in a non-framework way.

== History ==
Sam Lantinga created the library, first releasing it in early 1998, while working for Loki Software. He got the idea while porting a Windows application to Macintosh. He then used SDL to port &quot;Doom&quot; to BeOS (see Doom source ports). Around the time of its creation, SDL was regarded as a simple alternative to DirectX. Several other free libraries were developed to work alongside SDL, such as SMPEG and . He also founded Galaxy Gameworks in 2008 to help commercially support SDL, although the company plans are currently on hold due to time constraints.

Soon after putting Galaxy Gameworks on hold, Lantinga announced that SDL 1.3 (which would then later become SDL 2.0) would be licensed under the zlib License. Lantinga announced SDL 2.0 on 14 July 2012, at the same time announcing that he was joining Valve, the first version of which was announced the same day he joined the company. Lantinga announced the stable release of SDL 2.0.0 on 13 August 2013.

SDL 2.0 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 codebase with a different, not backwards-compatible API. It replaces several parts of the 1.2 API with more general support for multiple input and output options. Some feature additions include multiple window support, hardware-accelerated 2D graphics, and better Unicode support.

Support for Mir and Wayland was added in SDL 2.0.2 and enabled by default in SDL 2.0.4. Version 2.0.4 also provided better support for Android.

In 2024, the stable preview of SDL 3.1.3 was released (and in January 2025 3.20 was released as stable). It makes the API more consistent and allows access to more parts of the device, along with other features.

== Software architecture ==
SDL is a wrapper around the operating-system-specific functions that the game needs to access. The only purpose of SDL is to provide a common framework for accessing these functions for multiple operating systems (cross-platform). SDL provides support for 2D pixel operations, sound, file access, event handling, timing and threading. It is often used to complement OpenGL by setting up the graphical output and providing mouse and keyboard input, since OpenGL comprises only rendering.

A game using the Simple DirectMedia Layer will &quot;not&quot; automatically run on every operating system; further adaptations must be applied. These are reduced to a minimum, since SDL also contains a few abstraction APIs for frequent functions offered by an operating system.

The syntax of SDL is function-based: all operations done in SDL are done by passing parameters to subroutines (functions). Special structures are also used to store the specific information SDL needs to handle. SDL functions are categorized under several different subsystems.

=== Subsystems ===
SDL is divided into several subsystems:

; Basics: Initialization and Shutdown, Configuration Variables, Error Handling, Log Handling
; Video: Display and Window Management, surface functions, rendering acceleration, etc.
; Input Events: Event handling, Support for Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick and Game controller
; Force Feedback: SDL_haptic.h implements support for &quot;Force Feedback&quot;
; Audio: SDL_audio.h implements Audio Device Management, Playing and Recording
; Threads: multi-threading: Thread Management, Thread Synchronization Primitives, Atomic Operations
; Timers: Timer Support
; File Abstraction: Filesystem Paths, File I/O Abstraction
; Shared Object Support: Shared Object Loading and Function Lookup
; Platform and CPU Information: Platform Detection, CPU Feature Detection, Byte Order and Byte Swapping, Bit Manipulation
; Power Management: Power Management Status
; Additional: Platform-specific functionality

Besides this basic, low-level support, there also are a few separate official libraries that provide some more functions. These comprise the &quot;standard library&quot;, and are provided on the official website and included in the official documentation:

* &quot;SDL_image&quot; — support for multiple image formats
* &quot;SDL_mixer&quot; — complex audio functions, mainly for sound mixing
* &quot;SDL_net&quot; — networking support
* &quot;SDL_ttf&quot; — TrueType font rendering support
* &quot;SDL_rtf&quot; — simple Rich Text Format rendering

Other, non-standard libraries also exist. For example: SDL_Collide on SourceForge created by Amir Taaki.

=== Language bindings ===
The SDL 2.0 library has language bindings for:

* Ada
* Beef
* C
* C++
* C#
* Common Lisp
* D
* Fortran
* Gambas
* Go
* Haskell
* Java (e.g. JSDL)
* Julia
* Lua
* Nim
* OCaml
* Odin
* Pascal
* Perl (via SDL)
* PHP
* Python (several, e.g. pygame_sdl2 and sdl2hl)
* Raku
* Ring
* Rust
* Vala
=== Supported back-ends ===

Because of the way SDL is designed, much of its source code is split into separate modules for each operating system, to make calls to the underlying system. When SDL is compiled, the appropriate modules are selected for the target system. The following back-ends are available:

* GDI back-end for Microsoft Windows.
* DirectX back-end; older SDL 1.2 uses DirectX 7 by default, while 2.0 defaults to DirectX 9 and can access up to DirectX 12.
* Quartz back-end for macOS (dropped in 2.0).
* Metal back-end for macOS / iOS / tvOS since 2.0.8; older versions use OpenGL by default.
* Xlib back-end for X11-based windowing system on various operating systems.
* OpenGL contexts on various platforms.
* EGL back-end when used in conjunction with Wayland-based windowing system., Raspberry Pi and other systems.
* Vulkan contexts on platforms that support it.
* sceGu back-end, a Sony OpenGL-like backend native to the PSP.
An unofficial Sixel back-end is available for SDL 1.2.

The Rockbox MP3 player firmware also distributes a version of SDL 1.2, which is used to run games such as Quake.

== Reception and adoption ==

Over the years SDL was used for many commercial and non-commercial video game projects. For instance, MobyGames listed 120 games using SDL in 2013, and the SDL website itself listed around 700 games in 2012. Important commercial examples are &quot;Angry Birds&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, and games developed using Valve&#x27;s Source Engine, which uses SDL extensively for cross-platform compatibility; ones from the open-source domain are &quot;OpenTTD&quot;, &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; or &quot;Freeciv&quot;.

The cross-platform game releases of the popular Humble Indie Bundles for Linux, Mac and Android are often SDL-based.

SDL is also often used for later ports on new platforms with legacy code. For instance, the PC game Homeworld was ported to the Pandora handheld and Jagged Alliance 2 for Android via SDL.

Also, several non video game programs use SDL; examples are the emulators, such as DOSBox, FUSE ZX Spectrum emulator and VisualBoyAdvance.

There were several books written for development with SDL (see further reading).

SDL is used in university courses teaching multimedia and computer science, for instance, in a workshop about game programming using libSDL at the University of Cadiz in 2010, or a Game Design discipline at UTFPR (Ponta Grossa campus) in 2015.

<text>Seattle University (Seattle U or SU) is a private Jesuit university in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is the largest independent university in the Northwestern United States, with over 7,500 students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs within six schools.

==History==
In 1891, Adrian Sweere, S.J., took over a small parish school near downtown Seattle at Broadway and Madison. At first, the school was named after the surrounding Immaculate Conception parish and did not offer higher education. In 1898, the school was renamed after the city it was located in as &quot;Seattle College&quot;, which itself was named after Chief Seattle.

Seattle College granted its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees 11 years later. Initially, the school served as both a high school and a college. From 1919 to 1931, the college moved to Interlaken Boulevard but in 1931 it returned to First Hill permanently. When the college moved back to First Hill, it split off the High School portion of the school, which remained on Interlaken, as Seattle Preparatory High School. They remained connected through the Matteo Ricci program, which ended in 2017, and the many Seattle Prep Students who go to Seattle University for undergrad. In 1931, Seattle College created a night school for women, though admitting women was highly controversial at the time.

In 1948, Seattle College renamed itself to its current name of Seattle University under president Albert A. Lemieux. In 1993, the Seattle University School of Law was established through the purchase of the Law School of the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, and the School of Law moved to the Seattle campus in 1999.

In 2009, Seattle University completed its largest capital campaign, raising almost $169 million. This led to investment in the scholarship fund, academic programs and professorships, a fitness complex, an arts center, and the $56 million Lemieux Library and McGoldrick Learning Commons, completed in fall 2010.

In 2024, Seattle real estate developer Richard Hedreen donated his $300 million art collection to the university in honor of his late wife, alumna Betty Hedreen, marking one of the largest single gifts to a university ever made.

In December 2024, the university announced that it would acquire Cornish College of the Arts.

==Campus==
Seattle University has a campus in the city&#x27;s First Hill neighborhood, east of downtown Seattle and immediately adjacent to the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Seattle University&#x27;s campus has been recognized by the city of Seattle and EPA for its commitment to sustainability through pesticide-free grounds, a food waste compost facility, recycling, and energy conservation program.

The campus includes numerous works by well-known artists: the Centennial Fountain by Seattle artist George Tsutakawa; a large glass sculpture in the PACCAR Atrium of Pigott Hall by Tacoma artist Dale Chihuly; and works by Chuck Close, Jacob Lawrence, Gwendolyn Knight, William Morris, and David Mach.

Undergraduate enrollment in 2024 was composed of 50.0% White, 33.7% Asian, 14.4% Hispanic, 8.4% Black, 3.5% Pacific Islander, 1.9% Native American, and 2.0% Other/Unknown; approximately 14% of the student body identifies with more than one ethnicity. 9.0% of the student body are made up of international students. The gender makeup of the undergraduate student body is 61% Female and 39% Male.

==Environmental sustainability==
Among Seattle University&#x27;s many environmental undertakings are projects ranging from composting initiatives to water conservation. There are also solar panels on buildings and a central recycling yard with an extensive recycling program. The university has been composting since 1995, and in 2003 it built the first composting facility in the state on an urban campus.

Seattle University received the Sustainability Innovator Award in 2007 from the Sustainable Endowments Institute for its pre-consumer food waste composting program and the Green Washington Award in 2008 from &quot;Washington CEO Magazine&quot; for its sustainable landscape practices and pre-consumer food waste composting program. &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;″s 2018 Green Rating rated the school as the #12 Green College in the country.

Seattle U&#x27;s move to a pesticide-free campus began in the early 1980s when Ciscoe Morris, now a local gardening personage, was head of the grounds department. He put a halt to chemical spraying and in its place released more than 20,000 beneficial insects called lacewings to eat the aphids that had infested trees on campus. The success of this led to other pesticide-free gardening practices.

In 2023, Seattle University became the first university in Washington state and the first Jesuit university to fully divest its endowment portfolio from fossil fuels.

==Athletics==

Between 1950 and 1971, Seattle University competed as a Division I independent school. In the 1950s, the basketball team was a powerhouse with brothers Johnny and Eddie O&#x27;Brien, who led the team to a rare victory over the Harlem Globetrotters. In 1958, future Basketball Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor paced a men&#x27;s basketball team that advanced to the Final Four and defeated top-ranked Kansas State University before losing to the University of Kentucky. Seattle University was also a leader in the area of racial diversity, with an integrated squad known as &quot;the United Nations team.&quot;

The success of men&#x27;s basketball, in addition to men&#x27;s golf and baseball, continued into the 1960s with players Eddie Miles, Clint Richardson, and Tom Workman who went on to successful careers in the NBA. The 1966 basketball squad gave Texas Western University its only defeat in a championship season celebrated in the film &quot;Glory Road&quot;.

During that time women&#x27;s tennis star Janet Hopps Adkisson was the first female to be the top-ranked player for both the men and women nationally. In women&#x27;s golf, Pat Lesser was twice named to the Curtis Cup in the mid-1950s and was later inducted into the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame.

Before 1980, more than 25 Seattle University baseball players went on to play professionally in both the major and minor leagues. Men&#x27;s golf and a Tom Gorman-led tennis team were also rated nationally. Gorman went on to lead the US Davis Cup team, where he captained a record 18 match wins and one Davis Cup title (1972) as a player and two more Davis Cup championships as a coach (1990 and 1992).

Seattle University joined the West Coast Conference in 1971. In 1980, it left the West Coast Conference and Division I membership and entered the NAIA, where it remained for nearly 20 years. In the late 1990s, President Fr. Sundborg started restoring the university&#x27;s NCAA membership. The athletic program moved into Division II in the fall of 2002.

The school moved from Division II to Division I in 2009. Also in that year, the university hired men&#x27;s basketball coach Cameron Dollar, a former assistant at the University of Washington, and women&#x27;s coach Joan Bonvicini, former University of Arizona coach and one of the winningest women&#x27;s college basketball coaches. In 2013, Coach Bonvicini led the Redhawks to the regular season Western Athletic Conference championship. In 2016, Suzy Barcomb was hired as the new coach for women&#x27;s basketball after Coach Bonvicini resigned in March 2016. In her first season with Seattle U, Coach Barcomb led the Redhawks to a WAC tournament title and was the 15th seed in the NCAA Tournament where Seattle University faced the second seed, Oregon Ducks.

In 1938, the mascot switched from the Maroons to the Chieftains. The name was selected to honor the school&#x27;s city&#x27;s namesake, Chief Seattle. In 2000, the university changed its mascot to the Redhawks.

On June 14, 2011, Seattle University accepted an invitation to join the Western Athletic Conference, becoming a full member for the 2012–2013 season.

In May 2024, Seattle University announced its intention to rejoin the West Coast Conference for the 2025-26 season after a 45 year absence. When the announcement was made, it was expected that they would be joining the conference along with rival Grand Canyon University from the WAC while also having the opportunity to reignite a rivalry with Gonzaga, the other Jesuit University in Washington State. However, spurred on by the collapse of the PAC-12 and the resulting conference realignment, Gonzaga announced their intention to leave the WCC for the PAC-12 and GCU declined the invitation to join the WCC and instead announced their intention to move to the Mountain West Conference.

==KXSU-LP student-run radio==
KXSU-LP (102.1 FM) is a low-power student-run radio station based on the Seattle University campus. Licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2016, the station began broadcasting as a campus-only operation in 1994 using the call sign KSUB and later it added internet service. Though it has an effective radiated power of just 7 watts, KXSU&#x27;s primary and secondary coverage areas include the entire city and its immediate suburbs.

KXSU&#x27;s air staff is comprised primarily of students but also includes faculty and alumni. According to the university, the station gives students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in writing, reporting, and broadcasting.

<text>The Seattle Colleges District (previously Seattle Community Colleges District; also known simply as Seattle Colleges) is a group of public colleges in Seattle, Washington. It nowadays consists of three colleges—North Seattle College, Seattle Central College, and South Seattle College. Together the colleges form the second largest institution of higher education in the state, behind the University of Washington, to which many of their graduates transfer.

The district&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1902, with the opening of Broadway High School on Capitol Hill. It operated as a traditional high school until the end of World War II, when it was converted to a vocational and adult education institution for the benefit of veterans who wanted to finish high school but no longer fit in at regular schools. As a result, in 1946, Broadway High School was renamed Edison Technical School. Edison started offering college-level courses 21 years later, and it was reconstituted as Seattle Community College in September 1966.

North Seattle Community College and South Seattle Community College opened their doors in 1970, whereupon Seattle Community College was renamed Seattle Central Community College.

Seattle Central Community College was named Time magazine&#x27;s Community College of the Year in 2001.

In March 2014, the board of trustees voted unanimously to change the name from &quot;Seattle Community Colleges District&quot; to &quot;Seattle Colleges District&quot; and to change the names of the colleges to &quot;Seattle Central College&quot;, &quot;North Seattle College&quot; and &quot;South Seattle College&quot;.

In 2018 Seattle Colleges partnered with the city of Seattle and Seattle Public Schools to launch Seattle Promise, a tuition covering program that aims to expand college access, success, and completion. Seattle Promise was part of the Families and Education Levy passed by citizens of Seattle during the local election of November 2018. Seattle Promise offers graduating seniors of Seattle public schools paid tuition for up to two years or 90 credits as well as academic support and advising when they attend Seattle Colleges.

==Leadership and Governance==

The chief executive officer of Seattle Colleges District is the chancellor. Presidents of each of the three colleges comprising Seattle Colleges—North Seattle College, Seattle Central College, South Seattle College—report to the chancellor. Seattle Colleges is governed by a board of trustees appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate.
===Chancellors Since 2000===
* 2022–present - Dr. Rosie Rimando-Chareunsap 
* 2016–2022 - Dr. Shouan Pan 
* 2009-2016 - Dr. Jill Wakefield 
* 2003-2008 - Dr. Charles Mitchell 
* 1998-2003 - Dr. Peter Ku 

==Programs of Study==

Seattle Colleges offers more than 130 career and technical education programs and academic transfer programs organized by eight areas of study. These programs culminate in certificates and associate degrees, as well as a number of Bachelor of Applied Science degrees and college transfer options. The colleges also offer continuing education programs; concurrent high school enrollment and high school completion programs; and Adult Basic Education/English as a Second Language programs, and corporate and customized training.

<doc id="29204" wikidata="Q932701" url="?curid=29204" title="Summer of Love">
<text>The Summer of Love was a major social phenomenon that occurred in San Francisco during the summer of 1967. As many as 100,000 people, mostly young people, hippies, beatniks, and 1960s counterculture figures, converged in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district and Golden Gate Park. 

More broadly, the Summer of Love encompassed hippie culture, spiritual awakening, hallucinogenic drugs, anti-war sentiment, and free love throughout the West Coast of the United States, and as far away as New York City. An episode of the PBS documentary series &quot;American Experience&quot; referred to the Summer of Love as &quot;the largest migration of young people in the history of America&quot;.

Hippies, sometimes called flower children, were an eclectic group. Many opposed the Vietnam War, were suspicious of government, and rejected consumerist values. In the United States, counterculture groups rejected suburbia and the American way and instead opted for a communal lifestyle. Some hippies were active in political organization, whereas others were passive and more concerned with art (music, painting, poetry in particular) or spiritual and meditative practices. Many hippies took interest in ancient Indian religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism.

== Background ==
=== Culture of San Francisco ===
Inspired by Jack Kerouac″s &quot;On the Road&quot; (1957) and the Beat Generation of authors of the 1950s, who had flourished in the North Beach area of San Francisco, those who gathered in Haight-Ashbury during 1967 allegedly rejected the conformist and materialist values of modern life and adhered to the psychedelic movement; there was an emphasis on sharing and community. The Diggers established a Free Store, and Haight Ashbury Free Clinics was founded on June 7, 1967, where medical treatment was provided.

===Human Be-In and inspiration===

The prelude to the Summer of Love was a celebration known as the Human Be-In at Golden Gate Park on January 14, 1967, which was produced and organized by artist Michael Bowen.

It was at this event that Timothy Leary voiced his phrase, &quot;turn on, tune in, drop out&quot;. This phrase helped shape the entire hippie counterculture, as it voiced the key ideas of 1960s rebellion. These ideas included experimenting psychedelics, communal living, political decentralization, and dropping out of society. The term &quot;dropping out&quot; became popular among many high school and college students, many of whom would abandon their conventional education for a summer or more of hippie culture.

The event was announced by the Haight-Ashbury&#x27;s hippie newspaper, the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot;:

A new concept of celebration beneath the human underground must emerge, become conscious, and be shared, so a revolution can be formed with a renaissance of compassion, awareness, and love, and the revelation of unity for all mankind.

The gathering of approximately 30,000 at the Human Be-In helped publicize hippie fashions.

===Planning===
The term &quot;Summer of Love&quot; originated with the formation of the &quot;Council for the Summer of Love&quot; during the spring of 1967 as a response to the convergence of young people on the Haight-Ashbury district. The council was composed of the Family Dog hippie commune, The Straight Theatre, The Diggers, &quot;The San Francisco Oracle&quot;, and approximately 25 other people, who sought to alleviate some of the problems anticipated from the influx of young people expected during the summer. The council also assisted the Free Clinic and organized housing, food, sanitation, music and arts, along with maintaining coordination with local churches and other social groups. Psychedelic poster artist Bob Schnepf was commissioned by Chet Helms to create the official Summer of Love poster, which became a lasting icon of the era.

==Beginning==
===Youth arrivals===
College students, high school students, and runaways began streaming into the Haight during the spring break of 1967. John F. Shelley, the then-Mayor of San Francisco and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, determined to stop the influx of young people once schools ended for the summer, unwittingly brought additional attention to the scene, and a series of articles in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; alerted the national media to the hippies&#x27; growing numbers. By spring, some Haight-Ashbury organizations including Diggers theater and about 25 residents responded by forming the &quot;Council of the Summer of Love&quot;, giving the event a name.

&quot;You only had to walk out your door to join the fun&quot;—Mike Lafavore

===Popularization===
The media&#x27;s coverage of hippie afflux in the Haight-Ashbury drew the attention of youth from all over America. Hunter S. Thompson termed the district &quot;Hashbury&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.
On February 6, 1967, Newsweek printed a four-page four-color article titled &quot;Dropouts on a Mission&quot;.
On March 17, 1967, &quot;Time&quot; magazine printed an article &quot;Love on Haight&quot;.
On June 6, 1967, &quot;Newsweek&quot; printed &quot;The Hippies are Coming&quot;.
The activities in the area were reported almost daily.

The event was also reported by the counterculture&#x27;s own media, particularly the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot;, the pass-around readership of which is thought to have exceeded a half-million people that summer, and the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot;.

The media&#x27;s reportage of the &quot;counterculture&quot; included other events in California, such as the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival in Marin County and the Monterey Pop Festival, both during June 1967. As many as 40,000 people may have attended the Magic Mountain festival. At Monterey, approximately 30,000 people gathered for the first day of the music festival, with the number increasing to 60,000 on the final day. Additionally, media coverage of the Monterey Pop Festival facilitated the Summer of Love as large numbers of hippies traveled to California to hear favorite bands such as the Who, Grateful Dead, the Animals, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Otis Redding, the Byrds, and Big Brother and the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin.

===&quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;===
The musician John Phillips of the band the Mamas &amp; the Papas wrote the song &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot; for his friend Scott McKenzie. It served to promote both the Monterey Pop Festival that Phillips was helping to organize, and to popularize the flower children of San Francisco. Released on May 13, 1967, the song was an instant success. By the week ending July 1, 1967, it reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States, where it remained for four consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, the song charted at number one in the United Kingdom and much of Europe. The single is purported to have sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.

== Events ==
=== New York City ===
In Manhattan, near the Greenwich Village neighborhood, during a concert in Tompkins Square Park on Memorial Day of 1967, some police officers asked for the music&#x27;s volume to be reduced. In response, some people in the crowd threw various objects, and 38 arrests ensued. A debate about the &quot;threat of the hippie&quot; ensued between Mayor John Lindsay and Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary. After this event, Allan Katzman, the editor of the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, predicted that 50,000 hippies would enter the area for the summer. 

=== California ===
Double in size of the Tompkins Square Park concert, as many as 100,000 young people from around the world flocked to San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district, as well as to nearby Berkeley and to other San Francisco Bay Area cities, to join in a popularized version of the hippie culture. A Free Clinic was established for free medical treatment, and a Free Store gave away basic necessities without charge to anyone who needed them.

The Summer of Love attracted a wide range of people of various ages: teenagers and college students drawn by their peers and the allure of joining an alleged cultural utopia; middle-class vacationers; and even partying military personnel from bases within driving distance. The Haight-Ashbury could not accommodate this influx of people, and the neighborhood scene quickly deteriorated, with overcrowding, homelessness, hunger, drug problems, and crime afflicting the neighborhood.

=== Denver ===
Chet Helms, Barry Fey and others who were constructing The Family Dog Denver in the summer of 1967 also held a Human Be-In, in Denver&#x27;s City Park, with the goal of harnessing the Summer of Love vibe to promote Helm&#x27;s new Family Dog Productions venture, which opened in September, 1967. 5,000 people attended the Be-In, with performances by bands like the Grateful Dead, Odetta and Captain Beefheart. Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary were also reportedly in attendance. As Denver native Bruce Bond states in the 2021 documentary &quot;The Tale of the Dog,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s not like the Summer of Love ended in Frisco. It just moved east, to Denver.&quot;

== Use of drugs ==

Psychedelic drug use became common. Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir commented:

Haight Ashbury was a ghetto of bohemians who wanted to do anything—and we did but I don&#x27;t think it has happened since. Yes there was LSD. But Haight Ashbury was not about drugs. It was about exploration, finding new ways of expression, being aware of one&#x27;s existence.

After losing his untenured position as an instructor on the Psychology faculty at Harvard University, Timothy Leary became a major advocate for the recreational use of psychedelic drugs. After starting taking psilocybin in the late fifties, a psychoactive chemical produced by certain mushrooms that causes effects similar to those of LSD, Leary endorsed the use of all psychedelics for personal development. He often invited friends as well as an occasional graduate student to consume such drugs along with him and colleague Richard Alpert.

On the West Coast, author Ken Kesey, a prior volunteer for a CIA-started LSD experiment in 1959, advocated the use of LSD. Soon after participating, he was inspired to write the bestselling novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. Subsequently, after buying an old school bus, painting it with psychedelic graffiti and attracting a group of similarly minded individuals he dubbed the Merry Pranksters, Kesey and his group traveled across the country, hosting &quot;acid tests&quot; where they would fill a large container with a diluted low dose form of the drug and give out diplomas to those who passed their test.

Along with LSD, cannabis started to be much used during this period. However, new laws were subsequently enacted to control the use of both drugs. The users thereof often had sessions to oppose the laws, including The Human Be-In referenced above as well as various &quot;smoke-ins&quot; during July and August; however, their efforts at repeal were unsuccessful.

==Funeral and aftermath==
By the end of summer, many participants had left the scene to join the back-to-the-land movement of the late 1960s, to resume school studies, or simply to &quot;get a job&quot;. Those remaining in the Haight wanted to commemorate the conclusion of the event. A mock funeral entitled &quot;The Death of the Hippie&quot; ceremony was staged on October 6, 1967, and organizer Mary Kasper explained the intended message:

In New York, the rock musical drama &quot;Hair&quot;, which told the story of the hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the 1960s, began Off-Broadway on October 17, 1967.

==Legacy==
===Second Summer of Love===

The &quot;Second Summer of Love&quot; (a term which generally refers to the summers of both 1988 and 1989) was a renaissance of acid house music and rave parties in Britain. The culture supported MDMA use and some LSD use. The art had a generally psychedelic emotion reminiscent of the 1960s.

===40th anniversary===
During the summer of 2007, San Francisco celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Summer of Love by holding numerous events around the region, culminating on September 2, 2007, when over 150,000 people attended the 40th anniversary of the Summer of Love concert, held in Golden Gate Park in Speedway Meadows. It was produced by 2b1 Multimedia and the Council of Light.

===50th anniversary===

In 2016, 2b1 Multimedia and The Council of Light, once again, began the planning for the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. By the beginning of 2017, the council had gathered about 25 poster artists, about 10 of whom submitted their finished art, but it was never printed. The council was also contacted by many bands and musicians who wanted to be part of this historic event, all were waiting for the date to be determined before a final commitment. New rules enforced by the San Francisco Parks and Recreational Department (PRD) prohibited the council from holding a free event of the proposed size. There were many events planned for San Francisco in 2017, many of which were 50th Anniversary-themed. However, there was no free concert. The PRD later hosted an event originally called &quot;Summer Solstice Party,&quot; but it was later renamed &quot;50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love&quot; two weeks before commencement. The event had fewer than 20,000 attendees from the local Bay Area.

In frustration, producer Boots Hughston put the proposal of what was by then to be a 52nd anniversary free concert into the form of an initiative intended for the November 6, 2018, ballot. The issue did not make the ballot; however, a more generic Proposition E provides for directing hotel tax fees to a $32 million budget for &quot;arts and cultural organizations and projects in the city.&quot;

During the summer of 2017, San Francisco celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love by holding numerous events and art exhibitions.
In Liverpool, the city has staged a 50 Summers of Love festival based on the 50th anniversary of the June 1, 1967, release of the album &quot;Sgt Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, by the Beatles.

<doc id="29207" wikidata="Q7537759" url="?curid=29207" title="Skyhooks (band)">
<text>Skyhooks were an Australian rock band formed in Melbourne in 1973. Their classic lineup (1974–1977) comprised Graeme &quot;Shirley&quot; Strachan (vocals), Greg Macainsh (bass and backing vocals), Red Symons (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Bob &quot;Bongo&quot; Starkie (guitar and backing vocals), and Imants &quot;Freddie&quot; Strauks (drums).

Known for their flamboyant costumes and makeup, their music addressed a variety of issues including drugs, sex, and the gay scene while frequently referencing Australian places and culture. Evolving from a series of groups with Macainsh and Strauks in the late 1960s and early 1970s, they rose to national prominence when their debut album &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot; (1974), which was initially a moderate success upon release, gained unprecedented popularity the following year, aided by the nascent ABC music show &quot;Countdown&quot;; the album topped the Australian Kent Music Report chart for a record-breaking 16 weeks and sold over 200,000 copies, becoming the best-selling Australian album at the time. Their second album &quot;Ego Is Not a Dirty Word&quot; (1975) topped the Kent Music Report for 11 weeks.

Symons and Strachan left in 1977 and 1978 respectively and became media personalities; Symons was replaced with Bob Spencer and Strachan was replaced with Tony Williams, before they disbanded in 1980. The classic lineup reunited four times in the ensuing years, with reunions in 1990 and 1994 producing new material, including the number-one song &quot;Jukebox in Siberia&quot; in 1990. Strachan died in a helicopter crash in 2001; original lead singer Steve Hill, who left and was replaced by Strachan, died in 2005, and original guitarist Peter Starkie died in 2020.

Music historian Ian McFarlane stated that the band &quot;made an enormous impact on Australian social life&quot;. In 1992, the group was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. In 2011, the Skyhooks album &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry.

==History==
===1966–1974: Early years and formation===
Greg Macainsh and Imants &quot;Freddie&quot; Strauks both attended Norwood High School in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood and formed Spare Parts in 1966 with Macainsh on bass guitar and Strauks on lead vocals. Spare Parts was followed by Sound Pump in 1968, Macainsh formed Reuben Tice in Eltham, with Tony Williams on vocals. By 1970 Macainsh was back with Strauks, now on drums, first in Claptrap and by 1971 in Frame which had Graeme &quot;Shirley&quot; Strachan as lead vocalist. Frame also included Pat O&#x27;Brien on guitar and Cynthio Ooms on guitar. Strachan had befriended Strauks earlier—he sang with Strauks on the way to parties—and was asked to join Claptrap which was renamed as Frame. Strachan stayed in Frame for about 18 months but left for a career in carpentry and a hobby of surfing in Phillip Island.

Skyhooks formed in March 1973 in Melbourne with Steve Hill on vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Inglis on guitar (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, Peter Starkie on guitar and backing vocals (Lipp &amp; the Double Dekker Brothers) and Strauks on drums and backing vocals. The name, Skyhooks, came from a fictional organisation in the 1956 film &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot;. Their first gig was on 16 April 1973 at St Jude&#x27;s Church hall in Carlton. At a later gig, former Daddy Cool frontman, Ross Wilson was playing in his group Mighty Kong with Skyhooks as a support act. Wilson was impressed with the fledgling band and signed Macainsh to a publishing deal. In August, Bob &quot;Bongo&quot; Starkie (Mary Jane Union) on guitar replaced his older brother Peter (later in Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons) and Inglis was replaced by Red Symons on guitar, vocals and keyboards. The two new members added a touch of theatre and humour to the band&#x27;s visual presence. By late 1973, Wilson had convinced Michael Gudinski to sign the band to his booking agency, Australian Entertainment Exchange, and eventually to Gudinski&#x27;s label, Mushroom Records.

Skyhooks gained a cult following around Melbourne including university intelligentsia and pub rockers, but a poorly received show at the January 1974 Sunbury Pop Festival saw the group booed off stage. Two tracks from their live set, &quot;Hey What&#x27;s the Matter?&quot; and &quot;Love on the Radio&quot; appeared on Mushroom&#x27;s &quot;Highlights of Sunbury &#x27;74&quot;. After seeing his performance on TV, Hill phoned Macainsh and resigned. To replace Hill, in March, Macainsh recruited occasional singer, surfer and carpenter Strachan from his Frame era. Strachan had been dubbed &quot;Shirley&quot; by fellow surfers due to his curly blond hair &quot;a la&quot; Shirley Temple.

===1974–1975: &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot;===
For Skyhooks, the replacement of Hill by Strachan was a pivotal moment, as Strachan had remarkable vocal skills, and a magnetic stage and screen presence. Alongside Macainsh&#x27;s lyrics, another facet of the group was the twin-guitar sound of Starkie and Symons. Adopting elements of glam rock in their presentation, and lyrics that presented frank depictions of the social life of young Australia in the 1970s, the band shocked conservative middle Australia with their outrageous (for the time) costumes, make-up, lyrics, and on-stage activities. A 1.2-metre (4 ft) high mushroom-shaped phallus was confiscated by Adelaide police after a performance. Six of the ten tracks on their debut album, &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot;, were banned by the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters for their sex and drug references: &quot;Toorak Cowboy&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Revolution?&quot;, &quot;You Just Like Me Cos I&#x27;m Good in Bed&quot;, &quot;Hey What&#x27;s the Matter&quot;, &quot;Motorcycle Bitch&quot; and &quot;Smut&quot;. Much of the group&#x27;s success derived from its distinctive repertoire, mostly penned by bass guitarist Macainsh, with an occasional additional song from Symons—who wrote &quot;Smut&quot; and performed its lead vocals. Although Skyhooks were not the first Australian rock band to write songs in a local setting—rather than ditties about love or songs about New York City or other foreign lands—they were the first to become commercially successful doing so. Skyhooks songs addressed teenage issues including buying drugs (&quot;Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)&quot;), suburban sex (&quot;Balwyn Calling&quot;), the gay scene (&quot;Toorak Cowboy&quot;) and loss of girlfriends (&quot;Somewhere in Sydney&quot;) by namechecking Australian locales. Radio personality, Billy Pinnell described the importance of their lyrics in tackling Australia&#x27;s cultural cringe:

The first Skyhooks single, &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot;, was released in August 1974, ahead of the album, and peaked at No. 28 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Charts. The album, &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot; initially charted only in Melbourne upon its release on 7 October 1974. It went on to spend 16 weeks at the top of the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Charts from February to June 1975. The album was produced by Wilson, and became the best selling Australian album, to that time, with 226,000 copies sold in Australia.

Skyhooks returned to the Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1975. They were declared the best performers by &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; reviewers, and Gudinski now took over their management. The second single, &quot;Horror Movie&quot;, reached No. 1 for two weeks in March. The band&#x27;s success was credited by Gudinski with saving his struggling Mushroom Records and enabled it to develop into the most successful Australian label of its time.

The success of the album was also due to support by a new pop music television show &quot;Countdown&quot; on national public broadcaster ABC Television, rather than promotion by commercial radio. &quot;Horror Movie&quot; was the first song played on the first colour transmission of &quot;Countdown&quot; in early 1975. Despite the radio ban, the ABC&#x27;s newly established 24-hour rock music station Double Jay chose the album&#x27;s fifth track, the provocatively titled &quot;You Just Like Me Cos I&#x27;m Good in Bed&quot;, as its first ever broadcast on 19 January.

===1975–1976: &quot;Ego Is Not a Dirty Word&quot;===
Skyhooks&#x27; 1975 national tour promoting &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot; finished at Melbourne&#x27;s Festival Hall with their ANZAC Day (25 April) performance. They were supported by comedy singer Bob Hudson, heavy rockers AC/DC and New Zealand band Split Enz. Strachan then took two weeks off and considered leaving the band, but he returned – newly married – and they continued recording the follow-up album, &quot;Ego Is Not a Dirty Word&quot;. Initially, they were locked out of the recording studio until their manager, Gudinski, sent down the money still owed for recording the first album. &quot;Ego Is Not a Dirty Word&quot; spent 11 weeks at the top of the Australian album chart from 21 July 1975, and sold 210,000 copies. with the single, &quot;Ego Is Not a Dirty Word&quot; issued in April ahead of the album, peaking at No. 2. The next single, &quot;All My Friends Are Getting Married&quot; reached No. 2 in July, and was followed by &quot;Million Dollar Riff&quot; at No. 6 in October. Macainsh&#x27;s then girlfriend, Jenny Brown, described the band in her 1975 book, &quot;Skyhooks : Million Dollar Riff&quot;. A live version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Let It Rock&quot; from a December performance was released as a single in March 1976 and reached No. 26.

With Australian commercial success achieved, Skyhooks turned to the US market. Gudinski announced a $1.5 million deal with Mercury Records/Phonogram Records, which released a modified international version of &quot;Ego Is Not a Dirty Word&quot; with &quot;Horror Movie&quot; and &quot;You Just Like Me Cos I&#x27;m Good in Bed&quot; from their first Australian album replacing two tracks. A US tour followed in March–April 1976, but critics described them as imitators of Kiss due to the similarity of Symons&#x27; make-up and stage act to that of Gene Simmons, and despite limited success in Boston, Massachusetts and Jacksonville, Florida they failed to make inroads into the general US market.

===1977–1981: Later years to break-up===

After completing their 1976 US tour, the band remained in San Francisco and recorded their third album with Wilson producing, &quot;Straight in a Gay Gay World&quot;, which was released in August 1976 and peaked at No. 3 on the Australian album charts. In July, upon return to Australia they launched The Brats Are Back Tour with a single, &quot;This Is My City&quot;, which peaked at number 32. &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; followed in August and peaked at No. 12 on the singles chart. By October, Strachan provided his debut solo single, &quot;Every Little Bit Hurts&quot; (a cover of Brenda Holloway&#x27;s 1964 hit). In February 1977, Symons left the band and was replaced on guitar by Bob Spencer from the band Finch. With Symons&#x27; departure the band dropped the glam rock look and used a more straight forward hard rock approach.

During 1977 Skyhooks toured nationally three times, while their first single with Spencer, &quot;Party to End All Parties&quot;, entered the top 30 in May. Strachan released his second solo single, a cover of Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Tracks of My Tears&quot;, which reached the top 20 in July. Meanwhile, Mushroom released a singles anthology, &quot;The Skyhooks Tapes&quot;, which entered the top 50 in September. The band&#x27;s mass popularity had declined although they still kept their live performances exciting and irreverent.

In January 1978 they toured New Zealand and performed at the Nambassa festival. In February their next single, &quot;Women in Uniform&quot;, was issued and peaked at No. 8, while its album &quot;Guilty Until Proven Insane&quot; followed in March and reached No. 7. The album was produced by Americans Eddie Leonetti and Jack Douglas. The second single from the album, &quot;Meglomania&quot; released in May, peaked at number 93. Strachan told band members he intended to leave—but it was not officially announced for six months—he continued regular shows until his final gig with Skyhooks on 29 July 1978. Strachan released further solo singles, &quot;Mr Summer&quot; in October and &quot;Nothing but the Best&quot; in January 1979, but neither charted in the top 50. Strachan&#x27;s replacement in Skyhooks, on lead vocals, was Tony Williams (ex-Reuben Tice with Macainsh).

Williams&#x27; first single for Skyhooks, &quot;Over the Border&quot;, a political song about the state of the Queensland Police Force at the time, reached the top 40 in April 1979, and their fifth studio album, &quot;Hot for the Orient&quot;, was released in May 1980, but failed to enter the top 50.

From 1975 to 1977, Skyhooks were—alongside Sherbet—the most commercially successful group in Australia, but over the next few years, Skyhooks rapidly faded from the public eye with the departure of key members, and in 1980 the band announced its break-up in controversial circumstances. Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum, usually a supporter of Skyhooks, savaged &quot;Hot for the Orient&quot; on his &quot;Humdrum&quot; segment of &quot;Countdown&quot;—viewers demanded that the band appear on a following show to defend it. Poor reception of the album both by the public and reviewers led the band to take out a page-sized ad in the local music press declaring &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You All Get Fu**ed&quot; (title of one of their songs) and they played their last performance on 8 June, not in their hometown of Melbourne, but in the mining town of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.

===1982–1999: Reformations and later releases===
In December 1982, Mushroom released a medley of Skyhooks songs as &quot;Hooked on Hooks&quot; which peaked at No. 21. Demands for the &quot;classic&quot; line-up of the band—Macainsh, Bob Starkie, Strachan, Strauks and Symons—to reform were successful and on 23 April 1983, they started the Living in the 80&#x27;s Tour. Support acts for the first concert included The Church, Mental as Anything, The Party Boys, The Sunnyboys, and Midnight Oil—who acknowledged, &quot;Hooks were the only Australian band they would let top the bill above them&quot;. This tour was released on LP as &quot;Live in the 80&#x27;s&quot;.

A one-off reunion concert took place in October 1984, and in 1990 the band finally recorded new material, including &quot;Jukebox in Siberia&quot;, released in September, which peaked at the top of the ARIA Singles Charts for two weeks. In November, &quot;The Latest and Greatest&quot;, a compilation album, was released, which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Charts. The tracks were taken from Skyhooks&#x27; first four studio albums along with two recent singles, &quot;Jukebox In Siberia&quot; and the uncharted &quot;Tall Timber&quot;.

In 1992, Skyhooks were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame, while their manager, Gudunski, and record label, Mushroom Records, received a &#x27;Special Achievement Award&#x27;. Producer of their first three albums, Wilson, had been inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989 as an individual and again as a member of Daddy Cool in 2006.

The final release of new Skyhooks material came in June 1999 when a twin-CD, &quot;Skyhooks: The Collection&quot;, was issued. Disc one contained a greatest hits package, very similar to &quot;The Latest and Greatest&quot;, with additional tracks. Disc two is referred to by fans as &quot;The Lost Album&quot;, with previously unreleased songs from their 1990 and 1994 recording sessions.

===After Skyhooks===
Strachan and Symons each went on to successful careers in Australian media including radio and television. Symons worked as a breakfast presenter on ABC radio and wrote humorous newspaper columns after being on the TV show &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; as a house band member and judge of the Red Faces segment. Starkie played locally with different bands including Ol&#x27; Skydaddys, and Ram Band. Strauks was drummer for Melbourne rock band The Sports, Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons, folk band The Bushwackers and the Ol&#x27; Skydaddys. Macainsh played with John Farnham on his Whispering Jack Tour and with Dave Warner&#x27;s from the Suburbs, in 1988 he put together and managed a successful AC/DC tribute band called Back in Black who went on to support Skyhooks on their comeback tour. He was a board member of Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) (1997–2000) and Phonographic Performance Company of Australia (PPCA) (2001–2006), and is an intellectual property lawyer.

Strachan was killed in an air crash on 29 August 2001, when the helicopter he was learning to fly solo crashed into Mount Archer near Kilcoy, northwest of Brisbane. A memorial concert was held on 11 September 2001 at the Palais Theatre, tributes were paid and some remaining members—Strauks, Macainsh, Starkie, Symons and Spencer—performed with guest vocalists Daryl Braithwaite and Wilson. It is the only time Symons and his replacement, Spencer performed together on stage. Braithwaite performed &quot;All My Friends Are Getting Married&quot; with the band while Wilson sang the rare Skyhooks track &quot;Warm Wind in the City&quot;.

The 30th anniversary of the release of the &quot;Living in the 70&#x27;s&quot; album was commemorated in 2004, with different incarnations of the band performing. Absent were Strachan, Hill and Inglis. Vocals were performed by Wilson, Williams and Bob Starkie. The original line-up of Skyhooks, including Hill, reformed in 2005 at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney for a one-off gig, a benefit for Hill, who had been diagnosed with liver cancer. The line-up of Inglis, Peter Starkie, Strauks and Macainsh joined him onstage. Hill died six weeks later. In November 2009, the &quot;Skyhooks Tour Archive&quot;, displayed on the band&#x27;s website, listed 925 live shows.

Macainsh, Starkie and Strauks appeared as Skyhooks at the 2009 Helpmann Awards in Sydney. They performed &quot;Women in Uniform&quot; with Australian rock icon Jimmy Barnes providing vocals. Red Symons was also slated to perform with the band, but was replaced by Diesel after withdrawing a few days before the show.

Original guitarist Peter Starkie died of complications after a fall, in mid-September 2020, aged 72.

<text>In mathematics, a square root of a number is a number such that formula_1; in other words, a number whose &quot;square&quot; (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or formula_2) is . For example, 4 and −4 are square roots of 16 because formula_3.

Every nonnegative real number has a unique nonnegative square root, called the &quot;principal square root&quot; or simply &quot;the square root&quot; (with a definite article, see below), which is denoted by formula_4 where the symbol &quot;formula_5&quot; is called the &quot;radical sign&quot; or &quot;radix&quot;. For example, to express the fact that the principal square root of 9 is 3, we write formula_6. The term (or number) whose square root is being considered is known as the &quot;radicand&quot;. The radicand is the number or expression underneath the radical sign, in this case, 9. For non-negative , the principal square root can also be written in exponent notation, as formula_7.

Every positive number has two square roots: formula_8 (which is positive) and formula_9 (which is negative). The two roots can be written more concisely using the ± sign as formula_10. Although the principal square root of a positive number is only one of its two square roots, the designation &quot;&quot;the&quot; square root&quot; is often used to refer to the principal square root.

Square roots of negative numbers can be discussed within the framework of complex numbers. More generally, square roots can be considered in any context in which a notion of the &quot;square&quot; of a mathematical object is defined. These include function spaces and square matrices, among other mathematical structures.

==History==
The Yale Babylonian Collection clay tablet YBC 7289 was created between 1800 BC and 1600 BC, showing formula_11 and formula_12 respectively as 1;24,51,10 and 0;42,25,35 base 60 numbers on a square crossed by two diagonals. (1;24,51,10) base 60 corresponds to 1.41421296, which is correct to 5 decimal places (1.41421356...).

The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is a copy from 1650 BC of an earlier Berlin Papyrus and other textspossibly the Kahun Papyrusthat shows how the Egyptians extracted square roots by an inverse proportion method.

In Ancient India, the knowledge of theoretical and applied aspects of square and square root was at least as old as the &quot;Sulba Sutras&quot;, dated around 800–500 BC (possibly much earlier). A method for finding very good approximations to the square roots of 2 and 3 are given in the &quot;Baudhayana Sulba Sutra&quot;. Apastamba who was dated around 600 BCE has given a strikingly accurate value for formula_11 which is correct up to five decimal places as formula_14.
 Aryabhata, in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; (section 2.4), has given a method for finding the square root of numbers having many digits.

It was known to the ancient Greeks that square roots of positive integers that are not perfect squares are always irrational numbers: numbers not expressible as a ratio of two integers (that is, they cannot be written exactly as formula_15, where and are integers). This is the theorem &quot;Euclid X, 9&quot;, almost certainly due to Theaetetus dating back to .
The discovery of irrational numbers, including the particular case of the square root of 2, is widely associated with the Pythagorean school. Although some accounts attribute the discovery to Hippasus, the specific contributor remains uncertain due to the scarcity of primary sources and the secretive nature of the brotherhood. It is exactly the length of the diagonal of a square with side length 1.

In the Chinese mathematical work &quot;Writings on Reckoning&quot;, written between 202 BC and 186 BC during the early Han dynasty, the square root is approximated by using an &quot;excess and deficiency&quot; method, which says to &quot;...combine the excess and deficiency as the divisor; (taking) the deficiency numerator multiplied by the excess denominator and the excess numerator times the deficiency denominator, combine them as the dividend.&quot;

A symbol for square roots, written as an elaborate R, was invented by Regiomontanus (1436–1476). An R was also used for radix to indicate square roots in Gerolamo Cardano&#x27;s &quot;Ars Magna&quot;.

According to historian of mathematics D.E. Smith, Aryabhata&#x27;s method for finding the square root was first introduced in Europe by Cataneo—in 1546.

According to Jeffrey A. Oaks, Arabs used the letter &quot;jīm/ĝīm&quot; (), the first letter of the word &quot;&quot; (variously transliterated as &quot;jaḏr&quot;, &quot;jiḏr&quot;, &quot;ǧaḏr&quot; or &quot;ǧiḏr&quot;, &quot;root&quot;), placed in its initial form () over a number to indicate its square root. The letter &quot;jīm&quot; resembles the present square root shape. Its usage goes as far as the end of the twelfth century in the works of the Moroccan mathematician Ibn al-Yasamin.

The symbol &quot;√&quot; for the square root was first used in print in 1525, in Christoph Rudolff&#x27;s &quot;Coss&quot;.

==Properties and uses==

The principal square root function formula_16 (usually just referred to as the &quot;square root function&quot;) is a function that maps the set of nonnegative real numbers onto itself. In geometrical terms, the square root function maps the area of a square to its side length.

The square root of is rational if and only if is a rational number that can be represented as a ratio of two perfect squares. (See square root of 2 for proofs that this is an irrational number, and quadratic irrational for a proof for all non-square natural numbers.) The square root function maps rational numbers into algebraic numbers, the latter being a superset of the rational numbers).

The square root function is continuous for all nonnegative , and differentiable for all positive . If denotes the square root function, whose derivative is given by:formula_20

The Taylor series of formula_21 about converges for , and is given by

formula_22

The square root of a nonnegative number is used in the definition of Euclidean norm (and distance), as well as in generalizations such as Hilbert spaces. It defines an important concept of standard deviation used in probability theory and statistics. It has a major use in the formula for solutions of a quadratic equation. Quadratic fields and rings of quadratic integers, which are based on square roots, are important in algebra and have uses in geometry. Square roots frequently appear in mathematical formulas elsewhere, as well as in many physical laws.

==Square roots of positive integers==
A positive number has two square roots, one positive, and one negative, which are opposite to each other. When talking of &quot;the&quot; square root of a positive integer, it is usually the positive square root that is meant.

The square roots of an integer are algebraic integers—more specifically quadratic integers.

The square root of a positive integer is the product of the roots of its prime factors, because the square root of a product is the product of the square roots of the factors. Since formula_23 only roots of those primes having an odd power in the factorization are necessary. More precisely, the square root of a prime factorization isformula_24 

===As decimal expansions===
The square roots of the perfect squares (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are irrational numbers, and hence have non-repeating decimals in their decimal representations. Decimal approximations of the square roots of the first few natural numbers are given in the following table.

===As expansions in other numeral systems===
As with before, the square roots of the perfect squares (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are irrational numbers, and therefore have non-repeating digits in any standard positional notation system.

The square roots of small integers are used in both the SHA-1 and SHA-2 hash function designs to provide nothing up my sleeve numbers.

===As periodic continued fractions===
A result from the study of irrational numbers as simple continued fractions was obtained by Joseph Louis Lagrange . Lagrange found that the representation of the square root of any non-square positive integer as a continued fraction is periodic. That is, a certain pattern of partial denominators repeats indefinitely in the continued fraction. In a sense these square roots are the very simplest irrational numbers, because they can be represented with a simple repeating pattern of integers.

The square bracket notation used above is a short form for a continued fraction. Written in the more suggestive algebraic form, the simple continued fraction for the square root of 11, [3; 3, 6, 3, 6, ...], looks like this:formula_25

where the two-digit pattern {3, 6} repeats over and over again in the partial denominators. Since , the above is also identical to the following generalized continued fractions:

formula_26

==Computation==

Square roots of positive numbers are not in general rational numbers, and so cannot be written as a terminating or recurring decimal expression. Therefore in general any attempt to compute a square root expressed in decimal form can only yield an approximation, though a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations can be obtained.

Most pocket calculators have a square root key. Computer spreadsheets and other software are also frequently used to calculate square roots. Pocket calculators typically implement efficient routines, such as the Newton&#x27;s method (frequently with an initial guess of 1), to compute the square root of a positive real number. When computing square roots with logarithm tables or slide rules, one can exploit the identitiesformula_27
where and are the natural and base-10 logarithms.

By trial-and-error, one can square an estimate for formula_28 and raise or lower the estimate until it agrees to sufficient accuracy. For this technique it is prudent to use the identityformula_29
as it allows one to adjust the estimate by some amount and measure the square of the adjustment in terms of the original estimate and its square.

The most common iterative method of square root calculation by hand is known as the &quot;Babylonian method&quot; or &quot;Heron&#x27;s method&quot; after the first-century Greek philosopher Heron of Alexandria, who first described it. The method uses the same iterative scheme as the Newton–Raphson method yields when applied to the function , using the fact that its slope at any point is , but predates it by many centuries. The algorithm is to repeat a simple calculation that results in a number closer to the actual square root each time it is repeated with its result as the new input. The motivation is that if is an overestimate to the square root of a nonnegative real number then will be an underestimate and so the average of these two numbers is a better approximation than either of them. However, the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means shows this average is always an overestimate of the square root (as noted below), and so it can serve as a new overestimate with which to repeat the process, which converges as a consequence of the successive overestimates and underestimates being closer to each other after each iteration. To find :

# Start with an arbitrary positive start value . The closer to the square root of , the fewer the iterations that will be needed to achieve the desired precision.
# Replace by the average between and .
# Repeat from step 2, using this average as the new value of .

That is, if an arbitrary guess for formula_28 is , and , then each is an approximation of formula_28 which is better for large than for small . If is positive, the convergence is quadratic, which means that in approaching the limit, the number of correct digits roughly doubles in each next iteration. If , the convergence is only linear; however, formula_32 so in this case no iteration is needed.

Using the identityformula_33
the computation of the square root of a positive number can be reduced to that of a number in the range . This simplifies finding a start value for the iterative method that is close to the square root, for which a polynomial or piecewise-linear approximation can be used.

The time complexity for computing a square root with digits of precision is equivalent to that of multiplying two -digit numbers.

Another useful method for calculating the square root is the shifting nth root algorithm, applied for .

The name of the square root function varies from programming language to programming language, with codice_1 (often pronounced &quot;squirt&quot;) being common, used in C and derived languages such as C++, JavaScript, PHP, and Python.

==Square roots of negative and complex numbers==
The square of any positive or negative number is positive, and the square of 0 is 0. Therefore, no negative number can have a real square root. However, it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the complex numbers, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number. This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by (sometimes by , especially in the context of electricity where &quot;i&quot; traditionally represents electric current) and called the imaginary unit, which is &quot;defined&quot; such that . Using this notation, we can think of as the square root of −1, but we also have and so is also a square root of −1. By convention, the principal square root of −1 is , or more generally, if is any nonnegative number, then the principal square root of is
formula_34

The right side (as well as its negative) is indeed a square root of , sinceformula_35

For every non-zero complex number there exist precisely two numbers such that : the principal square root of (defined below), and its negative.

===Principal square root of a complex number===

To find a definition for the square root that allows us to consistently choose a single value, called the principal value, we start by observing that any complex number formula_36 can be viewed as a point in the plane, formula_37 expressed using Cartesian coordinates. The same point may be reinterpreted using polar coordinates as the pair formula_38 where formula_39 is the distance of the point from the origin, and formula_40 is the angle that the line from the origin to the point makes with the positive real (formula_41) axis. In complex analysis, the location of this point is conventionally written formula_42 Ifformula_43
then the of formula_44 is defined to be the following:formula_45 
The principal square root function is thus defined using the non-positive real axis as a branch cut. If formula_44 is a non-negative real number (which happens if and only if formula_47) then the principal square root of formula_44 is formula_49 in other words, the principal square root of a non-negative real number is just the usual non-negative square root. It is important that formula_50 because if, for example, formula_51 (so formula_52) then the principal square root isformula_53
but using formula_54 would instead produce the other square root formula_55 

The principal square root function is holomorphic everywhere except on the set of non-positive real numbers (on strictly negative reals it is not even continuous). The above Taylor series for formula_21 remains valid for complex numbers formula_41 with formula_58

The above can also be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions:formula_59

===Algebraic formula===

When the number is expressed using its real and imaginary parts, the following formula can be used for the principal square root:

formula_60

where if and otherwise. In particular, the imaginary parts of the original number and the principal value of its square root have the same sign. The real part of the principal value of the square root is always nonnegative.

For example, the principal square roots of are given by:

formula_61

===Notes===

In the following, the complex and may be expressed as:

* formula_62
* formula_63

where formula_64 and formula_65.

Because of the discontinuous nature of the square root function in the complex plane, the following laws are not true in general.

* formula_66 Counterexample for the principal square root: and This equality is valid only when formula_67
* formula_68 Counterexample for the principal square root: and This equality is valid only when formula_69
*formula_70 Counterexample for the principal square root: ) This equality is valid only when formula_71

A similar problem appears with other complex functions with branch cuts, e.g., the complex logarithm and the relations or which are not true in general.

Wrongly assuming one of these laws underlies several faulty &quot;proofs&quot;, for instance the following one showing that :
formula_72

The third equality cannot be justified (see invalid proof). It can be made to hold by changing the meaning of √ so that this no longer represents the principal square root (see above) but selects a branch for the square root that contains formula_73 The left-hand side becomes eitherformula_74
if the branch includes orformula_75
if the branch includes , while the right-hand side becomesformula_76
where the last equality, formula_77 is a consequence of the choice of branch in the redefinition of .

==th roots and polynomial roots==

The definition of a square root of formula_41 as a number formula_79 such that formula_1 has been generalized in the following way.

A cube root of formula_41 is a number formula_79 such that formula_83; it is denoted formula_84

If is an integer greater than two, a -th root of formula_41 is a number formula_79 such that formula_87; it is denoted formula_88

Given any polynomial , a root of is a number such that . For example, the th roots of are the roots of the polynomial (in ) formula_89

Abel–Ruffini theorem states that, in general, the roots of a polynomial of degree five or higher cannot be expressed in terms of th roots.

==Square roots of matrices and operators==

If &quot;A&quot; is a positive-definite matrix or operator, then there exists precisely one positive definite matrix or operator &quot;B&quot; with ; we then define . In general matrices may have multiple square roots or even an infinitude of them. For example, the identity matrix has an infinity of square roots, though only one of them is positive definite.

==In integral domains, including fields==
Each element of an integral domain has no more than 2 square roots. The difference of two squares identity is proved using the commutativity of multiplication. If and are square roots of the same element, then . Because there are no zero divisors this implies or , where the latter means that two roots are additive inverses of each other. In other words if an element a square root of an element exists, then the only square roots of are and . The only square root of 0 in an integral domain is 0 itself.

In a field of characteristic 2, an element either has one square root or does not have any at all, because each element is its own additive inverse, so that . If the field is finite of characteristic 2 then every element has a unique square root. In a field of any other characteristic, any non-zero element either has two square roots, as explained above, or does not have any.

Given an odd prime number , let for some positive integer . A non-zero element of the field with elements is a quadratic residue if it has a square root in . Otherwise, it is a quadratic non-residue. There are quadratic residues and quadratic non-residues; zero is not counted in either class. The quadratic residues form a group under multiplication. The properties of quadratic residues are widely used in number theory.

==In rings in general==
Unlike in an integral domain, a square root in an arbitrary (unital) ring need not be unique up to sign. For example, in the ring formula_90 of integers modulo 8 (which is commutative, but has zero divisors), the element 1 has four distinct square roots: ±1 and ±3.

Another example is provided by the ring of quaternions formula_91 which has no zero divisors, but is not commutative. Here, the element −1 has infinitely many square roots, including , , and . In fact, the set of square roots of is exactlyformula_92

A square root of 0 is either 0 or a zero divisor. Thus in rings where zero divisors do not exist, it is uniquely 0. However, rings with zero divisors may have multiple square roots of 0. For example, in formula_93 any multiple of is a square root of 0.

==Geometric construction of the square root==

The square root of a positive number is usually defined as the side length of a square with the area equal to the given number. But the square shape is not necessary for it: if one of two similar planar Euclidean objects has the area &quot;a&quot; times greater than another, then the ratio of their linear sizes is formula_28.

A square root can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. In his Elements, Euclid (fl. 300 BC) gave the construction of the geometric mean of two quantities in two different places: Proposition II.14 and Proposition VI.13. Since the geometric mean of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is formula_95, one can construct formula_28 simply by taking .

The construction is also given by Descartes in his &quot;La Géométrie&quot;, see figure 2 on page 2. However, Descartes made no claim to originality and his audience would have been quite familiar with Euclid.

Euclid&#x27;s second proof in Book VI depends on the theory of similar triangles. Let AHB be a line segment of length with and . Construct the circle with AB as diameter and let C be one of the two intersections of the perpendicular chord at H with the circle and denote the length CH as &quot;h&quot;. Then, using Thales&#x27; theorem and, as in the proof of Pythagoras&#x27; theorem by similar triangles, triangle AHC is similar to triangle CHB (as indeed both are to triangle ACB, though we don&#x27;t need that, but it is the essence of the proof of Pythagoras&#x27; theorem) so that AH:CH is as HC:HB, i.e. , from which we conclude by cross-multiplication that , and finally that formula_97. When marking the midpoint O of the line segment AB and drawing the radius OC of length , then clearly OC &gt; CH, i.e. formula_98 (with equality if and only if ), which is the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality for two variables and, as noted above, is the basis of the Ancient Greek understanding of &quot;Heron&#x27;s method&quot;.

Another method of geometric construction uses right triangles and induction: formula_99 can be constructed, and once formula_8 has been constructed, the right triangle with legs 1 and formula_8 has a hypotenuse of formula_102. Constructing successive square roots in this manner yields the Spiral of Theodorus depicted above.

<text>Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse (&quot;Emperor William the Great&quot;) was a German transatlantic ocean liner in service from 1897 to 1914, when she was scuttled in battle. She was the largest ship in the world for a time, and held the Blue Riband until Cunard Line’s entered service in 1907. The vessel’s career was relatively uneventful, despite a refit in 1913.

The liner was built in Stettin for Norddeutscher Lloyd, and entered service in 1897. She was the first liner to be a Four funnel liner and is considered to be the first &quot;super liner.&quot; The first of four sister ships built between 1903 and 1907 for Norddeutscher Lloyd (the others being , and ), she marked the beginning of a change in the way maritime supremacy was demonstrated in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century.

The ship began a new era in ocean travel and the novelty of having four funnels was quickly associated with size, strength, speed and above all luxury. Quickly established on the Atlantic, she gained the Blue Riband for Germany, a notable prize for the fastest trip from Europe to America which had been previously dominated by the British.

In 1900, she was damaged in a massive and lethal multi-ship fire in the port of New York. She was also in a collision in the French port of Cherbourg in 1906. With the advent of her sister ships, she was modified to an all-third-class ship to take advantage of the lucrative immigrant market travelling to the United States.

Converted into an auxiliary cruiser at the outbreak of World War I, she was given orders to capture and destroy enemy ships. She destroyed several before being defeated in the Battle of Río de Oro by the British cruiser and scuttled by her crew, just three weeks after the outbreak of war. Her wreck was discovered in 1952 and partly dismantled.

==Origin, concept and construction==
At the end of the 19th century, the United Kingdom dominated maritime trade with the ocean liners of the principal maritime companies such as the Cunard and the White Star Line. Having gained more influence in Europe after William I, German Emperor, his grandfather, had created the German Empire in 1871, Emperor Wilhelm II wished to consolidate German influence on the sea and thus decrease that of the British. In 1889, the Emperor himself had attended a naval review in honour of the jubilee of his grandmother Queen Victoria. There he saw the strength and size of these British ships, notably the latest and then-largest liner owned by White Star, . He particularly admired the fact that these ships could easily be converted to auxiliary cruisers in time of conflict. Leaving a lasting impression, the emperor was heard to say that &quot;We must have some of these...&quot;

&quot;Norddeutscher Lloyd&quot;, commonly called NDL, or in English, North German Lloyd, was one of only two German maritime companies which had any influence in the hugely profitable North Atlantic shipping market. Neither of these lines had shown any interest in operating large liners. NDL, however, was the first company to name any of their liners in honour of members of the Imperial family, purely to flatter the emperor. The company also had important links with the naval architects AG Vulkan of Stettin. NDL then approached Vulkan and commissioned them to build a new &quot;superliner&quot;, which was to be named &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot;. The new ship would set a new style for ocean liners. She was the largest and longest liner afloat and would have been the largest ever had it not been for of 1860. She was the first liner to have suites with sleeping quarters including a private parlor and bath. She was built with decks strengthened to mount eight guns, four guns, and fourteen machine guns; although fewer and smaller guns were actually mounted in her ultimate wartime conversion.

The launching of the ship took place on 4 May 1897 in the presence of the Imperial family; it was the emperor who baptised the ship whose name honoured his grandfather Emperor William I, &quot;the Great&quot;. The liner was completed and internally decorated at Bremerhaven. Her maiden voyage was scheduled for September the same year. &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; was the first ship to have four funnels. For the next two decades they were a symbol of size and safety.

==Characteristics==
===Technical aspects===
&quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot;″s registered length was , her beam was and her depth was . Her tonnages were , and displacement. Her dimensions were similar to those of the 1860 &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, which was the largest ship of its time. As already noted, her four funnels were her most unusual feature. People associated the safety of an ocean liner with the number of &quot;stacks&quot; or funnels they had. Some passengers would in fact refuse to board ships if they did not have four funnels. In an age when ocean travel was not as safe as today, it was important to ensure that passengers felt at ease.

The special improvement in the arrangement of this steamer, as compared with other express steamers previously built by the NDL or other companies, consisted in the entire upper deck. Like many four-funnelled liners, &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; did not actually require that many. She had only two uptake shafts from the boiler rooms, which each branched into two to connect to the four funnels—this design is the reason for the funnels being unequally spaced.

&quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; became the first liner to have a commercial wireless telegraphy system when the Marconi Company installed one in February 1900. Communications were demonstrated with systems installed at the Borkum Island lighthouse and Borkum Riff lightship northwest of the island, as well as with British stations, and the first ship-to-shore message was sent on 7 March. By 1911 her call sign was DKW.

The ship was propelled by two had two propellers, each powered by a four-cylinder triple expansion engine. Between them her two engines were rated at 3,094 NHP and gave her a speed of more than . The engines were noted for their stability. The engines were balanced on the Schlick system, which prevented movement being transferred to the body of the ship, thus reducing vibration.

===Interiors===

&quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; was built to carry a maximum of 1,506 passengers: 206 first class; 226 second class; 1,074 third class. When she was completed, her crew numbered 488. However, after her refit in 1913, her crew space was increased to 800. The décor of ship was in the style of Baroque revival, overseen by Johann Poppe, who carried out all of the interior decoration. This was unique as usually a ship would have several interior designers.

The interiors were graced with statues, mirrors, tapestries, gilding, and various portraits of the Imperial family. The interiors of her sister ships were also placed in the hands of Poppe. The first class salon was noted for its tapestries and its blue seating. The smoking room, a traditionally male preserve, was made to look like a typical German inn. The dining room, capable of holding all passengers in one sitting, rose several decks and was crowned with a dome. The room also had columns and had its chairs fixed to the deck, a typical feature of ocean liners of the era.

==Career==

&quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; set out on her maiden voyage on 19 September 1897, travelling from Bremerhaven to Southampton and thence to New York. With a capacity of 800 third-class passengers, the NDL had ensured that they would profit greatly from migrants from Europe to the United States. From her maiden voyage, she was the only superliner to cross the Atlantic with such speed and such media attention. In March 1898, she successfully gained the Blue Riband with an average crossing speed of , thus establishing the new German competitiveness. The Blue Riband, an award given for the fastest crossing of the North Atlantic, east and westbound, had previously been held by the Cunard liner . This turn of events was closely watched by the maritime world of the era, who were eager to see how the British would retaliate. However, the NDL soon lost the riband in 1900 to the new German superliner, of the Hamburg America Line. This change in events was acceptable to Germans, who were able to relax in the knowledge that they were still the owners of the fastest liner; however, NDL promptly ordered that &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; undergo a refit to ensure that they were the dominant German company. This refit included the installation of wireless telegraphy, then new technology which allowed &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; to transmit telegraphic messages to a port, emphasising her image of security.
The NDL took the competition even further. 1901 saw the addition to their fleet of another four-funnel liner, named in honour of Crown Prince William, heir to the German throne, and they subsequently commissioned another two superliners, and of 1903 and 1907 respectively. From 1904 to 1907 the east-bound speed rekord was held by SS &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm II&quot;. The company stated that the four liners were of the renowned Kaiser class and decided to market them as the &quot;Four Flyers&quot;, a reference to their speed and associations with the Blue Riband.

In June 1900 at her quay in Hoboken, New Jersey, &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; was the victim of a fire which killed one hundred staff who were trying to remove the threat as the ship was towed to safety in the Hudson River. Six years later, on 21 November 1906, she was in collision with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company liner in Cherbourg Harbour. Five passengers aboard &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; and three crewmen aboard &quot;Orinoco&quot; were killed, and &quot;Orinoco&quot;″s clipper bow made a tear in the starboard side of &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot;″s hull. A court of inquiry found &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; wholly responsible for the collision. New York City mayor William Jay Gaynor was embarking on a European vacation when he was shot aboard the ship on 9 August 1910.

A technological evolution of steamships soon made NDL&#x27;s express steamers outdated. Cunard&#x27;s and outmatched their German rivals in all fields, and when the future White Star&#x27;s entered service in 1911, luxury on the high seas was taken one step further. As a result, &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; was rebuilt in 1913 to carry third-class passengers only. It seemed that her glory was fading regardless of her career as the first &quot;four stacker&quot;. From 26 January 1907, she was charged with carrying passengers between the Mediterranean Sea and New York, effectively ending the public career of the first of the &quot;four flyers&quot;.

===World War I===
From 1908, German naval captains had been receiving orders to make preparations in the event of a sudden war. In fact, &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; was soon fitted with cannons and thus transformed into an auxiliary cruiser. Across the world, supply ships carrying weapons and provisions were ready to convert merchant vessels into armed auxiliary cruisers. On 4 August 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany after the Germans invaded Belgium and Luxembourg. &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; was requisitioned and turned into an armed cruiser, painted in grey and black. Her commander at the time, Captain Reymann, operated not only under the rules of war, but also the rules of mercy.
Reymann soon sank three ships, &quot;Tubal Cain&quot;, &quot;Kaipara&quot;, and &quot;Nyanza&quot;, but only after taking their occupants on board. Further south in the Atlantic, &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; encountered two passenger liners: &quot;Galician&quot; and . Reymann&#x27;s first intention was to sink both vessels, but, discovering that they had many women and children on board, he let them go. In this early stage of the war, it was thought that it could be fought in a chivalrous fashion. However, soon it was to become a total war and ships would no longer be warned before being fired upon. As &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; approached the west coast of Africa, her coal bunkers were almost empty and needed refilling. She stopped at Río de Oro, (Villa Cisneros, former Spanish Sahara) where German and Austrian colliers started the task of refuelling her.

The task of coaling was still going on on 26 August, when the British cruiser appeared. Reymann quickly prepared his ship and crew for battle and steamed out to engage the enemy after disembarking his prisoners of war. A fierce battle took place, but came to a dramatic end when &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; ran out of ammunition. According to the Germans, rather than let the enemy capture the onetime pride of Germany, Reymann ordered the ship to be scuttled using dynamite, which was already in position should this situation ever arise. On detonation, the explosives tore a massive hole in the ship, causing her to capsize. This version of events was disputed by the British, who stated that &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; had been badly damaged and sinking when Reymann ordered it to be abandoned. The British firmly believed that it was gunfire from HMS &quot;Highflyer&quot; which sank the German ship. Reymann managed to swim to shore, and he made his way back to Germany by working as a stoker on a neutral vessel. Most of the crew were taken prisoner and held in the Amherst Internment Camp in Nova Scotia for the remainder of the war.

The downfall of such great liners in the event of war was their huge fuel consumption. Most liners were subsequently converted from cruisers to hospital ships or troopships.

==Wreck==
On 6 September 2013, the Salam Association for the Protection of the Environment and Sustainable Development in Morocco captured underwater footage of what was left of the wreck, with the ship&#x27;s name on the hull visible. This was confirmed by the Moroccan Ministry of Culture on 8 October 2013.

<text>The Sydney Swans are a professional Australian rules football club based in Sydney, New South Wales. The men&#x27;s team competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), and the women&#x27;s team in the AFL Women&#x27;s (AFLW). The Swans also field a reserves men&#x27;s team in the Victorian Football League (VFL). The Sydney Swans Academy, consisting of the club&#x27;s best junior development signings, contests Division 2 of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s underage national championships and the Talent League.

The club&#x27;s origins trace back to 21 March 1873, when a meeting was held at the Clarendon Hotel in South Melbourne to establish a junior football club, to be called the South Melbourne Football Club. The club commenced playing in 1874 at its home ground, Lakeside Oval in Albert Park. Playing as South Melbourne, it participated in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) competition from 1878 before joining the breakaway Victorian Football League (VFL) as a founding member in 1897. Originally known as the &quot;Bloods&quot; in reference to the red colour used on players&#x27; guernseys, the Swan emblem was adopted in 1933 after a journalist at the time referred to them using the moniker following a large influx of Western Australian players. In 1982, it became the first professional Australian football club to permanently relocate interstate (from Victoria to New South Wales). Initially playing in Sydney as &quot;The Swans&quot;, it was given its current name in 1983.

The club has a rivalry with the Greater Western Sydney Giants, with whom they contest the Sydney Derby. Their headquarters and training facilities are located in the Moore Park sporting precinct, with offices and indoor training at the Royal Hall of Industries and outdoor sessions conducted on the adjacent Tramway Oval and Sydney Cricket Ground, the latter being the site of the club&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s team home matches since 1982. The Swans have won five VFL/AFL premierships including 1909, 1918, and 1933, before experiencing a 72-year premiership drought—the longest of any team in the competition&#x27;s history. This premiership drought ended with the 2005 premiership, which was later followed by another title in 2012. Their five premierships are supplemented by fourteen grand final defeats, the most recent of which came in 2024.

According to Roy Morgan, the Swans are one of the most supported clubs in the AFL with more than a million fans in 2021.

==History==

===Origins: 1873–1876===
The club&#x27;s origins trace back to 21 March 1873, when a meeting was held at the Clarendon Hotel in South Melbourne for the purpose of establishing a junior football club, to be called the South Melbourne Football Club.

According to club historians, it was incorporated at the Temperance Hall, Napier Street at Emerald Hill 19 June 1874. It was first known as &quot;Cecil Football Club&quot; (after Cecil Street, South Melbourne, one of the early thoroughfares), but adopted the name &quot;South Melbourne Football Club&quot; four weeks later on 15 July. The club was based at Lake Oval alongside the lake in Albert Park, also home of the South Melbourne Cricket Club.

While one of the early favourites to win, South Melbourne were a notable exclusion from the Challenge Cup competitions of the 1870s with entry to this competition strictly limited to clubs playing under the Melbourne Football Club&#x27;s rules. The club&#x27;s lack of adherence to the Victorian Rules (and insistence on playing by its own rules) resulted in some controversial early wins. This, along with ability to regularly field a full senior team, may have contributed to its absence during the football season competition begun in the 1870s. Throughout this period South Melbourne, along with neighbouring Cup member club Albert Park, had experimented with rugby football rules which in May 1874 had advocated strongly for their widespread adoption in Victoria; however, this did not meet favour with the more powerful clubs in the colony.

Despite not being part of the big league of clubs, South Melbourne by the mid-1870s is recorded to have enough senior players to field two teams of twenty and played matches against non-Cup clubs during this time against nearby clubs including Fawkner Park, Elwood, West Melbourne, Southern Rifles in 1875 and Sandridge Alma, St Kilda Alma, Victoria Parade, and Williamstown in 1876 among others. Many of this group of clubs most of which had primarily juniors had also begun to discuss starting their own cup competition.

South was one of Victoria&#x27;s most prolific touring clubs. Seeking more regular senior competition in 1876 South Melbourne also went on one of its first regional tours playing against newly formed clubs at Beechworth, Blackwood, Taradale and Ballarat.

===VFA era: 1877–1896===
South Melbourne was a junior foundation club of the Victorian Football Association in 1877, and attained senior status in 1879.

====Amalgamation with Albert Park====
In 1880, South Melbourne amalgamated with the nearby Albert-park Football Club, which had a senior football history dating back to May 1867 (Albert-park had, in fact, been known as South Melbourne during its first year of existence). Following the amalgamation, the club retained the name South Melbourne, and adopted the club&#x27;s now familiar red and white colours from Albert-park. Nicknamed the &quot;Southerners&quot;, the team was more colourfully known as the &quot;Bloods&quot;, in reference to the bright red diagonal sash on their white jumpers The colourful epithet the &quot;Bloodstained Angels&quot; was also in use. Following the 1880 amalgamation it became the strongest in metropolitan Melbourne.

====VFA success====

Over its first decade as an amalgamated club, South Melbourne won five VFA premierships – in 1881, 1885 (undefeated) and three-in-a-row in 1888, 1889 and 1890 – and was runner-up to the provincial Geelong Football Club in 1880, 1883 and 1886. The 1886 season was notable for its 4 September match against Geelong, which generated unprecedented public interest as both clubs had entered the match undefeated.

The club was the second Victorian club to visit New South Wales in 1883 travelling to Newcastle where it also defeated the Northern Districts League by a goal before travelling to Sydney where it defeated Sydney by just a single goal in front of a large crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground and East Sydney Football Club by a goal in front of 600 spectators.

In May 1889, the Swans lost narrowly to a touring Maori team from New Zealand.
At the end of the 1896 season, Collingwood and South Melbourne finished equal at the top of the VFA&#x27;s premiership ladder with records of 14–3–1, requiring a playoff match to determine the season&#x27;s premiership; this was the first time this had occurred in VFA history. The match took place on 3 October 1896 at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. Collingwood won the match, six goals to five, in front of an estimated crowd of 12,000.

This grand final would be the last match South Melbourne would play in the VFA, as the following season they would be one of eight founding clubs forming the breakaway Victorian Football League joining St Kilda, Essendon, Fitzroy, Melbourne, Geelong, Carlton and Collingwood.

===VFL entry: 1897–1909===

South Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the Victorian Football League that was formed in 1897.

===Premiership success: 1909–1945===

The club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. However, they were the subject of some off-field difficulties, and the late 1920s, the South Melbourne Districts Football Club donated 40 guineas to South Melbourne to stop them from folding. The Districts also often provided assistance payments to players when needed.

In 1932, the red sash on the guernsey was replaced with a red &quot;V&quot;. 
The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933. The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Legion&quot;.

On grand final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.
It was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a &quot;Herald and Weekly Times&quot; artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the black swan being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934. The name stuck, in part due to the club&#x27;s association with nearby Albert Park and Lake, also known for its swans (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).

After several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known colloquially as &quot;the Bloodbath&quot;, due to the player brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled for many years.

===Struggling times: 1946–1981===
Following the end of the second world war, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They narrowly missed the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished any higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne&#x27;s financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country zoning failed to help, as the Riverina Football League proved to be one of the least profitable zones.
Between 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach Norm Smith, South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they &quot;won&quot; three wooden spoons. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s, South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.

===A VFL club for Sydney===
The VFL had been actively seeking an audience in Sydney since its first exhibition match in 1903 drew 20,000 people. For more than three quarters of a century, it had strategically scheduled matches in Sydney and through the Australian National Football Council – had allocated a significant share of its marketing budget to developing the code in Sydney, showcasing interstate tournaments and encouraging its clubs to play against the state representative side. At one point, it even attempted to negotiate a hybrid code with rugby league. However interest in the code in Sydney remained the poorest in the country (where it was behind three other football codes). In the late 1970s, however, with increasing professionalism of the sport there was an overall increase in national interest in the VFL competition.

In 1976, Melbourne journalist Jim Main began to break a story that a leading Melbourne businessman who had relocated to Sydney, Mannie Bongornio, had been meeting with Allen Aylett about luring a VFL club to Sydney. The idea began to gain traction and in 1977, Ron Barassi proposed the VFL setting up a club in Sydney, which he offered to coach believing that it would help spread the code in the state. Upon becoming league president, Aylett had the league investigated playing Sunday matches at the SCG. The VFL scheduled 2 premiership matches for the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1979. One of them, between the previous year&#x27;s grand finalists North Melbourne and Hawthorn drew a record 31,395 to the gates. In 1979 the financially struggling Fitzroy Lions conducted a feasibility into the possibility of moving to North Sydney and a proposal was put forward, but was voted down by its board in 1980. To test the market further, the VFL scheduled 4 matches for the SCG in 1980 with an average attendance of 19,000. In April 1980, the VFL stated that its market study showed there was sufficient support for a Sydney team, finding that there was an increase in television ratings in Sydney and sustained attendance at matches and that it intended to have a team in Sydney, possibly as soon as 1982. A 1981 report by Graham Huggins concluded that there was an &quot;untapped market in Sydney which represented an excellent opportunity for the league.&quot; The report claimed that 60,000 people in Sydney had stated that they would regularly support the new club and 90% of these supporters would watch VFL on television from Sydney and 80% of these supporters had not attended rugby and 92% believed that Australian rules could become popular in Sydney.

In 1981 the VFL had decided that it would establish an entirely new 13th VFL club in Sydney along with a possible 14th team. The VFL was under strong pressure from interests in Adelaide to admit a South Australian club and from the ACT for a new Canberra license, however VFL president Allan Aylett was convinced that Sydney was the most viable option. By 1981, Canberra&#x27;s ACTAFL had edged out rugby league in popularity with an increase in participation it had become the number one sport. Under significant pressure from a rugby league junior development push and fearing the impact on its strong local competition of entry of a Sydney team made a formal bid for licence to enter a Canberra team into the VFL. With corporate backing and strong public support including local legend Alex Jesaulenko, the Canberra bid was confident it would be a successful expansion club. Aylett however, determined to pursue the entry of a Sydney team, dismissed the Canberra bid publishing a scathing report on the development of football in the ACT, stating that the VFL might consider Canberra for a licence in another 10 years. Aylett&#x27;s view was that Sydney offered a much bigger television audience and the most potential to add to the league&#x27;s lucrative television rights. The league had also estimated that the club could initially draw support from an estimated 300,000 ex-Victorians living in and around Sydney.

With the possibility of another club making Sydney a viable move, in 1981, the South Melbourne board, recognising the structural difficulties it faced with long-term viability and financial stability in Melbourne, decided not to miss what it saw as a strategic opportunity to capture an untapped market and save its club. The board made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members justifying the board&#x27;s reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move. On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.

Inevitably, the move caused very great internal difficulties as a large supporters&#x27; group known as Keep South at South campaigned against the move throughout the rest of 1981; and, at an extraordinary general meeting on 22 September, the group democratically won control of the club&#x27;s board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority. The new board, whilst representative of most fans, lacked the support of the players, many of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board to commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season. The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November in order to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for at least two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.

===Swans move to Sydney: 1982–1984===
In 1982, the club was still technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Its physical &quot;home club&quot; was the &quot;Southern Cross Social Club&quot; at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick In response to the move, the club&#x27;s sponsors, Bond Corporation pulled out and the club was left without a major backer. At a major launch in Sydney, Aylett vindicated the league&#x27;s decision, announcing it had signed a new sponsor, Ward Transport, and that on-field success for the Swans would soon follow. The Swans experienced success in the 1982 Escort Championships with 1,000 supporters packing out the Chevron Hotel ballroom in King Cross in response to the win, however Channel Seven did not broadcast the match in Sydney. 

The club won their first official Sydney home game against Melbourne in front of 15,764.

In June 1982, it dropped the name &quot;South Melbourne&quot;, officially becoming &quot;the Swans&quot; for the rest of the season. The name change, however, did not endear either the Sydney media or the Sydney public, and after successive games at home, began to draw as few as 10,000. Despite just missing the finals, and some good wins at home and respectable home crowds against league leaders Carlton and Richmond, the lack of success and cold reception in Sydney led to the lustre quickly leaving the league&#x27;s glamour team. It was officially renamed the &quot;Sydney Swans&quot; in 1983.

In 1983 average crowds in Sydney continued to plummet to 12,000 and Swans supporter packages dropped to as low as 100 members (well short of the 20,000 average crowds predicted by the VFL&#x27;s 1980 Hennessy Report). Television ratings and sponsorship revenue in Sydney were also far below the league&#x27;s expectations.

Operating at a loss well short of the VFL&#x27;s predicted $750,000 a year profit poor financial performance continued to drown the club in 1984, with the club flagging pay cuts to its players in order to survive. Coach Ricky Quade resigned and caretaker coach Bob Hammond, despite showing some promise, was unable to turn the club&#x27;s poor performance around. In order to keep the club solvent during this time, the VFL began to write loans to the Swans that the club would have been unable to pay off on its own. The Swans were the league&#x27;s most reliant on sponsorship and subsidies from the VFL to stay solvent and meet player payments due to its continued poor crowds, public apathy and poor TV ratings.

Public support for the Swans in Sydney was so bad that by the start of the 1985 season, the VFL began to backflip and the league&#x27;s administrators, having sunk large amounts of money into the club began looking to offload it.

=== Edelsten era and privatisation: 1985–1987 ===
On 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be $6.3 million, Geoffrey Edelsten &quot;bought&quot; the Swans; in reality it was $2.9 million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach Tom Hafey. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong&#x27;s contracts to recruit David Bolton, Bernard Toohey and Greg Williams, who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered). The likes of Gerard Healy, Merv Neagle and Paul Morwood were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to Simon Madden, Terry Daniher, Andrew Bews and Maurice Rioli.

During the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant, flashy club, typified by the style of its spearhead, Warwick Capper, his long bright blond mullet and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for girlfriends who were fashion models and his general showy eccentricity made him notorious off the field – all somewhat fashionable in the 1980s. During Capper&#x27;s peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him the Mark of the Year award in 1987 while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans&#x27; successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the &quot;Swanettes&quot;, becoming the sole such American-style cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton&#x27;s Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were rapidly discontinued. During the Edelsten era, the club&#x27;s owner and the private company Westec are reported to have sunk more than $10 million in additional private capital to keep the club afloat.

When the Southern Cross club went bankrupt in 1987, the club relocated to the newly built Sydney Football Stadium.

In 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the West Coast Eagles and the following week scored 236 points against the Essendon Football Club. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992. However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.

===Dark times: 1988–1994===
The club&#x27;s form was to slump in the following year. Losses were in the millions. It was obvious to most that the Swans were struggling financially, though the owners, Sydney Rules Pty Ltd a subsidiary of Powerplay International Ltd were not selling. In early 1988 the company advised the Australian Securities Exchange to cease trading its shares as it could not continue to trade until it had offloaded the Swans. A Canberra consortium including the ACTAFL initially proposed to buy the failed club and shift it to Canberra, however the VFL claimed this was too extreme a move. The league compromised and along with Aylett, who had denied Canberra a license in 1981, proposed that the Swans play away games in the ACT with a dual aim of giving the club a sustainable supporter base and helping resurrect the code in the ACT which had lost enormous ground to rugby league since the introduction of the Canberra Raiders. However the VFL blocked the move feeling that the club would lose its identity if it were to play matches in Canberra.

By mid year the VFL had revoked the Swans license and took over ownership of the club, after an investigation under VFL CEO Ross Oakley determined that it was unable to continue operating. However, there were no buyers. On 6 May 1988 the VFL paid Powerplay just $10 to transfer ownership of the club in an attempt to keep it afloat until a buyer could be found. The VFL would wait months for the club to regain financial security. The VFL had reported that it needed to find a buyer willing to pay at least $4 million in order to make the club financially viable in the medium to long term. In the meantime, the league had secured a sponsor which helped underwrite the club until the sale.

At the end of 1988 the VFL re-tendered the Swans license and a group of financial backers including Mike Willesee, Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley, purchased the licence and bankrolled the club.

Morale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts. Coach Tom Hafey was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era). The Willesee consortia appointed Col Kinnear as the new coach.

Capper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for AUD$400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club&#x27;s finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney&#x27;s goalkicking was led by Bernard Toohey (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist Greg Williams, Bernard Toohey and Barry Mitchell. The careers of stars such as Dennis Carroll, David Bolton, Ian Roberts, Tony Morwood and David Murphy wound down, while promising young players like Jamie Lawson, Robert Teal and Paul Bryce had their careers cut short by injury.

Attendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. Kinnear in 1990 urged his players rally to support the club&#x27;s loyal fans and stem their mass exodus however he was ultimately stood down in August 1991. The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.

In October 1992, members from the 15 AFL clubs voted on axing the struggling Swans. To fill the void left by the Swans, the league floated a radical proposal for Carlton or Collingwood to play all of their away games in Sydney, however it was felt that even the leagues most popular clubs wouldn&#x27;t be able to draw a sufficient audience in Sydney to cover for the loss of the Swans. The AFL extended an offer for a Tasmanian license which was declined, and received an offer from the ACTAFL to relocate the club to Canberra, however the AFL rejected this. There were also strong rumours that the AFL intended to merge the club with the Brisbane Bears to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne. Without adequate alternatives the AFL Commission instead decided to step in and save the club, offering substantial monetary and management support, with the 15 clubs asked to cover the club&#x27;s AUD$1.2 million annual expenses including license fee and hire of the SCG. With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.

During this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the Wagga Wagga region of country New South Wales, Dennis Carroll and later the courageous captain Paul Kelly. However coach Gary Buckenara was sacked after 18 straight losses, managing to register just 2 wins and a draw during his term.
Desperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited Ron Barassi as coach who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Dermott Brereton was also recruited from Hawthorn on a three-year contract becoming one of the swans highest paid players, and was considered to replace Paul Kelly as club captain. However Brereton&#x27;s time in Sydney was marred by multiple tribunal appearances including 6 and 7 week bans and while he starred in some upset wins he spent more time off the field than on it; resulting in Barassi labelling the experiment as a disappointment, and not offering a contract extension.

===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995–2001===
A big coup for the club was recruitment of St Kilda Football Club champion Tony &quot;Plugger&quot; Lockett in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the Super League war in the dominant rival rugby league football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.

1995 would be Barassi&#x27;s last year in charge. The Swans won eight games – as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined – and finished with a percentage of over 100. They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Captain Paul Kelly won the League&#x27;s highest individual honour, the Brownlow Medal. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.
Former Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to , which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the MCG.

The Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers in the semi-final at the SCG.

The 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being Tony Lockett kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers .

After missing the finals in 2000, the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in 2001, but were beaten by by 55 points in their elimination final at Colonial Stadium.

===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002–2004===
Former Swans favourite son Paul Roos was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumours that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with Terry Wallace.

Roos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.

A new home ground at Stadium Australia provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans&#x27; first game played at the stadium in Round 9, 2002 against attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v Collingwood match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the Brisbane Lions in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.

2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended &#x27;s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for Leo Barry&#x27;s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual Coleman Medallist Fraser Gehrig, whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.

Sydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, Barry Hall. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.

As the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of Paul Williams, Barry Hall, Craig Bolton, Darren Jolly, Ted Richards, Peter Everitt, Martin Mattner, Rhyce Shaw, Shane Mumford, Ben McGlynn and Mitch Morton, amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of Daniel Motlop, Nick Dal Santo, James Kelly, Courtenay Dempsey and Sam Lonergan who went to , , and the latter two to respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.
===Premiership glory: 2005===

In 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou, for their unorthodox, &quot;boring&quot; defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total while playing against the Swans). Swans coach Paul Roos maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.

After finishing third during the regular season, the Swans lost the second qualifying final against the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco Oval on 2 September by 10.5 (65) to 10.9 (69). This dropped them into a semi-final against the Geelong Cats at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31–53 before Nick Davis kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against St Kilda, the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).

The Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the AFL Grand Final on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast&#x27;s 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with Leo Barry marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles&#x27; final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans&#x27; first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney.

On 30 September 2005, a ticker tape parade down Sydney&#x27;s George Street was held in honour of the Swans&#x27; achievements, which ended with a rally at Sydney Town Hall, where Lord Mayor Clover Moore presented the team with the key to the city. The flag of the Swans also flew on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge during the week; the same flag was later given to Premier of Western Australia Geoff Gallop to fly on top of the state legislature in Perth as part of the friendly wager between Gallop and Premier of New South Wales Morris Iemma.

Off the field the Grand Final success instigated moves to make the club sustainable in the long term and capitalise on the success to grow the code in the state. The Greater Sydney Australian Football Foundation Limited was formed, which would later become the Sydney Swans Foundation aimed initially at raising $5 million in funds to develop the Swans and the code in New South Wales. The Foundation has raised millions since its inception and helped keep the Swans sustainable in Sydney.

===Grand final loss: 2006===

As reigning premiers, the Sydney Swans started the 2006 season slowly, losing three of their first four games, including in round one to an side that would finish near the bottom of the ladder with only three wins and a draw, and finish with the worst defensive record of any side for the season (Sydney, conversely, had the best defensive record of any side).

The 2006 AFL Grand Final was contested between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 30 September 2006. The West Coast Eagles avenged their 2005 Grand Final defeat by beating the Sydney Swans by one point, only the fourth one-point grand final margin in the competition&#x27;s history.

The rivalry between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles has become one of the great modern rivalries. The six games between the two sides (from the start of the 2005 finals to the first round of 2007 inclusive) were decided by a combined margin of 13 points. Four of those six games were finals and 2 grand finals.

===Finals goal: 2007–2010===
Sydney finished the 2007 home and away season in 7th place, and advanced to the finals, where they faced and were defeated by by 38 points in the elimination final. It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign.

The conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of Adam Schneider and Sean Dempster to St Kilda, the delisting of Simon Phillips, Jonathan Simpkin and Luke Vogels, and the gain of Henry Playfair from Geelong and Martin Mattner from Adelaide.

The Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated in the elimination final before losing to the Western Bulldogs the following week.

2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. Barry Hall, Leo Barry, Jared Crouch, Michael O&#x27;Loughlin, Amon Buchanan and Darren Jolly all departed at the conclusion of the season, with Mark Seaby, Daniel Bradshaw and Shane Mumford, among others, joining the club during the trade period.

The 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated by five points in the elimination final before losing to the Western Bulldogs in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons. The loss signalled the end of the Swans coaching career of Paul Roos as well as that of the playing career of Brett Kirk.

===John Longmire era: 2011–present===

Former premiership-winning forward John Longmire took over as coach of the Swans as part of a succession plan initiated by Paul Roos in 2009 prior to the beginning of the 2011 season.
He led the club to a seventh-place finish at the end of the regular season, therefore qualifying for the finals for the 13th time in the past 16 seasons. The Swans defeated in an elimination final at Docklands Stadium before losing to in the semi-finals the following week.

It was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded Geelong Cats on its home ground, Skilled Stadium, where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans&#x27; first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the West Coast Eagles at Patersons Stadium during the regular season. The Swans&#x27; victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain Jarrad McVeigh&#x27;s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.

====2012: Premiership year, Sydney becomes a two team town====
The 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers . After an even and physical first half, Sydney went on to win by 63 points. Subsequent wins over , , and saw the Swans sit second behind on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively).

The Swans defeated by 29 points in their qualifying final at AAMI Stadium, thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated by 26 points to qualify for their first grand final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process.

In the grand final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn by ten points in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with Nick Malceski kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans&#x27; fifth premiership and first since 2005. Ryan O&#x27;Keefe was named the Norm Smith Medallist and the Swans&#x27; best player in September.

The Swans&#x27; 2013 season was marred by long-term injuries to many of its key players, namely Adam Goodes, Sam Reid, Lewis Jetta, Rhyce Shaw and Lewis Roberts-Thomson, among others; despite this setback, the team were still able to reach the finals for the fifteenth time in 18 seasons, reaching the preliminary finals where they were defeated by at Patersons Stadium, its first loss at the venue since 2009.

====2014–2016: Grand final losses====

The 2014 AFL season began with some difficulties for the Swans. Sydney lost their first game against and then to Collingwood before becoming the first non-South Australian team to win at Adelaide Oval defeating Adelaide by 63 points with Lance Franklin and Luke Parker kicking 4 goals each. After a loss to North Melbourne in Round 4, the Swans&#x27; won twelve games in a row, including victories against 2013 grand finalists Fremantle and Hawthorn, Geelong by 110 points at the SCG and then ladder leaders Port Adelaide. In Round 17, the Swans defeated Carlton to match a winning streak set three times in club history, the last of which came way back in 1935, and eventually closed out the season with their first minor premiership in 18 years and a club record 17 wins for the season, eclipsing the previous highest of 16, which was achieved on six past occasions in 2012, 1996, 1986, 1945, 1936 and 1935. In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the 2014 AFL Grand Final. They defeated Fremantle at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against North Melbourne, which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The 2014 AFL Grand Final was played on Saturday, 27 September 2014, in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player Lance Franklin would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney&#x27;s biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.

The Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next two games against Fremantle, where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the Western Bulldogs. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against Geelong and North Melbourne, and an upset away win against Hawthorn in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to Richmond at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against Port Adelaide and Brisbane Lions, before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the Hawks by 89 points. The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the Eagles by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to Geelong at Simmonds stadium; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against Collingwood, , St Kilda and .

The Swans faced minor premiers Fremantle in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness. Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low-scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing Sam Reid to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter. The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against North Melbourne, struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time. For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.

The Swans&#x27; continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a salary cap concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city. It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped. The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000). During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by ageing players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade. In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA, the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for Callum Sinclair in a swap deal, as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, Michael Talia from the Western Bulldogs.

The Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against Collingwood, with new Swans recruit Michael Talia suffering a long-term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit Callum Sinclair kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with Lance Franklin kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, Isaac Heeney starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club&#x27;s 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain Kieren Jack and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.

Ahead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at Stadium Australia. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant Jeremy Cameron outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the Adelaide Crows by 6 goals, with Franklin and Tom Papley kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the Geelong Cats at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in five years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.

The Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to Hawthorn by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0–6. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.

The Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether; however, three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the elimination finals.

The Swans&#x27; golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with 8 wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.

====2016–present: Pride Games====
In 2015, a pre-season Pride Game was played at Drummoyne Oval between the Swans and the Fremantle Dockers. From the following year, it became an annual fixture marking the club&#x27;s support for the LGBTQIA+ community. The annual Pride Games are currently only played between the Swans and St Kilda. the AFL had no plans to introduce a Pride Round, although the AFLW Pride Round was established in 2018.

====2020s: Return to finals====
They won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points, but won only four more games for the season, missing the finals in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1994–95. The 16th-place finish was also the lowest in club history.

After two seasons out of the finals, the Swans rebounded to great effect in 2021. An excellent first month of the season, which saw them upset Brisbane and reigning premiers Richmond, set up a strong home-and-away campaign. Seven wins in their final eight games saw Sydney secure sixth position with a 15–7 win-loss record, just percentage outside the top four, but their year came to a premature end in the finals after a heartbreaking one-point loss to crosstown rival Greater Western Sydney in the second elimination final. The players felt as though they had more to give, and were overcome with disappointment knowing that they had no finals win to show for it, in a season which had otherwise been a massive step in the right direction.

In 2022, the Swans backed up their meteoric rise up the ladder with another promising start, winning five of their first six matches. This included a 30-point win against Geelong in Round 2, which involved Lance Franklin kicking his 1000th career goal, sparking one of the biggest pitch invasions in AFL history. After a mid-year slump, in which the Swans lost winnable games against Gold Coast, Port Adelaide and Essendon, they finished the home-and-away season with seven wins in a row, securing a top-4 berth for the first time since 2016.

In the 2022 finals series, the Swans beat Melbourne by 22 points at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to lock in a home preliminary final. The Swans played Collingwood in the preliminary final and won by a single point, qualifying to play in their fourth grand final in 12 years under Longmire.

On 24 September, the Swans were defeated by Geelong by 133 points to 52 in the 2022 AFL Grand Final.

In 2023 the Swans started well winning their opening two matches and on top of the ladder. A mid season slump saw them drop to as low as 15th but they turned it around winning six in a row to qualify for the finals.

In 2024, the Swans finished the season on top of the ladder with a record of 17–6. This gave them the minor premiership, their first since 2016. They defeated GWS in the Qualifying Final and Port Adelaide in the Preliminary Final to qualify for their 7th Grand Final of the 21st century and their 5th under John Longmire. However they were defeated by the Brisbane Lions in the 2024 Grand Final 120 to 60. 

On 26 November 2024, a few months after the swans premiership loss, John Longmire decided to announce his resignation as senior coach of Sydney Swans and hand the senior coach role to assistant coach Dean Cox.

==Club identity==
The club&#x27;s on-field nickname, the Swans, was suggested by a Herald and Weekly Times artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the black swan being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934. The Chicago Swans are affiliated with the club and share a similar logo.

===Uniforms===
The jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the Sydney Opera House at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red &quot;V&quot; on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club&#x27;s major sponsor is QBE Insurance. In 2004 the club added the initials &#x27;SMFC&#x27; in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club&#x27;s past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. From 2011 to 2021, the clash guernsey was a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but was rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the Brisbane Lions and Gold Coast Suns) and cross town rivals GWS Giants are the only clubs with which there is a clash. As of 2023 in addition to being used in games in Victoria unless there is a clash, the red &quot;V&quot; is used as a clash guernsey against Gold Coast and Brisbane

Nike is the current manufacturer of the Swans&#x27; apparel. Previous manufacturers were Puma (from mid-1990s to 2009) and ISC (2010 to 2020).

====Evolution====
===Club song===
The club song is known as &quot;Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White&quot;&#x27; and is to the tune of the &quot;Victory March&quot;, the fight song of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in South Bend, Indiana, US, which was written by University of Notre Dame graduates and brothers Rev. Michael J. Shea and John F. Shea. In 1961, SMFC committee member Mr. Lynn Laurence sought and was granted a copyright from the University and other musical houses to adapt and add lyrics to the &quot;Victory March&quot; thus creating the new club song, which replaced an adaptation of &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot; by Gene Autry. Port Adelaide also has used the &quot;Victory March&quot; as the basis for their club song since 1971, though their senior team changed their club song to their current original &quot;Power To Win&quot; after their entry into the AFL.

George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Swanee&quot; (1919) was used by the club in marketing promotions during the late 1990s.

In March 2021, the Swans made a slight but inclusive change to the penultimate line of their club song, with the words &quot;while &quot;her loyal sons&quot; are marching...&quot; changing to &quot;while &quot;our loyal Swans&quot; are marching...&quot;.

===Home ground and training base===

The club&#x27;s original home ground was Lakeside Oval, when they were known as the South Melbourne Football Club 
from 1879 until 1981.

Since the 2016 AFL season, the Swans have played all their home games at the Sydney Cricket Ground, a 48,000 capacity venue located in inner-east suburb of Moore Park. The venue has been home to Swans home games since the club&#x27;s relocation to Sydney in 1982. In the years 2002–2015, the Swans played between three and four home matches per season and most home finals matches at Stadium Australia (commercially known as ANZ Stadium), an 80,000 capacity stadium located in the west of the city. During the first five years at the ground average crowds were high, but issues with the surface as well as fan and player disengagement resulted in the club ending its association with the venue.

The club also trains on the SCG during the season and had its indoor training facilities and offices located within the stadium. During the off-season, when the ground is configured for cricket, the Swans train on the adjacent Tramway Oval (previously known as Lakeside Oval) also located within the Moore Park precinct. The oval is located less than one hundred metres from the SCG and since undergoing a redevelopment in 2018/19, has the same dimensions as the Docklands Stadium in Melbourne. The Swans NEAFL/reserves team have played some home matches at the oval, which has grassed hills and standing areas for several hundred spectators.

In October 2018 the club announced it would shift all offices and indoor training facilities to Moore Park&#x27;s Royal Hall of Industries sometime in the early-to-mid 2020s, after announcing a $55 million deal with the New South Wales Government to redevelop the Hall. The club pulled out of the agreement in April 2020 due to the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2021, the Swans announced it had re-negotiated a lease with the government to immediately commence the project. The facility provides indoor training facilities and administration for the Swans AFL, VFL and AFLW teams. The club began moving into the facility in December 2022. It was formally opened by the Prime Minister and New South Wales Premier in June 2023. The facility includes an indoor training field, gym, wet recovery area, medical amenities, a retail store, commercial kitchen, media studio, auditorium, learning centre, office space and a rooftop terrace, while the newly built adjoining building includes an international standard multi-purpose indoor sports court.

==Rivalries==

===Greater Western Sydney===

The introduction of the GWS Giants to the AFL in 2012 resulted in the formation of the Sydney Derby. The Swans compete against their cross-city rivals twice every season. The best performed player from every derby match is awarded the Brett Kirk Medal.

Initially, the rivalry was a one-sided affair in favour of the Swans, who won 8 of the first 9 derbies. However, it has become more competitive in recent years, with the Giants winning 5 of the 7 most recent derbies. The Swans have also played the Giants in four finals matches, losing three of them.

===West Coast Eagles===
The Swans developed a famous modern rivalry against the Perth-based West Coast Eagles between 2005 and 2007, when six consecutive games between the two teams, including two qualifying finals and two grand finals, were decided by less than a goal. The rivalry was highlighted by Sydney&#x27;s four-point win against West Coast in the 2005 Grand Final, and West Coast&#x27;s one-point win against Sydney in the 2006 Grand Final.

===Hawthorn===
The rivalry with Hawthorn has been more recent, mostly defined by two grand finals (2012 and 2014). The Swans beat Hawthorn in 2012 by 10 points to claim their fifth premiership. The rivalry grew in 2013, when Hawthorn forward Lance Franklin transferred to the Swans as a free agent on a nine-year, $10 million deal. In 2014, the Swans finished minor premiers and were favourites to win the grand final, however Hawthorn beat Sydney by 63 points. Both teams have had close games since their grand final encounters, with their matches often finishing within single digit margins.

==Men&#x27;s team==
===Current squad===
==Women&#x27;s team==

The Sydney Swans women&#x27;s team was founded for the 2016 exhibition series; however, they did not bid for AFLW entry until 2022. Following the granting of an official AFLW license, the team made its debut in 2022 AFL Women&#x27;s season 7. 
It was the most supported in the AFLW in 2022 (S7) with 7,757 members. Despite finishing last in its debut season, the women&#x27;s team had the 4th highest average home attendance in the league, with 3,773 playing out of the North Sydney Oval and Henson Park.

===Current squad===
===Club Champion===
==Reserves team==

The Sydney reserves are the reserves side of the club, playing in the Victorian Football League since 2021.

===History===
South Melbourne Juniors was formed by the South Melbourne Football Club on 29 March 1900, joining the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (MJFA).

In 1919, the Victorian Junior Football League (VFL) was formed, with the Leopold Football Club operating as South Melbourne&#x27;s affiliate. At the end of the 1924 season, Leopold was replaced by the South Melbourne Second Eighteen.

The side competed in the VFL seconds (which later became the AFL reserves) until the competition&#x27;s demise at the end of 1999, even after the move Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the reserves competition, with its best performances in losing grand finals in 1927, 1956, 1980 and 1995.

In 2000, the Sydney reserves – known as the Redbacks – joined the Sydney AFL competition, but was so dominant in the lower competition that it withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002, the Swans affiliated themselves with the Port Melbourne Football Club in the VFL, sending most of its reserves players there, while also retaining the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL as a junior development team. From 2003, the Sydney reserves recombined to a single team, which contested the higher standard AFL Canberra, winning four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008.

In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the newly established North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition. The side often played as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games. The side never won a premiership, eliminated in the Eastern Conference Grand Finals in 2011 and 2012; then losing the overall NEAFL grand final five times: 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Following the disbandment of the NEAFL in 2020, the Sydney reserves have competed in the Victorian Football League.

==Sydney Swans Academy==
The Sydney Swans Academy consists of the club&#x27;s junior development signings. It was formed in 2010 as one of two in Sydney including the GWS Giants Academy and one of four Northern Academies including the Brisbane Lions Academy and Gold Coast Suns Academy.

72 spread staff across 9 facilities manage 550 selected underage players from age 10 up with regional hubs in Illawarra, Central Coast, Newcastle, Port Macquarie and Northern Rivers.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s U16 and U18 teams have contested Division 2 of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s underage championships since 2017.

The Swans Academy also joined the Talent League in 2019.

==Supporter base==

Although a large majority of the existing fan base strongly objected to the relocation of the club from South Melbourne, the Sydney Swans have built a large following in the city they now call home. Attendances and memberships in Sydney grew dramatically during the Lockett era, helped out by the Super League War plaguing Rugby League. Nevertheless, the Swans continue to have a substantial supporter base in Victoria, with attendances for Swans games in Melbourne being much higher than other non-Victorian teams. In 2024, the Sydney Swans achieved their highest home attendances in club history, with an average of 38,202 fans at each of their 11 home games at the SCG, far surpassing the previous record of 35,818 that was set back in 1997. The club also reached a new membership record of 73,757 as of September 2024, 12.9% more than their previous record of 65,332, set one year earlier in 2023. 

Aboriginal actress and dancer Lillian Crombie founded the First Nations supporters club, the Black Swans.

According to Roy Morgan Research, the club has been the most supported club among all AFL supporters in every year since 2004.

The club also has an official Sydney LGBTQIA+ supporter group, Rainbow Swans.

<text>Supersessionism, also called replacement theology and fulfillment theology by its proponents, is the Christian doctrine that the Christian Church has superseded the Jewish people, assuming their role as God&#x27;s covenanted people, thus asserting that the New Covenant through Jesus Christ has superseded or replaced the Mosaic covenant. Supersessionists hold that the universal Church has become God&#x27;s true Israel and so Christians, whether Jew or gentile, are the people of God.

Often claimed by later Christians to have originated with Paul the Apostle in the New Testament, supersessionism has formed a core tenet of Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches for the majority of their history. Many early Church Fathers—including Justin Martyr and Augustine of Hippo—were supersessionist.

Most historic Christian churches, including the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, Reformed Churches and Methodist Churches, hold that the Old Covenant has three components: ceremonial, moral, and civil ( covenant theology). They teach that while the ceremonial and civil (judicial) laws have been fulfilled, the moral law of the Ten Commandments continues to bind Christian believers. Since the 19th century, certain Christian communities, such as the Plymouth Brethren, have espoused dispensationalist theology as contrasted to supersessionism and covenant theology. Additionally, as part of Christian–Jewish reconciliation, the Roman Catholic Church has placed an increased emphasis on the shared history between the Christian and modern Jewish religions.

Rabbinic Judaism rejects supersessionism as offensive to Jewish history. Islam teaches that it is the final and most authentic expression of Abrahamic monotheism, superseding both Judaism and Christianity. The Islamic teaching of &quot;tahrif&quot; teaches that earlier monotheistic scriptures or earlier interpretations of them have been corrupted by later interpretations of them, while the Quran presents a pure and unaltered version of their divine message.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;supersessionism&quot; comes from the English verb &quot;to supersede&quot;, from the Latin verb , &quot;to sit&quot;, plus &quot;super&quot;, &quot;upon&quot;. It thus signifies one thing being replaced or supplanted by another.

Throughout Church history, many Christian theologians saw the New Covenant in Christ as a replacement for the Mosaic Covenant and the Church as the new people of God. The word &quot;supersession&quot; is used by Sydney Thelwall in the title of chapter three of his 1870 translation of Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;An Answer to the Jews&quot;.

==Early Church==
===New Testament===

In the New Testament, Jesus and others repeatedly give Jews priority in their mission, as in Jesus&#x27;s expression of him coming to the Jews rather than to gentiles and in Paul the Apostle&#x27;s formula &quot;first for the Jew, then for the Gentile&quot;. Yet after the death of Jesus, the inclusion of the gentiles as equals in this burgeoning sect of Judaism also caused problems, particularly when it came to gentiles keeping the Mosaic law, which was both a major issue at the Council of Jerusalem and a theme of Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Galatians, though the relationship of Paul and Judaism is still disputed today.

Paul&#x27;s views on the Jews are complex, but he is generally regarded as the first person to make the claim that by not accepting claims of Jesus&#x27;s divinity, non-believing Jews disqualified themselves from salvation. Paul himself was a Jew. After a conversion experience he came to accept Jesus&#x27;s claim to be the Messiah later in his life. In the opinion of Roman Catholic ex-priest James Carroll, accepting Jesus&#x27;s divinity, for Paul, was dichotomous with being a Jew. His personal conversion and his understanding of the dichotomy between being Jewish and accepting Jesus&#x27;s divinity, was the religious philosophy he wanted to see adopted among other Jews of his time. However, New Testament scholar N.T. Wright argues that Paul saw his faith in Jesus as precisely the fulfillment of his Judaism, not that there was any tension between being Jewish and Christian. Christians quickly adopted Paul&#x27;s views.

For most of Christian history, supersessionism has been the mainstream interpretation of the New Testament of all three major historical traditions within Christianity – Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant. The text most often evident in favor of the supersessionist view is Hebrews 8:13: &quot;In speaking of &#x27;a new covenant&#x27; [Jer. 31.31–32] he has made the first one obsolete.&quot; Other statements by Jesus have also been used, namely Matthew 21:43 &quot;Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits.&quot;

===Church Fathers===

Many early Christian commentators taught that the Old Covenant was fulfilled and superseded by the New Covenant in Christ, for instance, Justin Martyr wrote that the &quot;true spiritual Israel&quot; referred to those who had &quot;been led to God through this crucified Christ&quot;. Irenaeus taught that, while the New Covenant had superseded the old, the moral law underlying the Law of Moses continued to stand in the New Covenant. Whereas, Tertullian believed that the New Covenant brought with it a new law, writing: &quot;Who else, therefore, are understood but we, who, fully taught by the new law, observe these practices, the old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the action itself demonstrates. ...Therefore, as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal circumcision was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual circumcision has shone out into the voluntary observances of peace.&quot;

Augustine of Hippo followed the views of the earlier Church Fathers but emphasized the importance to Christianity of the continued existence of the separate Rabbinic Jewish faith: &quot;The Jews ... are thus by their own Scriptures a testimony to us that we have not forged the prophecies about Christ.&quot; The Catholic church built its system of eschatology on his theology, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church. Augustine, however, also mentioned to &quot;love&quot; the Jews as a means to convert them to Christianity. Jeremy Cohen, followed by John Y. B. Hood and James Carroll, sees this as having had decisive social consequences, with Carroll saying, &quot;It is not too much to say that, at this juncture, Christianity &#x27;permitted&#x27; Judaism to endure because of Augustine.&quot;

== Contemporary views ==

=== Eastern Orthodox ===
In the early days, there were different views within the Orthodox Church regarding replacement theology, although the Orthodox Church did not use this term to describe this theological thought. However, after the restoration of Israel fulfilled the prophecies in the Old Testament, replacement theology was reconsidered, and some churches have explicitly rejected it.

===Roman Catholic===

Supersessionism is not the name of any official Roman Catholic Church teaching and the word appears in no Church documents, but official Catholic teaching has reflected varying levels of supersessionist thought throughout its history, especially prior to the mid-twentieth century. The theology that religious Jews dissent by continuing to exist outside the Church is extensive in Catholic liturgy and literature. The Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) marked a shift in emphasis of official Catholic teaching about Judaism, a shift which may be described as a move from &quot;hard&quot; to &quot;soft&quot; supersessionism, to use the terminology of David Novak.
Prior to Vatican II, Catholic teaching on the matter was characterized by &quot;displacement&quot; or &quot;substitution&quot; theologies, according to which the Church and its New Covenant took the place of Judaism and its &quot;Old Covenant&quot;, the latter being rendered void by the coming of Jesus. The nullification of the Old Covenant was often explained in terms of the &quot;deicide charge&quot; that Jews forfeited their covenantal relationship with God by executing the divine Christ. As recently as 1943, Pope Pius XII stated in his encyclical :

At the Second Vatican Council, which was convened two decades after the Holocaust, a different framework emerged on how Catholics should think about the status of the Jewish covenant. The declaration , which was promulgated in 1965, made several statements which signaled a shift away from &quot;hard supersessionist&quot; replacement thinking which posited that the Jews&#x27; covenant was no longer acknowledged by God. Retrieving Paul&#x27;s language in chapter 11 of his Epistle to the Romans, the declaration states, &quot;God holds the Jews most dear for the sake of their Fathers; He does not repent of the gifts He makes or of the calls He issues.[...] Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures.&quot; A draft of the declaration contained a passage which originally called for &quot;the entry of that [Jewish] people into the fullness of the people of God established by Christ&quot;; however, at the suggestion of Catholic priest (and convert from Judaism) John M. Oesterreicher, it was replaced in the final promulgated version with the following language: &quot;the Church awaits that day, known to God alone, on which all peoples will address the Lord in a single voice and &#x27;serve him shoulder to shoulder&#x27; (Zeph 3:9).&quot;
Further developments in Catholic thinking on the covenantal status of ethnic Jews were led by Pope John Paul II. Among his most noteworthy statements on the matter is that which occurred during his historic visit to the synagogue in Mainz (1980), where he called Jews the &quot;people of God of the Old Covenant, which has never been abrogated by God (cf. Romans 11:29, &quot;for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable&quot; [NRSV]).&quot; In 1997, John Paul II again affirmed the Jews&#x27; covenantal status: &quot;This people continues in spite of everything to be the people of the covenant and, despite human infidelity, the Lord is faithful to his covenant.&quot;

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI, wrote in his 1999 work &quot;Many Religions – One Covenant&quot; that &quot;the Sinai [Mosaic] Covenant is indeed superseded.&quot;

The post-Vatican II shift toward acknowledging the ethnic Jews as a covenanted people has led to heated discussions in the Catholic Church over the issue of missionary activity directed toward Jews, with some Catholics theologians with Cardinal Avery Dulles reasoning that &quot;if Christ is the redeemer of the world, every tongue should confess him&quot;, while others vehemently oppose &quot;targeting Jews for conversion&quot;. Weighing in on this matter, Cardinal Walter Kasper, then president of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, reaffirmed the validity of the Jews&#x27; covenant and then continued: 

In his apostolic exhortation (2013), Pope Francis emphasized communal heritage and mutual respect for each other, writing:

Similarly, the words of Cardinal Kasper, &quot;God&#x27;s grace, which is the grace of Jesus Christ according to our faith, is available to all. Therefore, the Church believes that Judaism, [as] the faithful response of the Jewish people to God&#x27;s irrevocable covenant, is salvific for them, because God is faithful to his promises,&quot; highlight the covenantal relationship of God with the Jewish people, but differ from Pope Francis in calling the Jewish faith &quot;salvific&quot;. In 2011, Kasper specifically repudiated the notion of &quot;displacement&quot; theology, clarifying that the &quot;New Covenant for Christians is not the replacement (substitution), but the fulfillment of the Old Covenant.&quot;

These statements by Catholic officials signal a remaining point of debate, wherein some adhere to a movement away from supersessionism, and others remain with a &quot;soft&quot; notion of supersessionism. Traditionalist Catholic groups, such as the Society of St. Pius X, strongly oppose the theological developments concerning Judaism made at Vatican II and retain &quot;hard&quot; supersessionist views. Even among mainstream Catholic groups and official Catholic teaching, elements of &quot;soft&quot; supersessionism remain. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; refers to a future corporate repentance on the part of Jews:

In the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s (1964), the Church stated that God &quot;chose the race of Israel as a people&quot; and &quot;set up a covenant&quot; with them, instructing them and making them holy. However, &quot;all these things.[...] were done by way of preparation and as a figure of that new and perfect covenant&quot; instituted by and ratified in Christ (No. 9). Vatican II also affirmed, &quot;the Church is the new people of God&quot; without being &quot;Israel according to the flesh&quot;, the Jewish people.

In &quot;Notes on the Correct Way to Present the Jews and Judaism&quot; (1985), the Church stated that the &quot;Church and Judaism cannot then be seen as two parallel ways of salvation and the Church must witness to Christ as the Redeemer of all.&quot;

===Protestant===
Modern Protestants hold a range of positions on supersessionism and the relationship between the Church and the Jewish people. These differences arise from dissimilar literal versus figurative approaches to understanding the relationships between the covenants of the Bible, particularly the relationship between the covenants of the Old Testament and the New Covenant.

After the establishment of the political state of Israel in the wake of the Holocaust, mainstream Christian theologians and denominations began to re-examine supersessionism and some communities came to outright reject the teaching. Protestant hermeneutical frameworks tend to guide views on the subject, with covenant theology generally associated with supersessionism and dispensationalism generally opposed to supersessionism. Christian Zionism is also associated with a rejection of supersessionism; Dual-covenant theology contrasts with supersessionism by holding that the Mosaic covenant remains valid for Talmudic Jews.

Extensive discussion is found in Christian views on the Old Covenant and in the respective articles for each of these viewpoints: for example, there is a section within dispensationalism detailing that perspective&#x27;s concept of Israel. Differing approaches influence how the land promise in Genesis 12, 15 and 17 is understood, whether it is interpreted literally or figuratively, both with regard to the land and the identity of people who inherit it.

Adherents to these various views are not restricted to a single denomination though some traditions teach a certain view. Classical covenant theology is taught within the Presbyterian and Continental Reformed traditions. Methodist hermeneutics traditionally use a variation of this, known as Wesleyan covenant theology, which is consistent with Arminian soteriology. Certain mainline American denominations (e.g. TEC, ELCA, UMC) have released non-supersessionist statements. Liberal Protestant opponents to supersessionism associate the doctrine with racist motivations.

Paul van Buren developed a thoroughly nonsupersessionist position, in contrast to Karl Barth, his mentor. He wrote, &quot;The reality of the Jewish people, fixed in history by the reality of their election, in their faithfulness in spite of their unfaithfulness, is as solid and sure as that of the gentile church.&quot;

====Lutheranism====
The Lutheran Churches have historically taught the doctrine of supersessionism. This continues to be taught in Confessional Lutheran denominations, such as the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod, which have rejected a Christian theological basis for Zionism.

====Reformed====
The Reformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Reformed Anglican) tradition adheres to covenant theology and historically has taught that &quot;Christ fulfills the expectations of Jewish covenant life and renews the people of God rooted in the Old Testament and Judaism&quot; and that &quot;Jesus is the new temple, the new Israel.&quot;

===Latter-day Saints===
Mormonism professes to be the restoration of the original Christian faith and that the ancient Hebrew religion was a form of proto-Christianity. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints believe that the modern day descendants of Israel are still God&#x27;s covenant people, but they have nonetheless apostatized from the proto-Christian faith that God anciently revealed through the ancient patriarchs and Israel&#x27;s prophets. For example, the Book of Moses narrates that the biblical patriarch Enoch was shown a vision of Jesus as the Messiah who should be crucified and resurrected. The Book of Abraham narrates that God revealed to the titular biblical patriarch a vision of the Son of Man (a common title for Jesus Christ) being chosen in a premortal council to serve as the Redeemer of mankind.

Historically, Latter-day Saint leaders and church instructional materials have promoted the idea that those who accept baptism into the church are literal descendants of the scattered Israelites, primarily the tribe of Ephraim. However, those teachings have been de-emphasized since the latter 20th century in favor of a competing narrative regarding members being adopted or &quot;grafted&quot; into the House of Israel.

The title page of the Book of Mormon—which adherents believe is among content translated by Joseph Smith from the gold plates—states that one of its primary purposes is &quot;to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God.&quot; The Nephites—whom the Book of Mormon presents as ancient Israelites who escaped Jerusalem just before the Babylonian captivity—are said to have kept the Law of Moses with an understanding that it presaged Christ&#x27;s messianic mission. The Book of Mormon further teaches that because the Jews rejected and crucified Christ, they will be scattered among the nations of the earth and scourged across generations until they accept Christ as the true Messiah. According to the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, after Jesus reveals himself to the Jews, they will weep because of their iniquities.

In 1982, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, published a book titled &quot;The Millennial Messiah&quot;, which devotes an entire chapter to &quot;The Jews and the Second Coming&quot;. It states:

Some Jews consider the Latter-day Saint practice of posthumous baptism a particularly disrespectful enactment of supersessionist beliefs, and have repeatedly requested that the Church desist from baptizing Jewish Holocaust victims.

=== Jewish ===
Rabbinic Judaism rejects supersessionism, only discussing the topic as an idea upheld by Christian and Muslim theologians. Some modern Jews are offended by the traditional Christian belief in supersessionism, as they believe it undermines the history of their religion.

Supersessionism may be viewed as fundamentally antisemitic.

=== Muslim ===
In its canonical form, the Islamic idea of teaches that Jewish and Christian scriptures or their interpretations have been corrupted, which has obscured the divine message that they originally contained. According to this teaching, the Quran both points out and corrects these supposed errors introduced by previous corruption of monotheistic scriptures, which makes it the final and most pure divine revelation.

Sandra Toenis Keiting argues that Islam was supersessionist from its inception, advocating the view that the Quranic revelations would &quot;replace the corrupted scriptures possessed by other communities&quot;, and that early Islamic scriptures display a &quot;clear theology of revelation that is concerned with establishing the credibility of the nascent community&quot; vis-à-vis other religions. In contrast, Abdulaziz Sachedina has argued that Islamic supersessionism stems not from the Quran or hadith, but rather from the work of Muslim jurists who reinterpreted the Quranic message about &quot;islam&quot; (in its literal meaning of &#x27;submission&#x27;) being &quot;the only true religion with God&quot; into an argument about the religion of Islam being superior to other faiths, thereby providing theoretical justification for Muslim political dominance and a wider interpretation of the notion of jihad.

In Islamic legal exegesis (), abrogation () is the theory developed to resolve contradictory Quranic revelation by amending the earlier revelation. Only Quran 2:106 uses a form of the word (specifically meaning &#x27;we abrogate&#x27;). Q2:106 indicates of two varieties of abrogation: &quot;supersession&quot; – the &quot;suspension&quot; and replacement of the old verse without its elimination – or &quot;suppression&quot; – the nullification of the old verse from the written Quran ().

==Types==

Both Christian and Jewish theologians have identified different types of supersessionism in the Christian reading of the Bible.

R. Kendall Soulen notes three categories of supersessionism identified by Christian theologians: punitive, economic, and structural:
* Punitive supersessionism is represented by such Christian thinkers as Hippolytus of Rome, Origen, and Martin Luther. It is the view that Jews who reject Jesus as the Jewish Messiah are consequently condemned by God, forfeiting the promises otherwise due to them under the covenants.
* Economic supersessionism is used in the technical theological sense of function (see economic Trinity). It is the view that the practical purpose of the nation of Israel in God&#x27;s plan is replaced by the role of the Church. It is represented by writers such as Justin Martyr, Augustine, and Barth.
* Structural supersessionism is Soulen&#x27;s term for the &quot;de facto&quot; marginalization of the Old Testament as normative for Christian thought. In his words, &quot;Structural supersessionism refers to the narrative logic of the standard model whereby it renders the Hebrew Scriptures largely indecisive for shaping Christian convictions about how God&#x27;s works as Consummator and Redeemer engage humankind in universal and enduring ways.&quot; Soulen&#x27;s terminology is used by Craig A. Blaising, in &quot;The Future of Israel as a Theological Question&quot;.

These three views are neither mutually exclusive, nor logically dependent, and it is possible to hold all of them or any one with or without the others. The work of Matthew Tapie attempts a further clarification of the language of supersessionism in modern theology that Peter Ochs has called &quot;the clearest teaching on supersessionism in modern scholarship.&quot; Tapie argued that Soulen&#x27;s view of economic supersessionism shares important similarities with those of Jules Isaac&#x27;s thought (the French-Jewish historian well known for his identification of &quot;the teaching of contempt&quot; in the Christian tradition) and can ultimately be traced to the medieval concept of the &quot;cessation of the law&quot; – the idea that Jewish observance of the ceremonial law (Sabbath, circumcision, and dietary laws) ceases to have a positive significance for Jews after the passion of Christ. According to Soulen, Christians today often repudiate supersessionism but they do not always carefully examine just what that is supposed to mean. Soulen thinks Tapie&#x27;s work is a remedy to this situation.

<text>Software cracking (known as &quot;breaking&quot; mostly in the 1980s) is an act of removing copy protection from a software. Copy protection can be removed by applying a specific &quot;crack&quot;. A &quot;crack&quot; can mean any tool that enables breaking software protection, a stolen product key, or guessed password. Cracking software generally involves circumventing licensing and usage restrictions on commercial software by illegal methods. These methods can include modifying code directly through disassembling and bit editing, sharing stolen product keys, or developing software to generate activation keys. Examples of &quot;crack&quot;s are: applying a &quot;patch&quot; or by creating reverse-engineered serial number generators known as &quot;keygens&quot;, thus bypassing software registration and payments or converting a trial/demo version of the software into fully-functioning software without paying for it. Software cracking contributes to the rise of online piracy where pirated software is distributed to end-users through filesharing sites like BitTorrent, One click hosting (OCH), or via Usenet downloads, or by downloading bundles of the original software with cracks or keygens.

Some of these tools are called keygen, patch, loader, or no-disc crack. A keygen is a handmade product serial number generator that often offers the ability to generate working serial numbers in your own name. A patch is a small computer program that modifies the machine code of another program. This has the advantage for a cracker to not include a large executable in a release when only a few bytes are changed. A loader modifies the startup flow of a program and does not remove the protection but circumvents it. A well-known example of a loader is a trainer used to cheat in games. Fairlight pointed out in one of their .nfo files that these type of cracks are not allowed for warez scene game releases. A nukewar has shown that the protection may not kick in at any point for it to be a valid crack.

Software cracking is closely related to reverse engineering because the process of attacking a copy protection technology, is similar to the process of reverse engineering. The distribution of cracked copies is illegal in most countries. There have been lawsuits over cracking software. It might be legal to use cracked software in certain circumstances. Educational resources for reverse engineering and software cracking are, however, legal and available in the form of Crackme programs.

==History==
Software are inherently expensive to produce but cheap to duplicate and distribute. Therefore, software producers generally tried to implement some form of copy protection before releasing it to the market. In 1984, Laind Huntsman, the head of software development for Formaster, a software protection company, commented that &quot;no protection system has remained uncracked by enterprising programmers for more than a few months&quot;. In 2001, Dan S. Wallach, a professor from Rice University, argued that &quot;those determined to bypass copy-protection have always found ways to do so – and always will&quot;.

Most of the early software crackers were computer hobbyists who often formed groups that competed against each other in the cracking and spreading of software. Breaking a new copy protection scheme as quickly as possible was often regarded as an opportunity to demonstrate one&#x27;s technical superiority rather than a possibility of money-making. Software crackers usually did not benefit materially from their actions and their motivation was the challenge itself of removing the protection. Some low skilled hobbyists would take already cracked software and edit various unencrypted strings of text in it to change messages a game would tell a game player, often something considered vulgar. Uploading the altered copies on file sharing networks provided a source of laughs for adult users. The cracker groups of the 1980s started to advertise themselves and their skills by attaching animated screens known as crack intros in the software programs they cracked and released. Once the technical competition had expanded from the challenges of cracking to the challenges of creating visually stunning intros, the foundations for a new subculture known as demoscene were established. Demoscene started to separate itself from the illegal &quot;warez scene&quot; during the 1990s and is now regarded as a completely different subculture. Many software crackers have later grown into extremely capable software reverse engineers; the deep knowledge of assembly required in order to crack protections enables them to reverse engineer drivers in order to port them from binary-only drivers for Windows to drivers with source code for Linux and other free operating systems. Also because music and game intro was such an integral part of gaming the music format and graphics became very popular when hardware became affordable for the home user.

With the rise of the Internet, software crackers developed secretive online organizations. In the latter half of the nineties, one of the most respected sources of information about &quot;software protection reversing&quot; was Fravia&#x27;s website.

In 2017, a group of software crackers started a project to preserve Apple II software by removing the copy protection.

==+HCU==
The &quot;High Cracking University&quot; (+HCU) was founded by Old Red Cracker (+ORC), considered a genius of reverse engineering and a legendary figure in Reverse Code Engineering (RCE), to advance research into RCE. He had also taught and authored many papers on the subject, and his texts are considered classics in the field and are mandatory reading for students of RCE.

The addition of the &quot;+&quot; sign in front of the nickname of a reverser signified membership in the +HCU. Amongst the students of +HCU were the top of the elite Windows reversers worldwide. +HCU published a new reverse engineering problem annually and a small number of respondents with the best replies qualified for an undergraduate position at the university.

+Fravia was a professor at +HCU. Fravia&#x27;s website was known as &quot;+Fravia&#x27;s Pages of Reverse Engineering&quot; and he used it to challenge programmers as well as the wider society to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; the &quot;brainwashing of a corrupt and rampant materialism&quot;. In its heyday, his website received millions of visitors per year and its influence was &quot;widespread&quot;. On his site, +Fravia also maintained a database of the tutorials generated by +HCU students for posterity.

Nowadays most of the graduates of +HCU have migrated to Linux and few have remained as Windows reversers. The information at the university has been rediscovered by a new generation of researchers and practitioners of RCE who have started new research projects in the field.

==Methods==
The most common software crack is the modification of an application&#x27;s binary to cause or prevent a specific key branch in the program&#x27;s execution. This is accomplished by reverse engineering the compiled program code using a debugger such as x64dbg, SoftICE, OllyDbg, GDB, or MacsBug until the software cracker reaches the subroutine that contains the primary method of protecting the software (or by disassembling an executable file with a program such as IDA). The binary is then modified using the debugger or a hex editor such as HIEW or monitor in a manner that replaces a prior branching opcode with its complement or a NOP opcode so the key branch will either always execute a specific subroutine or skip over it. Almost all common software cracks are a variation of this type. A region of code that must not be entered is often called a &quot;bad boy&quot; while one that should be followed is a &quot;good boy&quot;.

Proprietary software developers are constantly developing techniques such as code obfuscation, encryption, and self-modifying code to make binary modification increasingly difficult. Even with these measures being taken, developers struggle to combat software cracking. This is because it is very common for a professional to publicly release a simple cracked EXE or Retrium Installer for public download, eliminating the need for inexperienced users to crack the software themselves.

A specific example of this technique is a crack that removes the expiration period from a time-limited trial of an application. These cracks are usually programs that alter the program executable and sometimes the .dll or .so linked to the application and the process of altering the original binary files is called patching. Similar cracks are available for software that requires a hardware dongle. A company can also break the copy protection of programs that they have legally purchased but that are licensed to particular hardware, so that there is no risk of downtime due to hardware failure (and, of course, no need to restrict oneself to running the software on bought hardware only).

Another method is the use of special software such as CloneCD to scan for the use of a commercial copy protection application. After discovering the software used to protect the application, another tool may be used to remove the copy protection from the software on the CD or DVD. This may enable another program such as Alcohol 120%, CloneDVD, Game Jackal, or Daemon Tools to copy the protected software to a user&#x27;s hard disk. Popular commercial copy protection applications which may be scanned for include SafeDisc and StarForce.

In other cases, it might be possible to decompile a program in order to get access to the original source code or code on a level higher than machine code. This is often possible with scripting languages and languages utilizing JIT compilation. An example is cracking (or debugging) on the .NET platform where one might consider manipulating CIL to achieve one&#x27;s needs. Java&#x27;s bytecode also works in a similar fashion in which there is an intermediate language before the program is compiled to run on the platform dependent machine code.

Advanced reverse engineering for protections such as SecuROM, SafeDisc, StarForce, or Denuvo requires a cracker, or many crackers to spend much more time studying the protection, eventually finding every flaw within the protection code, and then coding their own tools to &quot;unwrap&quot; the protection automatically from executable (.EXE) and library (.DLL) files.

There are a number of sites on the Internet that let users download cracks produced by warez groups for popular games and applications (although at the danger of acquiring malicious software that is sometimes distributed via such sites). Although these cracks are used by legal buyers of software, they can also be used by people who have downloaded or otherwise obtained unauthorized copies (often through P2P networks).

==Software piracy==
Software cracking led to the distribution of pirated software around the world (software piracy). It was estimated that the United States lost US$2.3 billion in business application software in 1996. Software piracy rates were especially prevalent in African, Asian, Eastern European, and Latin American countries. In certain countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Kuwait, China, and El Salvador, 90% of the software used was pirated.

<doc id="29215" wikidata="Q189620" url="?curid=29215" title="SOAP">
<text>SOAP, originally an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol, is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

==Characteristics==
SOAP provides the Messaging Protocol layer of a web services protocol stack for web services. It is an XML-based protocol consisting of three parts: 
* an envelope, which defines the message structure and how to process it
* a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes
* a convention for representing procedure calls and responses

SOAP has three major characteristics:

#&quot;extensibility&quot; (security and WS-Addressing are among the extensions under development)
# &quot;neutrality&quot; (SOAP can operate over any protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, UDP)
# &quot;independence&quot; (SOAP allows for any programming model)

As an example of what SOAP procedures can do, an application can send a SOAP request to a server that has web services enabled—such as a real-estate price database—with the parameters for a search. The server then returns a SOAP response (an XML-formatted document) with the resulting data, e.g., prices, location, features. Since the generated data comes in a standardized machine-parsable format, the requesting application can then integrate it directly.

The SOAP architecture consists of several layers of specifications for:

* message format
* Message Exchange Patterns (MEP)
* underlying transport protocol bindings
* message processing models
* protocol extensibility

SOAP evolved as a successor of XML-RPC, though it borrows its transport and interaction neutrality from Web Service Addressing and the envelope/header/body from elsewhere (probably from WDDX).

==History==
SOAP was designed as an object-access protocol and released as XML-RPC in June 1998 as part of Frontier 5.1 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein for Microsoft, where Atkinson and Al-Ghosein were working. The specification was not made available until it was submitted to IETF 13 September 1999. According to Don Box, this was due to politics within Microsoft. Because of Microsoft&#x27;s hesitation, Dave Winer shipped XML-RPC in 1998.

The submitted Internet Draft did not reach RFC status and is therefore not considered a &quot;web standard&quot; as such. Version 1.1 of the specification was published as a W3C Note on 8 May 2000. Since version 1.1 did not reach W3C Recommendation status, it can not be considered a &quot;web standard&quot; either. Version 1.2 of the specification, however, became a W3C recommendation on June 24, 2003. &quot;SOAP&quot; originally stood for &quot;Simple Object Access Protocol&quot; but version 1.2 of the standard dropped this acronym.

The SOAP specification was maintained by the XML Protocol Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium until the group was closed 10 July 2009. 

After SOAP was first introduced, it became the underlying layer of a more complex set of web services, based on WSDL, XSD and UDDI. These different services, especially UDDI, have proved to be of far less interest, but an appreciation of them gives a complete understanding of the expected role of SOAP compared to how web services have actually evolved.

== SOAP terminology ==
SOAP specification can be broadly defined to be consisting of the following three conceptual components: protocol concepts, encapsulation concepts and network concepts.

=== Protocol concepts ===
; SOAP: This is a set of rules formalizing and governing the format and processing rules for information exchanged between a SOAP sender and a SOAP receiver.
; SOAP nodes: These are physical/logical machines with processing units which are used to transmit/forward, receive and process SOAP messages. These are analogous to nodes in a network.
; SOAP roles: Over the path of a SOAP message, all nodes assume a specific role. The role of the node defines the action that the node performs on the message it receives. For example, a role &quot;none&quot; means that no node will process the SOAP header in any way and simply transmit the message along its path.
; SOAP protocol binding : A SOAP message needs to work in conjunction with other protocols to be transferred over a network. For example, a SOAP message could use TCP as a lower layer protocol to transfer messages. These bindings are defined in the SOAP protocol binding framework.
; SOAP features: SOAP provides a messaging framework only. However, it can be extended to add features such as reliability, security etc. There are rules to be followed when adding features to the SOAP framework.
; SOAP module : A collection of specifications regarding the semantics of SOAP header to describe any new features being extended upon SOAP. A module needs to realize zero or more features. SOAP requires modules to adhere to prescribed rules.

=== Data encapsulation concepts ===
; SOAP message: Represents the information being exchanged between 2 SOAP nodes.
; SOAP envelope : It is the enclosing element of an XML message identifying it as a SOAP message.
; SOAP header block: A SOAP header can contain more than one of these blocks, each being a discrete computational block within the header. In general, the SOAP &quot;role&quot; information is used to target nodes on the path. A header block is said to be targeted at a SOAP node if the SOAP role for the header block is the name of a role in which the SOAP node operates. (ex: A SOAP header block with role attribute as &quot;ultimateReceiver&quot; is targeted only at the destination node which has this role. A header with a role attribute as &quot;next&quot; is targeted at each intermediary as well as the destination node.)
; SOAP header : A collection of one or more header blocks targeted at each SOAP receiver.
; SOAP body : Contains the body of the message intended for the SOAP receiver. The interpretation and processing of SOAP body is defined by header blocks.
; SOAP fault: In case a SOAP node fails to process a SOAP message, it adds the fault information to the SOAP fault element. This element is contained within the SOAP body as a child element.

=== Message sender and receiver concepts ===
; SOAP sender: The node that transmits a SOAP message.
; SOAP receiver: The node receiving a SOAP message. (Could be an intermediary or the destination node).
; SOAP message path: The path consisting of all the nodes that the SOAP message traversed to reach the destination node.
; Initial SOAP sender: This is the node which originated the SOAP message to be transmitted. This is the root of the SOAP message path.
; SOAP intermediary: All the nodes in between the SOAP originator and the intended SOAP destination. It processes the SOAP header blocks targeted at it and acts to forward a SOAP message towards an ultimate SOAP receiver.
; Ultimate SOAP receiver: The destination receiver of the SOAP message. This node is responsible for processing the message body and any header blocks targeted at it.

==Specification==
The SOAP specification defines the messaging framework, which consists of:
* The &quot;SOAP processing model&quot;, defining the rules for processing a SOAP message
* The &quot;SOAP extensibility model&quot; defining the concepts of SOAP features and SOAP modules
* The &quot;SOAP underlying protocol binding&quot; framework describing the rules for defining a binding to an underlying protocol that can be used for exchanging SOAP messages between SOAP nodes
* The &quot;SOAP message construct&quot; defining the structure of a SOAP message

==SOAP building blocks==
A SOAP message is an ordinary XML document containing the following elements:

==Transport methods==
Both SMTP and HTTP are valid application layer protocols used as transport for SOAP, but HTTP has gained wider acceptance as it works well with today&#x27;s internet infrastructure; specifically, HTTP works well with network firewalls. SOAP may also be used over HTTPS (which is the same protocol as HTTP at the application level, but uses an encrypted transport protocol underneath) with either simple or mutual authentication; this is the advocated WS-I method to provide web service security as stated in the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.

This is a major advantage over other distributed protocols like GIOP/IIOP or DCOM, which are normally filtered by firewalls. SOAP over AMQP is yet another possibility that some implementations support. SOAP also has an advantage over DCOM that it is unaffected by security rights configured on the machines that require knowledge of both transmitting and receiving nodes. This lets SOAP be loosely coupled in a way that is not possible with DCOM. There is also the SOAP-over-UDP OASIS standard.

== Message format ==
XML Information Set was chosen as the standard message format because of its widespread use by major corporations and open source development efforts. Typically, XML Information Set is serialized as XML. A wide variety of freely available tools significantly eases the transition to a SOAP-based implementation. The somewhat lengthy syntax of XML can be both a benefit and a drawback. While it facilitates error detection and avoids interoperability problems such as byte-order (endianness), it can slow processing speed and can be cumbersome. For example, CORBA, GIOP, ICE, and DCOM use much shorter, binary message formats. On the other hand, hardware appliances are available to accelerate processing of XML messages. Binary XML is also being explored as a means for streamlining the throughput requirements of XML.
XML messages by their self-documenting nature usually have more &#x27;overhead&#x27; (e.g., headers, nested tags, delimiters) than actual data in contrast to earlier protocols where the overhead was usually a relatively small percentage of the overall message.

In financial messaging SOAP was found to result in a 2–4 times larger message than previous protocols FIX (Financial Information Exchange) and CDR (Common Data Representation).

XML Information Set does not have to be serialized in XML. For instance, CSV and JSON XML-infoset representations exist. There is also no need to specify a generic transformation framework. The concept of SOAP bindings allows for specific bindings for a specific application. The drawback is that both the senders and receivers have to support this newly defined binding.

==Example message (encapsulated in HTTP) ==

The message below requests a stock price for AT&amp;T (stock ticker symbol &quot;T&quot;).
POST /InStock HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8

* SOAP&#x27;s neutrality characteristic explicitly makes it suitable for use with any transport protocol. Implementations often use HTTP as a transport protocol, but other popular transport protocols can be used. For example, SOAP can also be used over SMTP, JMS and message queues.
* SOAP, when combined with HTTP post/response exchanges, tunnels easily through existing firewalls and proxies, and consequently doesn&#x27;t require modifying the widespread computing and communication infrastructures that exist for processing HTTP post/response exchanges.
* SOAP has available to it all the facilities of XML, including easy internationalization and extensibility with XML Namespaces.

===Disadvantages===
* When using standard implementation and the default SOAP/HTTP binding, the XML infoset is serialized as XML. To improve performance for the special case of XML with embedded binary objects, the Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism was introduced.
* When relying on HTTP as a transport protocol and not using Web Services Addressing or an Enterprise Service Bus, the roles of the interacting parties are fixed. Only one party (the client) can use the services of the other.
* SOAP is less &quot;simple&quot; than the name would suggest. The verbosity of the protocol, low parsing speed of XML, and lack of a standardized interaction model led to the dominance of services using the HTTP protocol more directly. See, for example, REST.
* Being protocol-agnostic, SOAP is unable to take advantage of protocol-specific features and optimizations such as REST&#x27;s Uniform Interface or caching – instead having to reimplement them (as with WS-Addressing).

<text>Sodium thiopental, also known as Sodium Pentothal (a trademark of Abbott Laboratories), thiopental, thiopentone, or Trapanal (also a trademark), is a rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate general anesthetic. It is the thiobarbiturate analog of pentobarbital, and an analog of thiobarbital. Sodium thiopental was a core medicine in the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines, but was supplanted by propofol. Despite this, thiopental is listed as an acceptable alternative to propofol, depending on local availability and cost of these agents. It was the first of three drugs administered during most lethal injections in the United States until the US division of Hospira objected and stopped manufacturing the drug in 2011, and the European Union banned the export of the drug for this purpose. Although thiopental abuse carries a dependency risk, its recreational use is rare.

Sodium thiopental is well-known in popular culture, especially under the name &quot;sodium pentothal,&quot; as a &quot;truth serum,&quot; although its efficacy in this role has been questioned.

==Uses==

===Anesthesia===
Sodium thiopental is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate and has been used commonly in the induction phase of general anesthesia. Its use has been largely replaced with that of propofol, but may retain some popularity as an induction agent for rapid-sequence induction and intubation, such as in obstetrics. Following intravenous injection, the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 30–45 seconds. At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body, and in about 5–10 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain that consciousness returns.

A normal dose of sodium thiopental (usually 4–6 mg/kg) given to a pregnant woman for operative delivery (caesarean section) rapidly makes her unconscious, but the baby in her uterus remains conscious. However, larger or repeated doses can depress the baby&#x27;s consciousness.

Sodium thiopental is not used to maintain anesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination pharmacokinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness. Sodium thiopental would have to be given in large amounts to maintain unconsciousness during anaesthesia due to its rapid redistribution throughout the body (as it has a high volume of distribution). Since its half-life of 5.5 to 26 hours is quite long, consciousness would take a long time to return.

In veterinary medicine, sodium thiopental is used to induce anesthesia in animals. Since it is redistributed to fat, certain lean breeds of dogs such as sighthounds will have prolonged recoveries from sodium thiopental due to their lack of body fat and their lean body mass. Conversely, obese animals will have rapid recoveries, but it will take much longer for the drug to be entirely removed (metabolized) from their bodies. Sodium thiopental is always administered intravenously, as it can be fairly irritating to tissue and is a vesicant; severe tissue necrosis and sloughing can occur if it is injected incorrectly into the tissue around a vein.

===Medically-induced coma===
In addition to anesthesia induction, sodium thiopental was historically used to induce medical comas. It has now been superseded by drugs such as propofol because their effects wear off more quickly than thiopental.
Patients with brain swelling, causing elevation of intracranial pressure, either secondary to trauma or following surgery, may benefit from this drug. Sodium thiopental, and the barbiturate class of drugs, decrease neuronal activity thereby decreasing cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), decrease the cerebrovascular response to carbon dioxide, which in turn decreases intracranial pressure. Patients with refractory elevated intracranial pressure (RICH) due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have improved long term outcome when barbiturate coma is added to their neurointensive care treatment. Reportedly, thiopental has been shown to be superior to pentobarbital in reducing intracranial pressure. This phenomenon is also called an inverse steal or Robin Hood effect as cerebral perfusion to all parts of the brain is reduced (due to the decreased cerebrovascular response to carbon dioxide) allowing optimal perfusion to ischaemic areas of the brain which have higher metabolic demands, since vessels supplying ischaemic areas of the brain would already be maximally dilated because of the metabolic demand.

===Status epilepticus===
In refractory status epilepticus, thiopental may be used to terminate a seizure.

===Euthanasia===
Sodium thiopental is used intravenously for the purposes of euthanasia. In both Belgium and the Netherlands, where active euthanasia is allowed by law, the standard protocol recommends sodium thiopental as the ideal agent to induce coma, followed by pancuronium bromide to paralyze muscles and stop breathing.

Intravenous administration is the most reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia. Death is quick. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg thiopental sodium (Nesdonal) in a small volume (10 mL physiological saline). Then, a triple dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug is given, such as 20 mg pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) or 20 mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should be given intravenously to ensure optimal bioavailability but pancuronium bromide may be administered intramuscularly at an increased dosage level of 40 mg.

===Lethal injection===
Along with pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride, thiopental is used in 34 states of the US to execute prisoners by lethal injection. A very large dose is given to ensure rapid loss of consciousness. Although death usually occurs within ten minutes of the beginning of the injection process, some have been known to take longer. The use of sodium thiopental in execution protocols was challenged in court after a study in the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; reported autopsies of executed inmates showed the level of thiopental in their bloodstream was insufficient to cause unconsciousness although this is dependent on different factors and not just on the drug itself. 

On December 8, 2009, Ohio became the first state to use a single dose of sodium thiopental for an execution, following the failed use of the standard three-drug cocktail during a prior execution, due to inability to locate suitable veins. Kenneth Biros was executed using the single-drug method.

Washington State became the second state in the US to use the single-dose sodium thiopental injections for executions. On September 10, 2010, the execution of Cal Coburn Brown was the first in the state to use a single-dose, single-drug injection. His death was pronounced approximately one and a half minutes after the intravenous administration of five grams of the drug.

After its use for the execution of Jeffrey Landrigan in the US, the United Kingdom introduced a ban on the export of sodium thiopental in December 2010, after it was established that no European supplies to the US were being used for any other purpose. The restrictions were based on &quot;the European Union Torture Regulation (including licensing of drugs used in execution by lethal injection)&quot;. From 21 December 2011, the EU extended trade restrictions to prevent the export of certain medicinal products for capital punishment, stating that &quot;the Union disapproves of capital punishment in all circumstances and works towards its universal abolition&quot;.

===Truth serum===

Thiopental is still used in some places as a truth serum to weaken the resolve of a subject and make the individual more compliant to pressure. Barbiturates decrease both higher cortical brain function and inhibition. It is thought that because lying is a more involved process than telling the truth, suppression of the higher cortical functions may lead to the uncovering of the truth. The drug tends to make subjects verbose and cooperative with interrogators; however, the reliability of confessions made under thiopental is questionable.

===Psychiatry===
Psychiatrists have used thiopental to desensitize patients with phobias and to &quot;facilitate the recall of painful repressed memories.&quot; One psychiatrist who worked with thiopental is Jan Bastiaans, who used this procedure to help relieve trauma in surviving victims of the Holocaust.

==Mechanism of action==
Sodium thiopental is a member of the barbiturate class of drugs, which are relatively non-selective compounds that bind to an entire superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, of which the GABAA receptor channel is one of several representatives. This superfamily of ion channels includes the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), the 5-HT3 receptor, the glycine receptor and others. Surprisingly, while GABAA receptor currents are increased by barbiturates (and other general anesthetics), ligand-gated ion channels that are predominantly permeable for cationic ions are blocked by these compounds. For example, neuronal nAChR are blocked by clinically relevant anesthetic concentrations of both sodium thiopental and pentobarbital. Such findings implicate (non-GABAergic) ligand-gated ion channels, e.g. the neuronal nAChR, in mediating some of the (side) effects of barbiturates. The GABAA receptor is an inhibitory channel that decreases neuronal activity, and barbiturates enhance the inhibitory action of the GABAA receptor.

==Controversies==
Following a shortage that led a court to delay an execution in California, a company spokesman for Hospira, the sole American manufacturer of the drug, objected to the use of thiopental in lethal injection. &quot;Hospira manufactures this product because it improves or saves lives, and the company markets it solely for use as indicated on the product labeling. The drug is not indicated for capital punishment and Hospira does not support its use in this procedure.&quot; On January 21, 2011, the company announced that it would stop production of sodium thiopental from its plant in Italy, because it could not provide Italian authorities with guarantees that exported doses would not be used in executions. According to a company spokesperson, Italy was the only viable place where it could produce the drug, leaving the US without a supplier.

In October 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confiscated an overseas shipment of thiopental destined for the states of Arizona and Texas. FDA spokesman Jeff Ventura said in a statement, &quot;Courts have concluded that sodium thiopental for the injection in humans is an unapproved drug and may not be imported into the country&quot;.

==Metabolism==
Thiopental rapidly and easily crosses the blood–brain barrier as it is a lipophilic molecule. As with all lipid-soluble anaesthetic drugs, the short duration of action of sodium thiopental is due almost entirely to its redistribution away from central circulation into muscle and fatty tissue, due to its very high lipid–water partition coefficient (approximately 10), leading to sequestration in fatty tissue. Once redistributed, the free fraction in the blood is metabolized in the liver by zero-order kinetics. Sodium thiopental is mainly metabolized to pentobarbital, 5-ethyl-5-(1&#x27;-methyl-3&#x27;-hydroxybutyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid, and 5-ethyl-5-(1&#x27;-methyl-3&#x27;-carboxypropyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid.

==Dosage==
The usual dose range for induction of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6 mg/kg; however, there are many factors that can alter this. Premedication with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or clonidine will reduce requirements due to drug synergy, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, and lean body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone and for that matter any other intravenous anaesthetic are: hypovolemia, burns, azotemia, liver failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.

==Side effects==
As with nearly all anesthetic drugs, thiopental causes cardiovascular and respiratory depression resulting in hypotension, apnea, and airway obstruction. For these reasons, thiopental should only be administered by suitably trained medical personnel, who should give thiopental in an environment equipped to provide (respiratory) support, such as mechanical ventilation. Other side-effects include headache, agitated emergence, prolonged somnolence, and nausea. Intravenous administration of sodium thiopental is followed instantly by an odor and/or taste sensation, sometimes described as being similar to rotting onions, or to garlic. Residual side-effects may last up to 36 hours.

Although each molecule of thiopental contains one sulfur atom, it is not a sulfonamide, and does not show the allergic reactions of sulfa/sulpha drugs.

==Contraindications==
Thiopental should be used with caution in cases of liver disease, Addison&#x27;s disease, myxedema, severe heart disease, severe hypotension, a severe breathing disorder, or a family history of porphyria.

Co-administration of pentoxifylline and thiopental causes death by acute pulmonary edema in rats. This pulmonary edema was not mediated by cardiac failure or by pulmonary hypertension but was due to increased pulmonary vascular permeability.

==History==
Sodium thiopental was discovered in the early 1930s by Ernest H. Volwiler and Donalee L. Tabern, working for Abbott Laboratories. It was first used in human beings on March 8, 1934, by Dr. Ralph M. Waters in an investigation of its properties, which were short-term anesthesia and surprisingly little analgesia. Three months later, Dr. John S. Lundy started a clinical trial of thiopental at the Mayo Clinic at the request of Abbott. Abbott continued to make the drug until 2004, when it spun off its hospital-products division as Hospira.

Thiopental is famously associated with a number of anesthetic deaths in victims of the attack on Pearl Harbor. These deaths, relatively soon after the drug&#x27;s introduction, were said to be due to excessive doses given to shocked trauma patients. However, recent evidence available through freedom of information legislation was reviewed in the &quot;British Journal of Anaesthesia&quot;, which has suggested that this story was grossly exaggerated. Of the 344 wounded that were admitted to the Tripler Army Hospital, only 13 did not survive, and it is unlikely that thiopentone overdose was responsible for more than a few of these.

<text>The Stone Age was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make stone tools with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted for roughly 3.4 million years and ended between 4000 BC and 2000 BC, with the advent of metalworking. It therefore represents nearly 99.3% of human history. 

Though some simple metalworking of malleable metals, particularly the use of gold and copper for purposes of ornamentation, was known in the Stone Age, it is the melting and smelting of copper that marks the end of the Stone Age. In Western Asia, this occurred by about 3000 BC, when bronze became widespread. The term Bronze Age is used to describe the period that followed the Stone Age, as well as to describe cultures that had developed techniques and technologies for working copper alloys (bronze: originally copper and arsenic, later copper and tin) into tools, supplanting stone in many uses.

Stone Age artifacts that have been discovered include tools used by modern humans, by their predecessor species in the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, and possibly by the earlier partly contemporaneous genera &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot;. Bone tools have been discovered that were used during this period as well but these are rarely preserved in the archaeological record. The Stone Age is further subdivided by the types of stone tools in use.

The Stone Age is the first period in the three-age system frequently used in archaeology to divide the timeline of human technological prehistory (especially in Europe and western Asia) into functional periods, with the next two being the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, respectively. The Stone Age is also commonly divided into three distinct periods: the earliest and most primitive being the Paleolithic era; a transitional period with finer tools known as the Mesolithic era; and the final stage known as the Neolithic era. Neolithic peoples were the first to transition away from hunter-gatherer societies into the settled lifestyle of inhabiting towns and villages as agriculture became widespread. In the chronology of prehistory, the Neolithic era usually overlaps with the Chalcolithic (&quot;Copper&quot;) era preceding the Bronze Age.

The Archaeology of the Americas uses different markers to assign five periods which have different dates in different areas; the oldest period is the similarly named Lithic stage.

==Historical significance==

The Stone Age is contemporaneous with the evolution of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, with the possible exception of the early Stone Age, when species prior to &quot;Homo&quot; may have manufactured tools. According to the age and location of the current evidence, the cradle of the genus is the East African Rift System, especially toward the north in Ethiopia, where it is bordered by grasslands. The closest relative among the other living primates, the genus &quot;Pan&quot;, represents a branch that continued on in the deep forest, where the primates evolved. The rift served as a conduit for movement into southern Africa and also north down the Nile into North Africa and through the continuation of the rift in the Levant to the vast grasslands of Asia.

Starting from about 4 million years ago (mya) a single biome established itself from South Africa through the rift, North Africa, and across Asia to modern China. This has been called &quot;transcontinental &#x27;savannahstan recently. Starting in the grasslands of the rift, &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, the predecessor of modern humans, found an ecological niche as a tool-maker and developed a dependence on it, becoming a &quot;tool-equipped savanna dweller&quot;.

==Stone Age in archaeology==

===Beginning of the Stone Age===
The oldest indirect evidence found of stone tool use is fossilised animal bones with tool marks; these are 3.4 million years old and were found in the Lower Awash Valley in Ethiopia. Archaeological discoveries in Kenya in 2015, identifying what may be the oldest evidence of hominin use of tools known to date, have indicated that &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot; (a 3.2 to 3.5-million-year-old Pliocene hominin fossil discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya, in 1999) may have been the earliest tool-users known.

The oldest stone tools were excavated from the site of Lomekwi 3 in West Turkana, northwestern Kenya, and date to 3.3 million years old. Prior to the discovery of these &quot;Lomekwian&quot; tools, the oldest known stone tools had been found at several sites at Gona, Ethiopia, on sediments of the paleo-Awash River, which serve to date them. All the tools come from the Busidama Formation, which lies above a disconformity, or missing layer, which would have been from 2.9 to 2.7 mya. The oldest sites discovered to contain tools are dated to 2.6–2.55 mya. One of the most striking circumstances about these sites is that they are from the Late Pliocene, where prior to their discovery tools were thought to have evolved only in the Pleistocene. Excavators at the locality point out that:

The species that made the Pliocene tools remains unknown. Fragments of &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot;, &quot;Australopithecus aethiopicus&quot;, and &quot;Homo&quot;, possibly &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, have been found in sites near the age of the Gona tools.

In July 2018, scientists reported the discovery in China of the known oldest stone tools outside Africa, estimated at 2.12 million years old.

===End of the Stone Age===
Innovation in the technique of smelting ore is regarded as the end of the Stone Age and the beginning of the Bronze Age. The first highly significant metal manufactured was bronze, an alloy of copper and tin or arsenic, each of which was smelted separately. The transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age was a period during which modern people could smelt copper, but did not yet manufacture bronze, a time known as the Copper Age (or more technically the Chalcolithic or Eneolithic, both meaning &#x27;copper–stone&#x27;). The Chalcolithic by convention is the initial period of the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age.

The transition out of the Stone Age occurred between 6000 and 2500 BC for much of humanity living in North Africa and Eurasia.

The first evidence of human metallurgy dates to between the 6th and 5th millennia BC in the archaeological sites of the Vinča culture, including Majdanpek, Jarmovac, Pločnik, Rudna Glava in modern-day Serbia.

Ötzi the Iceman, a mummy from about 3300 BC, carried with him a copper axe and a flint knife.

In some regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, the Stone Age was followed directly by the Iron Age. The Middle East and Southeast Asian regions progressed past Stone Age technology around 6000 BC. Europe, and the rest of Asia became post-Stone Age societies by about 4000 BC. The proto-Inca cultures of South America continued at a Stone Age level until around 2000 BC, when gold, copper, and silver made their entrance. The peoples of the Americas notably did not develop a widespread behavior of smelting bronze or iron after the Stone Age period, although the technology existed. Stone tool manufacture continued even after the Stone Age ended in a given area. In Europe and North America, millstones were in use until well into the 20th century, and still are in many parts of the world.

===Concept of the Stone Age===
The terms &quot;Stone Age&quot;, &quot;Bronze Age&quot;, and &quot;Iron Age&quot; are not intended to suggest that advancements and time periods in prehistory are only measured by the type of tool material, rather than, for example, social organization, food sources exploited, adaptation to climate, adoption of agriculture, cooking, settlement, and religion. Like pottery, the typology of the stone tools combined with the relative sequence of the types in various regions provide a chronological framework for the evolution of humanity and society. They serve as diagnostics of date, rather than characterizing the people or the society.

Lithic analysis is a major and specialised form of archaeological investigation. It involves the measurement of stone tools to determine their typology, function and technologies involved. It includes the scientific study of the lithic reduction of the raw materials and methods used to make the prehistoric artifacts that are discovered. Much of this study takes place in the laboratory in the presence of various specialists. In experimental archaeology, researchers attempt to create replica tools, to understand how they were made. Flintknappers are craftsmen who use sharp tools to reduce flintstone to flint tool.

In addition to lithic analysis, field prehistorians use a wide range of techniques derived from multiple fields. The work of archaeologists in determining the paleocontext and relative sequence of the layers is supplemented by the efforts of geologic specialists in identifying layers of rock developed or deposited over geologic time; of paleontological specialists in identifying bones and animals; of palynologists in discovering and identifying pollen, spores and plant species; of physicists and chemists in laboratories determining ages of materials by carbon-14, potassium-argon and other methods. The study of the Stone Age has never been limited to stone tools and archaeology, even though they are important forms of evidence. The chief focus of study has always been on the society and the living people who belonged to it.

Useful as it has been, the concept of the Stone Age has its limitations. The date range of this period is ambiguous, disputed, and variable, depending upon the region in question. While it is possible to speak of a general &#x27;Stone Age&#x27; period for the whole of humanity, some groups never developed metal-smelting technology, and so remained in the so-called &#x27;Stone Age&#x27; until they encountered technologically developed cultures. The term was innovated to describe the archaeological cultures of Europe. It may not always be the best in relation to regions such as some parts of the Indies and Oceania, where farmers or hunter-gatherers used stone for tools until European colonisation began.

Archaeologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries CE, who adapted the three-age system to their ideas, hoped to combine cultural anthropology and archaeology in such a way that a specific contemporaneous tribe could be used to illustrate the way of life and beliefs of the people exercising a particular Stone-Age technology. As a description of people living today, the term &quot;Stone Age&quot; is controversial. The Association of Social Anthropologists discourages this use, asserting:To describe any living group as &#x27;primitive&#x27; or &#x27;Stone Age&#x27; inevitably implies that they are living representatives of some earlier stage of human development that the majority of humankind has left behind.

===Three-stage system===
In the 1920s, South African archaeologists organizing the stone tool collections of that country observed that they did not fit the newly detailed Three-Age System. In the words of J. Desmond Clark:

It was early realized that the threefold division of culture into Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages adopted in the nineteenth century for Europe had no validity in Africa outside the Nile valley.

Consequently, they proposed a new system for Africa, the Three-stage System. Clark regarded the Three-age System as valid for North Africa; in sub-Saharan Africa, the Three-stage System was best. In practice, the failure of African archaeologists either to keep this distinction in mind, or to explain which one they mean, contributes to the considerable equivocation already present in the literature. There are in effect two Stone Ages, one part of the Three-age and the other constituting the Three-stage. They refer to one and the same artifacts and the same technologies, but vary by locality and time.

The three-stage system was proposed in 1929 by Astley John Hilary Goodwin, a professional archaeologist, and Clarence van Riet Lowe, a civil engineer and amateur archaeologist, in an article titled &quot;Stone Age Cultures of South Africa&quot; in the journal &quot;Annals of the South African Museum&quot;. By then, the dates of the Early Stone Age, or Paleolithic, and Late Stone Age, or Neolithic (&quot;neo&quot; = new), were fairly solid and were regarded by Goodwin as absolute. He therefore proposed a relative chronology of periods with floating dates, to be called the Earlier and Later Stone Age. The Middle Stone Age would not change its name, but it would not mean Mesolithic.

The duo thus reinvented the Stone Age. In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, iron-working technologies were either invented independently or came across the Sahara from the north (see &quot;iron metallurgy in Africa&quot;). The Neolithic was characterized primarily by herding societies rather than large agricultural societies, and although there was copper metallurgy in Africa as well as bronze smelting, archaeologists do not currently recognize a separate Copper Age or Bronze Age. Moreover, the technologies included in those &#x27;stages&#x27;, as Goodwin called them, were not exactly the same. Since then, the original relative terms have become identified with the technologies of the Paleolithic and Mesolithic, so that they are no longer relative. Moreover, there has been a tendency to drop the comparative degree in favor of the positive: resulting in two sets of Early, Middle and Late Stone Ages of quite different content and chronologies.

By voluntary agreement, archaeologists respect the decisions of the Pan-African Congress on Prehistory, which meets every four years to resolve the archaeological business brought before it. Delegates are actually international; the organization takes its name from the topic. Louis Leakey hosted the first one in Nairobi in 1947. It adopted Goodwin and Lowe&#x27;s 3-stage system at that time, the stages to be called Early, Middle and Later.

===Problem of the transitions===
The problem of the transitions in archaeology is a branch of the general philosophic continuity problem, which examines how discrete objects of any sort that are in any way can be presumed to have a relationship of any sort. In archaeology, the relationship is one of causality. If Period B can be presumed to descend from Period A, there must be a boundary between A and B, the A–B boundary. The problem is in the nature of this boundary. If there is no distinct boundary, then the population of A suddenly stopped using the customs characteristic of A and suddenly started using those of B, an unlikely scenario in the process of evolution. More realistically, a distinct border period, the A/B transition, existed, in which the customs of A were gradually dropped and those of B acquired. If transitions do not exist, then there is no proof of any continuity between A and B.

The Stone Age of Europe is characteristically in deficit of known transitions. The 19th and early 20th-century innovators of the modern three-age system recognized the problem of the initial transition, the &quot;gap&quot; between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Louis Leakey provided something of an answer by proving that man evolved in Africa. The Stone Age must have begun there to be carried repeatedly to Europe by migrant populations. The different phases of the Stone Age thus could appear there without transitions. The burden on African archaeologists became all the greater, because now they must find the missing transitions in Africa. The problem is difficult and ongoing.

After its adoption by the First Pan African Congress in 1947, the Three-Stage Chronology was amended by the Third Congress in 1955 to include a First Intermediate Period between Early and Middle, to encompass the Fauresmith and Sangoan technologies, and the Second Intermediate Period between Middle and Later, to encompass the Magosian technology and others. The chronologic basis for the definition was entirely relative. With the arrival of scientific means of finding an absolute chronology, the two intermediates turned out to be will-of-the-wisps. They were in fact Middle and Lower Paleolithic. Fauresmith is now considered to be a facies of Acheulean, while Sangoan is a facies of Lupemban. Magosian is &quot;an artificial mix of two different periods&quot;.

Once seriously questioned, the intermediates did not wait for the next Pan African Congress two years hence, but were officially rejected in 1965 (again on an advisory basis) by Burg Wartenstein Conference #29, &quot;Systematic Investigation of the African Later Tertiary and Quaternary&quot;, a conference in anthropology held by the Wenner-Gren Foundation, at Burg Wartenstein Castle, which it then owned in Austria, attended by the same scholars that attended the Pan African Congress, including Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey, who was delivering a pilot presentation of her typological analysis of Early Stone Age tools, to be included in her 1971 contribution to &quot;Olduvai Gorge&quot;, &quot;Excavations in Beds I and II, 1960–1963.&quot;

However, although the intermediate periods were gone, the search for the transitions continued.

==Chronology==
In 1859 Jens Jacob Worsaae first proposed a division of the Stone Age into older and younger parts based on his work with Danish kitchen middens that began in 1851. In the subsequent decades this simple distinction developed into the archaeological periods of today. The major subdivisions of the Three-age Stone Age cross two epoch boundaries on the geologic time scale:
* The geologic Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary (highly glaciated climate)
** The Paleolithic period of archaeology
* The geologic Pleistocene–Holocene boundary (modern climate)
** Mesolithic or Epipaleolithic period of archaeology
** Neolithic period of archaeology
The succession of these phases varies enormously from one region (and culture) to another.

===Three-age chronology===

The Paleolithic or Palaeolithic (from Greek: παλαιός, &quot;palaios&quot;, &quot;old&quot;; and λίθος, &quot;lithos&quot;, &quot;stone&quot; lit. &quot;old stone&quot;, coined by archaeologist John Lubbock and published in 1865) is the earliest division of the Stone Age. It covers the greatest portion of humanity&#x27;s time (roughly 99% of &quot;human technological history&quot;, where &quot;human&quot; and &quot;humanity&quot; are interpreted to mean the genus &quot;Homo&quot;), extending from 2.5 or 2.6 million years ago, with the first documented use of stone tools by hominins such as &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, to the end of the Pleistocene around 10,000 BC. The Paleolithic era ended with the Mesolithic, or in areas with an early neolithisation, the Epipaleolithic.

====Lower Paleolithic====

At sites dating from the Lower Paleolithic Period (about 2,500,000 to 200,000 years ago), simple pebble tools have been found in association with the remains of what may have been the earliest human ancestors. A somewhat more sophisticated Lower Paleolithic tradition, known as the Chopper chopping tool industry, is widely distributed in the Eastern Hemisphere. This tradition is thought to have been the work of the hominin species named &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Although no such fossil tools have yet been found, it is believed that &quot;H. erectus&quot; probably made tools of wood and bone as well as stone.
About 700,000 years ago, a new Lower Paleolithic tool, the hand axe, appeared. The earliest European hand axes are assigned to the Abbevillian industry, which developed in northern France in the valley of the Somme River; a later, more refined hand-axe tradition is seen in the Acheulian industry, evidence of which has been found in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Some of the earliest known hand axes were found at Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) in association with remains of &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Alongside the hand-axe tradition, there developed a distinct and very different stone-tool industry, based on flakes of stone: special tools were made from worked (carefully shaped) flakes of flint. In Europe, the Clactonian industry is one example of a flake tradition. The early flake industries probably contributed to the development of the Middle Paleolithic flake tools of the Mousterian industry, which is associated with the remains of Neanderthal man.

=====Oldowan in Africa=====

The earliest documented stone tools have been found in eastern Africa, manufacturers unknown, at the 3.3 million-year-old site of Lomekwi 3 in Kenya. Better known are the later tools belonging to an industry known as Oldowan, after the type site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania.

The tools were formed by knocking pieces off a river pebble, or stones like it, with a hammerstone to obtain large and small pieces with one or more sharp edges. The original stone is called a core; the resultant pieces, flakes. Typically, but not necessarily, small pieces are detached from a larger piece, in which case the larger piece may be called the core and the smaller pieces the flakes. The prevalent usage, however, is to call all the results flakes, which can be confusing. A split in half is called bipolar flaking.

Consequently, the method is often called &quot;core-and-flake&quot;. More recently, the tradition has been called &quot;small flake&quot; since the flakes were small compared to subsequent Acheulean tools.

Another naming scheme is &quot;Pebble Core Technology (PBC)&quot;:

Various refinements in the shape have been called choppers, discoids, polyhedrons, subspheroid, etc. To date no reasons for the variants have been ascertained:

However, they would not have been manufactured for no purpose:

The whole point of their utility is that each is a &quot;sharp-edged rock&quot; in locations where nature has not provided any. There is additional evidence that Oldowan, or Mode 1, tools were used in &quot;percussion technology&quot;; that is, they were designed to be gripped at the blunt end and strike something with the edge, from which use they were given the name of choppers. Modern science has been able to detect mammalian blood cells on Mode 1 tools at Sterkfontein, Member 5 East, in South Africa. As the blood must have come from a fresh kill, the tool users are likely to have done the killing and used the tools for butchering. Plant residues bonded to the silicon of some tools confirm the use to chop plants.

Although the exact species authoring the tools remains unknown, Mode 1 tools in Africa were manufactured and used predominantly by &quot;Homo habilis&quot;. They cannot be said to have developed these tools or to have contributed the tradition to technology. They continued a tradition of yet unknown origin. As chimpanzees sometimes naturally use percussion to extract or prepare food in the wild, and may use either unmodified stones or stones that they have split, creating an Oldowan tool, the tradition may well be far older than its current record.

Towards the end of Oldowan in Africa the new species &quot;Homo erectus&quot; appeared over the range of &quot;Homo habilis&quot;. The earliest &quot;unambiguous&quot; evidence is a whole cranium, KNM-ER 3733 (a find identifier) from Koobi Fora in Kenya, dated to 1.78 mya. An early skull fragment, KNM-ER 2598, dated to 1.9 mya, is considered a good candidate also. Transitions in paleoanthropology are always hard to find, if not impossible, but based on the &quot;long-legged&quot; limb morphology shared by &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; in East Africa, an evolution from one of those two has been suggested.

The most immediate cause of the new adjustments appears to have been an increasing aridity in the region and consequent contraction of parkland savanna, interspersed with trees and groves, in favor of open grassland, dated 1.8–1.7 mya. During that transitional period the percentage of grazers among the fossil species increased from around 15–25% to 45%, dispersing the food supply and requiring a facility among the hunters to travel longer distances comfortably, which &quot;H. erectus&quot; obviously had. The ultimate proof is the &quot;dispersal&quot; of &quot;H. erectus&quot; &quot;across much of Africa and Asia, substantially before the development of the Mode 2 technology and use of fire&quot;. &quot;H. erectus&quot; carried Mode 1 tools over Eurasia.

According to the current evidence (which may change at any time) Mode 1 tools are documented from about 2.6 mya to about 1.5 mya in Africa, and to 0.5 mya outside of it. The genus Homo is known from &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; from 2.3 to 2.0 mya, with the latest habilis being an upper jaw from Koobi Fora, Kenya, from 1.4 mya. &quot;H. erectus&quot; is dated 1.8–0.6 mya. 

According to this chronology Mode 1 was inherited by &quot;Homo&quot; from unknown Hominans, probably &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, who must have continued on with Mode 1 and then with Mode 2 until their extinction no later than 1.1 mya. Meanwhile, living contemporaneously in the same regions &quot;H. habilis&quot; inherited the tools around 2.3 mya. At about 1.9 mya &quot;H. erectus&quot; came on stage and lived contemporaneously with the others. Mode 1 was now being shared by a number of Hominans over the same ranges, presumably subsisting in different niches, but the archaeology is not precise enough to say which.

=====Oldowan out of Africa=====
Tools of the Oldowan tradition first came to archaeological attention in Europe, where, being intrusive and not well defined, compared to the Acheulean, they were puzzling to archaeologists. The mystery would be elucidated by African archaeology at Olduvai, but meanwhile, in the early 20th century, the term &quot;Pre-Acheulean&quot; came into use in climatology. C. E. P. Brooks, a British climatologist working in the United States, used the term to describe a &quot;chalky boulder clay&quot; underlying a layer of gravel at Hoxne, central England, where Acheulean tools had been found. Whether any tools would be found in it and what type was not known. Hugo Obermaier, a contemporary German archaeologist working in Spain, stated:

This uncertainty was clarified by the subsequent excavations at Olduvai; nevertheless, the term is still in use for pre-Acheulean contexts, mainly across Eurasia, that are yet unspecified or uncertain but with the understanding that they are or will turn out to be pebble-tool.

There are ample associations of Mode 2 with &quot;H. erectus&quot; in Eurasia. &quot;H. erectus&quot; – Mode 1 associations are scantier but they do exist, especially in the Far East. One strong piece of evidence prevents the conclusion that only &quot;H. erectus&quot; reached Eurasia: at Yiron, Israel, Mode 1 tools have been found dating to 2.4 mya, about 0.5 my earlier than the known &quot;H. erectus&quot; finds. If the date is correct, either another Hominan preceded &quot;H. erectus&quot; out of Africa or the earliest &quot;H. erectus&quot; has yet to be found.

After the initial appearance at Gona in Ethiopia at 2.7 mya, pebble tools date from 2.0 mya at Sterkfontein, Member 5, South Africa, and from 1.8 mya at El Kherba, Algeria, North Africa. The manufacturers had already left pebble tools at Yiron, Israel, at 2.4 mya, Riwat, Pakistan, at 2.0 mya, and Renzidong, South China, at over 2 mya. The identification of a fossil skull at Mojokerta, Pernung Peninsula on Java, dated to 1.8 mya, as &quot;H. erectus&quot;, suggests that the African finds are not the earliest to be found in Africa, or that, in fact, erectus did not originate in Africa after all but on the plains of Asia. The outcome of the issue waits for more substantial evidence. Erectus was found also at Dmanisi, Georgia, from 1.75 mya in association with pebble tools.

Pebble tools are found the latest first in southern Europe and then in northern Europe. They begin in the open areas of Italy and Spain, the earliest dated to 1.6 mya at Pirro Nord, Italy. The mountains of Italy are rising at a rapid rate in the framework of geologic time; at 1.6 mya they were lower and covered with grassland (as much of the highlands still are). Europe was otherwise mountainous and covered over with dense forest, a formidable terrain for warm-weather savanna dwellers. Similarly there is no evidence that the Mediterranean was passable at Gibraltar or anywhere else to &quot;H. erectus&quot; or earlier hominins. They might have reached Italy and Spain along the coasts.

In northern Europe, pebble tools are found earliest at Happisburgh, United Kingdom, from 0.8 mya. The last traces are from Kent&#x27;s Cavern, dated 0.5 mya. By that time &quot;H. erectus&quot; is regarded as having been extinct; however, a more modern version apparently had evolved, &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;, who must have inherited the tools. He also explains the last of the Acheulean in Germany at 0.4 mya.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, archaeologists worked on the assumption that a succession of hominins and cultures prevailed, that one replaced another. Today the presence of multiple hominins living contemporaneously near each other for long periods is accepted as proven true; moreover, by the time the previously assumed &quot;earliest&quot; culture arrived in northern Europe, the rest of Africa and Eurasia had progressed to the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic, so that across the earth all three were for a time contemporaneous. In any given region there was a progression from Oldowan to Acheulean, Lower to Upper, no doubt.

=====Acheulean in Africa=====

The end of Oldowan in Africa was brought on by the appearance of Acheulean, or Mode 2, stone tools. The earliest known instances are in the 1.7–1.6 mya layer at Kokiselei, West Turkana, Kenya. At Sterkfontein, South Africa, they are in Member 5 West, 1.7–1.4 mya. The 1.7 is a fairly certain, fairly standard date. Mode 2 is often found in association with &quot;H. erectus&quot;. It makes sense that the most advanced tools should have been innovated by the most advanced hominin; consequently, they are typically given credit for the innovation.

A Mode 2 tool is a biface consisting of two concave surfaces intersecting to form a cutting edge all the way around, except in the case of tools intended to feature a point. More work and planning go into the manufacture of a Mode 2 tool. The manufacturer hits a slab off a larger rock to use as a blank. Then large flakes are struck off the blank and worked into bifaces by hard-hammer percussion on an anvil stone. Finally the edge is retouched: small flakes are hit off with a bone or wood soft hammer to sharpen or resharpen it. The core can be either the blank or another flake. Blanks are ported for manufacturing supply in places where nature has provided no suitable stone.

Although most Mode 2 tools are easily distinguished from Mode 1, there is a close similarity of some Oldowan and some Acheulean, which can lead to confusion. Some Oldowan tools are more carefully prepared to form a more regular edge. One distinguishing criterion is the size of the flakes. In contrast to the Oldowan &quot;small flake&quot; tradition, Acheulean is &quot;large flake&quot;: &quot;The primary technological distinction remaining between Oldowan and the Acheulean is the preference for large flakes (&gt;10 cm) as blanks for making large cutting tools (handaxes and cleavers) in the Acheulean.&quot; &quot;Large Cutting Tool&quot; (LCT) has become part of the standard terminology as well.

In North Africa, the presence of Mode 2 remains a mystery, as the oldest finds are from Thomas Quarry in Morocco at 0.9 mya. Archaeological attention, however, shifts to the Jordan Rift Valley, an extension of the East African Rift Valley (the east bank of the Jordan is slowly sliding northward as East Africa is thrust away from Africa). Evidence of use of the Nile Valley is in deficit, but Hominans could easily have reached the palaeo-Jordan River from Ethiopia along the shores of the Red Sea, one side or the other. A crossing would not have been necessary, but it is more likely there than over a theoretical but unproven land bridge through either Gibraltar or Sicily.

Meanwhile, Acheulean went on in Africa past the 1.0 mya mark and also past the extinction of &quot;H. erectus&quot; there. The last Acheulean in East Africa is at Olorgesailie, Kenya, dated to about 0.9 mya. Its owner was still &quot;H. erectus&quot;, but in South Africa, Acheulean at Elandsfontein, 1.0–0.6 mya, is associated with Saldanha man, classified as &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, a more advanced, but not yet modern, descendant most likely of &quot;H. erectus&quot;. The Thoman Quarry Hominans in Morocco similarly are most likely Homo rhodesiensis, in the same evolutionary status as &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;.
=====Acheulean out of Africa=====
Mode 2 is first known out of Africa at &#x27;Ubeidiya, Israel, a site now on the Jordan River, then frequented over the long term (hundreds of thousands of years) by Homo on the shore of a variable-level palaeo-lake, long since vanished. The geology was created by successive &quot;transgression and regression&quot; of the lake resulting in four cycles of layers. The tools are located in the first two, Cycles Li (Limnic Inferior) and Fi (Fluviatile Inferior), but mostly in Fi. The cycles represent different ecologies and therefore different cross-sections of fauna, which makes it possible to date them. They appear to be the same faunal assemblages as the Ferenta Faunal Unit in Italy, known from excavations at Selvella and Pieterfitta, dated to 1.6–1.2 mya.

At &#x27;Ubeidiya the marks on the bones of the animal species found there indicate that the manufacturers of the tools butchered the kills of large predators, an activity that has been termed &quot;scavenging&quot;. There are no living floors, nor did they process bones to obtain the marrow. These activities cannot be understood therefore as the only or even the typical economic activity of Hominans. Their interests were selective: they were primarily harvesting the meat of Cervids, which is estimated to have been available without spoiling for up to four days after the kill.

The majority of the animals at the site were of &quot;Palaearctic biogeographic origin&quot;. However, these overlapped in range on 30–60% of &quot;African biogeographic origin&quot;. The biome was Mediterranean, not savanna. The animals were not passing through; there was simply an overlap of normal ranges. Of the Hominans, &quot;H. erectus&quot; left several cranial fragments. Teeth of undetermined species may have been &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. The tools are classified as &quot;Lower Acheulean&quot; and &quot;Developed Oldowan&quot;. The latter is a disputed classification created by Mary Leakey to describe an Acheulean-like tradition in Bed II at Olduvai. It is dated 1.53–1.27 mya. The date of the tools therefore probably does not exceed 1.5 mya; 1.4 is often given as a date. This chronology, which is definitely later than in Kenya, supports the &quot;out of Africa&quot; hypothesis for Acheulean, if not for the Hominans.

From Southwest Asia, as the Levant is now called, the Acheulean extended itself more slowly eastward, arriving at Isampur, India, about 1.2 mya. It does not appear in China and Korea until after 1mya and not at all in Indonesia. There is a discernible boundary marking the furthest extent of the Acheulean eastward before 1 mya, called the Movius Line, after its proposer, Hallam L. Movius. On the east side of the line the small flake tradition continues, but the tools are additionally worked Mode 1, with flaking down the sides. In Athirampakkam at Chennai in Tamil Nadu the Acheulean age started at 1.51 mya and it is also prior than North India and Europe.

The cause of the Movius Line remains speculative, whether it represents a real change in technology or a limitation of archeology, but after 1 mya evidence not available to Movius indicates the prevalence of Acheulean. For example, the Acheulean site at Bose, China, is dated 0.803±3K mya. The authors of this chronologically later East Asian Acheulean remain unknown, as does whether it evolved in the region or was brought in.

There is no named boundary line between Mode 1 and Mode 2 on the west; nevertheless, Mode 2 is equally late in Europe as it is in the Far East. The earliest comes from a rock shelter at Estrecho de Quípar in Spain, dated to greater than 0.9 mya. Teeth from an undetermined Hominan were found there also. The last Mode 2 in Southern Europe is from a deposit at Fontana Ranuccio near Anagni in Italy dated to 0.45 mya, which is generally linked to &quot;Homo cepranensis&quot;, a &quot;late variant of &quot;H. erectus&quot;&quot;, a fragment of whose skull was found at Ceprano nearby, dated 0.46 mya.

====Middle Paleolithic====

This period is best known as the era during which the Neanderthals lived in Europe and the Near East (c. 300,000–28,000 years ago). Their technology is mainly the Mousterian, but Neanderthal physical characteristics have been found also in ambiguous association with the more recent Châtelperronian archeological culture in Western Europe and several local industries like the Szeletian in Eastern Europe/Eurasia. There is no evidence for Neanderthals in Africa, Australia or the Americas.

Neanderthals nursed their elderly and practised ritual burial indicating an organised society. The earliest evidence (Mungo Man) of settlement in Australia dates to around 40,000 years ago when modern humans likely crossed from Asia by island-hopping. Evidence for symbolic behavior such as body ornamentation and burial is ambiguous for the Middle Paleolithic and still subject to debate. The Bhimbetka rock shelters exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India, some of which are approximately 30,000 years old.

====Upper Paleolithic====

From 50,000 to 10,000 years ago in Europe, the Upper Paleolithic ends with the end of the Pleistocene and onset of the Holocene era (the end of the Last Glacial Period). Modern humans spread out further across the Earth during the period known as the Upper Paleolithic.

The Upper Paleolithic is marked by a relatively rapid succession of often complex stone artifact technologies and a large increase in the creation of art and personal ornaments. During period between 35 and 10 kya evolved: from 38 to 30 kya Châtelperronian, 40–28 Aurignacian, 28–22 Gravettian, 22–17 Solutrean, and 18–10 Magdalenian. All of these industries except the Châtelperronian are associated with anatomically modern humans. Authorship of the Châtelperronian is still the subject of much debate.

Most scholars date the arrival of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, with a possible range of up to 125,000 years ago. The earliest anatomically modern human remains found in Australia (and outside of Africa) are those of Mungo Man; they have been dated at 42,000 years old.

The Americas were colonised via the Bering land bridge which was exposed during this period by lower sea levels. These people are called the Paleo-Indians, and the earliest accepted dates are those of the Clovis culture sites, some 13,500 years ago. Globally, societies were hunter-gatherers but evidence of regional identities begins to appear in the wide variety of stone tool types being developed to suit very different environments.

====Epipaleolithic/Mesolithic====

The period starting from the end of the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, to around 6,000 years ago was characterized by rising sea levels and a need to adapt to a changing environment and find new food sources. The development of Mode 5 (microlith) tools began in response to these changes. They were derived from the previous Paleolithic tools, hence the term Epipaleolithic, or were intermediate between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic, hence the term Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), used for parts of Eurasia, but not outside it. The choice of a word depends on exact circumstances and the inclination of the archaeologists excavating the site. Microliths were used in the manufacture of more efficient composite tools, resulting in an intensification of hunting and fishing and with increasing social activity the development of more complex settlements, such as Lepenski Vir. Domestication of the dog as a hunting companion probably dates to this period.

The earliest known battle occurred during the Mesolithic period at a site in Egypt known as Cemetery 117.

====Neolithic====


The Neolithic, or New Stone Age, was approximately characterized by the adoption of agriculture. The shift from food gathering to food producing, in itself one of the most revolutionary changes in human history, was accompanied by the so-called Neolithic Revolution: the development of pottery, polished stone tools, and construction of more complex, larger settlements such as Göbekli Tepe and Çatalhöyük. Some of these features began in certain localities even earlier, in the transitional Mesolithic. The first Neolithic cultures started around 7000 BC in the fertile crescent and spread concentrically to other areas of the world; however, the Near East was probably not the only nucleus of agriculture, the cultivation of maize in Meso-America and of rice in the Far East being others.

Due to the increased need to harvest and process plants, ground stone and polished stone artifacts became much more widespread, including tools for grinding, cutting, and chopping. Skara Brae, located in Orkney, Scotland, is one of Europe&#x27;s best examples of a Neolithic village. The community contains stone beds, shelves and even an indoor toilet linked to a stream. The first large-scale constructions were built, including settlement towers and walls, e.g., Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) and ceremonial sites, e.g. Stonehenge. The Ġgantija temples of Gozo in the Maltese archipelago are the oldest surviving free standing structures in the world, erected –2500 BC. The earliest evidence for established trade exists in the Neolithic with newly settled people importing exotic goods over distances of many hundreds of miles.

These facts show that there were sufficient resources and co-operation to enable large groups to work on these projects. To what extent this was a basis for the development of elites and social hierarchies is a matter of ongoing debate. Although some late Neolithic societies formed complex stratified chiefdoms similar to Polynesian societies such as the Ancient Hawaiians, based on the societies of modern tribesmen at an equivalent technological level, most Neolithic societies were relatively simple and egalitarian. A comparison of art in the two ages leads some theorists to conclude that Neolithic cultures were noticeably more hierarchical than the Paleolithic cultures that preceded them.

===African chronology===
====Early Stone Age (ESA)====

The Early Stone Age in Africa is not to be identified with &quot;Old Stone Age&quot;, a translation of Paleolithic, or with Paleolithic, or with the &quot;Earlier Stone Age&quot; that originally meant what became the Paleolithic and Mesolithic. In the initial decades of its definition by the Pan-African Congress of Prehistory, it was parallel in Africa to the Upper and Middle Paleolithic. However, since then Radiocarbon dating has shown that the Middle Stone Age is in fact contemporaneous with the Middle Paleolithic. The Early Stone Age therefore is contemporaneous with the Lower Paleolithic and happens to include the same main technologies, Oldowan and Acheulean, which produced Mode 1 and Mode 2 stone tools respectively. A distinct regional term is warranted, however, by the location and chronology of the sites and the exact typology.

====Middle Stone Age (MSA)====

The Middle Stone Age was a period of African prehistory between Early Stone Age and Late Stone Age. It began around 300,000 years ago and ended around 50,000 years ago. It is considered as an equivalent of European Middle Paleolithic. It is associated with anatomically modern or almost modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Early physical evidence comes from Omo and Herto, both in Ethiopia and dated respectively at c. 195 ka and at c. 160 ka.

====Later Stone Age (LSA)====

The Later Stone Age (LSA, sometimes also called the Late Stone Age) refers to a period in African prehistory. Its beginnings are roughly contemporaneous with the European Upper Paleolithic. It lasts until historical times and this includes cultures corresponding to Mesolithic and Neolithic in other regions.

==Material culture==
===Tools===
Stone tools were made from a variety of stones. For example, flint and chert were shaped (or &quot;chipped&quot;) for use as cutting tools and weapons, while basalt and sandstone were used for ground stone tools, such as quern-stones. Wood, bone, shell, antler (deer) and other materials were widely used, as well. During the most recent part of the period, sediments (such as clay) were used to make pottery. Agriculture was developed and certain animals were domesticated as well.

Some species of non-primates are able to use stone tools, such as the sea otter, which breaks abalone shells with them. Primates can both use and manufacture stone tools. This combination of abilities is more marked in apes and humans, but only humans, or more generally hominins, depend on tool use for survival. The key anatomical and behavioral features required for tool manufacture, which are possessed only by hominins, are the larger thumb and the ability to hold by means of an assortment of grips.

===Food and drink===

Food sources of the Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers were wild plants and animals harvested from the environment. They liked animal organ meats, including the livers, kidneys and brains. Large seeded legumes were part of the human diet long before the agricultural revolution, as is evident from archaeobotanical finds from the Mousterian layers of Kebara Cave, in Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/j.jas.2004.11.006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, recent evidence indicates that humans processed and consumed wild cereal grains as far back as 23,000 years ago in the Upper Paleolithic.

Near the end of the Wisconsin glaciation, 15,000 to 9,000 years ago, mass extinction of Megafauna such as the woolly mammoth occurred in Asia, Europe, North America and Australia. This was the first Holocene extinction event. It possibly forced modification in the dietary habits of the humans of that age and with the emergence of agricultural practices, plant-based foods also became a regular part of the diet. A number of factors have been suggested for the extinction: certainly over-hunting, but also deforestation and climate change. The net effect was to fragment the vast ranges required by the large animals and extinguish them piecemeal in each fragment.

===Shelter and habitat===
Around 2 million years ago, &quot;Homo habilis&quot; is believed to have constructed the first man-made structure in East Africa, consisting of simple arrangements of stones to hold branches of trees in position. A similar stone circular arrangement believed to be around 380,000 years old was discovered at Terra Amata, near Nice, France. (Concerns about the dating have been raised: see Terra Amata.) Several human habitats dating back to the Stone Age have been discovered around the globe, including:
* A tent-like structure inside a cave near the Grotte du Lazaret, Nice, France.
* A structure with a roof supported with timber, discovered in Dolní Věstonice, the Czech Republic, dates to around 23,000 BC. The walls were made of packed clay blocks and stones.
* Many huts made of mammoth bones have been found in East-Central Europe and Siberia. The people who made these huts were expert mammoth hunters. Examples have been found along the Dniepr river valley of Ukraine, including near Chernihiv, in Moravia, Czech Republic and in southern Poland.
* An animal hide tent dated to around 15000 to 10000 BC, in the Magdalenian, was discovered at Plateau Parain, France.

===Art===
Prehistoric art is visible in the artifacts. Prehistoric music is inferred from found instruments, while parietal art can be found on rocks of any kind. The latter are petroglyphs and rock paintings. The art may or may not have had a religious function.

====Petroglyphs====

Petroglyphs appeared in the Neolithic. A Petroglyph is an intaglio abstract or symbolic image engraved on natural stone by various methods, usually by prehistoric peoples. They were a dominant form of pre-writing symbols. Petroglyphs have been discovered in different parts of the world, including Australia (Sydney rock engravings), Asia (Bhimbetka, India), North America (Death Valley National Park), South America (Cumbe Mayo, Peru), and Europe (Finnmark, Norway).

====Rock paintings====

In paleolithic times, mostly animals were painted, in theory ones that were used as food or represented strength, such as the rhinoceros or large cats (as in the Chauvet Cave). Signs such as dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and half-human/half-animal figures. The Cave of Chauvet in the Ardèche department, France, contains the most important cave paintings of the paleolithic era, dating from about 36,000 BC. The Altamira cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, bisons. The hall of bulls in Lascaux, Dordogne, France, dates from about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.

The meaning of many of these paintings remains unknown. They may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs that suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as calendar or almanac use, but the evidence remains interpretative.

Some scenes of the Mesolithic, however, can be typed and therefore, judging from their various modifications, are fairly clear. One of these is the battle scene between organized bands of archers. For example, &quot;the marching warriors&quot;, a rock painting at Cingle de la Mola, Castellón in Spain, dated to about 7,000–4,000 BC, depicts about 50 bowmen in two groups marching or running in step toward each other, each man carrying a bow in one hand and a fistful of arrows in the other. A file of five men leads one band, one of whom is a figure with a &quot;high crowned hat&quot;.

In other scenes elsewhere, the men wear head-dresses and knee ornaments but otherwise fight nude. Some scenes depict the dead and wounded, bristling with arrows. One is reminded of Ötzi the Iceman, a Copper Age mummy revealed by an Alpine melting glacier, who collapsed from loss of blood due to an arrow wound in the back.

===Stone Age rituals and beliefs===

Modern studies and the in-depth analysis of finds dating from the Stone Age indicate certain rituals and beliefs of the people in those prehistoric times. It is now believed that activities of the Stone Age humans went beyond the immediate requirements of procuring food, body coverings, and shelters. Specific rites relating to death and burial were practiced, though certainly differing in style and execution between cultures. Megalithic tombs, multichambered, and dolmens, single-chambered, were graves with a huge stone slab stacked over other similarly large stone slabs; they have been discovered all across Europe and Asia and were built in the Neolithic and the Bronze Age.

==Modern popular culture==
The image of the caveman is commonly associated with the Stone Age. For example, a 2003 documentary series showing the evolution of humans through the Stone Age was called &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot;, but only the last programme showed humans living in caves. While the idea that human beings and dinosaurs coexisted is sometimes portrayed in popular culture in cartoons, films and computer games, such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; and &quot;Chuck Rock&quot;, the notion of hominids and non-avian dinosaurs co-existing is not supported by any scientific evidence.

Other depictions of the Stone Age include the best-selling &quot;Earth&#x27;s Children&quot; series of books by Jean M. Auel, which are set in the Paleolithic and are loosely based on archaeological and anthropological findings.

The 1981 film &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; by Jean-Jacques Annaud tells the story of a group of early homo sapiens searching for their lost fire. A 21st-century series, &quot;Chronicles of Ancient Darkness&quot; by Michelle Paver tells of two New Stone Age children fighting to fulfil a prophecy and save their clan.

<doc id="29222" wikidata="Q337325" url="?curid=29222" title="Sam Loyd">
<text>Samuel Loyd (January 30, 1841 – April 10, 1911) was an American chess player, chess composer, puzzle author, and recreational mathematician. Loyd was born in Philadelphia but raised in New York City.

As a chess composer, he authored a number of chess problems, often with interesting themes. At his peak, Loyd was one of the best chess players in the US, and he was ranked 15th in the world, according to chessmetrics.com.

He played in the strong Paris 1867 chess tournament (won by Ignatz von Kolisch) with little success, placing near the bottom of the field.

Following his death, his book &quot;Cyclopedia of 5000 Puzzles&quot; was published (1914) by his son, Samuel Loyd Jr. His son, named after his father, dropped the &quot;Jr&quot; from his name and started publishing reprints of his father&#x27;s puzzles.
Loyd (senior) was inducted into the US Chess Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Reputation==
Loyd is widely acknowledged as one of America&#x27;s great puzzle writers and popularizers, often mentioned as &quot;the greatest.&quot; Martin Gardner featured Loyd in his August 1957 Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; and called him &quot;America&#x27;s greatest puzzler&quot;. In 1898, &quot;The Strand&quot; dubbed him &quot;the prince of puzzlers&quot;. As a chess problemist, his composing style is distinguished by wit and humour.

He is also known for lies and self-promotion, however, and he has been criticized on these grounds—Martin Gardner&#x27;s assessment continues &quot;but also obviously a hustler&quot;. Canadian puzzler Mel Stover called Loyd &quot;an old reprobate&quot;, and Matthew Costello called him &quot;puzzledom&#x27;s greatest celebrity... popularizer, genius&quot;, but also a &quot;huckster&quot; and &quot;fast-talking snake oil salesman&quot;.

He collaborated with puzzler Henry Dudeney for a while, but Dudeney broke off the correspondence and accused Loyd of stealing his puzzles and publishing them under his own name. Dudeney despised Loyd so intensely that he equated him with the devil.

Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented the fifteen tiles in the box and one space puzzle. This is false, as Loyd had nothing to do with the invention or popularity of the puzzle, and the craze was in the early 1880s, not the early 1870s. The craze had ended by July 1880 and Loyd&#x27;s first article on the subject was not published until 1896. Loyd first claimed in 1891 that he had invented the puzzle, and he continued to do so until his death. The actual inventor was Noyes Chapman, who applied for a patent in March 1880.

An enthusiast of Tangram puzzles, Loyd popularized them with &quot;The Eighth Book Of Tan&quot;, a book of seven hundred unique Tangram designs and a fanciful history of the origin of the Tangram, claiming that the puzzle was invented 4,000 years ago by a god named Tan. This was presented as true and has been described as &quot;Sam Loyd&#x27;s Most Successful Hoax&quot;.

==Chess problems==
===Excelsior problem===
One of his best-known chess problems is the following, called &quot;Excelsior&quot; by Loyd after the poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. White is to move and checkmate Black in five moves against any defense:

Loyd bet a friend that he could not pick a piece that &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; give mate in the main line, and when it was published in 1861 it was with the stipulation that White mates with &quot;the least likely piece or pawn&quot;.
===Steinitz Gambit problem===
One of the most famous chess problems by Loyd. He wrote on this problem: &quot;The originality of the problem is due to the White King being placed in absolute safety, and yet coming out on a reckless career, with no immediate threat and in the face of innumerable checks.&quot;
===Charles XII problem===

This problem was originally published in 1859. The story involves a chess incident during the siege of Charles XII of Sweden by the Turks at Bender in 1713. &quot;Charles beguiled this period by means of drills and chess, and used frequently to play with his minister, Christian Albert Grosthusen, some of the contests being mentioned by Voltaire. One day while so engaged, the game had been played to this stage, and Charles (White) had just announced checkmate in three.&quot;
:1. Rxg3 Bxg3
:2. Nf3 Bxh2
:3. g4

&quot;Scarcely had he uttered the words, when a (Turkish) bullet, shattering the window, dashed the White knight off of the board in fragments. Grothusen started violently, but Charles, with utmost coolness, begged him to put back the other knight and work out the mate, observing that it was pretty enough. But another glance at the board made Charles smile. We do not need the knight. I can give it to you and still mate in four!&quot; 
:1. hxg3 Be3
:2. Rg4 Bg5
:3. Rh4+ Bxh4
:4. g4#

Who would believe it, he had scarcely spoken when another bullet flew across the room, and the pawn at h2 shared the fate of the knight. Grothusen turned pale. &quot;You have our good friends the Turks with you,&quot; said the king unconcerned, &quot;it can scarcely be expected that I should contend against such odds; but let me see if I can dispense with that pawn. I have it!&quot; he shouted with a laugh, &quot;I have great pleasure in informing you that there is undoubtedly a mate in 5.&quot; 
:1. Rb7 Be3
:2. Rb1 Bg5
:3. Rh1+ Bh4
:4. Rh2 gxh2
:5. g4#

In 1900, Friedrich Amelung pointed out that in the original position, if the first bullet had struck the rook instead of the knight, Charles would still have a mate in six.
:1. Nf3 Be1
:2. Nxe1 Kh4
:3. h3 Kh5
:4. Nd3 Kh4
:5. Nf4 h5
:6. Ng6#

In 2003, ChessBase posted a fifth variation, attributed to Brian Stewart. After the first bullet took out the knight, if the second had removed the g-pawn rather than the h-pawn, Charles would be able to mate in ten.
:1. hxg3 Be1
:2. Rg4 Bxg3
:3. Rxg3 Kh4
:4. Kf4 h5
:5. Rg2 Kh3
:6. Kf3 h4
:7. Rg4 Kh2
:8. Rxh4+ Kg1
:9. Rh3 Kf1
:10. Rh1#
==Puzzles==
===Trick Donkeys problem===

One of Loyd&#x27;s notable puzzles was the &quot;Trick Donkeys&quot;. It was based on a similar puzzle involving dogs published in 1857. In the problem, the solver must cut the drawing along the dotted lines and rearrange the three pieces so that the riders appear to be riding the donkeys.

===Vanishing puzzles===
A vanishing puzzle is a mechanical optical illusion showing different numbers of a certain object when parts of the puzzle are moved around.

Loyd patented rotary vanishing puzzles in 1896 and published versions named &quot;Get Off the Earth&quot;, &quot;Teddy and the Lion&quot; and &quot;The Disappearing Bicyclist&quot; (pictured). Each had a circular card connected to a cardboard backdrop with a pin, letting it rotate. In &quot;the Disappearing Bicyclist&quot;, when the disc is rotated such that the arrow points to A, 13 boys can be seen. When rotated so that the arrow points to B, only 12 boys appear.

====Vanishing area puzzle====

A square with a side length of 8 units (&quot;chessboard&quot;) is dissected into four pieces, which can be assembled into a 5x13 rectangle. Since the area of the square is 64 units but the area of the rectangle is 65 units, this seems paradoxical at first. However, it is just an optical illusion as the pieces don&#x27;t fit exactly to form a rectangle, but leave a small barely visible gap along the diagonal. This puzzle is also known as the Chessboard paradox or paradox of Loyd and Schlömilch.

===Back from the Klondike===
This is one of Sam Loyd&#x27;s most famous puzzles, first printed in the &quot;New York Journal and Advertiser&quot;, April 24, 1898 (as far as available evidence indicates). Loyd&#x27;s original instructions were to: Start from that heart in the center and go three steps in a straight line in any one of the eight directions, north, south, east or west, or on the bias, as the ladies say, northeast, northwest, southeast or southwest. When you have gone three steps in a straight line, you will reach a square with a number on it, which indicates the second day&#x27;s journey, as many steps as it tells, in a straight line in any of the eight directions. From this new point when reached, march on again according to the number indicated, and continue on, following the requirements of the numbers reached, until you come upon a square with a number which will carry you just one step beyond the border, when you are supposed to be out of the woods and can holler all you want, as you will have solved the puzzle.

<doc id="29228" wikidata="Q39315" url="?curid=29228" title="Shiba Inu">
<text>The is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original dog breeds native to Japan. Its name literally translates to &quot;brushwood dog&quot;, as it is used to flush game.

A small, alert, and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting. It looks similar to other Japanese dog breeds such as the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct bloodline, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.

==Appearance==
The Shiba&#x27;s body frame is compact with well-developed muscles. It is double-coated, with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick. Fur is short and even on the foxlike face, ears, and legs. Guard hairs stand off the body and are about long at the withers. The purpose of the guard hairs is to protect their underlying skin and to repel rain or snow. The tail hair is slightly longer and stands open in a brush. Their tails are a defining characteristic and make them stand apart from other dog breeds.

The cream color is considered a &quot;major fault&quot; by both the Japan Kennel Club and American Kennel Club. It is not intentionally bred in a show dog, as the required markings known as are not visible; &quot;Urajiro&quot; literally translates to &quot;underside white&quot;. Conversely, a white (cream) coat is perfectly acceptable according to the British Kennel Club breed standard.

The &quot;urajiro&quot; (cream to white ventral color) is required in the following areas on all coat colors: on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs, on the abdomen, around the vent and the ventral side of the tail. On reds: commonly on the throat, fore chest, and chest. On blacks and sesames: commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the fore chest.

==Temperament==

The Shiba Inu is considered an alert, affectionate, and independent breed with high intelligence but also somewhat stubborn and strong-willed.

The terms , , and have subtle interpretations that have been the subject of much commentary.

A survey of experts classified the Shiba Inu as having &quot;high aggression, high reactivity and medium trainability&quot;. A possible explanation for this and other observed behaviour is that the Shiba Inu is more closely related to the wolf than domesticated dogs from other countries. Due to the high intelligence of the breed it requires a lot of exercise and stimulation. Insufficient exercise can lead to anxiety which leads to undesirable behaviours, notably the &quot;shiba scream&quot;.

A survey in Japan found the Shiba Inu to be more likely to engage in destructive behaviour, refusal to walk whilst on a lead, engage in mounting behaviour, and tail chasing. The Shiba Inu was also found to be less likely to bark at noises whilst inside the house.

==History==

The Shiba Inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. Dogs with a similar appearance to the Shiba Inu were represented in &quot;dogū&quot; made during the prehistoric Jōmon period of Japanese history.

The Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, such as birds and rabbits. Shiba lived in the mountainous areas of the Chūbu region. During the Meiji Restoration, western dog breeds were imported and crosses between these and native Japanese breeds became popular. From 1912 to 1926, almost no pure Shiba remained. From around 1928, hunters and intellectuals began to show interest in the protection of the remaining pure Shiba.

Despite efforts to preserve the breed, the Shiba nearly became extinct during World War II due to wartime food shortage, as well as outbreaks of distemper in the 1950s and 60s and the , which discouraged preservation efforts. All subsequent dogs were bred from the only three surviving bloodlines. These bloodlines were the Shinshu Shiba from Nagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from the former Mino Province in the south of present-day Gifu Prefecture, and the San&#x27;in Shiba from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures.

The Shinshu Shibas possessed a solid undercoat, with a dense layer of guard hairs, and were small and red in color. The Mino Shibas tended to have thick, prick ears, and possessed a sickle tail, rather than the common curled tail found on most modern Shibas. The San&#x27;in Shibas were larger than most modern shibas, and tended to be black, without the common tan and white accents found on modern black-and-tan shibas.

When the study of Japanese dogs was formalized in the early and mid-20th century, these three strains were combined into one overall breed, the Shiba Inu. The first Japanese breed standard for the Shiba, the Nippo Standard, was published in 1934. In December 1936, the Shiba Inu was recognized as a Natural Monument of Japan through the Cultural Properties Act, largely due to the efforts of Nippo (Nihon Ken Hozonkai), the Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog.

In 1954, an armed service family brought the first Shiba Inu to the United States. In 1979, the first recorded litter was born in the United States. The Shiba was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1992 and added to the AKC Non-Sporting Group in 1993. It is now primarily kept as a pet both in Japan and abroad. According to the American Kennel Club, the Shiba Inu is the number one companion dog in Japan. In the United States the breed ranked 44th place in registrations for 2016 with the American Kennel Club.

==Health==

A study in Japan on patella luxation in small breeds found the Shiba Inu to have the second highest rate of the condition, with 35% of the Shiba Inus surveyed being affected. Three genes belonging to the breed were associated with glaucoma were found in an analysis of DNA sequencing. Another study from Japan reviewing cases of dogs presented for ophthalmologic examination found the Shiba Inu to make up 33% of all glaucoma cases whilst only making up 2.7% of the total population used in the study. Pyometra, a uterine infection of intact bitches, is slightly more common in the Shiba Inu. The Shiba Inu is predisposed to canine atopic dermatitis. An auto-immune disease common in Akitas Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome is known to occur in the Shiba Inu.

===Lifespan===
A review of cemetery data in Japan found that the Shiba Inu had a life expectancy of 15 and a half years, greater than any other breed. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14.6 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

==Sanin Shiba Inu==
The Sanin Shiba Inu is a variety of Shiba Inu. It comes from the Inaba Inu of Tottori Prefecture and the Sekishu Inu of Shimane Prefecture, and both are endangered due to the increase of western dogs. In the early Showa period, Masumi Ozaki, a former landowner in Tottori prefecture, started preservation breeding to prevent the loss of local breeds.

However, as World War II grew more intense, the breeding projects became difficult to maintain. Due to the use of dogs for fur by the military, the number of dogs decreased from 50 to 20. In 1947, the two breeds were bred together to create the foundation stock of the Sanin Shiba Inu. The numbers were still low but the dogs were protected by the Ozaki family, who carried on the preservation activities.

Despite the end of the war, more threats to the breeds emerged in the 1950s and 60s, two outbreaks of distemper occurred in Tottori prefecture, killing many dogs. In addition, the Great Tottori Fire discouraged preservation efforts even more.

== In popular culture ==
Despite not being a popular dog breed outside of Japan, the Shiba Inu has become popular on the Internet. Doge is an Internet meme from originally from 2013 characterized by Kabosu, a Shiba Inu, and broken English. A cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, is named after this meme and its logo bears an image of Kabosu. Another cryptocurrency is also named Shiba Inu after the breed. Another Shiba Inu dog that went viral was a dog known as &#x27;Cheems&#x27;. He went viral during the COVID-19 pandemic and gained worldwide attention. Cheems died during cancer surgery on August 18, 2023 at the age of 12½ years.

The breed is often referred to as &quot;Shibe&quot; in memes. According to Jamie Cohen, an assistant professor of media studies at Queens College of the City University of New York, the Shiba Inu breed has had a significant presence in online culture since at least 2010.

<text>A slot machine, fruit machine (British English), poker machine or pokies (Australian English and New Zealand English) is a gambling machine that creates a game of chance for its customers.

A slot machine&#x27;s standard layout features a screen displaying three or more reels that &quot;spin&quot; when the game is activated. Some modern slot machines still include a lever as a skeuomorphic design trait to trigger play. However, the mechanical operations of early machines have been superseded by random number generators, and most are now operated using buttons and touchscreens.

Slot machines include one or more currency detectors that validate the form of payment, whether coin, banknote, voucher, or token. The machine pays out according to the pattern of symbols displayed when the reels stop &quot;spinning&quot;. Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and contribute about 70% of the average U.S. casino&#x27;s income.

Digital technology has resulted in variations in the original slot machine concept. As the player is essentially playing a video game, manufacturers can offer more interactive elements, such as advanced bonus rounds and more varied video graphics.

==Terms and their sources==
The &quot;slot machine&quot; term derives from the slots on the machine for inserting and retrieving coins. &quot;Fruit machine&quot; comes from the traditional fruit images on the spinning reels such as lemons and cherries. Slot machines are also known pejoratively as &quot;one-armed bandits&quot;, alluding to the large mechanical levers affixed to the sides of early mechanical machines, and to the games&#x27; ability to empty players&#x27; pockets and wallets as thieves would.

==History==
Sittman and Pitt of Brooklyn, New York, developed a gambling machine in 1891 that was a precursor to the modern slot machine. It contained five drums holding a total of 50 card faces and was based on poker. The machine proved extremely popular, and soon many bars in the city had one or more of them. Players would insert a nickel and pull a lever, which would spin the drums and the cards that they held, the player hoping for a good poker hand. There was no direct payout mechanism, so a pair of kings might get the player a free beer, whereas a royal flush could pay out cigars or drinks; the prizes were wholly dependent upon what the establishment would offer. To improve the odds for the house, two cards were typically removed from the deck, the ten of spades and the jack of hearts, doubling the odds against winning a royal flush. The drums could also be rearranged to further reduce a player&#x27;s chance of winning.

Because of the vast number of possible wins in the original poker-based game, it proved practically impossible to make a machine capable of awarding an automatic payout for all possible winning combinations. At some time between 1887 and 1895, Charles Fey of San Francisco, California, devised a much simpler automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols: horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell; the bell gave the machine its name. By replacing ten cards with five symbols and using three reels instead of five drums, the complexity of reading a win was considerably reduced, allowing Fey to design an effective automatic payout mechanism. Three bells in a row produced the biggest payoff, ten nickels (50¢). Liberty Bell was a huge success and spawned a thriving mechanical gaming device industry. After a few years, the devices were banned in California, but Fey still could not keep up with the demand for them elsewhere. The Liberty Bell machine was so popular that it was copied by many slot machine manufacturers. The first of these, also called the &quot;Liberty Bell&quot;, was produced by the manufacturer Herbert Mills in 1907. By 1908, &quot;bell&quot; machines had been installed in cigar stores, brothels and barber shops. Early machines, including an 1899 Liberty Bell, are now part of the Nevada State Museum&#x27;s Fey Collection.

The first Liberty Bell machines produced by Mills used the same symbols on the reels as did Charles Fey&#x27;s original. Soon afterward, another version was produced with patriotic symbols, such as flags and wreaths, on the wheels. Later, a similar machine called the Operator&#x27;s Bell was produced that included the option of adding a gum-vending attachment. As the gum offered was fruit-flavored, fruit symbols were placed on the reels: lemons, cherries, oranges and plums. A bell was retained, and a picture of a stick of Bell-Fruit Gum, the origin of the bar symbol, was also present. This set of symbols proved highly popular and was used by other companies that began to make their own slot machines: Caille, Watling, Jennings and Pace.

A commonly used technique to avoid gambling laws in several states was to award food prizes. For this reason, several gumball and other vending machines were regarded with mistrust by the courts. The two Iowa cases of &quot;State v. Ellis&quot; and &quot;State v. Striggles&quot; are both used in criminal law classes to illustrate the concept of reliance upon authority as it relates to the axiomatic &quot;ignorantia juris non excusat&quot; (&quot;ignorance of the law is no excuse&quot;). In these cases, a mint vending machine was declared to be a gambling device because the machine would, by internally manufactured chance, occasionally give the next user several tokens exchangeable for more candy. Despite the display of the result of the next use on the machine, the courts ruled that &quot;[t]he machine appealed to the player&#x27;s propensity to gamble, and that is [a] vice.&quot;

In 1963, Bally developed the first fully electromechanical slot machine called Money Honey (although earlier machines such as Bally&#x27;s High Hand draw-poker machine had exhibited the basics of electromechanical construction as early as 1940). Its electromechanical workings made Money Honey the first slot machine with a bottomless hopper and automatic payout of up to 500 coins without the help of an attendant. The popularity of this machine led to the increasing predominance of electronic games, with the side lever soon becoming vestigial.

The first video slot machine was developed in 1976 in Kearny Mesa, California by the Las Vegas–based Fortune Coin Co. This machine used a modified Sony Trinitron color receiver for the display and logic boards for all slot-machine functions. The prototype was mounted in a full-size, show-ready slot-machine cabinet. The first production units went on trial at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel. After some modifications to defeat cheating attempts, the video slot machine was approved by the Nevada State Gaming Commission and eventually found popularity on the Las Vegas Strip and in downtown casinos. Fortune Coin Co. and its video slot-machine technology were purchased by IGT (International Gaming Technology) in 1978.

The first American video slot machine to offer a &quot;second screen&quot; bonus round was Reel ’Em In, developed by WMS Industries in 1996. This type of machine had appeared in Australia from at least 1994 with the Three Bags Full game. With this type of machine, the display changes to provide a different game in which an additional payout may be awarded.

==Operation==
Depending on the machine, the player can insert cash or, in &quot;ticket-in, ticket-out&quot; machines, a paper ticket with a barcode, into a designated slot on the machine. The machine is then activated by means of a lever or button (either physical or on a touchscreen), which activates reels that spin and stop to rearrange the symbols. If a player matches a winning combination of symbols, the player earns credits based on the paytable. Symbols vary depending on the theme of the machine. Classic symbols include objects such as fruits, bells, and stylized lucky sevens. Most slot games have a theme, such as a specific style, location, or character. Symbols and other bonus features of the game are typically aligned with the theme. Some themes are licensed from popular media franchises, including films, television series (including game shows such as &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, which has been one of the most popular lines of slot machines overall), entertainers, and musicians.

Multi-line slot machines have become more popular since the 1990s. These machines have more than one payline, meaning that visible symbols that are not aligned on the main horizontal may be considered as winning combinations. Traditional three-reel slot machines commonly have one, three, or five paylines while video slot machines may have 9, 15, 25, or as many as 1024 different paylines. Most accept variable numbers of credits to play, with 1 to 15 credits per line being typical. The higher the amount bet, the higher the payout will be if the player wins.

One of the main differences between video slot machines and reel machines is in the way payouts are calculated. With reel machines, the only way to win the maximum jackpot is to play the maximum number of coins (usually three, sometimes four or even five coins per spin). With video machines, the fixed payout values are multiplied by the number of coins per line that is being bet. In other words: on a reel machine, the odds are more favorable if the gambler plays with the maximum number of coins available. However, depending on the structure of the game and its bonus features, some video slots may still include features that improve chances at payouts by making increased wagers.
&quot;Multi-way&quot; games eschew fixed paylines in favor of allowing symbols to pay anywhere, as long as there is at least one in at least three consecutive reels from left to right. Multi-way games may be configured to allow players to bet by-reel: for example, on a game with a 3x5 pattern (often referred to as a 243-way game), playing one reel allows all three symbols in the first reel to potentially pay, but only the center row pays on the remaining reels (often designated by darkening the unused portions of the reels). Other multi-way games use a 4x5 or 5x5 pattern, where there are up to five symbols in each reel, allowing for up to 1,024 and 3,125 ways to win respectively. The Australian manufacturer Aristocrat brands games featuring this system as &quot;Reel Power&quot;, &quot;Xtra Reel Power&quot; and &quot;Super Reel Power&quot; respectively. A variation involves patterns where symbols are adjacent to one another. Most of these games have a hexagonal reel formation, and much like multi-way games, any patterns not played are darkened out of use.

Denominations can range from 1 cent (&quot;penny slots&quot;) all the way up to $100.00 or more per credit. The latter are typically known as &quot;high limit&quot; machines, and machines configured to allow for such wagers are often located in dedicated areas (which may have a separate team of attendants to cater to the needs of those who play there). The machine automatically calculates the number of credits the player receives in exchange for the cash inserted. Newer machines often allow players to choose from a selection of denominations on a splash screen or menu.

==Terminology==
A bonus is a special feature of the particular game theme, which is activated when certain symbols appear in a winning combination. Bonuses and the number of bonus features vary depending upon the game. Some bonus rounds are a special session of free spins (the number of which is often based on the winning combination that triggers the bonus), often with a different or modified set of winning combinations as the main game and/or other multipliers or increased frequencies of symbols, or a &quot;hold and re-spin&quot; mechanic in which specific symbols (usually marked with values of credits or other prizes) are collected and locked in place over a finite number of spins. In other bonus rounds, the player is presented with several items on a screen from which to choose. As the player chooses items, a number of credits is revealed and awarded. Some bonuses use a mechanical device, such as a spinning wheel, that works in conjunction with the bonus to display the amount won.

A candle is a light on top of the slot machine. It flashes to alert the operator that change is needed, hand pay is requested, a potential problem with the machine or the progressive jackpot has been won. It can be lit by the player by pressing the &quot;service&quot; or &quot;help&quot; button.

Carousel refers to a grouping of slot machines, usually in a circle or oval formation.

A coin hopper is a container where the coins that are immediately available for payouts are held. The hopper is a mechanical device that rotates coins into the coin tray when a player collects credits/coins (by pressing a &quot;Cash Out&quot; button). When a certain preset coin capacity is reached, a coin diverter automatically redirects, or &quot;drops&quot;, excess coins into a &quot;drop bucket&quot; or &quot;drop box&quot;. (Unused coin hoppers can still be found even on games that exclusively employ Ticket-In, Ticket-Out technology, as a vestige.)

The credit meter is a display of the amount of money or number of credits on the machine. On mechanical slot machines, this is usually a seven-segment display, but video slot machines typically use stylized text that suits the game&#x27;s theme and user interface.

The drop bucket or drop box is a container located in a slot machine&#x27;s base where excess coins are diverted from the hopper. Typically, a drop bucket is used for low-denomination slot machines and a drop box is used for high-denomination slot machines. A drop box contains a hinged lid with one or more locks whereas a drop bucket does not contain a lid. The contents of drop buckets and drop boxes are collected and counted by the casino on a scheduled basis.

EGM is short for &quot;Electronic Gaming Machine&quot;.

Free spins are a common form of bonus, where a series of spins are automatically played at no charge at the player&#x27;s current wager. Free spins are usually triggered via a scatter of at least three designated symbols (with the number of spins dependent on the number of symbols that land). Some games allow the free spins bonus to &quot;retrigger&quot;, which adds additional spins on top of those already awarded. There is no theoretical limit to the number of free spins obtainable. Some games may have other features that can also trigger over the course of free spins.

A hand pay refers to a payout made by an attendant or at an exchange point (&quot;cage&quot;), rather than by the slot machine itself. A hand pay occurs when the amount of the payout exceeds the maximum amount that was preset by the slot machine&#x27;s operator. Usually, the maximum amount is set at the level where the operator must begin to deduct taxes. A hand pay could also be necessary as a result of a short pay.

Hopper fill slip is a document used to record the replenishment of the coin in the coin hopper after it becomes depleted as a result of making payouts to players. The slip indicates the amount of coin placed into the hoppers, as well as the signatures of the employees involved in the transaction, the slot machine number and the location and the date.

MEAL book (Machine entry access log or Machine entry authorization log, depending on the jurisdiction or venue) is a log of the employee&#x27;s entries into the machine.

Low-level or slant-top slot machines include a stool so the player may sit down. Stand-up or upright slot machines are played while standing.

Optimal play is a payback percentage based on a gambler using the optimal strategy in a skill-based slot machine game.

Payline is a line that crosses through one symbol on each reel, along which a winning combination is evaluated. Classic spinning reel machines usually have up to nine paylines, while video slot machines may have as many as one hundred. Paylines could be of various shapes (horizontal, vertical, oblique, triangular, zigzag, etc.)

Persistent state refers to passive features on some slot machines, some of which able to trigger bonus payouts or other special features if certain conditions are met over time by players on that machine.

Roll-up is the process of dramatizing a win by playing sounds while the meters count up to the amount that has been won.

Short pay refers to a partial payout made by a slot machine, which is less than the amount due to the player. This occurs if the coin hopper has been depleted as a result of making earlier payouts to players. The remaining amount due to the player is either paid as a hand pay or an attendant will come and refill the machine.

A scatter is a pay combination based on occurrences of a designated symbol landing anywhere on the reels, rather than falling in sequence on the same payline. A scatter pay usually requires a minimum of three symbols to land, and the machine may offer increased prizes or jackpots depending on the number that land. Scatters are frequently used to trigger bonus games, such as free spins (with the number of spins multiplying based on the number of scatter symbols that land). The scatter symbol usually cannot be matched using wilds, and some games may require the scatter symbols to appear on consecutive reels in order to pay. On some multiway games, scatter symbols still pay in unused areas.

Taste is a reference to the small amount often paid out to keep a player seated and continuously betting. Only rarely will machines fail to pay even the minimum out over the course of several pulls.
Tilt is a term derived from electromechanical slot machines&#x27; &quot;tilt switches&quot;, which would make or break a circuit when they were tilted or otherwise tampered with that triggered an alarm. While modern machines no longer have tilt switches, any kind of technical fault (door switch in the wrong state, reel motor failure, out of paper, etc.) is still called a &quot;tilt&quot;.

A theoretical hold worksheet is a document provided by the manufacturer for every slot machine that indicates the theoretical percentage the machine should hold based on the amount paid in. The worksheet also indicates the reel strip settings, number of coins that may be played, the payout schedule, the number of reels and other information descriptive of the particular type of slot machine.

Volatility or variance refers to the measure of risk associated with playing a slot machine. A low-volatility slot machine has regular but smaller wins, while a high-variance slot machine has fewer but bigger wins.

Weight count is an American term referring to the total value of coins or tokens removed from a slot machine&#x27;s drop bucket or drop box for counting by the casino&#x27;s hard count team through the use of a weigh scale.

Wild symbols substitute for most other symbols in the game (similarly to a joker card), usually excluding scatter and jackpot symbols (or offering a lower prize on non-natural combinations that include wilds). How jokers behave are dependent on the specific game and whether the player is in a bonus or free games mode. Sometimes wild symbols may only appear on certain reels, or have a chance to &quot;stack&quot; across the entire reel.

==Pay table==

Each machine has a table that lists the number of credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the pay line of the machine. Some symbols are wild and can represent many, or all, of the other symbols to complete a winning line. Especially on older machines, the pay table is listed on the face of the machine, usually above and below the area containing the wheels. On video slot machines, they are usually contained within a help menu, along with information on other features.

==Technology==
===Reels===
Historically, all slot machines used revolving mechanical reels to display and determine results. Although the original slot machine used five reels, simpler, and therefore more reliable, three reel machines quickly became the standard.

A problem with three reel machines is that the number of combinations is only cubic – the original slot machine with three physical reels and 10 symbols on each reel had only 103 = 1,000 possible combinations. This limited the manufacturer&#x27;s ability to offer large jackpots since even the rarest event had a likelihood of 0.1%. The maximum theoretical payout, assuming 100% return to player would be 1000 times the bet, but that would leave no room for other pays, making the machine very high risk, and also quite boring.

Although the number of symbols eventually increased to about 22, allowing 10,648 combinations, this still limited jackpot sizes as well as the number of possible outcomes.

In the 1980s, however, slot machine manufacturers incorporated electronics into their products and programmed them to weight particular symbols. Thus the odds of losing symbols appearing on the payline became disproportionate to their actual frequency on the physical reel. A symbol would only appear once on the reel displayed to the player, but could, in fact, occupy several stops on the multiple reel.

In 1984, Inge Telnaes received a patent for a device titled, &quot;Electronic Gaming Device Utilizing a Random Number Generator for Selecting the Reel Stop Positions&quot; (US Patent 4448419), which states: &quot;It is important to make a machine that is perceived to present greater chances of payoff than it actually has within the legal limitations that games of chance must operate.&quot; The patent was later bought by International Game Technology and has since expired.

A virtual reel that has 256 virtual stops per reel would allow up to 2563 = 16,777,216 final positions. The manufacturer could choose to offer a $1 million jackpot on a $1 bet, confident that it will only happen, over the long term, once every 16.8 million plays.

===Computerization===
With microprocessors now ubiquitous, the computers inside modern slot machines allow manufacturers to assign a different probability to every symbol on every reel. To the player, it might appear that a winning symbol was &quot;so close&quot;, whereas in fact the probability is much lower.

In the 1980s in the U.K., machines embodying microprocessors became common. These used a number of features to ensure the payout was controlled within the limits of the gambling legislation. As a coin was inserted into the machine, it could go either directly into the cashbox for the benefit of the owner or into a channel that formed the payout reservoir, with the microprocessor monitoring the number of coins in this channel. The drums themselves were driven by stepper motors, controlled by the processor and with proximity sensors monitoring the position of the drums. A &quot;look-up table&quot; within the software allows the processor to know what symbols were being displayed on the drums to the gambler. This allowed the system to control the level of payout by stopping the drums at positions it had determined. If the payout channel had filled up, the payout became more generous; if nearly empty, the payout became less so (thus giving good control of the odds).

===Video slot machines===
Video slot machines do not use mechanical reels, but use graphical reels on a computerized display. As there are no mechanical constraints on the design of video slot machines, games often use at least five reels, and may also use non-standard layouts. This greatly expands the number of possibilities: a machine can have 50 or more symbols on a reel, giving odds as high as 300 million to 1 against – enough for even the largest jackpot. As there are so many combinations possible with five reels, manufacturers do not need to weight the payout symbols (although some may still do so). Instead, higher paying symbols will typically appear only once or twice on each reel, while more common symbols earning a more frequent payout will appear many times. Video slot machines usually make more extensive use of multimedia, and can feature more elaborate minigames as bonuses. Modern cabinets typically use flat-panel displays, but cabinets using larger curved screens (which can provide a more immersive experience for the player) are not uncommon.

Video slot machines typically encourage the player to play multiple &quot;lines&quot;: rather than simply taking the middle of the three symbols displayed on each reel, a line could go from top left to the bottom right or any other pattern specified by the manufacturer. As each symbol is equally likely, there is no difficulty for the manufacturer in allowing the player to take as many of the possible lines on offer as desired – the long-term return to the player will be the same. The difference for the player is that the more lines they play, the more likely they are to get paid on a given spin (because they are betting more).

To avoid seeming as if the player&#x27;s money is simply ebbing away (whereas a payout of 100 credits on a single-line machine would be 100 bets and the player would feel they had made a substantial win, on a 20-line machine, it would only be five bets and not seem as significant), manufacturers commonly offer bonus games, which can return many times their bet. The player is encouraged to keep playing to reach the bonus: even if they are losing, the bonus game could allow them to win back their losses.

===Payout percentage===

Slot machines are typically programmed to pay out as winnings 0% to 99% of the money that is wagered by players. This is known as the &quot;theoretical payout percentage&quot; or RTP, &quot;return to player&quot;. The minimum theoretical payout percentage varies among jurisdictions and is typically established by law or regulation. For example, the minimum payout in Nevada is 75%, in New Jersey 83%, and in Mississippi 80%. The winning patterns on slot machines – the amounts they pay and the frequencies of those payouts – are carefully selected to yield a certain fraction of the money paid to the &quot;house&quot; (the operator of the slot machine) while returning the rest to the players during play. Suppose that a certain slot machine costs $1 per spin and has a return to player (RTP) of 95%. It can be calculated that, over a sufficiently long period such as 1,000,000 spins, the machine will return an average of $950,000 to its players, who have inserted $1,000,000 during that time. In this (simplified) example, the slot machine is said to pay out 95%. The operator keeps the remaining $50,000. Within some EGM development organizations this concept is referred to simply as &quot;par&quot;. &quot;Par&quot; also manifests itself to gamblers as promotional techniques: &quot;Our &#x27;Loose Slots&#x27; have a 93% payback! Play now!&quot;

A slot machine&#x27;s theoretical payout percentage is set at the factory when the software is written. Changing the payout percentage after a slot machine has been placed on the gaming floor requires a physical swap of the software or &quot;firmware&quot;, which is usually stored on an EPROM but may be loaded onto non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) or even stored on CD-ROM or DVD, depending on the capabilities of the machine and the applicable regulations. In certain jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, the EPROM has a tamper-evident seal and can only be changed in the presence of Gaming Control Board officials. Other jurisdictions, including Nevada, randomly audit slot machines to ensure that they contain only approved software.

Historically, many casinos, both online and offline, have been unwilling to publish individual game RTP figures, making it impossible for the player to know whether they are playing a &quot;loose&quot; or a &quot;tight&quot; game. Since the turn of the century, some information regarding these figures has started to come into the public domain either through various casinos releasing them—primarily this applies to online casinos—or through studies by independent gambling authorities.

The &quot;return to player&quot; is not the only statistic that is of interest. The probabilities of every payout on the pay table is also critical. For example, consider a hypothetical slot machine with a dozen different values on the pay table. However, the probabilities of getting all the payouts are zero except the largest one. If the payout is 4,000 times the input amount, and it happens every 4,000 times on average, the &quot;return to player&quot; is exactly 100%, but the game would be dull to play. Also, most people would not win anything, and having entries on the paytable that have a return of zero would be deceptive. As these individual probabilities are closely guarded secrets, it is possible that the advertised machines with high return to player simply increase the probabilities of these jackpots. The casino could legally place machines of a similar style payout and advertise that some machines have 100% return to player. The added advantage is that these large jackpots increase the excitement of the other players.

The table of probabilities for a specific machine is called the Probability and Accounting Report or PAR sheet, also PARS commonly understood as Paytable and Reel Strips. Mathematician Michael Shackleford revealed the PARS for one commercial slot machine, an original International Gaming Technology &quot;Red White and Blue&quot; machine. This game, in its original form, is obsolete, so these specific probabilities do not apply. He only published the odds after a fan of his sent him some information provided on a slot machine that was posted on a machine in the Netherlands. The psychology of the machine design is quickly revealed. There are 13 possible payouts ranging from 1:1 to 2,400:1. The 1:1 payout comes every 8 plays. The 5:1 payout comes every 33 plays, whereas the 2:1 payout comes every 600 plays. Most players assume the likelihood increases proportionate to the payout. The one mid-size payout that is designed to give the player a thrill is the 80:1 payout. It is programmed to occur an average of once every 219 plays. The 80:1 payout is high enough to create excitement, but not high enough that it makes it likely that the player will take their winnings and abandon the game. More than likely the player began the game with at least 80 times his bet (for instance there are 80 quarters in $20). In contrast the 150:1 payout occurs only on average of once every 6,241 plays. The highest payout of 2,400:1 occurs only on average of once every 643 = 262,144 plays since the machine has 64 virtual stops. The player who continues to feed the machine is likely to have several mid-size payouts, but unlikely to have a large payout. He quits after he is bored or has exhausted his bankroll.

Despite their confidentiality, occasionally a PAR sheet is posted on a website. They have limited value to the player, because usually a machine will have 8 to 12 different possible programs with varying payouts. In addition, slight variations of each machine (e.g., with &quot;double jackpots&quot; or &quot;five times play&quot;) are always being developed. The casino operator can choose which EPROM chip to install in any particular machine to select the payout desired. The result is that there is not really such a thing as a high payback type of machine, since every machine potentially has multiple settings. From October 2001 to February 2002, columnist Michael Shackleford obtained PAR sheets for five different nickel machines; four IGT games &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, &quot;Fortune Cookie&quot;, &quot;Leopard Spots&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and one game manufactured by WMS; &quot;Reel &#x27;em In&quot;. Without revealing the proprietary information, he developed a program that would allow him to determine with usually less than a dozen plays on each machine which EPROM chip was installed. Then he did a survey of over 400 machines in 70 different casinos in Las Vegas. He averaged the data, and assigned an average payback percentage to the machines in each casino. The resultant list was widely publicized for marketing purposes (especially by the Palms casino which had the top ranking).

One reason that the slot machine is so profitable to a casino is that the player must play the &quot;high house edge and high payout&quot; wagers along with the &quot;low house edge and low payout&quot; wagers. In a more traditional wagering game like craps, the player knows that certain wagers have almost a 50/50 chance of winning or losing, but they only pay a limited multiple of the original bet (usually no higher than three times). Other bets have a higher house edge, but the player is rewarded with a bigger win (up to thirty times in craps). The player can choose what kind of wager he wants to make. A slot machine does not afford such an opportunity. Theoretically, the operator could make these probabilities available, or allow the player to choose which one so that the player is free to make a choice. However, no operator has ever enacted this strategy. Different machines have different maximum payouts, but without knowing the odds of getting the jackpot, there is no rational way to differentiate.

In many markets where central monitoring and control systems are used to link machines for auditing and security purposes, usually in wide area networks of multiple venues and thousands of machines, player return must usually be changed from a central computer rather than at each machine. A range of percentages is set in the game software and selected remotely.

In 2006, the Nevada Gaming Commission began working with Las Vegas casinos on technology that would allow the casino&#x27;s management to change the game, the odds, and the payouts remotely. The change cannot be done instantaneously, but only after the selected machine has been idle for at least four minutes. After the change is made, the machine must be locked to new players for four minutes and display an on-screen message informing potential players that a change is being made.

===Linked machines===
Some varieties of slot machines can be linked together in a setup sometimes known as a &quot;community&quot; game. The most basic form of this setup involves progressive jackpots that are shared between the bank of machines, but may include multiplayer bonuses and other features.

In some cases multiple machines are linked across multiple casinos. In these cases, the machines may be owned by the manufacturer, who is responsible for paying the jackpot. The casinos lease the machines rather than owning them outright. Casinos in New Jersey, Nevada, Louisiana, Arkansas, and South Dakota now offer multi-state progressive jackpots, which now offer bigger jackpot pools.

===Fraud===
Mechanical slot machines and their coin acceptors were sometimes susceptible to cheating devices and other scams. One historical example involved spinning a coin with a short length of plastic wire. The weight and size of the coin would be accepted by the machine and credits would be granted. However, the spin created by the plastic wire would cause the coin to exit through the reject chute into the payout tray. This particular scam has become obsolete due to improvements in newer slot machines. Another obsolete method of defeating slot machines was to use a light source to confuse the optical sensor used to count coins during payout.

Modern slot machines are controlled by EPROM computer chips and, in large casinos, coin acceptors have become obsolete in favor of bill acceptors. These machines and their bill acceptors are designed with advanced anti-cheating and anti-counterfeiting measures and are difficult to defraud. Early computerized slot machines were sometimes defrauded through the use of cheating devices, such as the &quot;slider&quot;, &quot;monkey paw&quot;, &quot;lightwand&quot; and &quot;the tongue&quot;. Many of these old cheating devices were made by the late Tommy Glenn Carmichael, a slot machine fraudster who reportedly stole over $5 million. In the modern day, computerized slot machines are fully deterministic and thus outcomes can be sometimes successfully predicted.

===Skill stops===
Skill stop buttons predated the Bally electromechanical slot machines of the 1960s and 1970s. They appeared on mechanical slot machines manufactured by Mills Novelty Co. as early as the mid 1920s. These machines had modified reel-stop arms, which allowed them to be released from the timing bar, earlier than in a normal play, simply by pressing the buttons on the front of the machine, located between each reel.

&quot;Skill stop&quot; buttons were added to some slot machines by Zacharias Anthony in the early 1970s. These enabled the player to stop each reel, allowing a degree of &quot;skill&quot; so as to satisfy the New Jersey gaming laws of the day which required that players were able to control the game in some way. The original conversion was applied to approximately 50 late-model Bally slot machines. Because the typical machine stopped the reels automatically in less than 10 seconds, weights were added to the mechanical timers to prolong the automatic stopping of the reels. By the time the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverages Commission (ABC) had approved the conversion for use in New Jersey arcades, the word was out and every other distributor began adding skill stops. The machines were a huge hit on the Jersey Shore and the remaining unconverted Bally machines were destroyed as they had become instantly obsolete.

==Legislation==
===United States===
In the United States, the public and private availability of slot machines is highly regulated by state governments. Many states have established gaming control boards to regulate the possession and use of slot machines and other forms of gaming.

Nevada is the only state that has no significant restrictions against slot machines both for public and private use. In New Jersey, slot machines are only allowed in hotel casinos operated in Atlantic City. Several states (Indiana, Louisiana and Missouri) allow slot machines (as well as any casino-style gambling) only on licensed riverboats or permanently anchored barges. Since Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi has removed the requirement that casinos on the Gulf Coast operate on barges and now allows them on land along the shoreline. Delaware allows slot machines at three horse tracks; they are regulated by the state lottery commission. In Wisconsin, bars and taverns are allowed to have up to five machines. These machines usually allow a player to either take a payout, or gamble it on a double-or-nothing &quot;side game&quot;.

The territory of Puerto Rico places significant restrictions on slot machine ownership, but the law is widely flouted and slot machines are common in bars and coffeeshops.

In regards to tribal casinos located on Native American reservations, slot machines played against the house and operating independently from a centralized computer system are classified as &quot;Class III&quot; gaming by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), and sometimes promoted as &quot;Vegas-style&quot; slot machines. In order to offer Class III gaming, tribes must enter into a compact (agreement) with the state that is approved by the Department of the Interior, which may contain restrictions on the types and quantity of such games. As a workaround, some casinos may operate slot machines as &quot;Class II&quot; games—a category that includes games where players play exclusively against at least one other opponent and not the house, such as bingo or any related games (such as pull-tabs). In these cases, the reels are an entertainment display with a pre-determined outcome based on a centralized game played against other players. Under the IGRA, Class II games are regulated by individual tribes and the National Indian Gaming Commission, and do not require any additional approval if the state already permits tribal gaming.

Some historical race wagering terminals operate in a similar manner, with the machines using slots as an entertainment display for outcomes paid using the parimutuel betting system, based on results of randomly-selected, previously-held horse races (with the player able to view selected details about the race and adjust their picks before playing the credit, or otherwise use an auto-bet system).

====Private ownership====

Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia place no restrictions on private ownership of slot machines. Conversely, in Connecticut, Hawaii, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Tennessee, private ownership of any slot machine is completely prohibited. The remaining states allow slot machines of a certain age (typically 25–30 years) or slot machines manufactured before a specific date.

===Canada===
The Government of Canada has minimal involvement in gambling beyond the Canadian Criminal Code. In essence, the term &quot;lottery scheme&quot; used in the code means slot machines, bingo and table games normally associated with a casino. These fall under the jurisdiction of the province or territory without reference to the federal government; in practice, all Canadian provinces operate gaming boards that oversee lotteries, casinos and video lottery terminals under their jurisdiction.

OLG piloted a classification system for slot machines at the Grand River Raceway developed by University of Waterloo professor Kevin Harrigan, as part of its PlaySmart initiative for responsible gambling. Inspired by nutrition labels on foods, they displayed metrics such as volatility and frequency of payouts. OLG has also deployed electronic gaming machines with pre-determined outcomes based on a bingo or pull-tab game, initially branded as &quot;TapTix&quot;, which visually resemble slot machines.

In Ontario, 4 April 2022 saw the re-introduction of the online gambling market. This became possible when the Canadian Criminal Code was amended to allow single-event wagering August 2021. The province is expected to generate about $800 million in gross revenue per year.

===Australia===
In Australia &quot;Poker Machines&quot; or &quot;pokies&quot; are officially termed &quot;gaming machines&quot;. In Australia, gaming machines are a matter for state governments, so laws vary between states. Gaming machines are found in casinos (approximately one in each major city), pubs and clubs in some states (usually sports, social, or RSL clubs). The first Australian state to legalize this style of gambling was New South Wales, when in 1956 they were made legal in all registered clubs in the state. There are suggestions that the proliferation of poker machines has led to increased levels of problem gambling; however, the precise nature of this link is still open to research.

In 1999 the Australian Productivity Commission reported that nearly half Australia&#x27;s gaming machines were in New South Wales. At the time, 21% of all the gambling machines in the world were operating in Australia and, on a per capita basis, Australia had roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States. Australia ranks 8th in total number of gaming machines after Japan, U.S.A., Italy, U.K., Spain and Germany. This primarily is because gaming machines have been legal in the state of New South Wales since 1956; over time, the number of machines has grown to 97,103 (at December 2010, including the Australian Capital Territory). By way of comparison, the U.S. State of Nevada, which legalised gaming including slots several decades before N.S.W., had 190,135 slots operating.

Revenue from gaming machines in pubs and clubs accounts for more than half of the $4 billion in gambling revenue collected by state governments in fiscal year 2002–03.

In Queensland, gaming machines in pubs and clubs must provide a return rate of 85%, while machines located in casinos must provide a return rate of 90%. Most other states have similar provisions. In Victoria, gaming machines must provide a minimum return rate of at least 85% (including jackpot contribution), are prohibited from accepting bills greater than $50 in denomination, and each wager must be manually initiated by the player (thus prohibiting &quot;autoplay&quot; mechanisms). 

Western Australia has the most restrictive regulations on electronic gaming machines (EGMs) in general. They may only be operated at the Crown Perth casino resort, which is the only casino in Western Australia, and have a return rate of 90%. Many EGMs operate games that are nearly identical to slot machines, but with modifications to comply with state law: EGMs are prohibited from using spinning reels, and must not use symbols associated with poker machines used elsewhere. Each wager must take at least three seconds to play, and each wager must be initiated by the user.

This policy has an extensive political history, reaffirmed by the 1974 Royal Commission into Gambling:

Despite the state having praised its restrictions for keeping gaming machines from being widely available to the public as in other states, the machines have faced criticism for being almost indistinguishable to a normal slot machine, and thus having the same addictive qualities. In March 2022, a royal commission found Crown Gaming to be unfit to hold a gaming license in WA, citing issues surrounding money laundering, failing to minimise harms from problem gambling, and the regulatory framework of the Gaming and Wagering Commission being considered outdated. To implement the recommendations of the Commission, EGMs were limited to maximum bets of $10 beginning in July 2023, while also requiring the implementation of weekly limits on play and losses, and the implementation of cashless machines requiring pre-loaded player cards to function.

Nick Xenophon was elected on an independent No Pokies ticket in the South Australian Legislative Council at the 1997 South Australian state election on 2.9 percent, re-elected at the 2006 election on 20.5 percent, and elected to the Australian Senate at the 2007 federal election on 14.8 percent. Independent candidate Andrew Wilkie, an anti-pokies campaigner, was elected to the Australian House of Representatives seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election. Wilkie was one of four crossbenchers who supported the Gillard Labor government following the hung parliament result. Wilkie immediately began forging ties with Xenophon as soon as it was apparent that he was elected. In exchange for Wilkie&#x27;s support, the Labor government are attempting to implement precommitment technology for high-bet/high-intensity poker machines, against opposition from the Tony Abbott Coalition and Clubs Australia.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, every establishment in the country that facilitated poker machines was shut down, in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus, bringing Australia&#x27;s usage of poker machines effectively to zero.

=== Russia ===
In Russia, &quot;slot clubs&quot; appeared quite late, only in 1992. Before 1992, slot machines were only in casinos and small shops, but later slot clubs began appearing all over the country. The most popular and numerous were &quot;Vulcan 777&quot; and &quot;Taj Mahal&quot;. Since 2009, when gambling establishments were banned, almost all slot clubs disappeared and are found only in a specially authorized gambling zones.

===United Kingdom=== 
Slot machines are covered by the Gambling Act 2005, which superseded the Gaming Act 1968.

Slot machines in the U.K. are categorised by definitions produced by the Gambling Commission as part of the Gambling Act of 2005.

Casinos built under the provisions of the 1968 Act are allowed to house either up to twenty machines of categories B–D or any number of C–D machines. As defined by the 2005 Act, large casinos can have a maximum of one hundred and fifty machines in any combination of categories B–D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 5:1); small casinos can have a maximum of eighty machines in any combination of categories B–D (subject to a machine-to-table ratio of 2:1).

====Category A====
Category A games were defined in preparation for the planned &quot;Super Casinos&quot;. Despite a lengthy bidding process with Manchester being chosen as the single planned location, the development was cancelled soon after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. As a result, there are no lawful Category A games in the U.K.

====Category B====
Category B games are divided into subcategories. The differences between B1, B3 and B4 games are mainly the stake and prizes as defined in the above table. Category B2 games – Fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) – have quite different stake and prize rules: FOBTs are mainly found in licensed betting shops, or bookmakers, usually in the form of electronic roulette.

The games are based on a random number generator; thus each game&#x27;s probability of getting the jackpot is independent of any other game: probabilities are all equal. If a pseudorandom number generator is used instead of a truly random one, probabilities are not independent since each number is determined at least in part by the one generated before it.

====Category C====
Category C games are often referred to as fruit machines, one-armed bandits and AWP (amusement with prize). Fruit machines are commonly found in pubs, clubs, and arcades. Machines commonly have three but can be found with four or five reels, each with 16–24 symbols printed around them. The reels are spun each play, from which the appearance of particular combinations of symbols result in payment of their associated winnings by the machine (or alternatively initiation of a subgame). These games often have many extra features, trails and subgames with opportunities to win money; usually more than can be won from just the payouts on the reel combinations.

Fruit machines in the U.K. almost universally have the following features, generally selected at random using a pseudorandom number generator:
* A player (known in the industry as a &quot;punter&quot;) may be given the opportunity to &quot;hold&quot; one or more reels before spinning, meaning they will not be spun but instead retain their displayed symbols yet otherwise count normally for that play. This can sometimes increase the chance of winning, especially if two or more reels are held. 
* A player may also be given a number of &quot;nudges&quot; following a spin (or, in some machines, as a result in a subgame). A nudge is a step rotation of a reel chosen by the player (the machine may not allow all reels to be nudged for a particular play).
* &quot;Cheats&quot; can also be made available on the internet or through emailed newsletters to subscribers. These cheats give the player the impression of an advantage, whereas in reality the payout percentage remains exactly the same. The most widely used cheat is known as hold after a nudge and increases the chance that the player will win following an unsuccessful nudge. Machines from the early 1990s did not advertise the concept of hold after a nudge when this feature was first introduced, it became so well known amongst players and widespread amongst new machine releases that it is now well-advertised on the machine during play. This is characterized by messages on the display such as &quot;DON&#x27;T HOLD ANY&quot; or &quot;LET &#x27;EM SPIN&quot; and is a designed feature of the machine, not a cheat at all. Holding the same pair three times on three consecutive spins also gives a guaranteed win on most machines that offer holds.

It is known for machines to pay out multiple jackpots, one after the other (this is known as a &quot;repeat&quot;) but each jackpot requires a new game to be played so as not to violate the law about the maximum payout on a single play. Typically this involves the player only pressing the Start button at the &quot;repeat&quot; prompt, for which a single credit is taken, regardless of whether this causes the reels to spin or not. Machines are also known to intentionally set aside money, which is later awarded in a series of wins, known as a &quot;streak&quot;. The minimum payout percentage is 70%, with pubs often setting the payout at around 78%.
===Japan===
Japanese slot machines, known as or pachislot from the words &quot;pachinko&quot; and &quot;slot machine&quot;, are a descendant of the traditional Japanese pachinko game. Slot machines are a fairly new phenomenon and they can be found mostly in pachinko parlors and the adult sections of amusement arcades, known as game centers.

==Jackpot disputes==

Electronic slot machines can malfunction. When the displayed amount is smaller than the one it is supposed to be, the error usually goes unnoticed. When it happens the other way, disputes are likely. Below are some notable arguments caused by the owners of the machines saying that the displayed amounts were far larger than the ones patrons should get.

===United States===
Two such cases occurred in casinos in Colorado in 2010, where software errors led to indicated jackpots of $11 million and $42 million. Analysis of machine records by the state Gaming Commission revealed faults, with the true jackpot being substantially smaller. State gaming laws did not require a casino to honour payouts in that case.

===Vietnam===
On October 25, 2009, while a Vietnamese American man, Ly Sam, was playing a slot machine in the Palazzo Club at the Sheraton Saigon Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, it displayed that he had hit a jackpot of US$55,542,296.73. The casino refused to pay, saying it was a machine error, Ly sued the casino. On January 7, 2013, the District 1 People&#x27;s Court in Ho Chi Minh City decided that the casino had to pay the amount Ly claimed in full, not trusting the error report from an inspection company hired by the casino. Both sides appealed thereafter, and Ly asked for interest while the casino refused to pay him. In January, 2014, the news reported that the case had been settled out of court, and Ly had received an undisclosed sum.

==Problem gambling and slot machines==
Natasha Dow Schüll, associate professor in New York University&#x27;s Department of Media, Culture and Communication, uses the term &quot;machine zone&quot; to describe the state of immersion that users of slot machines experience when gambling, where they lose a sense of time, space, bodily awareness, and monetary value.

Mike Dixon, PhD, professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo, studies the relationship between slot players and machines. In one of Dixon&#x27;s studies, players were observed experiencing heightened arousal from the sensory stimulus coming from the machines. They &quot;sought to show that these &#x27;losses disguised as wins&#x27; (LDWs) would be as arousing as wins, and more arousing than regular losses.&quot;

Psychologists Robert Breen and Marc Zimmerman found that players of video slot machines reach a debilitating level of involvement with gambling three times as rapidly as those who play traditional casino games, even if they have engaged in other forms of gambling without problems.

Eye-tracking research in local bookkeepers&#x27; offices in the UK suggested that, in slots games, the reels dominated players&#x27; visual attention, and that problem gamblers looked more frequently at amount-won messages than did those without gambling problems.

The 2011 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report &quot;Slot Machines: The Big Gamble&quot; focused on the link between slot machines and gambling addiction.

<text>Sneaker Pimps are an English electronic music band, formed in Hartlepool in 1994. They are best known for their debut album, &quot;Becoming X&quot; (1996), and its singles &quot;6 Underground&quot; and &quot;Spin Spin Sugar&quot;. The band takes its name from an article the Beastie Boys published in their &quot;Grand Royal&quot; magazine about a man they hired to track down classic sneakers.

The band was founded by electronic musician Liam Howe and guitarist Chris Corner. They later recruited Kelli Ali (then known as Kelli Dayton) as lead singer, plus guitarist Joe Wilson and drummer Dave Westlake as backup musicians. After &quot;Becoming X&quot;, the band decided to replace Ali with Corner on vocals. Wilson and Westlake departed in 2002. In 2016 Howe and Corner revived the group after a lengthy hiatus. In 2021, they began releasing new music.

==History==
Chris Corner and Liam Howe met as teenagers in the 1980s, both taking an interest in recording and studio experimentation. They banded together under the name F.R.I.S.K. and produced the &quot;Soul of Indiscretion&quot; EP, an early example of what became known as trip hop. The mix of beats and acoustic folk sounds was further explored on two more instrumental EPs: &quot;F.R.I.S.K.&quot; and &quot;World as a Cone&quot;. They were signed to Clean Up Records. The duo also worked as DJs and producers under the name Line of Flight.

Howe and Corner launched Sneaker Pimps as a recording group in 1994. The following year, they recruited Ian Pickering to help write lyrics for what would become Sneaker Pimps&#x27; debut album, &quot;Becoming X&quot;. Corner recorded vocals for several demo tracks, but the band decided the kind of music they were writing would better suit a female voice. At their manager&#x27;s suggestion, they saw Kelli Ali (then known as Kelli Dayton) performing in a pub with her band The Lumieres, and invited her to sing on some demos, including an early version of &quot;6 Underground&quot;. She soon joined the band, and the demos won the group a contract with Virgin Records. The group was presented as a trio featuring Howe, Corner, and Ali; while bassist Joe Wilson and drummer Dave Westlake were added as supporting musicians.

Released in 1996, &quot;Becoming X&quot; sold over one million copies. The band toured for two years to support the album, including gigs alongside Aphex Twin. A &quot;grueling&quot; tour of the US strained relations within the band, and Howe left the tour prematurely. A remix album, &quot;Becoming Remixed&quot;, followed in 1998.

Howe and Corner then developed their own studio, also called Line of Flight after their earlier production work, and began sessions for the second Sneaker Pimps album. Kelli Ali had taken a break after the &quot;Becoming X&quot; tour and was away traveling, so Corner sang on the new demos. When Ali returned, she was told by Howe and Corner that her voice was no longer considered suitable for their new music, and that Corner&#x27;s voice was a better fit. Due to other ongoing personality conflicts and the band&#x27;s concern about being stereotyped as a faddish female-fronted trip-hop act, Ali was fired and Corner took over on lead vocals.

This significant lineup change caused Virgin Records to drop the band. Their second album &quot;Splinter&quot; was released in the UK on Clean Up Records in 1999, and failed to match the commercial success of &quot;Becoming X&quot;. New songs were premiered during a 2001 European tour opening for Placebo. Their third album &quot;Bloodsport&quot; was released on Tommy Boy Records in 2002. Howe and Corner also gained notice by writing and producing for other artists, including Natalie Imbruglia, and for remixing songs under the name Line of Flight.

In 2002, Joe Wilson and Dave Westlake left Sneaker Pimps. In 2003, a fourth Sneaker Pimps album was demoed but shelved. The album, which started as the soundtrack for an abandoned indie film project called &quot;Blind Michael&quot;, is referred to in fan circles as &quot;SP4&quot;. Corner then launched the solo project IAMX, which included several songs from the &quot;SP4&quot; project. After some additional cancelled projects, in 2006 Howe and Corner recorded some new demo tracks with an unidentified female singer; the tracks turned up on a MiniDisc found in a bar in Russia and are now commonly referred to as &quot;SP5 demos&quot;. The tracks were leaked online and were later confirmed to be legitimate new Sneaker Pimps songs.

After several years of side projects, Howe hinted in 2015 that Sneaker Pimps may reform. Corner confirmed the reunion in 2016, and as of early 2019 they were reportedly working on a new album. Deluxe box sets of previous albums and two new studio albums were announced to be released variously across 2021.

In May 2021, the band announced a new album entitled &quot;Squaring the Circle&quot;. The album was produced at Sawtooth Studios in Pioneertown, California and The Tower Studios in London. Main vocals are shared by Corner and &quot;featured artist&quot; Simonne Jones. Five of the songs originate from the SP5 demos, &quot;Lifeline&quot; (originally &quot;Samaritan&quot;), &quot;Child in the Dark&quot; (originally &quot;Satellite&quot;), So Far Gone (originally &quot;Sun Ate the Moon&quot;), &quot;Come Like the Cure&quot; (originally &quot;Elias&quot;) and &quot;No Show&quot; (originally &quot;Rush&quot;).

==Members==
In the studio, the band regularly swapped instruments. As Corner explained during the recording sessions for &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, &quot;we tend towards jobs, but generally we can mix and match. If we get bored of one aspect, someone else jumps in the seat. Gone are the days where it’s like &#x27;You’re the drummer, I’m the synth player.&quot; When playing live, however, their roles were more fixed:

<doc id="29234" wikidata="Q44475" url="?curid=29234" title="Spear">
<text>A spear is a polearm consisting of a shaft, usually of wood, with a pointed head. The head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself, as is the case with fire hardened spears, or it may be made of a more durable material fastened to the shaft, such as bone, flint, obsidian, copper, bronze, iron, or steel. The most common design for hunting and/or warfare, since modern times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle, diamond, or leaf. The heads of fishing spears usually feature multiple sharp points, with or without barbs.

Spears can be divided into two broad categories: those designed for thrusting as a melee weapon (including weapons such as lances and pikes) and those designed for throwing as a ranged weapon (usually referred to as javelins).

The spear has been used throughout human history as a weapon for hunting and/or fishing and for warfare. Along with the club, knife, and axe, it is one of the earliest and most widespread tools ever developed by early humans. As a weapon, it may be wielded with either one or two hands. It was used in virtually every conflict up until the modern era, where even to this day, it lives on in the form of a bayonet fixed onto the muzzle of a long gun.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;spear&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;&quot;, from the Proto-Germanic &quot;speri&quot;, from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*sper-&quot; &quot;spear, pole&quot;.

==Origins==
Spear manufacture and use is not confined to humans. It is also practiced by the western chimpanzee. Chimpanzees near Kédougou, Senegal have been observed to create spears by breaking straight limbs off trees, stripping them of their bark and side branches, and sharpening one end with their teeth. They then used the weapons to hunt galagos sleeping in hollows.

===Prehistory===

The Clacton Spear found in England and the Schöningen spears found in present-day Germany document that wooden spears have been used for hunting since at least 400,000 years ago. A 2012 study from the site of Kathu Pan in South Africa suggests that hominids, possibly &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;, may have developed the technology of hafted stone-tipped spears in Africa about 500,000 years ago. Wood does not preserve well, however, and Craig Stanford, a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Southern California, has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees means that early humans may have used wooden spears before this.

From circa 200,000 BC onwards, Middle Paleolithic humans began to make complex stone blades with flaked edges which were used as spear heads. These stone heads could be fixed to the spear shaft by gum or resin or by bindings made of animal sinew, leather strips or vegetable matter. During this period, a clear difference remained between spears designed to be thrown and those designed to be used in hand-to-hand combat. By the Magdalenian period (c. 15,000–9500 BC), spear-throwers similar to the later atlatl were in use.

==Military==
===Europe===
====Classical antiquity====
=====Ancient Greeks=====

The spear is the main weapon of the warriors of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. The use of both a single thrusting spear and two throwing spears are mentioned. It has been suggested that two styles of combat are being described; an early style, with thrusting spears, dating to the Mycenaean period in which the Iliad is set, and, anachronistically, a later style, with throwing spears, from Homer&#x27;s own Archaic period.

In the 7th century BC, the Greeks evolved a new close-order infantry formation, the phalanx. The key to this formation was the hoplite, who was equipped with a large, circular, bronze-faced shield (aspis) and a spear with an iron head and bronze butt-spike (doru). The hoplite phalanx dominated warfare among the Greek City States from the 7th into the 4th century BC.

The 4th century saw major changes. One was the greater use of peltasts, light infantry armed with spear and javelins. The other was the development of the sarissa, a two-handed pike in length, by the Macedonians under Phillip of Macedon and Alexander the Great. The pike phalanx, supported by peltasts and cavalry, became the dominant mode of warfare among the Greeks from the late 4th century onward until Greek military systems were supplanted by the Roman legions.

=====Ancient Romans=====

In the pre-Marian Roman armies, the first two lines of battle, the &quot;hastati&quot; and &quot;principes&quot;, often fought with a sword called a &quot;gladius&quot; and &quot;pila&quot;, heavy javelins that were specifically designed to be thrown at an enemy to pierce and foul a target&#x27;s shield. Originally the &quot;principes&quot; were armed with a short spear called a &quot;hasta&quot;, but these gradually fell out of use, eventually being replaced by the gladius. The third line, the &quot;triarii&quot;, continued to use the &quot;hasta&quot;.

From the late 2nd century BC, all legionaries were equipped with the &quot;pilum&quot;. The &quot;pilum&quot; continued to be the standard legionary spear until the end of the 2nd century AD. &quot;Auxilia&quot;, however, were equipped with a simple hasta and, perhaps, javelins or darts. During the 3rd century AD, although the &quot;pilum&quot; continued to be used, legionaries usually were equipped with other forms of throwing and thrusting spear, similar to &quot;auxilia&quot; of the previous century. By the 4th century, the &quot;pilum&quot; had effectively disappeared from common use.

In the late period of the Roman Empire, the spear became more often used because of its anti-cavalry capacities as the barbarian invasions were often conducted by people with a developed culture of cavalry in warfare.

====Medieval period====
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the spear and shield continued to be used by nearly all Western European cultures. Since a medieval spear required only a small amount of steel along the sharpened edges (most of the spear-tip was wrought iron), it was an economical weapon. Quick to manufacture, and needing less smithing skill than a sword, it remained the main weapon of the common soldier. The Vikings, for instance, although often portrayed with an axe, sword, or lance in hand, were armed mostly with spears, as were their Anglo-Saxon, Irish, or continental contemporaries. Spears eventually evolved into lances; this is where the lance depiction comes from. With a good majority of Medieval weapons being spears they became integrated into many war tactics. Spears were very commonly used while providing a defensive block. When men on horses tried to get by these blocks, they would often be killed by the spears that could poke through the shield walls. Spears became more common than swords and axes because of how cheap, long, and fast spears were made. 

=====Infantry=====

Broadly speaking, spears were either designed to be used in melee, or to be thrown. Within this simple classification, there was a remarkable range of types. For example, M. J. Swanton identified thirty different spearhead categories and sub-categories in early Saxon England. Most medieval spearheads were generally leaf-shaped. Notable types of early medieval spears include the &quot;angon&quot;, a throwing spear with a long head similar to the Roman &quot;pilum&quot;, used by the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, and the winged (or lugged) spear, which had two prominent wings at the base of the spearhead, either to prevent the spear penetrating too far into an enemy or to aid in spear fencing. Originally a Frankish weapon, the winged spear also was popular with the Vikings. It would become the ancestor of later medieval polearms, such as the partisan and spetum.

The thrusting spear also has the advantage of reach, being considerably longer than other weapon types. Exact spear lengths are hard to deduce as few spear shafts survive archaeologically, but would seem to have been the average length. Some nations were noted for their long spears, including the Scots and the Flemish. Spears usually were used in tightly ordered formations, such as the shield wall or the schiltron. To resist cavalry, spear shafts could be planted against the ground. William Wallace drew up his schiltrons in a circle at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 to deter charging cavalry; this was a widespread tactic sometimes known as the &quot;crown&quot; formation. Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray used a circular schiltron on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn. However, the rectangular schiltron was much more common and was used by King Robert the Bruce on the second day of the Battle of Bannockburn and in the Battle of Old Byland when he defeated English armies.

Throwing spears became rarer as the Middle Ages drew on, but survived in the hands of specialists such as the Catalan Almogavars. They were commonly used in Ireland until the end of the 16th century.

Spears began to lose fashion among the infantry during the 14th century, being replaced by polearms that combined the thrusting properties of the spear with the cutting properties of the axe, such as the halberd. Where spears were retained they grew in length, eventually evolving into pikes, which would be a dominant infantry weapon in the 16th and 17th centuries.

=====Cavalry=====
Cavalry spears were originally the same as infantry spears and were often used with two hands or held with one hand overhead. In the 12th century, after the adoption of stirrups and a high-cantled saddle, the spear became a decidedly more powerful weapon. A mounted knight would secure the lance by holding it with one hand and tucking it under the armpit (the &quot;couched lance&quot; technique) In combination with a lance rest, this allowed all the momentum of the horse and knight to be focused on the weapon&#x27;s tip, whilst still retaining accuracy and control. This use of the spear spurred the development of the lance as a distinct weapon that was perfected in the medieval sport of jousting.

In the 14th century, tactical developments meant that knights and men-at-arms often fought on foot. This led to the practice of shortening the lance to about to make it more manageable. As dismounting became commonplace, specialist polearms such as the pollaxe were adopted by knights and this practice ceased.

====Introduction of gunpowder====

The development of both the long, two-handed pike and gunpowder firearms in Renaissance Europe saw an ever-increasing focus on integrated infantry tactics. Those infantry not armed with these weapons carried variations on the polearm, including the halberd and the bill. At the start of the Renaissance, cavalry remained predominantly lance-armed; gendarmes with the heavy knightly lance and lighter cavalry with a variety of lighter lances. By the 1540s, however, pistol-armed cavalry called reiters were beginning to make their mark. Cavalry armed with pistols and other lighter firearms, along with a sword, had virtually replaced lance armed cavalry in Western Europe by the beginning of the 17th century.

Ultimately, the spear proper was rendered obsolete on the battlefield. Its last flowering was the half-pike or spontoon, a shortened version of the pike carried by officers of various ranks. While originally a weapon, this came to be seen more as a badge of office, or &quot;leading staff&quot; by which troops were directed. The half-pike, sometimes known as a boarding pike, was also used as a weapon on board ships until the late 19th century.

===Middle East===
====Modern era====

Muslim warriors used a spear that was called an &quot;az-zaġāyah&quot;. Berbers pronounced it &quot;zaġāya&quot;, but the English term, derived from the Old French via Berber, is &quot;assegai&quot;. It is a polearm used for throwing or hurling, usually a light spear or javelin made of hard wood and pointed with a forged iron tip. The &quot;az-zaġāyah&quot; played an important role during the Islamic conquest as well as during later periods, well into the 20th century. A longer pole &quot;az-zaġāyah&quot; was being used as a hunting weapon from horseback. The &quot;az-zaġāyah&quot; was widely used. It existed in various forms in areas stretching from Southern Africa to the Indian subcontinent, although these places already had their own variants of the spear. This javelin was the weapon of choice during the &quot;Fulani jihad&quot; as well as during the Mahdist War in Sudan. It is still being used by certain wandering Sufi ascetics &quot;(Derwishes)&quot;.

===Asia===
====China====

In the Chinese martial arts, the Chinese spear (Qiang 槍) is popularly known as the &quot;king of weapons&quot;. The spear is listed in the group of the four major weapons (along with the gun (staff), dao (a single-edged blade similar to a sabre), and the jian (sword)).

Spears were used first as hunting weapons amongst the ancient Chinese. They became popular as infantry weapons during the Warring States and Qin era, when spearmen were used as especially highly disciplined soldiers in organized group attacks. When used in formation fighting, spearmen would line up their large rectangular or circular shields in a shieldwall manner. The Qin also employed long spears (more akin to a pike) in formations similar to Swiss pikemen in order to ward off cavalry. The Han Empire would use similar tactics as its Qin predecessors. Halberds, polearms, and dagger axes were also common weapons during this time.

Spears were also common weaponry for Warring States, Qin, and Han era cavalry units. During these eras, the spear would develop into a longer lance-like weapon used for cavalry charges.
There are many words in Chinese that would be classified as a spear in English. The &quot;Mao&quot; is the predecessor of the &quot;Qiang&quot;. The first bronze &quot;Mao&quot; appeared in the Shang dynasty. This weapon was less prominent on the battlefield than the &quot;ge&quot; (dagger-axe). In some archaeological examples two tiny holes or ears can be found in the blade of the spearhead near the socket, these holes were presumably used to attach tassels, much like modern day wushu spears.

In the early Shang, the &quot;Mao&quot; appeared to have a relatively short shaft as well as a relatively narrow shaft as opposed to &quot;Mao&quot; in the later Shang and Western Zhou period. Some &quot;Mao&quot; from this era are heavily decorated as is evidenced by a Warring States period &quot;Mao&quot; from the Ba Shu area.

In the Han dynasty the &quot;Mao&quot; and the &quot;Ji&quot; (戟 &quot;Ji&quot; can be loosely defined as a halberd) rose to prominence in the military. Interesting to note is that the amount of iron Mao-heads found exceeds the number of bronze heads. By the end of the Han dynasty (Eastern Han) the process of replacement of the iron &quot;Mao&quot; had been completed and the bronze &quot;Mao&quot; had been rendered completely obsolete. After the Han dynasty toward the Sui and Tang dynasties the &quot;Mao&quot; used by cavalry were fitted with much longer shafts, as is mentioned above. During this era, the use of the &quot;Shuo&quot; (矟) was widespread among the footmen. The &quot;Shuo&quot; can be likened to a pike or simply a long spear.
After the Tang dynasty, the popularity of the &quot;Mao&quot; declined and was replaced by the &quot;Qiang&quot; (枪). The Tang dynasty divided the &quot;Qiang&quot; in four categories: &quot;一曰漆枪， 二曰木枪， 三曰白杆枪， 四曰扑头枪。” Roughly translated the four categories are: Qi (a kind of wood) Spears, Wooden Spears, Bai Gan (A kind of wood) Spears and Pu Tou Qiang. The Qiang that were produced in the Song and Ming dynasties consisted of four major parts: Spearhead, Shaft, End Spike and Tassel. The types of Qiang that exist are many. Among the types there are cavalry Qiang that were the length of one &quot;zhang&quot; (approximately ), Litte-Flower Spears (Xiao Hua Qiang 小花枪) that are the length of one person and their arm extended above his head, double hooked spears, single hooked spears, ringed spears and many more.

There is some confusion as to how to distinguish the &quot;Qiang&quot; from the &quot;Mao&quot;, as they are obviously very similar. Some people say that a &quot;Mao&quot; is longer than a &quot;Qiang&quot;, others say that the main difference is between the stiffness of the shaft, where the &quot;Qiang&quot; would be flexible and the &quot;Mao&quot; would be stiff. Scholars seem to lean toward the latter explanation more than the former. Because of the difference in the construction of the &quot;Mao&quot; and the &quot;Qiang&quot;, the usage is also different, though there is no definitive answer as to what exactly the differences are between the &quot;Mao&quot; and the &quot;Qiang&quot;.

====India====

Spears are known as Bhala in Indian languages. Spears in the Indian society were used both in missile and non-missile form, both by cavalry and foot-soldiers. Mounted spear-fighting was practiced using with a , ball-tipped wooden lance called a &quot;bothati&quot;, the end of which was covered in dye so that hits may be confirmed. Spears were constructed from a variety of materials such as the &quot;sang&quot; made completely of steel, and the &quot;ballam&quot; which had a bamboo shaft.

The Arab presence in Sindh and the Mameluks of Delhi introduced the Middle Eastern javelin into India.

The Rajputs wielded a type of spear for infantrymen which had a club integrated into the spearhead, and a pointed butt end. Other spears had forked blades, several spear-points, and numerous other innovations. One particular spear unique to India was the &quot;vita&quot; or corded lance.

Used by the Maratha Army, it had a rope connecting the spear with the user&#x27;s wrist, allowing the weapon to be thrown and pulled back. The &quot;Vel&quot; is a type of spear or lance, originated in Southern India, primarily used by Tamils.

Sikh Nihangs sometimes carry a spear even today. Spears were used in conflicts and training by armed paramilitary units such as the razakars of Nizams of Hyderabad State as late as the second half of the 20th century.

====Japan====
The hoko spear was used in ancient Japan sometime between the Yayoi period and the Heian period, but it became unpopular as early samurai often acted as horseback archers. Medieval Japan employed spears again for infantrymen to use, but it was not until the 11th century in that samurai began to prefer spears over bows. Several polearms were used in the Japanese theatres; the naginata was a glaive-like weapon with a long, curved blade popularly among the samurai and the Buddhist warrior-monks, often used against cavalry; the yari was a longer polearm, with a straight-bladed spearhead, which became the weapon of choice of both the samurai and the ashigaru (footmen) during the Warring States Era; the horseback samurai used shorter yari for his single-armed combat; on the other hand, ashigaru infantries used long yari (similar with European pike) for their massed combat formation.

====Philippines====
Filipino spears (sibat) were used as both a weapon and a tool throughout the Philippines. It is also called a &quot;bangkaw&quot; (after the Bankaw Revolt.), &quot;sumbling&quot; or &quot;palupad&quot; in the islands of Visayas and Mindanao. Sibat are typically made from rattan, either with a sharpened tip or a head made from metal. These heads may either be single-edged, double-edged or barbed. Styles vary according to function and origin. For example, a sibat designed for fishing may not be the same as those used for hunting.

The spear was used as the primary weapon in expeditions and battles against neighbouring island kingdoms and it became famous during the 1521 Battle of Mactan, where the chieftain Lapu Lapu of Cebu fought against Spanish forces led by Ferdinand Magellan who was subsequently killed.

===Africa===

==== South Africa ====

The various types of the assegai (a light spear or javelin made of wood and pointed with iron or fire-hardened tip) were used throughout Africa and it was the most common weapon used before the introduction of firearms. The Zulu, Xhosa and other Nguni tribes of South Africa were renowned for their use of the assegai.
Shaka of the Zulu invented a shorter stabbing spear with a shaft and a larger, broader blade one foot (0.3m) long. This weapon is otherwise known as the &quot;iklwa&quot; or &quot;ixwa&quot;, after the sound that was heard as it was withdrawn from the victim&#x27;s wound. The traditional spear was not abandoned, but was used to range attack enemy formations before closing in for close quarters battle with the iklwa. This tactical combination originated during Shaka&#x27;s military reforms. This weapon was typically used with one hand while the off hand held a cowhide shield for protection.

==== Egypt ====
Similar to most armies of their period, Ancient Egyptian forces were centered around the use of the spear. In battle, spearmen would be armed with a bronze-tipped spear (dja) and shield (ikem), which were used in elaborate formations much like Greek and Roman forces. Before the Hyksos invasion into Egypt, wooden spears were used, which were prone to splinter, but the influx of a new population brought innovations around bronze technology. Unlike other cultures who wielded spears at this time, the Egyptians did not treat their javelins (around 1 meter to 3.3 feet long) as disposable, using them both for thrusting and throwing.

===The Americas===
====West Mexico and South America (Pre-Colombia)====
As advanced metallurgy was largely unknown in pre-Columbian America outside of Western Mexico and South America, most weapons in Meso-America were made of wood or obsidian. This did not mean that they were less lethal, as obsidian may be sharpened to become many times sharper than steel. Meso-American spears varied greatly in shape and size. While the Aztecs preferred the sword-like macuahuitl clubs for fighting, the advantage of a far-reaching thrusting weapon was recognised, and a large portion of the army would carry the tepoztopilli into battle. The tepoztopilli was a polearm, and to judge from depictions in various Aztec codices, it was roughly the height of a man, with a broad wooden head about twice the length of the users&#x27; palm or shorter, edged with razor-sharp obsidian blades which were deeply set in grooves carved into the head, and cemented in place with bitumen or plant resin as an adhesive. The tepoztopilli was able both to thrust and slash effectively.

Throwing spears also were used extensively in Meso-American warfare, usually with the help of an atlatl. Throwing spears were typically shorter and more stream-lined than the tepoztopilli, and some had obsidian edges for greater penetration.

====Native Americans====

Typically, most spears made by Native Americans were created from materials surrounding their communities. Usually, the shaft of the spear was made with a wooden stick while the head of the spear was fashioned from arrowheads, pieces of metal such as copper, or a bone that had been sharpened. Spears were a preferred weapon by many since it was inexpensive to create, could more easily be taught to others, and could be made quickly and in large quantities.

Native Americans used the buffalo pound method to kill buffalo, which required a hunter to dress as a buffalo and lure one into a ravine where other hunters were hiding. Once the buffalo appeared, the other hunters would kill him with spears. A variation of this technique, called the buffalo jump, was when a runner would lead the animals towards a cliff. As the buffalo got close to the cliff, other members of the tribe would jump out from behind rocks or trees and scare the buffalo over the cliff. Other hunters would be waiting at the bottom of the cliff to spear the animal to death.

==Hunting==
One of the earliest forms of killing prey for humans, hunting game with a spear and spear fishing continues to this day as both a means of catching food and as a cultural activity. Some of the most common prey for early humans were megafauna such as mammoths which were hunted with various kinds of spear. One theory for the Quaternary extinction event was that most of these animals were hunted to extinction by humans with spears. Even after the invention of other hunting weapons such as the bow and sling, the spear continued to be used, either as a projectile weapon or used by hand, such as in bear hunting and boar hunting.

===Types===

* Barred spears: A barred spear has a crossbar beneath the blade, to prevent too deep a penetration of the spear into an animal. The bar may be forged as part of the spearhead or may be more loosely tied by means of loops below the blade. Barred spears are known from the Bronze Age, but the first historical record of their use in Europe is found in the writings of Xenophon in the 5th century BC. Examples also are shown in Roman art. In the Middle Ages, a winged or lugged war-spear was developed (see above), but the later Middle Ages saw the development of specialised types, such as the boar-spear and the bear-spear. The boar-spear could be used both on foot or horseback.
* Javelin
* Harpoon
* Trident

===Modern revival===
Spear hunting fell out of favor in most of Europe in the 18th century, but continued in Germany, enjoying a revival in the 1930s. Spear hunting is still practiced in the United States. Animals taken are primarily wild boar and deer, although trophy animals as large as Cape Buffalo have been hunted with spears. Alligators are hunted in Florida with a type of harpoon.

In underwater settings, the practice of sport fishing with spearguns is also quite prominent. The invention of the speargun is attributed to either Alec Kramarenko in the mid-1930s or Georges Beuchat in 1947. 

==Gymnastics==
One of the gymnastic exercises performed by the ancient Greeks was the throwing of a spear, referred to as ἀκυντισμός.

==In myth and legend==

===Symbolism===

Like many weapons, a spear may also be a symbol of power.

The Celts would symbolically destroy a dead warrior&#x27;s spear either to prevent its use by another or as a sacrificial offering.

In classical Greek mythology Zeus&#x27; bolts of lightning may be interpreted as a symbolic spear. Some would carry that interpretation to the spear that frequently is associated with Athena, interpreting her spear as a symbolic connection to some of Zeus&#x27; power beyond the Aegis once he rose to replacing other deities in the pantheon. Athena was depicted with a spear prior to that change in myths, however. Chiron&#x27;s wedding-gift to Peleus when he married the nymph Thetis in classical Greek mythology, was an ashen spear as the nature of ashwood with its straight grain made it an ideal choice of wood for a spear.

The Romans and their early enemies would force prisoners to walk underneath a &#x27;yoke of spears&#x27;, which humiliated them. The yoke would consist of three spears, two upright with a third tied between them at a height which made the prisoners stoop. It has been suggested that the arrangement has a magical origin, a way to trap evil spirits. The word &quot;subjugate&quot; has its origins in this practice (from Latin &quot;sub&quot; = under, &quot;jugum&quot; = yoke).

In Norse mythology, the god Odin&#x27;s spear (named Gungnir) was made by the sons of Ivaldi. It had the special property that it never missed its mark. During the War with the Vanir, Odin symbolically threw Gungnir into the Vanir host. This practice of symbolically casting a spear into the enemy ranks at the start of a fight was sometimes used in historic clashes, to seek Odin&#x27;s support in the coming battle. In Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Siegfried&quot;, the haft of Gungnir is said to be from the &quot;World-Tree&quot; Yggdrasil.

Other spears of religious significance are the Holy Lance and the Lúin of Celtchar, believed by some to have vast mystical powers.

Sir James George Frazer in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; noted the phallic nature of the spear and suggested that in the Arthurian legends the spear or lance functioned as a symbol of male fertility, paired with the Grail (as a symbol of female fertility).
The Hindu god of war Murugan is worshipped by Tamils in the form of the spear called &quot;Vel&quot;, which is his primary weapon.

The term &quot;spear&quot; is also used (in a somewhat archaic manner) to describe the male line of a family, as opposed to the distaff or female line.
