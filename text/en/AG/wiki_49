<text>&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from the &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;, a poem written by American lawyer Francis Scott Key on September 14, 1814, after he witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort after the battle.

The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a social club in London. Smith&#x27;s song, &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot; (or &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot;), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. This setting, renamed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, soon became a popular patriotic song. With a range of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing, in part because the melody sung today is the soprano part. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today with the second to fourth being rarely sung.

&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was first recognized for official use by the United States Navy in 1889. On March 3, 1931, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution () making the song the official national anthem of the United States, which President Herbert Hoover signed into law. The resolution is now codified at .

==History==
===Francis Scott Key&#x27;s lyrics===

On August 28, 1814, William Beanes, a physician who resided in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, was arrested by British forces in his home after the Burning of Washington and the Raid on Alexandria. A friend of Key&#x27;s, Beanes was accused of aiding the detention of several British Army stragglers who were ransacking local homesteads in search of food.

On September 2, 1814, Key wrote a letter from his home in Georgetown to his mother, ending with:

I am going in the morning to Baltimore to proceed in a flag-vessel to Genl Ross. Old Dr Beanes of Marlbro&#x27; is taken prisoner by the Enemy, who threaten to carry him off – Some of his friends have urged me to apply for a flag &amp; go &amp; try to procure his release. I hope to return in about 8 or 10 days, though [it] is uncertain, as I do not know where to find the fleet. – As soon as I get back I hope I shall be able to set out for Fred[ericksburg] – ...

Under sanction from President Madison, on September 3, Key traveled by land from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore, where he arrived on the morning of September 4. He located Col. John Stuart Skinner, an American agent for prisoners of war, who leased a sloop-rigged packet ship belonging to John and Benjamin Ferguson, brothers who owned a cargo and passenger service between Baltimore and Norfolk. The ship had a nine-man crew and was captained by a co-owner, John Ferguson. They sailed from Baltimore the next day (September 5) out through the Patapsco River and then south, down the Chesapeake Bay. As recorded in the British ships&#x27; logs, on September 6, they had rendezvoused with HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and several British troopships near the mouth of the Patuxant. There they learned Beanes was aboard HMS &quot;Tonnant&quot; further down in the Bay. Rear Admiral Pulteney Malcolm assigned the frigate &quot;Hebrus&quot; to escort the American sloop to Tangier Island, where he thought &quot;Tonnant&quot; was located.

On September 7, around noon, they spotted &quot;Tonnant&quot; near the mouth of the Potomac. The flagship then anchored and brought Key and Skinner aboard.

It was aboard &quot;Tonnant&quot;, after dinner, that Skinner and Key secured the release of Beanes after conversing with Major-General Robert Ross and Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Ross initially refused to release Beanes, but relented after reading letters, brought by Key, written by wounded British prisoners of war praising American doctors for their kind treatment. Because Key and Skinner had overheard details of the plans for the attack on Baltimore, they were prevented from going ashore until after the battle, several days later.

From &quot;Tonnant&quot;, Key, Skinner, and Beanes were transferred to the frigate HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; on the morning of September 8. The fleet then slowly moved up the Chesapeake toward Baltimore. The truce vessel was in tow with &quot;Surprise&quot;. On September 11, off the North Point peninsula, Colonel Skinner insisted that they be transferred back to their own truce vessel, which they were allowed to do, under guard. It was still tethered to &quot;Surprise&quot;. Admiral Cochrane then transferred his flag to the shallow-draft &quot;Surprise&quot; so he could move in with the bombardment squadron. Having advanced into the Patapsco River, the 16-ship attack force began to fire on Fort McHenry at sunrise on September 13; the bombardment would last 25 hours.

During the rainy day and through the night, Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that the fort&#x27;s smaller &quot;storm flag&quot; () continued to fly, but once the bomb and Congreve rocket barrage had stopped, he would not know how the battle had turned out until dawn. On the morning of September 14, the storm flag had been lowered and the large garrison flag () had been raised.

During the bombardment, HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; provided the &quot;rockets&#x27; red glare&quot;, while the heavy-mortar bomb ships HMS &quot;Terror&quot;, &quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;Devastation&quot;, &quot;Meteor&quot; and &quot;Aetna&quot; provided the &quot;bombs bursting in air&quot;. Around 1,500 to 1,800 bomb shells and over 700 rockets were fired at the fort but with minimal casualties and damage being done. Four men died and 24 were wounded in the fort. The ships were forced to fire from their maximum range (with minimal accuracy) to stay out of range of the fort&#x27;s formidable cannon fire.

Key was inspired by the U.S. victory and the sight of the large U.S. flag flying triumphantly above the fort. This flag (as well as the storm flag), with 15 stars and 15 stripes, had been made by Mary Young Pickersgill together with other workers in her home on Baltimore&#x27;s Pratt Street. The flag later came to be known as the Star-Spangled Banner, and is today on display in the National Museum of American History, a treasure of the Smithsonian Institution. It was restored in 1914 by Amelia Fowler, and again in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program.

Aboard the ship that morning, Key began writing his lyrics on the back of a letter he had kept in his pocket. Late afternoon on September 16, Key, Skinner and Beanes were released from the fleet and they arrived in Baltimore that evening. He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel, where he was staying. His finished manuscript was untitled and unsigned. When printed as a broadside, the next day, it was given the title &quot; of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;. It was first published nationally in &quot;The Analectic Magazine&quot;.

Much of the idea of the poem, including the flag imagery and some of the wording, is derived from an earlier song by Key, also set to the tune of &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot;. The song, known as &quot;When the Warrior Returns&quot;, was written in honor of Stephen Decatur and Charles Stewart on their return from the First Barbary War.
Since the 1990s, the anthem has become controversial due to perceived racism in the anthem&#x27;s lyrics and Key&#x27;s involvement in slavery. The anthem&#x27;s third stanza uses the phrase &quot;the hireling and slave&quot;, which had been interpreted by several commentators to refer to American slaves who escaped to the British military during the war, as Britain offered them freedom and the opportunity to join the Corps of Colonial Marines to fight against U.S. forces. Key was also a slaveholder throughout much of his life. According to &quot;The Nation&quot;, Key&#x27;s &quot;message to the blacks fighting for freedom was unmistakable—we will hunt you down and the search will leave you in terror because, when we find you, your next stop is the gloom of the grave&quot;. The reference to slaves, which was perceived as being racist towards Black Americans, purportedly prevented the song being adopted as the U.S. national anthem for almost a century.

Conversely, University of Michigan professor Mark Clague and Key&#x27;s biographer has claimed that the poem celebrates the courage of the American soldiers, both black and white, who helped defend the fortress and the city. The controversial phrase, &quot;the hireling and the slave&quot;, according to Clague, actually refers to British armed forces personnel and their American collaborators regardless of race, who are promised either death on the battlefield or, similarly to United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolution, permanent exile once the British Empire is defeated. This interpretation is consistent with what Celticist Michael Newton has written about how, during the American Revolution, &quot;slavery&quot; and &quot;oppression&quot; were routinely used as Patriot code words for continued &quot;British rule&quot; over the United States.

Also according to Clague, Francis Scott Key freed four of the seven slaves he inherited and was involved in his later years with the American Colonization Society&#x27;s practice of buying slaves and setting them free in what is now Liberia. Key&#x27;s poem, according to Clague, &quot;in no way glorifies or celebrates slavery.&quot; However, Clague&#x27;s interpretation of the song has been criticised for going against mainstream academic historical consensus, as the majority of recent scholars who have written about slavery during the War of 1812, such as Gene A. Smith, Marc Leepson and David Roediger have alleged that Key was referencing only American runaway slaves rather than late stage American Loyalists in the passage. In 2016, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; argued that &quot;[is] The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; racist? The short answer is yes, insofar as almost every older piece of American iconography cannot be rid of the stain of slavery.&quot;

===John Stafford Smith&#x27;s music===

Key gave the poem to his brother-in-law Joseph H. Nicholson who saw that the words fit the popular melody &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot;, by English composer John Stafford Smith. This was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen&#x27;s club of amateur musicians in London. Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore, who anonymously made the first known broadside printing on September 17; of these, two known copies survive.

On September 20, both the &quot;Baltimore Patriot&quot; and &quot;The American&quot; printed the song, with the note &quot;Tune: Anacreon in Heaven&quot;. The song quickly became popular; it was ultimately printed in 17 newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire. Soon after, Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;, although it was originally called &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;. Thomas Carr&#x27;s arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot;. The song&#x27;s popularity increased and its first public performance took place in October when Baltimore actor Ferdinand Durang sang it at Captain McCauley&#x27;s tavern. Washington Irving, then editor of the &quot;Analectic Magazine&quot; in Philadelphia, reprinted the song in November 1814.

By the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in popular use. Seeking a singular, standard version, President Woodrow Wilson tasked the U.S. Bureau of Education with providing that official version. In response, the Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement. Those musicians were Walter Damrosch, Will Earhart, Arnold J. Gantvoort, Oscar Sonneck and John Philip Sousa. The standardized version that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 5, 1917, in a program that included Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Carillon&quot; and Gabriel Pierné&#x27;s &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;. The concert was put on by the Oratorio Society of New York and conducted by Walter Damrosch. An official handwritten version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows all five men&#x27;s votes tallied, measure by measure.

===National anthem===
The song gained popularity throughout the 19th century, and bands played it during public events such as Independence Day celebrations.

A plaque displayed at Fort Meade, South Dakota, claims that the idea of making &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; the national anthem began on their parade ground in 1892. Colonel Caleb Carlton, post commander, established the tradition that the song be played &quot;at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts.&quot; Carlton explained the custom to Governor Sheldon of South Dakota who &quot;promised me that he would try to have the custom established among the state militia.&quot; Carlton wrote that after a similar discussion, Secretary of War Daniel S. Lamont issued an order that it &quot;be played at every Army post every evening at retreat.&quot;

In 1889, the U.S. Navy officially adopted &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; be played at military and other appropriate occasions. The playing of the song two years later during the seventh-inning stretch of Game One of the 1918 World Series, and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited as the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game, though evidence shows that the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was performed as early as 1897 at Opening Day ceremonies in Philadelphia and then more regularly at the Polo Grounds in New York City beginning in 1898. The tradition of performing the national anthem before every baseball game began in World War II.

Between 1918 and 1929, John Charles Linthicum, the U.S. congressman from Maryland at the time, introduced a series of six unsuccessful bills to officially recognize &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the national anthem.

In 1927, with the thought that &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was unsuited for a national anthem, the National Federation of Music Clubs sponsored a composition contest to nominate a national anthem. They selected the text of &quot;America The Beautiful&quot;; 901 compositions were submitted for the $1,500 prize (). Frank Damrosch, Frederick Converse, Felix Borowski, and Peter Lutkin judged the compositions but nominated no winner.

On November 3, 1929, Robert Ripley drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not!&quot;, saying &quot;Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem&quot;.

In 1930, Veterans of Foreign Wars started a petition for the United States to officially recognize &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the national anthem. Five million people signed the petition. The petition was presented to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on January 31, 1930. On the same day, Elsie Jorss-Reilley and Grace Evelyn Boudlin sang the song to the committee to refute the perception that it was too high pitched for a typical person to sing. The committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor for a vote. The House of Representatives passed the bill later that year. The Senate passed the bill on March 3, 1931. President Herbert Hoover signed the bill on March 4, 1931, officially adopting &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the national anthem of the United States of America. As currently codified, the United States Code states that &quot;[t]he composition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem.&quot; Although all four stanzas of the poem officially compose the National Anthem, only the first stanza is generally sung, the other three being much less well known.

Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;, whose melody is identical to &quot;God Save the King&quot;, the United Kingdom&#x27;s national anthem, also served as a &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem. Following the War of 1812 and subsequent U.S. wars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among them &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, which itself was being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States.

In the fourth verse, Key&#x27;s 1814 published version of the poem is written as, &quot;And this be our motto-&quot;In God is our trust!&quot;&quot; In 1956 when &#x27;In God We Trust&#x27; was under consideration to be adopted as the national motto of the United States by the US Congress, the words of the fourth verse of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; were brought up in arguments supporting adoption of the motto.

==Modern history==
===Performances===

The song is notoriously difficult for nonprofessionals to sing because of its wide rangea twelfth. Humorist Richard Armour referred to the song&#x27;s difficulty in his book &quot;It All Started With Columbus&quot;:

Professional and amateur singers have been known to forget the words, which is one reason the song is sometimes pre-recorded and lip-synced. Pop singer Christina Aguilera performed wrong lyrics to the song prior to Super Bowl XLV, replacing the song&#x27;s fourth line, &quot;o&#x27;er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming&quot;, with an alteration of the second line, &quot;what so proudly we watched at the twilight&#x27;s last gleaming&quot;. Other times the issue is avoided by having the performer(s) play the anthem instrumentally instead of singing it. The pre-recording of the anthem has become standard practice at some ballparks, such as Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park, according to the SABR publication &quot;The Fenway Project&quot;.

&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; has been performed regularly at the beginning of NFL games since the end of WWII by order of NFL commissioner Elmer Layden. The song has also been intermittently performed at baseball games since after WWI. The National Hockey League and Major League Soccer both require venues in both the U.S. and Canada to perform both the Canadian and U.S. national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries (with the &quot;away&quot; anthem being performed first). It is also usual for both U.S. and Canadian anthems (done in the same way as the NHL and MLS) to be played at Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the Toronto Raptors respectively, the only Canadian teams in those two major U.S. sports leagues, and in All Star Games in MLB, the NBA, and the NHL. The Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League, which play in a city on the Canada–US border and have a substantial Canadian fan base, play both anthems before all home games regardless of where the visiting team is based. Recently with the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB playing international games outside of the United States and Canada, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; has been performed alongside the host country&#x27;s national anthem.

Two especially unusual performances of the song took place in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. On September 12, 2001, Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom, broke with tradition and allowed the Band of the Coldstream Guards to perform the anthem at Buckingham Palace, London, at the ceremonial Changing of the Guard, as a gesture of support for Britain&#x27;s ally. The following day at a St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral memorial service, the Queen joined in the singing of the anthem, an unprecedented occurrence. The Star Spangled Banner was played by the Coldstream Guards again at Windsor Castle on the 20th anniversary of the attacks.

During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, the anthem was sung by protesters demonstrating outside the U.S. consulate-general in an appeal to the U.S. government to help them with their cause.

===200th anniversary celebrations===
The 200th anniversary of the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; occurred in 2014 with various special events occurring throughout the United States. A particularly significant celebration occurred during the week of September 10–16 in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Highlights included playing of a new arrangement of the anthem arranged by John Williams and participation of President Barack Obama on Defenders Day, September 12, 2014, at Fort McHenry. In addition, the anthem bicentennial included a youth music celebration including the presentation of the National Anthem Bicentennial Youth Challenge winning composition written by Noah Altshuler.

===Adaptations===
The first popular music performance of the anthem heard by the mainstream U.S. was by Puerto Rican singer and guitarist José Feliciano. He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow, blues-style rendition of the song at Tiger Stadium in Detroit before game five of the 1968 World Series, between Detroit and St. Louis. This rendition started contemporary &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; controversies. The response from many in the Vietnam War-era U.S. was generally negative. Despite the controversy, Feliciano&#x27;s performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; heard in the years since. One week after Feliciano&#x27;s performance, the anthem was in the news again when U.S. athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted controversial raised fists at the 1968 Olympics while the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; played at a medal ceremony.

Rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix often included a solo instrumental performance at concerts from 1968 to his death in 1970. Using high gain and distortion amplification effects and the vibrato arm on his guitar, Hendrix was able to simulate the sounds of rockets and bombs at the points when the lyrics are normally heard. One such performance at the Woodstock music festival in 1969 was a highlight of the event&#x27;s 1970 documentary film, becoming &quot;part of the sixties Zeitgeist&quot;. When asked about negative reactions to his &quot;unorthodox&quot; treatment of the anthem, Hendrix, who served briefly in the U.S. Army, responded &quot;I&#x27;m American so I played it... Unorthodox? I thought it was beautiful, but there you go.&quot; The Woodstock version by Jimi Hendrix was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2009.

Marvin Gaye gave a soul-influenced performance at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game and Whitney Houston gave a soulful rendition before Super Bowl XXV in 1991, which was released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in 2001 (along with José Feliciano, the only times the national anthem has been on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100). Roseanne Barr gave a controversial performance of the anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. The comedian belted out a screechy rendition of the song, and afterward, she mocked ballplayers by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. The performance offended some, including the sitting U.S. president, George H. W. Bush. Steven Tyler also caused some controversy in 2001 (at the Indianapolis 500, to which he later issued a public apology) and again in 2012 (at the AFC Championship Game) with a cappella renditions of the song with changed lyrics.

At Super Bowl XLVIII&#x27;s pre-game ceremonies in 2014, soprano Renée Fleming became the first opera singer to perform the National Anthem at a football game, and her emotional, groundbreaking performance (one of the most critically acclaimed renditions of all time) led the Fox network to the highest ratings of any program in the company&#x27;s history and remains so today. In 2016, Aretha Franklin performed a rendition before the nationally-televised Minnesota Vikings-Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Day game lasting more than four minutes and featuring a host of improvisations. It was one of Franklin&#x27;s last public appearances before her 2018 death. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie gave a controversial performance of the anthem in 2018. Critics likened her rendition to a jazzy &quot;sexed-up&quot; version of the anthem, which was considered highly inappropriate, with her performance compared to that of Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s 1962 performance of &quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. President&quot;. Fergie later apologized for her performance of the song, stating that &quot;I&#x27;m a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn&#x27;t strike the intended tone&quot;.

In March 2005, a government-sponsored program, the National Anthem Project, was launched after a Harris Interactive poll showed many adults knew neither the lyrics nor the history of the anthem.

==Lyrics==

&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; has four verses, although the second through fourth verses are not commonly performed.

Alternative lyrics

In a version hand-written by Francis Scott Key in 1840, the third line reads: &quot;Whose bright stars and broad stripes, through the clouds of the fight&quot;.

Fifth stanza

In 1861, poet Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. penned an unofficial fifth verse during the beginning of the American Civil War, looking hopefully at the emancipation of slaves.

==References in film, television, literature==
Several films have their titles taken from the song&#x27;s lyrics. These include the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; episode &quot;Red Rocket&#x27;s Glare&quot;; the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot;; two films titled &quot;Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot; (2000 and 2005); two made-for-TV features titled &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot; (1990 and 2000); two films titled &quot;So Proudly We Hail&quot; (1943 and 1990); a feature film (1977) and a short (2005) and a novel titled &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot;; &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Red Glare&quot;; and four films titled &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; (1949, 1986, 2004, and 2006). A 1936 short titled &quot;The Song of a Nation&quot; from Warner Bros. Pictures shows a version of the origin of the song. The title of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s 1980 short story &quot;No Refuge Could Save&quot; is a reference to the song&#x27;s third verse, and the obscurity of this verse is a major plot point.

==Customs and federal law==

When the U.S. national anthem was first recognized by law in 1931, there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing. On June 22, 1942, the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing, while others should simply stand at attention, men removing their hats. The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem, but not if the flag was not present. On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in uniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men removing their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions, but differentiating between &quot;those in uniform&quot; and &quot;members of the Armed Forces and veterans&quot; who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegiance versus the National Anthem, throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem, and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart.

Since 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code ) states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present including those in uniform should stand at attention; non-military service individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart; members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute; military service persons not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since allows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.

The text of is suggestive and not regulatory in nature. Failure to follow the suggestions is not a violation of the law. This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance. For example, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not sing the national anthem, though they are taught that standing is an &quot;ethical decision&quot; that individual believers must make based on their conscience.

==Translations==
As a result of immigration to the United States by many non-English-speaking peoples, the lyrics of America&#x27;s national anthem have seen multiple literary translations into immigrant languages. In 1861, very likely to help encourage German-American military service in the Union Army and the United States Navy during the American Civil War, the lyrics were translated into the German language in the United States and widely circulated. The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish-language version from 1919. It has since been translated into Hebrew and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants, Latin American Spanish (with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006), Louisiana French by the Cajun people, Irish, and Scottish Gaelic. The third verse of the anthem has also been translated into Latin.

With regard to the indigenous languages of North America and U.S. possessions in Polynesia, there are further translations into Navajo Cherokee, and Samoan.

==Protests==
===1968 Olympics Black Power salute===
The 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City. After having won gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200-meter running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Each athlete raised a black-gloved fist, and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, &quot;Silent Gesture&quot;, Smith stated that the gesture was not a &quot;Black Power&quot; salute, but a &quot;human rights salute&quot;. The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern Olympic Games.

===Protests against racism and police brutality (2016–present)===

Protests against police brutality and racism by kneeling on one knee during the national anthem began in the National Football League after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, in response to police brutality in the United States, before his team&#x27;s third preseason game of 2016. Kaepernick sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed. In particular, protests focus on the discussion of slavery (and mercenaries) in the third verse of the anthem, in which some have interpreted the lyrics as condemning slaves that had joined the British in an effort to earn their freedom. Since Kaepernick&#x27;s protest, other athletes have joined in the protests. In the 2017 season, after President Donald Trump&#x27;s condemnation of the kneeling, which included calling for players (whom he reportedly also referred to by various profanities) to be fired, many NFL players responded by protesting during the national anthem that week.
After the police-involved killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, when the 2019-2020 NBA season resumed play in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of players and coaches kneeled during the national anthem through the end of the season. In San Francisco, the statue of Francis Scott Key—the nation&#x27;s first memorial to the anthem&#x27;s lyricist Key, a slaveowner—was toppled by protestors on June 19, 2020 and in June 2021 was replaced by 350 black steel sculptures that honor the first 350 Africans kidnapped and forced onto a slave ship headed across the Atlantic from Angola in 1619.

===California chapter of the NAACP call to remove the national anthem===
In November 2017, the California Chapter of the NAACP called on Congress to remove &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the national anthem. Alice Huffman, California NAACP president, said: &quot;It&#x27;s racist; it doesn&#x27;t represent our community, it&#x27;s anti-black.&quot; The rarely-sung third stanza of the anthem contains the words &quot;No refuge could save the hireling and slave, from the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave&quot;, which some interpret as racist. The organization was still seeking a representative to sponsor the legislation in Congress at the time of its announcement.

<doc id="31065" wikidata="Q338611" url="?curid=31065" title="Third Council of the Lateran">
<text>The Third Council of the Lateran met in Rome in March 1179. Pope Alexander III presided and 302 bishops attended. The Catholic Church regards it as the eleventh ecumenical council.

By agreement reached at the Peace of Venice in 1177 the bitter conflict between Alexander III and Emperor Frederick I was brought to an end. When Pope Adrian IV died in 1159, the divided cardinals elected two popes: Roland of Siena, who took the name of Alexander III, and Octavian of Rome who, though nominated by fewer cardinals, was supported by Frederick and assumed the name of Pope Victor IV. Frederick, wishing to remove all that stood in the way of his authority in Italy, declared war upon the Italian states and especially the Church which was enjoying great authority. A serious schism arose out of this conflict, and after Victor IV&#x27;s death in 1164, two further antipopes were nominated in opposition to Alexander III: Paschal III (1164–1168) and Callistus III (1168–1178). Eventually, at the Peace of Venice, when Alexander gained victory, he promised Frederick that he would summon an ecumenical council. 

Besides removing the remains of the recent schism, the Council condemned the Cathar heresies and pushed for the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline. It also became the first general Council of the Church to legislate against sodomy. Three sessions were held, on 5, 14, and 19 March, in which 27 canons were promulgated. 

The most important of these were:

*Canon 1. In order to prevent the possibility of future schisms, only cardinals were to possess the right to elect a pope. In addition a two-thirds majority was to be required in order for the election to be valid. If any candidate should declare himself pope without receiving the required majority, he and his supporters were to be excommunicated.
*Canon 2 declared null and void those ordinations performed by the antipopes Octavian (Victor IV), Guy of Crema (Paschal III), and John de Struma (Callixtus III).
*Canon 3 forbade the promotion of anyone to a parish before the age of 25 and to the episcopate before the age of 30.
*Canon 5 forbade the ordination of clerics not provided with any means of proper support.
*Canon 7 forbade the charging of money to conduct burials, bless a marriage or indeed the celebration of any of the sacraments.
*Canon 11 forbade clerics to have women in their houses or to visit the monasteries of nuns without a good reason; declared that married clergy should lose their benefices; and decreed that priests who engaged in &quot;that unnatural vice for which the wrath of God came down upon the sons of disobedience and destroyed the five cities with fire&quot; (sodomy) should be deposed from clerical office and required to do penance—while laymen should be excommunicated.
*Canon 18 required every cathedral church to appoint a master to teach the clerics and the poor scholars of the church; this action helped launch the cathedral schools that later became universities. It also regulated the license to teach (&quot;licentia docendi&quot;), stating &quot;let no one demand any money for a licence to teach, or under cover of some custom seek anything from teachers, or forbid anyone to teach who is suitable and has sought a licence.&quot; Selling the license to teach could prevent the progress of churches.
*Canon 19 declared excommunication for those who tried to tax churches and clergy without the consent of the bishop.
*Canon 23 concerns the proper organisation of accommodation for lepers.
*Canon 25 excommunicated those who engage in usury.
*Canon 26 forbade Jews and Muslims from having Christian servants and states that the evidence of Christians is always to be accepted against Jews. It also excommunicates any Christian who lives with a Jew or Muslim.
*Canon 27 stressed the duty of princes to repress heresy and condemned &quot;the Brabantians, Aragonese, Basques, Navarrese, and others who practice such cruelty toward Christians that they respect neither churches nor monasteries, spare neither widows nor orphans, neither age nor sex, but after the manner of pagans, destroy and lay waste everything&quot; (&quot;De Brabantionibus et Aragonensibus, Navariis, Bascolis, Coterellis et Triaverdinis, qui tantam in Christianos immanitatem exercent, ut nec ecclesiis, nec monasteriis deferant, non viduis, et pupillis, non senibus, et pueris, nec cuilibet parcant aetati, aut sexui, sed more paganorum omnia perdant, et vastent&quot;).

Among the many attendees at the Council was William of Tyre, the historian and, at the time, archbishop of Tyre. William was sent by Baldwin IV as the representative of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and wrote about the journey to the Council in his history. The Kingdom of Hungary was represented by Andrew, Archbishop of Kalocsa.

Archbishop-elect Berthold of Bremen attended, expecting to have his election confirmed although he had not taken major orders. His presence was resented by the other archbishops and the lobbying of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony succeeded in getting his election quashed. His former teacher, Girard la Pucelle, spoke unavailingly in his defence.

==Effects==
Due to the 26th canon forbidding Christians from dwelling among Jews and Muslims, segregation laws were occasionally enforced by European governments against Jews, creating Jewish quarters. Later in Venice, the term ghetto was born from a segregated Jewish quarter.

<text>The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution is a 1995 book by John Brockman which discusses the work of several well-known scientists who are directly communicating their new, sometimes provocative, ideas to the general public. John Brockman has continued the themes of &#x27;The Third Culture&#x27; in the website of the Edge Foundation, where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English.

The title of the book refers to C. P. Snow&#x27;s 1959 work &quot;The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution&quot;, which described the conflict between the cultures of the humanities and science.

== Contents ==
Contributions by twenty-three authors were included in the 1995 book:
* physicist Paul Davies
* biologist Richard Dawkins 
* philosopher Daniel Dennett
* paleontologist Niles Eldredge
* chaos theorist J. Doyne Farmer
* theoretical physicist Murray Gell-Mann
* biologist Brian Goodwin
* geologist/biologist Stephen Jay Gould
* physicist Alan Guth
* inventor W. Daniel Hillis
* theoretical psychologist Nicholas Humphrey
* geneticist Steve Jones
* biologist Stuart Kauffman
* complex systems specialist Christopher Langton
* biologist Lynn Margulis
* mathematician and computer scientist Marvin Minsky
* mathematical physicist Roger Penrose
* cognitive scientist Steven Pinker
* theoretical astrophysicist Martin Rees
* cognitive scientist Roger Schank
* theoretical physicist Lee Smolin
* biologist Francisco Varela
* evolutionary biologist George C. Williams

The book influenced the reception of popular scientific literature in parts of the world beyond the United States. In Germany, the book inspired several newspapers to integrate scientific reports into their &quot;Feuilleton&quot; or &quot;culture&quot; sections (such as the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;). At the same time, the assertions of the book were discussed as a source of controversy, especially the implicit assertion that &quot;third culture thinking&quot; is mainly an American development. Critics acknowledge that, whereas in the English-speaking cultures there is a large tradition of scientists writing popular books, such tradition was absent for a long period in the German and French languages, with journalists often filling the gap. However, some decades ago there were also scientists, like the physicists Heisenberg and Schrödinger and the psychologist Piaget, who fulfill the criteria Brockman named for &quot;third culture.&quot; The German author Gabor Paal suggested that the idea of the &quot;third culture&quot; is a rather modern version of what Hegel called Realphilosophie (&quot;philosophy of the real&quot;).

Also, already during the interwar period, Otto Neurath and other members of the Vienna Circle strongly propagated the need for both the unity of science and the popularization of new scientific concepts. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle&#x27;s members left for the United States where they taught in several universities, causing their philosophical ideas to spread in the Anglo-Saxon world throughout the 1930s–1940s.

<text>The Importance of Being Earnest, a Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde, the last of his four drawing-room plays, following &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1892), &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; (1893) and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895). First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James&#x27;s Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy depicting the tangled affairs of two young who lead double lives to evade unwanted social obligations, both assuming the name Ernest while wooing the two young women of their affections.

The play, celebrated for its wit and repartee, parodies contemporary dramatic norms, gently satirises late Victorian manners, and introduces – in addition to the two pairs of young lovers – the formidable Lady Bracknell, the fussy governess Miss Prism and the benign and scholarly Canon Chasuble. Contemporary reviews in Britain and overseas praised the play&#x27;s humour, although some critics had reservations about its lack of social messages.

The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde&#x27;s career but was followed within weeks by his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde&#x27;s lover, unsuccessfully schemed to throw a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright at the end of the performance. This feud led to a series of legal trials from March to May 1895 which resulted in Wilde&#x27;s conviction and imprisonment for homosexual acts. Despite the play&#x27;s early success, Wilde&#x27;s disgrace caused it to be closed in May after 86 performances. After his release from prison in 1897 he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no more comic or dramatic works.

From the early 20th century onwards the play has been revived frequently in English-speaking countries and elsewhere. After the first production, which featured George Alexander, Allan Aynesworth and Irene Vanbrugh among others, many actors have been associated with the play, including Mabel Terry-Lewis, John Gielgud, Edith Evans, Margaret Rutherford, Martin Jarvis, Nigel Havers and Judi Dench. The role of the redoubtable Lady Bracknell has sometimes been played by men. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; has been adapted for radio from the 1920s onwards and for television since the 1930s, filmed for the cinema on three occasions (directed by Anthony Asquith in 1952, Kurt Baker in 1992 and Oliver Parker in 2002) and turned into operas and musicals.
==Synopsis==
The play is set in &quot;The Present&quot; (1895 at the time of the premiere).
===Act I===
Algernon Moncrieff&#x27;s flat in Half Moon Street

Algernon Moncrieff, a young , is visited by a friend whom he knows by the name of Ernest Worthing. The latter has come from the country to propose to Algernon&#x27;s cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax. Algernon refuses to consent until Ernest explains why his cigarette case bears the inscription, &quot;From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack&quot;. Worthing is forced to admit to living a double life. In the country, he assumes a serious attitude for the benefit of his young ward, the heiress Cecily Cardew, and goes by the name of John or Jack, while pretending that he must worry about a wastrel younger brother in London, named Ernest. Meanwhile, he assumes the identity of the profligate Ernest when in town. Algernon confesses a similar deception: he pretends to have a sickly friend named Bunbury in the country, whom he can &quot;visit&quot; whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation. Jack refuses to tell Algernon the location of his country estate.

Gwendolen and her formidable mother, Lady Bracknell, now call on Algernon, who distracts Lady Bracknell in another room while Jack proposes to Gwendolen. She accepts but says she could not love him if his name were not Ernest. He resolves secretly to be rechristened. Discovering the two in this intimate exchange, Lady Bracknell interviews Jack as a prospective suitor for her daughter. Horrified to learn that he was adopted – having been found as a baby in a handbag deposited at Victoria Station in London – she refuses him and forbids further contact with her daughter. Gwendolen manages to covertly promise to him her undying love. As Jack gives her his address in the country, Algernon surreptitiously notes it on the cuff of his sleeve: Jack&#x27;s revelation of his pretty young ward has motivated his friend to meet her.

===Act II===
The Garden of the Manor House, Woolton

Cecily is studying with her governess, Miss Prism, in the (fictitious) village of Woolton, Hertfordshire. Algernon arrives, pretending to be Ernest Worthing, and soon charms Cecily. Long fascinated by her uncle Jack&#x27;s hitherto-absent dissolute brother, she is predisposed to fall for Algernon in his role of Ernest. Algernon plans for the rector, Dr Chasuble, to rechristen him &quot;Ernest&quot;. Jack has decided to abandon his double life. He arrives in full mourning and announces his brother&#x27;s death in Paris, from a severe chill, a story undermined by Algernon&#x27;s presence in the guise of Ernest. Gwendolen now enters, having left the Bracknells&#x27; London house without her mother&#x27;s knowledge. During the temporary absence of the two men she meets Cecily. They get along well at first, but when they learn of the other&#x27;s engagement each indignantly declares that she is the one engaged to Ernest. When Jack and Algernon reappear together, Gwendolen and Cecily realise they have been deceived; they leave the men in the garden and withdraw to the house.

===Act III===
Morning-room at the Manor House, Woolton

Gwendolen and Cecily forgive the men&#x27;s trickery. Arriving in pursuit of her daughter, Lady Bracknell is astonished to be told that Algernon and Cecily are engaged. The revelation of Cecily&#x27;s wealth soon dispels Lady Bracknell&#x27;s initial doubts over the young lady&#x27;s suitability, but any engagement is forbidden by her guardian, Jack: he will consent only if Lady Bracknell agrees to his own union with Gwendolen – something she declines to do.

The impasse is resolved by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell recognises as the person who, 28 years earlier as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy out in a perambulator from Lord Bracknell&#x27;s house and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absent-mindedly put into the perambulator the manuscript of a novel she was writing, and put the baby in a handbag, which she later left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the eldest son of Lady Bracknell&#x27;s late sister, Mrs Moncrieff, and thus Algernon&#x27;s elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as Gwendolen&#x27;s suitor.

Gwendolen continues to insist that she can love only a man named Ernest. Lady Bracknell tells Jack that, as the firstborn, he would have been named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack examines the Army Lists and discovers that his father&#x27;s name – and hence his own original christening name – was, in fact, Ernest. As the happy couples embrace – Ernest and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism – Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: &quot;My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality&quot;. He replies, &quot;On the contrary, Aunt Augusta: I&#x27;ve now realized for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

==Composition==

&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; followed the success of Wilde&#x27;s earlier drawing room plays, &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1892), &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; (1893) and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895). He spent the summer of 1894 with his family at Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where he began work on the new play.

Wilde scholars generally agree that the most important influence on the play was W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s 1877 farce &quot;Engaged&quot;, from which Wilde borrowed not only several incidents but also, in the words of Russell Jackson in his 1980 introduction to Wilde&#x27;s play, &quot;the gravity of tone demanded by Gilbert of his actors&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s first draft was so long that it filled four exercise books, and over the summer he continually revised and refined it, as he had done with his earlier plays. Among his many changes he altered the subtitle from &quot;a Serious Comedy for Trivial People&quot; to &quot;a Trivial Comedy for Serious People&quot;, and renamed the characters Lady Brancaster and Algernon Montford as Lady Bracknell and Algernon Moncrieff.

Wilde wrote the part of John Worthing with the actor-manager Charles Wyndham in mind. Wilde shared Bernard Shaw&#x27;s view that Wyndham was the ideal comedy actor and based the character on his stage persona. Wyndham accepted the play for production at his theatre, but before rehearsals began, he changed his plans in order to help a beleaguered colleague, the actor-manager George Alexander of the St James&#x27;s Theatre. In early 1895 Alexander&#x27;s production of Henry James&#x27;s &quot;Guy Domville&quot; failed, and closed after 31 performances, leaving Alexander in urgent need of a new play to follow it. Wyndham waived his contractual rights and allowed Alexander to stage Wilde&#x27;s play.

After working with Wilde on stage movements, using a model theatre, Alexander asked the author to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde complied and combined elements of the second and third acts. The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr Gribsby, a solicitor who comes from London to serve a writ on the profligate &quot;Ernest&quot; Worthing for unpaid dining bills at the Savoy Hotel. Wilde was not entirely happy with alterations made at Alexander&#x27;s behest. He said, &quot;Yes, it is quite a good play. I remember I wrote one very like it myself, but it was even more brilliant than this&quot;, but the three-act version usually performed is widely considered more effective than Wilde&#x27;s four-act original.

==First productions==
The play was first produced at the St James&#x27;s Theatre, London, on 14 February – Valentine&#x27;s Day – 1895, preceded by a curtain-raiser, a short comedy called &quot;In the Season&quot;, by Langdon E. Mitchell. During most of the month-long rehearsal period Wilde was on holiday in Algeria with his gay partner, Lord Alfred Douglas, but he returned in time for the dress rehearsal on 12 February. Douglas remained in Algiers; his father, the Marquess of Queensberry, planned to disrupt the premiere by throwing a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end. Wilde learned of the plan and Alexander cancelled Queensberry&#x27;s ticket and arranged for the police to bar his entrance. Wilde wrote to Douglas, &quot;He arrived with a prize fighter!! I had all Scotland Yard to guard the theatre. He prowled around for three hours, then left chattering like a monstrous ape&quot;. Queensberry left the bouquet at the theatre entrance.

Wilde arrived for the premiere dressed in &quot;florid sobriety&quot;, wearing a green carnation in his lapel. Allan Aynesworth, who played Algernon Moncrieff, recalled to Hesketh Pearson:

The theatrical newspaper &quot;The Era&quot; reported that the play &quot;met with enthusiastic and unanimous approval&quot; and confidently predicted &quot;a long and prosperous run&quot;. Aynesworth was &quot;debonair and stylish&quot;, and Alexander, who played Jack Worthing, &quot;demure&quot;; according to &quot;The Era&quot;, &quot;Mr George Alexander played Worthing just as a part of this sort should be played, i.e., with entire seriousness and no indication of purposed irony&quot;. &quot;The Morning Post&quot; said that Irene Vanbrugh and Evelyn Millard could not be bettered and caught the required Gilbertian tone. &quot;The Observer&quot; remarked on the &quot;rapturous amusement&quot; of the audience, and echoed &quot;The Era&quot;&#x27;s prediction of a long run.

According to the published text, the characters, descriptions and cast comprised:


Queensberry continued harassing Wilde, who within weeks launched a private prosecution against him for criminal libel, triggering a series of trials that revealed Wilde&#x27;s homosexual private life and ended in his imprisonment for gross indecency in May 1895. The Victorian public turned against him after his arrest, and box-office receipts dwindled rapidly; Alexander tried to save the production by removing the author&#x27;s name from the playbills, but it closed on 8 May after only 83 performances.

The play&#x27;s original Broadway production opened at the Empire Theatre on 22 April 1895 but closed after sixteen performances. Its cast included William Faversham as Algernon, Henry Miller as Jack, Viola Allen as Gwendolen and Ida Vernon as Lady Bracknell. The Australian premiere was in Melbourne on 10 August 1895, presented by Robert Brough and Dion Boucicault Jr., with Cecil Ward as Jack, Boucicault as Algernon and Jenny Watt-Tanner as Lady Bracknell. The production was an immediate success. Wilde&#x27;s downfall in England did not affect the popularity of his plays in Australia. The same company presented the New Zealand premiere in October 1895, when the play was enthusiastically received. Reviewers said, &quot;in subtlety of thought, brilliancy of wit and sparkling humour, it has scarcely been excelled&quot;; and &quot;its fun is irresistible ... increasing in intensity until in the third and last act it becomes uproarious&quot;.

==Critical opinion==

In contrast with much theatre of the time, the light plot of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; does not address serious social and political issues, and this troubled some contemporary reviewers. Though unsure of Wilde&#x27;s seriousness as a dramatist, they recognised the play&#x27;s cleverness, humour and popularity. Shaw found the play &quot;extremely funny&quot; but &quot;heartless&quot;, a view he maintained all his life. His review in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; argued that comedy should touch as well as amuse: &quot;I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter, not to be tickled or bustled into it&quot;.

In &quot;The World&quot;, William Archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning: &quot;What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?&quot; In &quot;The Speaker&quot;, A. B. Walkley admired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of Wilde&#x27;s dramatic career. He denied that the term &quot;farce&quot; was derogatory or even lacking in seriousness and said, &quot;It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I think, our stage has not seen&quot;.

H. G. Wells, in an unsigned review for &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, called the play one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying, &quot;More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine&quot;. He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, &quot;... how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously&quot;. The play was so light-hearted that some reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama. W. H. Auden later (1963) called it &quot;a pure verbal opera&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;The story is almost too preposterous to go without music&quot;. Mary McCarthy, in &quot;Sights and Spectacles&quot; (1959), despite thinking the play extremely funny, called it &quot;a ferocious idyll&quot;; &quot;depravity is the hero and the only character&quot;.

As Wilde&#x27;s works came to be read and performed again in the early 20th century, it was &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; that received the most productions. The critic and author Max Beerbohm called the play Wilde&#x27;s &quot;finest, most undeniably his own&quot;, saying that the plots of his other comedies – &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; – follow the manner of Victorien Sardou, and are similarly unrelated to the theme of the work, while in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; the story is &quot;dissolved&quot; into the form of the play. By the time of its centenary in 1995 the journalist Mark Lawson described the piece as &quot;the second most known and quoted play in English after &quot;Hamlet&quot;&quot;.

==Revivals==
===1895–1929===

&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and Wilde&#x27;s three other drawing room plays were performed in Britain during the author&#x27;s imprisonment and exile by small touring groups. A. B. Tapping&#x27;s company toured &quot;The Importance&quot; between October 1895 and March 1896, and Elsie Lanham&#x27;s touring company presented it along with &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, beginning in November 1899. The play was well received; one local critic described it as &quot;sparkling with wit and epigrams&quot;, and another called it &quot;a most entertaining comedy [with] some sparkling dialogue&quot;.

The play was not seen again in London until after Wilde&#x27;s death in 1900. Alexander revived it in the small Coronet theatre in Notting Hill, outside the West End, in December the following year, after taking it on tour, starring as John Worthing, with a cast that included the young Lilian Braithwaite as Cecily. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; called the piece &quot;a brilliant play&quot;. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; returned to the West End when Alexander presented a revival at the St James&#x27;s in 1902. It was billed as &quot;By the author of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;&quot;, and few reviews mentioned Wilde&#x27;s name, but his work was praised. &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; said:

The revival ran for 52 performances. For the first Broadway revival, by Charles Frohman&#x27;s Empire Stock Company later in 1902, the playbills and the reviews restored the author&#x27;s name.

Alexander presented the work again at the St James&#x27;s in 1909, when he and Aynesworth reprised their original roles; that revival ran for 316 performances. Max Beerbohm said that the play was sure to become a classic of the English repertory and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written, adding that the actors had &quot;worn as well as the play&quot;.
The play was revived on Broadway in 1910 with a cast that included Hamilton Revelle, A. E. Matthews and Jane Oaker. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the play &quot;has lost nothing of its humor ... no one with a sense of humor can afford to miss it&quot;. For a 1913 revival at the St James&#x27;s, the young actors Gerald Ames and A. E. Matthews succeeded the creators as Jack and Algernon.

Leslie Faber as Jack, John Deverell as Algernon and Margaret Scudamore as Lady Bracknell headed the cast in a 1923 production at the Haymarket Theatre. Revivals in the first decades of the 20th century treated &quot;the present&quot; as the current year. It was not until the 1920s that the case for 1890s costumes was established; as a critic in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; put it, &quot;Thirty years on, one begins to feel that Wilde should be done in the costume of his period – that his wit today needs the backing of the atmosphere that gave it life and truth. ... Wilde&#x27;s glittering and complex verbal felicities go ill with the shingle and the short skirt&quot;.

===1930–2000===
In Nigel Playfair&#x27;s 1930 production at the Lyric, Hammersmith, John Gielgud played Jack to the Lady Bracknell of his aunt, Mabel Terry-Lewis. An Old Vic production in 1934 featured the husband-and-wife team of Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester as Chasuble and Miss Prism; others in the cast were Roger Livesey (Jack), George Curzon (Algernon), Athene Seyler (Lady Bracknell), Flora Robson (Gwendolen) and Ursula Jeans (Cecily). On Broadway, Estelle Winwood co-starred with Clifton Webb and Hope Williams in a 1939 revival.

Gielgud produced and starred in a production at the Globe (now the Gielgud) Theatre in 1939, in a cast that included Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell, Joyce Carey as Gwendolen, Angela Baddeley as Cecily and Margaret Rutherford as Miss Prism. &quot;The Times&quot; considered the production the best since the original and praised it for its fidelity to Wilde&#x27;s conception and its &quot;airy, responsive ball-playing quality&quot;. Later in the same year, Gielgud presented the work again, with Jack Hawkins as Algernon, Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as Gwendolen and Peggy Ashcroft as Cecily, with Evans and Rutherford in their previous roles. The production was presented in several seasons during and after the Second World War, with mostly the same principal players. During a 1946 season at the Haymarket, the King and Queen attended a performance, which, as the journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft put it, gave the play &quot;a final accolade of respectability&quot;. Gielgud&#x27;s London production toured North America and was successfully staged on Broadway in 1947.

In 1975 Jonathan Miller, who had been prevented for financial reasons the previous year from staging the play at the National Theatre with an all-male cast, directed a production in which Lady Bracknell, played by Irene Handl, was given a German accent. For Peter Hall&#x27;s 1982 production at the National Theatre the cast included Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell, Martin Jarvis as Jack, Nigel Havers as Algernon, Zoë Wanamaker as Gwendolen and Anna Massey as Miss Prism. In 1987 a version of the play was given at the Whitehall Theatre starring Hinge and Bracket as Miss Prism and Lady Bracknell respectively. Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s 1993 production at the Aldwych Theatre, starring Maggie Smith, had occasional references to a conjectural gay subtext.

===21st century===
The play was presented in Singapore in 2004 by the British Theatre Playhouse, and the same company took the production to Greenwich Theatre, London, in 2005. In 2007 Peter Gill directed the play at the Theatre Royal, Bath. The production went on a short UK tour before playing in the West End in 2008.

Since the 1987 Whitehall version, some other productions have cast a male actor in the role of Lady Bracknell. In 2005 the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, presented the play with an all-male cast; it also featured Wilde as a character – the play opened with him drinking in a Parisian café, dreaming of his play. The Melbourne Theatre Company staged a production in 2011 with Geoffrey Rush as Lady Bracknell. In the same year the Roundabout Theatre Company presented a Broadway revival based on the 2009 Stratford Shakespeare Festival production featuring its director, Brian Bedford, as Lady Bracknell. At the Vaudeville Theatre, London, in 2015, David Suchet took the role in a production directed by Adrian Noble.

In 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre, London, Lucy Bailey directed a production that followed a trend to &quot;age-blind&quot; casting: the average age of the cast was nearly seventy, and Jarvis and Havers reprised the roles they had played at the National in 1982. In 2024 the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester presented an updated version, described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a convincing stab at a 21st-century makeover&quot;.

==Publication==
===First edition===

Wilde&#x27;s two final comedies, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, were still on stage in London at the time of his prosecution in 1895, and they were soon closed as the details of his case became public. After two years in prison with hard labour, Wilde went into exile in Paris, sick and depressed, his reputation destroyed in England. In 1898 Leonard Smithers agreed with Wilde to publish the two final plays.

Wilde proved to be a diligent reviser, sending detailed instructions on stage directions, character listings and the book&#x27;s presentation and insisting that a playbill from the first performance be reproduced inside. Ellmann argues that the proofs show a man &quot;very much in command of himself and of the play&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s name did not appear on the cover, which stated: &quot;By the Author of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;&quot;. His return to work was brief, as he refused to write anything else: &quot;I can write, but have lost the joy of writing&quot;.

===In translation===
&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;″s popularity has meant it has been translated into many languages, but the pun in the title (&quot;&quot;, a masculine proper name, and &quot;&quot;, steadfast and serious) poses a special problem for translators. The simplest instance of a suitable translation of the pun is in German, where (serious) and (given name) are the same.
As wordplay is usually unique to the language in question, translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original or creating a similar pun in their own language. Some translators leave all characters&#x27; names unchanged and in their original spelling: readers are reminded of the original cultural setting, but the liveliness of the pun is lost. Others, favouring comprehensibility over fidelity to the original, have replaced &quot;Ernest&quot; with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language. For instance, Italian versions variously call the play , the given names being respectively the values of honesty, propriety and fidelity. Translators differ in their approach to the original English honorific titles; some change them all or none, but most leave a mix, partly as a compensation for the loss of Englishness.

French offers a closer pun. According to Les Archives du spectacle in its listing of productions in French since 1954, the title of the play is most often given as , but has also been rendered as , , and .

==Analysis==
===Structure and genre===
The novelist and critic Arthur Ransome argued that Wilde freed himself by abandoning the melodrama of his earlier drawing room plays and basing the story entirely on the Earnest/Ernest verbal conceit. Freed from &quot;living up to any drama more serious than conversation&quot;, Wilde could now amuse himself to a fuller extent with &quot;quips, , epigrams and repartee that had really nothing to do with the business at hand&quot;. The academic Sos Eltis comments that although Wilde&#x27;s earliest and longest handwritten drafts of the play are full of &quot;farcical accidents, broad puns and a number of familiar comic devices&quot;, in his revisions &quot;Wilde transformed standard nonsense into the more systematic and disconcerting illogicality which characterizes &quot;Earnest&#x27;s&quot; dialogue&quot;.

The genre of the &quot;Importance of Being Earnest&quot; has been debated by scholars and critics, who have variously categorised it as high comedy, farce, parody and satire. In a 1956 critique Richard Foster argues that the play creates &quot;an &#x27;as if&#x27; world in which &#x27;real&#x27; values are inverted, reason and unreason are interchanged and the probable defined by improbability&quot;. Contributors to &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Oscar Wilde&quot; (1997) variously refer to the play as &quot;high farce&quot;, &quot;an ostensible farce&quot;, &quot;farce with aggressive pranks, quick-paced action and evasion of moral responsibility&quot;, and &quot;high comedy&quot;.

===Triviality===
Ransome described &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; as the most trivial of Wilde&#x27;s society plays, and the only one that produces &quot;that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful ... It is precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly&quot;. &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing, but vice in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is represented by Algernon&#x27;s greedy consumption of cucumber sandwiches. Wilde told his friend Robbie Ross that the play&#x27;s theme was &quot;That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously, and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality&quot;. The theme is glanced at in the play&#x27;s title, and earnestness is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue; Algernon says in Act II, &quot;one must be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in life&quot;, but goes on to reproach Jack for being serious about everything and thus revealing a trivial nature. Blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of Dorian Gray and Sir Robert Chiltern (in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;), but in &quot;Earnest&quot; the protagonists&#x27; duplicity (Algernon&#x27;s &quot;Bunburying&quot; and Worthing&#x27;s double life as Jack and Ernest) is for more innocent purposes – largely to evade unwelcome social obligations. While much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues, Wilde&#x27;s writing in this play is the antithesis of that of didactic writers like Shaw who used their characters to present audiences with grand ideals and appeals for social justice.

===Satire and parody===
The play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs – marriage and the pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered by some to be the overriding societal value; originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the middle and upper classes during the mid-19th century. The play&#x27;s subtitle introduces the theme, which continues in the discussion between Jack and Algernon in Act I: &quot;Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them&quot;.
Wilde&#x27;s inversion of values continues: when Algernon arrives in Woolton masquerading as Ernest he tells Cecily that he is not really wicked at all.
:CECILY: If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.
In the final scene Jack asks Gwendolen if she can forgive him for not having been deceitful after all:
:JACK: Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you forgive me?
:GWENDOLEN: I can, for I feel that you are sure to change.

In turn, Gwendolen and Cecily have the idea of marrying a man named Ernest. Gwendolen ignores her mother&#x27;s methodical analysis of Jack Worthing&#x27;s suitability as a husband and places her entire faith in a forename, declaring in Act I, &quot;The only really safe name is Ernest&quot;. This is an opinion shared by Cecily in Act II: &quot;I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest&quot;.
Wilde portrayed society&#x27;s rules and rituals in the figure of Lady Bracknell: according to the Wilde scholar Peter Raby, minute attention to the details of her style created a comic effect of assertion by restraint. She dismisses Jack&#x27;s London address as on the unfashionable side of Belgrave Square and is unmoved by Jack&#x27;s explanation that the handbag in which he was found as a baby was deposited in the cloakroom of the socially superior half of Victoria Station.

Wilde parodies 19th-century melodrama, introducing exaggeratedly incongruous situations such as Jack&#x27;s arrival in full mourning for the brother who has just walked into his house, and the sudden switch from fulsome affection between Cecily and Gwendolen to deep hostility on discovering that they are supposedly both engaged to the same man.

===Conjectural homosexual subtext===
In queer theory the play&#x27;s themes of duplicity and ambivalence are inextricably bound up with Wilde&#x27;s homosexuality, so that the play exhibits what one critic terms a &quot;flickering presence-absence of ... homosexual desire&quot;. After his release from prison, Wilde wrote to Reginald Turner, &quot;It was extraordinary reading the play over. How I used to toy with that tiger Life!&quot; In a 2014 study, William Eaton writes, &quot;&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is what it obviously is, a play about dissimulation, and that dissimulation – not seeming to be who one was – was extremely important for homosexuals of Wilde&#x27;s time and place, and thus was an extremely non-trivial matter for Wilde&quot;.

Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, a proponent of queer theory, interprets linguistic aspects of the play as allusions to gay culture and stereotypes, such as references to the German language and the composer Richard Wagner, both of which were associated with male homosexuality in Wilde&#x27;s day. In 1990 Noel Annan suggested that the use of the name Ernest may have been a homosexual in-joke. In 1892, two years before Wilde began writing the play, John Gambril Nicholson had published a book of pederastic poetry, &quot;Love in Earnest&quot;. The sonnet &quot;Of Boys&#x27; Names&quot; included the verse:
&lt;poem&gt;
 Though Frank may ring like silver bell
 and Cecil softer music claim
 they cannot work the miracle
 – &#x27;tis Ernest sets my heart a-flame.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Annan speculated that &quot;earnest&quot; may also have been a private code-word among gay men, as in: &quot;Is he earnest?&quot; in the same way that &quot;Is he musical?&quot; is thought to have been used. Eaton finds this theory unconvincing, and in 2001 Sir Donald Sinden, an actor who had met Lord Alfred Douglas and two of the play&#x27;s original cast (Irene Vanbrugh and Allan Aynesworth), wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; to rebut suggestions that &quot;earnest&quot; held any sexual connotations:
===Bunbury===
Bunbury is a village in Cheshire. Several theories have been advanced to explain Wilde&#x27;s use of the name to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal acquaintance of Wilde&#x27;s youth. Another theory is that Wilde spotted the names of a Captain Bunbury and a magistrate, Mr Bunbury, in &quot;The Worthing Gazette&quot; in August and September 1894, found the surname pleasing and borrowed it.

A suggestion put forward by Aleister Crowley – who knew Wilde – was that Bunbury was a portmanteau word, coined after Wilde had taken a train to Banbury, met a boy there and arranged a second meeting at Sunbury. Carolyn Williams, in a 2010 study, writes that for the word &quot;Bunburying&quot;, Wilde &quot;braids the &#x27;Belvawneying&#x27; evil eye from Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Engaged&quot;&quot; with Bunthorne from Gilbert (and Sullivan)&#x27;s 1881 comic opera &quot;Patience&quot;.

===Use of language===
Although Wilde had for several years been famous for dialogue and his use of language, Raby has argued that in this play the author achieved unity and mastery unmatched in his other plays, with the possible exception of &quot;Salome&quot;. Raby comments that although the earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; achieves &quot;a pitch-perfect style&quot; that allows these clashes to dissolve. Raby identifies three different registers in the play: Algernon&#x27;s exchange with his manservant conveying an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes. The imperious pronouncements of Lady Bracknell are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance as for her disconcerting opinions. In contrast, the discourse of Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism is distinguished by &quot;pedantic precept&quot; and &quot;idiosyncratic diversion&quot;. The play is full of epigrams and paradoxes. Max Beerbohm described it as abounding in &quot;chiselled apothegms – witticisms unrelated to action or character but so good in themselves as to have the quality of dramatic surprise&quot;.

===Characterisation===
Though Wilde deployed characters that were by now familiar – the upper-class dandy, the overbearing matriarch, the woman with a past, the puritanical young lady – his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies. Lady Bracknell, for instance, embodies respectable, upper-class society, but Eltis notes how her development &quot;from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character&quot; can be traced through Wilde&#x27;s revisions of the play. For the two young men, Wilde presents not stereotypical stage &quot;dudes&quot; but intelligent beings who, as Russell Jackson puts it, &quot;speak like their creator in well-formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue-words&quot;. Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism are, in Jackson&#x27;s view, characterised by &quot;a few light touches of detail&quot;, their old-fashioned enthusiasms and the Canon&#x27;s fastidious pedantry pared down by Wilde during his many redrafts of the text.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; has been adapted for the English-language cinema at least three times, first in 1952 by Anthony Asquith who adapted the screenplay and directed it. The cast included Michael Denison (Algernon), Michael Redgrave (Jack), Edith Evans (Lady Bracknell), Dorothy Tutin (Cecily), Joan Greenwood (Gwendolen), Margaret Rutherford (Miss Prism), and Miles Malleson (Dr Chasuble).

In 1992 Kurt Baker directed a version using an all-black cast with Daryl Keith Roach as Jack, Wren T. Brown as Algernon, Ann Weldon as Lady Bracknell, Lanei Chapman as Cecily, Chris Calloway as Gwendolen, CCH Pounder as Miss Prism and Brock Peters as Dr Chasuble, set in the United States.

In 2002 Oliver Parker, a director who had previously adapted &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, made another film. It stars Colin Firth (Jack), Rupert Everett (Algernon), Judi Dench (Lady Bracknell), Reese Witherspoon (Cecily), Frances O&#x27;Connor (Gwendolen), Anna Massey (Miss Prism) and Tom Wilkinson (Canon Chasuble). Parker interpolated about twenty lines of his own into the script and restored the episode cut by Wilde before the premiere of the play, in which a solicitor attempts to serve a writ on the supposed Ernest.

A 2008 Telugu language romantic comedy film, titled &quot;Ashta Chamma&quot;, is an adaptation of the play.

===Operas and musicals===
In 1963 Erik Chisholm composed an opera from the play, basing the libretto on Wilde&#x27;s text. Gerald Barry created the 2011 opera &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Barbican Centre in London. It premiered in Los Angeles in 2011. The role of Lady Bracknell is sung by a bass. The stage premiere was given by the Opéra national de Lorraine in Nancy in 2013. A 2012 concert performance was recorded live at the Barbican by the BBC and released commercially in 2014. In 2017 Odyssey Opera of Boston presented Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco&#x27;s opera &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; as part of a &quot;Wilde Opera Nights&quot; series, a season-long exploration of operatic works inspired by Wilde&#x27;s writings and world.

In 1964 Gerd Natschinski composed a musical, , based on the play. According to a study by Robert Tanitch, by 2002, there had been at least eight adaptations of the play as a musical, though &quot;never with conspicuous success&quot;. The earliest such version was a 1927 American show entitled &quot;Oh Earnest&quot;. The journalist Mark Bostridge comments, &quot;The libretto of a 1957 musical adaptation, &quot;Half in Earnest&quot;, deposited in the British Library, is scarcely more encouraging. The curtain rises on Algernon, strumming away at the piano, singing, &#x27;I can play &quot;Chopsticks&quot;, Lane&#x27;. Other songs include &#x27;A Bunburying I Must Go&#x27;&quot;. Since Bostridge wrote his article, at least one further musical version of the play has been staged: a show with a book by Douglas Livingstone and score by Adam McGuinness and Zia Moranne was staged in December 2011 at the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith; the cast included Susie Blake, Gyles Brandreth and Edward Petherbridge.

===Stage derivatives===
Tom Stoppard&#x27;s 1974 stage comedy &quot;Travesties&quot; draws extensively on Wilde&#x27;s play. Stoppard&#x27;s central character, Henry Carr, was a real-life figure who played Algernon in a production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; produced by James Joyce in Zurich in 1917. Stoppard reimagines him as an old man, reminiscing about the production and his days as a young man. The other characters include Carr&#x27;s sister Gwendolen and the local librarian, Cecily; the action of the play, under the erratic control of the old Carr&#x27;s fallible memory, continually mirrors that of Wilde&#x27;s original. Carr has an exchange with Tristan Tzara reminiscent of John Worthing&#x27;s exchanges with Algernon, Tzara has a scene with Joyce that draws on Jack&#x27;s interview with Lady Bracknell, and Gwendolen and Cecily have a falling out on the lines of that of their namesakes in Wilde&#x27;s play (though to the tune of &quot;Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean&quot; rather than in prose).

In 2016 the Irish actor/writers Helen Norton and Jonathan White wrote the comic play &quot;To Hell in a Handbag&quot; which retells the story of &quot;The Importance&quot; from the point of view of the characters Canon Chasuble and Miss Prism, giving them their own back story and showing what happens to them when they are not on stage in Wilde&#x27;s play.

===Radio and television===
There have been many radio versions of the play. In 1925 the BBC broadcast an adaptation with Hesketh Pearson as Jack Worthing. Further broadcasts of the play followed during the 1920s and 1930s, and in November 1937 the BBC broadcast the first television adaptation of the play, in an abridged version directed by Royston Morley. In 1942 BBC radio broadcast scenes from the play, featuring two members of the original cast: the programme was introduced by Allan Aynesworth and starred Irene Vanbrugh as Lady Bracknell. A 1951 broadcast of the complete three-act play starred Gielgud, Evans and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies.

A 1964 commercial television adaptation starred Ian Carmichael, Patrick Macnee, Susannah York, Fenella Fielding, Pamela Brown and Irene Handl. A BBC television version in 1974 starred Coral Browne as Lady Bracknell. In 1977 BBC Radio 4 broadcast the four-act version of the play for the first time, with Fabia Drake as Lady Bracknell, Richard Pasco as Jack, Jeremy Clyde as Algy, Maurice Denham as Canon Chasuble, Sylvia Coleridge as Miss Prism, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Gwendolen and Prunella Scales as Cecily. In 1988 a production of the four-act version was broadcast on BBC television, starring Joan Plowright, Paul McGann, Gemma Jones and Alec McCowen.

In 1995, to mark the centenary of the first performance of the play, Radio 4 broadcast a new adaptation on 13 February; directed by Glyn Dearman, it featured Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell, Michael Sheen as Jack, Martin Clunes as Algernon, John Moffatt as Dr Chasuble, Miriam Margolyes as Miss Prism, Samantha Bond as Gwendolen and Amanda Root as Cecily. In December 2000 BBC Radio 3 broadcast an adaptation directed by Howard Davies starring Geraldine McEwan as Lady Bracknell, Simon Russell Beale as Jack Worthing, Julian Wadham as Algernon Moncrieff, Geoffrey Palmer as Canon Chasuble, Celia Imrie as Miss Prism, Victoria Hamilton as Gwendolen and Emma Fielding as Cecily.

<doc id="31068" wikidata="Q1051304" url="?curid=31068" title="Analogy of the divided line">
<text>The analogy of the divided line () is presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in the &quot;Republic&quot; (509d–511e). It is written as a dialogue between Glaucon and Socrates, in which the latter further elaborates upon the immediately preceding analogy of the Sun at the former&#x27;s request. Socrates asks Glaucon not only to envision this unequally bisected line but to imagine further bisecting each of the two segments. Socrates explains that the four resulting segments represent four separate &#x27;affections&#x27; (παθήματα) of the psyche. The lower two sections are said to represent the visible while the higher two are said to represent the intelligible. These affections are described in succession as corresponding to increasing levels of reality and truth from conjecture () to belief (πίστις) to thought (διάνοια) and finally to understanding (νόησις). Furthermore, this analogy not only elaborates a theory of the psyche but also presents metaphysical and epistemological views.

== Description ==

In &quot;The Republic&quot; (509d–510a), Socrates describes the divided line to Glaucon this way:

== The visible world ==
Thus AB represents shadows and reflections of physical things, and BC the physical things themselves. These correspond to two kinds of knowledge, the illusion (&quot;eikasía&quot;) of our ordinary, everyday experience, and belief (πίστις &quot;pistis&quot;) about discrete physical objects which cast their shadows. In the &quot;Timaeus&quot;, the category of illusion includes all the &quot;opinions of which the minds of ordinary people are full,&quot; while the natural sciences are included in the category of belief.

The term eikasía (), meaning &quot;conjecture&quot; in Greek, was used by Plato to refer to a human way of dealing with appearances. Particularly, it is identified as the lower subsection of the visible segment and represents images, which Plato described as &quot;first shadows, then reflections in water and in all compacted, smooth, and shiny materials&quot;. According to the philosopher, &quot;eikasia&quot; and &quot;pistis&quot; add up to &quot;doxa&quot;, which is concerned with genesis (becoming).

&quot;Eikasia&quot; has several interpretations. For instance, it is the inability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else. It therefore prevents us from perceiving that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. Another variation posited by scholars such Yancey Dominick, explains that it is a way of understanding the originals that generate the objects that are considered as &quot;eikasia&quot;. This allows one to distinguish the image from reality such as the way one can avoid mistaking a reflection of a tree in a puddle for a tree.

== The intelligible world ==
According to some translations, the segment CE, representing the intelligible world, is divided into the same ratio as AC, giving the subdivisions CD and DE (it can be readily verified that CD must have the same length as BC:

Plato describes CD, the &quot;lower&quot; of these, as involving mathematical reasoning (διάνοια &quot;dianoia&quot;), where abstract mathematical objects such as geometric lines are discussed. Such objects are outside the physical world (and are not to be confused with the &quot;drawings&quot; of those lines, which fall within the physical world BC). However, they are less important to Plato than the subjects of philosophical understanding (νόησις &quot;noesis&quot;), the &quot;higher&quot; of these two subdivisions (DE):

Plato here is using the familiar relationship between ordinary objects and their shadows or reflections in order to illustrate the relationship between the physical world as a whole and the world of Ideas (Forms) as a whole. The former is made up of a series of passing reflections of the latter, which is eternal, more real and &quot;true.&quot; Moreover, the knowledge that we have of the Ideas – when indeed we do have it – is of a higher order than knowledge of the mere physical world. In particular, knowledge of the forms leads to a knowledge of the Idea (Form) of the Good.

== Tabular summary of the divided line ==
== Metaphysical importance ==
The analogy of the divided line is the cornerstone of Plato&#x27;s metaphysical framework. This structure illustrates the grand picture of Plato&#x27;s metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, all in one. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all. In the &quot;Republic&quot;, the philosopher must understand the Idea of Justice to live a just life or to organize and govern a just state.

The lowest level, which represents &quot;the world of becoming and passing away&quot; (&quot;Republic&quot;, 508d), is the metaphysical model for a Heraclitean philosophy of constant flux and for Protagorean philosophy of appearance and opinion. The second level, a world of fixed physical objects, also became Aristotle&#x27;s metaphysical model. The third level might be a Pythagorean level of mathematics. The fourth level is Plato&#x27;s ideal Parmenidean reality, the world of highest level Ideas.

== Epistemological meaning ==
Plato holds a very strict notion of knowledge. For example, he does not accept expertise about a subject, nor direct perception (see &quot;Theaetetus&quot;), nor true belief about the physical world (the &quot;Meno&quot;) as knowledge. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all. For this reason, in most of the earlier Socratic dialogues, Socrates denies knowledge both to himself and others.

For the first level, &quot;the world of becoming and passing away,&quot; Plato expressly denies the possibility of knowledge. Constant change never stays the same, therefore, properties of objects must refer to different Ideas at different times. Note that for knowledge to be possible, which Plato believed, the other three levels must be unchanging. The third and fourth level, mathematics and Ideas, are already eternal and unchanging. However, to ensure that the second level, the objective, physical world, is also unchanging, Plato, in the &quot;Republic&quot;, Book 4 introduces empirically derived axiomatic restrictions that prohibit both motion and shifting perspectives.

<doc id="31069" wikidata="Q179552" url="?curid=31069" title="Themistocles">
<text>Themistocles (; ; ) was an Athenian politician and general. He was one of a new breed of non-aristocratic politicians who rose to prominence in the early years of the Athenian democracy. As a politician, Themistocles was a populist, having the support of lower-class Athenians, and generally being at odds with the Athenian nobility. Elected archon in 493 BC, he convinced the polis to increase the naval power of Athens, a recurring theme in his political career. During the first Persian invasion of Greece, he fought at the Battle of Marathon (490 BC), and may have been one of the ten Athenian &quot;strategoi&quot; (generals) in that battle.

In the years after Marathon, and in the run-up to the second Persian invasion of 480–479 BC, Themistocles became the most prominent politician in Athens. He continued to advocate for a strong Athenian navy, and in 483 BC he persuaded the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes; these proved crucial in the forthcoming conflict with Persia. During the second invasion, he commanded the Greek allied navy at the battles of Artemisium and Salamis in 480 BC. Due to his subterfuge, the Allies successfully lured the Persian fleet into the Straits of Salamis, and the decisive Greek victory there was the turning point of the war. The invasion was conclusively repulsed the following year after the Persian defeat at the land Battle of Plataea.

After the conflict ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate him from the Athenians. In 472 or 471 BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from southern Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (r. 498–454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered the service of the Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465–424 BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there for the rest of his life.

Themistocles died in 459 BC, probably of natural causes. His reputation was posthumously rehabilitated, and he was re-established as a hero of the Athenian, and indeed Greek, cause. Themistocles can still reasonably be thought of as &quot;the man most instrumental in achieving the salvation of Greece&quot; from the Persian threat, as Plutarch describes him. His naval policies would have a lasting impact on Athens as well, since maritime power became the cornerstone of the Athenian Empire and golden age. Thucydides assessed Themistocles as &quot;a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled&quot;.

== Family ==
Themistocles was born in the Attic deme of Phrearrhii around 524 BC, the son of Neocles, a Leontian also of Phrearrhii, who was, in the words of Plutarch &quot;no very conspicuous man at Athens&quot;. His mother is more obscure; her name was either Euterpe or Abrotonum, and her place of origin has been given variously as Halicarnassus, Thrace, or Acarnania. Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father. Plutarch considers this to be false. Plutarch indicates that, on account of his mother&#x27;s background, Themistocles was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of Athens, Cynosarges, outside the city walls. However, in an early example of his cunning, Themistocles persuaded &quot;well-born&quot; children to exercise with him in Cynosarges, thus breaking down the distinction between &quot;alien and legitimate&quot;. Plutarch further reports that Themistocles was preoccupied, even as a child, with preparing for public life. His teacher is said to have told him: &quot;My boy, you will be nothing insignificant, but definitely something great, either for good or evil.&quot;

Themistocles left three sons born of Archippe, the daughter of Lysander of Alopece: Archeptolis, Polyeuctus, and Cleophantus. He also had two sons older than these three, Neocles and Diocles. Neocles died when he was young, bitten by a horse, and Diocles was adopted by his grandfather, Lysander. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot; mentions Cleophantus as a most excellent horseman, but no equal to his father in deeds or virtue. Themistocles also had many daughters: Mnesiptolema, the product of his second marriage, married her step-brother Archeptolis and became priestess of Cybele; Italia was married to Panthoides of Chios; and Sybaris to Nicomedes the Athenian. After Themistocles died, his nephew Phrasicles went to Magnesia and married another daughter, Nicomache (with her brothers&#x27; consent). Phrasicles then took charge of her sister Asia, the youngest of all ten children.

== Political and military career ==

=== Background ===
Themistocles grew up in a period of upheaval in Athens. The tyrant Peisistratos had died in 527 BC, passing power to his sons, Hipparchus and Hippias. Hipparchus was murdered in 514 BC, and in response to this, Hippias became paranoid and started to rely increasingly on foreign mercenaries to keep a hold on power. The head of the powerful but exiled Alcmaeonid family, Cleisthenes, began to scheme to overthrow Hippias and return to Athens. In 510 BC, he persuaded the Spartan king Cleomenes I to launch a full-scale attack on Athens, which succeeded in overthrowing Hippias. However, in the aftermath, the other noble (&quot;eupatrid&quot;) families of Athens rejected Cleisthenes, electing Isagoras as archon, with the support of Cleomenes. On a personal level, Cleisthenes wanted to return to Athens; however, he also probably wanted to prevent Athens becoming a Spartan client state. Outmaneuvering the other nobles, he proposed to the Athenian people a radical program in which political power would be invested in the people—a &quot;democracy&quot;. The Athenian people thus overthrew Isagoras, repelled a Spartan attack under Cleomenes, and invited Cleisthenes to return to Athens and put his plan into action. The establishment of the democracy was to radically change Athens: &quot;And so it was that the Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power... they gave vivid proof of what equality and freedom of speech might achieve&quot;

=== Early years of the democracy ===
The new system of government in Athens opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like Themistocles, who previously would have had no access to power. Moreover, the new institutions of the democracy required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; &quot;he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible.&quot; Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a down-market part of Athens. This move marked him out as a &#x27;man of the people&#x27;, and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens:

[H]e wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter&#x27;s name, Themistocles had set his eyes on a radical new constituency...

However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens. He began to practice law, the first person in Athens to prepare for public life in this way. His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used in the service of the common people, gained him further popularity.

=== Archonship ===

Themistocles probably turned 30 in 494 BC, which qualified him to become an archon, the highest of the magistracies in Athens. On the back of his popularity, he evidently decided to run for this office and was elected Archon Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493 BC). Themistocles&#x27;s archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of Athenian sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at Piraeus, to replace the existing facilities at Phalerum. Although further away from Athens, Piraeus offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified. Since Athens was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th century BC, Themistocles&#x27;s policies were to have huge significance for the future of Athens, and indeed Greece. In advancing naval power, Themistocles was probably advocating a course of action he thought essential for the long-term prospects of Athens. However, as Plutarch implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (&quot;thetes&quot;) as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Athenians—and thus into Themistocles&#x27;s own hands.

=== Rivalry with Aristides ===
After Marathon, probably in 489, Miltiades, the hero of the battle, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture Paros. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted. The Athenian aristocracy, and indeed Greek aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace. Miltiades was given a massive fine for the crime of &#x27;deceiving the Athenian people&#x27;, but died weeks later as a result of his wound. In the wake of this prosecution, the Athenian people chose to use a new institution of the democracy, which had been part of Cleisthenes&#x27; reforms, but remained so far unused. This was &#x27;ostracism&#x27;—each Athenian citizen was required to write on a shard of pottery (&quot;ostrakon&quot;) the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years. This may have been triggered by Miltiades&#x27; prosecution, and used by the Athenians to try to stop such power-games among the noble families. Certainly, in the years (487 BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the Alcmaeonids, were exiled. The career of a politician in Athens thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was likely to result in exile.

Themistocles, with his power-base firmly established among the poor, moved naturally to fill the vacuum left by Miltiades&#x27; death, and in that decade became the most influential politician in Athens. However, the support of the nobility began to coalesce around the man who would become Themistocles&#x27;s great rival—Aristides. Aristides cast himself as Themistocles&#x27;s opposite—virtuous, honest and incorruptible—and his followers called him &quot;the just&quot;. Plutarch suggests that the rivalry between the two had begun when they competed over the love of a boy: &quot;... they were rivals for the affection of the beautiful Stesilaus of Ceos, and were passionate beyond all moderation.&quot;

During the decade, Themistocles continued to advocate the expansion of Athenian naval power. The Athenians were certainly aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended; Darius&#x27; son and successor, Xerxes I, had continued the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Themistocles seems to have realised that for the Greeks to survive the coming onslaught required a Greek navy that could hope to face up to the Persian navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet. Aristides, as champion of the &quot;zeugites&quot; (the upper, &#x27;hoplite-class&#x27;) vigorously opposed such a policy.

In 483 BC, a massive new seam of silver was found in the Athenian mines of Laurion. Themistocles proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of 200 triremes, while Aristides suggested it should instead be distributed among the Athenian citizens. Themistocles avoided mentioning Persia, deeming that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, and instead focused their attention on Aegina. At the time, Athens was embroiled in a long-running war with the Aeginetans, and building a fleet would allow the Athenians to finally defeat them at sea. As a result, Themistocles&#x27;s motion was carried easily, although only 100 triremes were to be built. Aristides refused to countenance this; conversely Themistocles was not pleased that only 100 ships would be built. Tension between the two camps built over the winter, so that the ostracism of 482 BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides. In what has been characterized as the first referendum, Aristides was ostracised, and Themistocles&#x27;s policies were endorsed. Indeed, becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted for the construction of more ships than Themistocles had initially asked for. In the run-up to the Persian invasion, Themistocles had thus become the foremost politician in Athens.

=== Second Persian invasion of Greece ===
In 481 BC a congress of Greek city-states was held, during which 30 or so states agreed to ally themselves against the forthcoming invasion. The Spartans and Athenians were foremost in this alliance, being sworn enemies of the Persians.
The Spartans claimed the command of land forces, and since the Greek (hereafter referred to as &quot;Allied&quot;) fleet would be dominated by Athens, Themistocles tried to claim command of the naval forces. However, the other naval powers, including Corinth and Aegina, refused to give command to the Athenians, and Themistocles pragmatically backed down. Instead, as a compromise, the Spartans (an insignificant naval power), in the person of Eurybiades, were to command the naval forces. Herodotus is clear, however, that Themistocles commanded the fleet in all but name.

The congress met again in the spring of 480 BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes&#x27; advance. A force of 10,000 hoplites was dispatched under the command of the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles to the Vale of Tempe, which they believed the Persian army would have to pass through. However, once there, Alexander I of Macedon warned them that the vale could be bypassed in several ways and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large, and the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.
Themistocles now developed a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans would be willing to march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to show them that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.

To do this, every able-bodied Athenian male would be required to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon Athens. Persuading the Athenians to take this course was one of the highlights of Themistocles&#x27;s career. As Holland has it: What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, we have no way of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for Themistocles&#x27;s audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded.
His proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.

==== Battle of Artemisium ====
Thus, in August 480 BC, when the Persian army was approaching Thessaly, the Allied fleet sailed to Artemisium, and the Allied army marched to Thermopylae. Themistocles himself took command of the Athenian contingent of the fleet and went to Artemisium. When the Persian fleet finally arrived at Artemisium after a significant delay, Eurybiades, who both Herodotus and Plutarch suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail away without fighting. At this point Themistocles accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at Artemisium, and he used some of it to bribe Eurybiades to remain, while pocketing the rest. From this point on, Themistocles appears to have been more or less in charge of the Allied effort at Artemisium. Over three days of battle, the Allies held their own against the much larger Persian fleet, but sustained significant losses. However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of Thermopylae to the Persians made their continued presence at Artemisium irrelevant, and the Allies thus evacuated. According to Herodotus, Themistocles left messages at every place where the Persian fleet might stop for drinking water, asking the Ionians in the Persian fleet to defect, or at least fight badly. Even if this did not work, Themistocles apparently intended that Xerxes would at least begin to suspect the Ionians, thereby sowing dissension in the Persian ranks.

==== Battle of Salamis ====
In the aftermath of Thermopylae, Boeotia fell to the Persians, who then began to advance on Athens. The Peloponnesian Allies prepared to now defend the Isthmus of Corinth, thus abandoning Athens to the Persians. From Artemisium, the Allied fleet sailed to the island of Salamis, where the Athenian ships helped with the final evacuation of Athens. The Peloponnesian contingents wanted to sail to the coast of the Isthmus to concentrate forces with the army. However, Themistocles tried to convince them to remain in the Straits of Salamis, invoking the lessons of Artemisium; &quot;battle in close conditions works to our advantage&quot;. After threatening to sail with the whole Athenian people into exile in Sicily, he eventually persuaded the other Allies, whose security after all relied on the Athenian navy, to accept his plan. Therefore, even after Athens had fallen to the Persians, and the Persian navy had arrived off the coast of Salamis, the Allied navy remained in the Straits. Themistocles appears to have been aiming to fight a battle that would cripple the Persian navy, and thus guarantee the security of the Peloponnesus.

To bring about this battle, Themistocles used a cunning mix of subterfuge and misinformation, psychologically exploiting Xerxes&#x27; desire to finish the invasion. Xerxes&#x27; actions indicate that he was keen to finish the conquest of Greece in 480 BC, and to do this, he needed a decisive victory over the Allied fleet. Themistocles sent a servant, Sicinnus, to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was &quot;on the king&#x27;s side, and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes&#x27;.&quot; Themistocles claimed that the Allied commanders were infighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians needed to do was to block the straits. In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles seems to have been trying to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits. The message also had a secondary purpose: In the event of an Allied defeat, the Athenians might receive some degree of mercy from Xerxes (having indicated their readiness to submit). At any rate, this was exactly the kind of news that Xerxes wanted to hear. Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out to effect the block. Perhaps overconfident and expecting no resistance, the Persian navy sailed into the Straits, only to find that, far from disintegrating, the Allied navy was ready for battle.

According to Herodotus, after the Persian navy began its maneuvers, Aristides arrived at the Allied camp from Aegina. Aristides had been recalled from exile along with the other ostracised Athenians on the order of Themistocles, so that Athens might be united against the Persians. Aristides told Themistocles that the Persian fleet had encircled the Allies, which greatly pleased Themistocles, as he now knew that the Persians had walked into his trap. The Allied commanders seem to have taken this news rather uncomplainingly, and Holland therefore suggests that they were party to Themistocles&#x27;s ruse all along. Either way, the Allies prepared for battle, and Themistocles delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships. In the ensuing battle, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger Persian navy, which became disarrayed, and the Allies took advantage to win a famous victory.

Salamis was the turning point in the second Persian invasion, and indeed the Greco-Persian Wars in general. While the battle did not end the Persian invasion, it effectively ensured that all Greece would not be conquered, and allowed the Allies to go on the offensive in 479 BC. A number of historians believe that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history. Since Themistocles&#x27;s long-standing advocacy of Athenian naval power enabled the Allied fleet to fight, and his stratagem brought about the Battle of Salamis, it is probably not an exaggeration to say, as Plutarch does, that Themistocles, &quot;...is thought to have been the man most instrumental in achieving the salvation of Hellas.&quot;

==== Autumn 480 – Winter 479 BC ====

The Allied victory at Salamis ended the immediate threat to Greece, and Xerxes now returned to Asia with part of the army, leaving his general Mardonius to attempt to complete the conquest. Mardonius wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly, and the Athenians were thus able to return to their city, which had been burnt and razed by the Persians, for the winter. For the Athenians, and Themistocles personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the Persian army; the Athenians tried to shame them into doing so, with no success.

During the winter, the Allies held a meeting at Corinth to celebrate their success, and award prizes for achievement. However, perhaps tired of the Athenians pointing out their role at Salamis, and of their demands for the Allies to march north, the Allies awarded the prize for civic achievement to Aegina. Furthermore, although the admirals all voted for Themistocles in second place, they all voted for themselves in first place, so that no-one won the prize for individual achievement. In response, realising the importance of the Athenian fleet to their security, and probably seeking to massage Themistocles&#x27;s ego, the Spartans brought Themistocles to Sparta. There, he was awarded a special prize &quot;for his wisdom and cleverness&quot;, and won high praise from all. Furthermore, Plutarch reports that at the next Olympic Games:
[When] Themistocles entered the stadium, the audience neglected the contestants all day long to gaze on him, and pointed him out with admiring applause to visiting strangers, so that he too was delighted, and confessed to his friends that he was now reaping in full measure the harvest of his toils in behalf of Hellas.

After returning to Athens in the winter, Plutarch reports that Themistocles made a proposal to the city while the Greek fleet was wintering at Pagasae:
Themistocles once declared to the people [of Athens] that he had devised a certain measure which could not be revealed to them, though it would be helpful and salutary for the city, and they ordered that Aristides alone should hear what it was and pass judgment on it. So Themistocles told Aristides that his purpose was to burn the naval station of the confederate Hellenes, for that in this way the Athenians would be greatest, and lords of all. Then Aristides came before the people and said of the deed which Themistocles purposed to do, that none other could be more advantageous, and none more unjust. On hearing this, the Athenians ordained that Themistocles cease from his purpose.

==== Spring–Summer 479 BC ====
However, as happened to many prominent individuals in the Athenian democracy, Themistocles&#x27;s fellow citizens grew jealous of his success, and possibly tired of his boasting. It is probable that in early 479 BC, Themistocles was stripped of his command; instead, Xanthippus was to command the Athenian fleet, and Aristides the land forces. Though Themistocles was no doubt politically and militarily active for the rest of the campaign, no mention of his activities in 479 BC is made in the ancient sources. In the summer of that year, after receiving an Athenian ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront Mardonius, who had reoccupied Athens in June. At the decisive Battle of Plataea, the Allies destroyed the Persian army, while apparently on the same day, the Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale. These twin victories completed the Allied triumph, and ended the Persian threat to Greece.

=== Rebuilding of Athens after the Persian invasion ===

Whatever the cause of Themistocles&#x27;s unpopularity in 479 BC, it obviously did not last long. Both Diodorus and Plutarch suggest he was quickly restored to the favour of the Athenians. Indeed, after 479 BC, he seems to have enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.
In the aftermath of the invasion and the Destruction of Athens by the Achaemenids, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles in the autumn of 479 BC. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return to haunt him.

Themistocles also now returned to his naval policy, and more ambitious undertakings that would increase the dominant position of his native state. He further extended and fortified the port complex at Piraeus, and &quot;fastened the city [Athens] to the Piraeus, and the land to the sea&quot;. Themistocles probably aimed to make Athens the dominant naval power in the Aegean. Indeed, Athens would create the Delian League in 478 BC, uniting the naval power of the Aegean Islands and Ionia under Athenian leadership. Themistocles introduced tax breaks for merchants and artisans, to attract both people and trade to the city to make Athens a great mercantile centre. He also instructed the Athenians to build 20 triremes per year, to ensure that their dominance in naval matters continued. Plutarch reports that Themistocles also secretly proposed to destroy the beached ships of the other Allied navies to ensure complete naval dominance—but was overruled by Aristides and the council of Athens.

=== Fall and exile ===
It seems clear that, towards the end of the decade, Themistocles had begun to accrue enemies, and had become arrogant; moreover his fellow citizens had become jealous of his prestige and power. The Rhodian poet Timocreon was among his most eloquent enemies, composing slanderous drinking songs. Meanwhile, the Spartans actively worked against him, trying to promote Cimon (son of Miltiades) as a rival to Themistocles. Furthermore, after the treason and disgrace of the Spartan general Pausanias, the Spartans tried to implicate Themistocles in the plot; he was, however, acquitted of these charges. In Athens itself, he lost favour by building a sanctuary of Artemis, with the epithet &quot;Aristoboulẽ&quot; (&quot;of good counsel&quot;) near his home, a blatant reference to his own role in delivering Greece from the Persian invasion. Eventually, in either 472 or 471 BC, he was ostracised. In itself, this did not mean that Themistocles had done anything wrong; ostracism, in the words of Plutarch, &quot;was not a penalty, but a way of pacifying and alleviating that jealousy which delights to humble the eminent, breathing out its malice into this disfranchisement.&quot;
Themistocles first went to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving that they now had a prime opportunity to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles&#x27;s complicity in Pausanias&#x27;s treason. They demanded that he be tried by the &#x27;Congress of Greeks&#x27;, rather than in Athens, although it seems that in the end he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles&#x27;s flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. Both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way. Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.

== Later life in the Achaemenid Empire, death, and descendants ==
From Molossia, Themistocles apparently fled to Pydna, from where he took a ship for Asia Minor. This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at Naxos, which an Athenian fleet was in the process of besieging. Desperate to avoid the legal authorities, Themistocles, who had been traveling under an assumed identity, revealed himself to the captain and said that if he did not reach safety he would tell the Athenians that he&#x27;d bribed the ship to take him. According to Thucydides, who wrote within living memory of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at Ephesus, where Themistocles disembarked. Plutarch has the ship docking at Cyme in Aeolia, and Diodorus has Themistocles making his way to Asia in an undefined manner. Diodorus and Plutarch next recount a similar tale, namely that Themistocles stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the Persian king, Artaxerxes I. Since there was a bounty on Themistocles&#x27;s head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey Themistocles to the Persian king in the type of covered wagon that the King&#x27;s concubines travelled in. All three chroniclers agree that Themistocles&#x27;s next move was to contact the Persian king; in Thucydides, this is by letter, while Plutarch and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king. The spirit is, however, the same in all three: Themistocles introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service:
I, Themistocles, am come to you, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was compelled to defend myself against your father&#x27;s invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him. (Thucydides)

Thucydides and Plutarch say that Themistocles asked for a year&#x27;s grace to learn the Persian language and customs, after which he would serve the king, and Artaxerxes granted this. Plutarch reports that, as might be imagined, Artaxerxes was elated that such a dangerous and illustrious foe had come to serve him.

At some point in his travels, Themistocles&#x27;s wife and children were extricated from Athens by a friend, and joined him in exile. His friends also managed to send him many of his belongings, although up to 100 talents worth of his goods were confiscated by the Athenians. When, after a year, Themistocles returned to the king&#x27;s court, he appears to have made an immediate impact, and &quot;he attained ... very high consideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or since&quot;. Plutarch recounts that &quot;honors he enjoyed were far beyond those paid to other foreigners; nay, he actually took part in the King&#x27;s hunts and in his household diversions&quot;. Themistocles advised the king on his dealings with the Greeks, although it seems that for a long period, the king was distracted by events elsewhere in the empire, and thus Themistocles &quot;lived on for a long time without concern&quot;. He was made governor of the district of Magnesia on the Maeander River in Asia Minor, and assigned the revenues of three cities: Magnesia (about 50 talents per year—&quot;for bread&quot;); Myus (&quot;for opson&quot;); and Lampsacus (&quot;for wine&quot;). According to Plutarch, Neanthes of Cyzicus and Phanias reported two more, the city of Palaescepsis (&quot;for clothes&quot;) and the city of Percote (&quot;for bedding and furniture for his house&quot;), both near Lampsacus.

=== Greek exiles in the Achaemenid Empire ===
Themistocles was one of the several Greek aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Hippias, Demaratos, Gongylos or later Alcibiades. In general, those were generously welcomed by the Achaemenid kings, received land grants to support them, and ruled over cities throughout Asia Minor. Conversely, some Achaemenid satraps were welcomed as exiles in western courts, such as Artabazos II.

=== First portraiture of a ruler on coinage ===
Coins are the only contemporary documents remaining from the time of Themistocles. Although many coins in antiquity illustrated the images of various gods or symbols, the first portraiture of actual rulers only appears in the 5th century BC. Themistocles was probably the first ruler ever to issue coinage with his personal portrait, as he became Achaemenid Governor of Magnesia in 465–459 BC. Themistocles may have been in a unique position in which he could transfer the notion of individual portraiture, already current in the Greek world, and at the same time wield the dynastic power of an Achaemenid dynast who could issue his own coins and illustrate them as he wished. Still, there is some doubt that his coins may have represented Zeus rather than himself.
During his lifetime, Themistocles is known to have erected two statues to himself, one in Athens, and the other in Magnesia, which would lend credence to the possibility that he also illustrated himself on his coins. The Themistocles statue in Magnesia was illustrated on the reverse of some of the Magnesian coins of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius in the 2nd century.

The rulers of Lycia followed towards the end of the 5th century as the most prolific and unambiguous producers of coins displaying the portrait of their rulers. From the time of Alexander the Great, portraiture of the issuing ruler would then become a standard, generalized, feature of coinage.

=== Death ===
Themistocles died at Magnesia in 459 BC aged 65, according to Thucydides, from natural causes. However, perhaps inevitably, there were also rumours surrounding his death, saying that unwilling to follow the Great King&#x27;s order to make war on Athens, he committed suicide by taking poison, or drinking bull&#x27;s blood. Plutarch provides the most evocative version of this story:
But when Egypt revolted with Athenian aid...and Cimon&#x27;s mastery of the sea forced the King to resist the efforts of the Hellenes and to hinder their hostile growth...messages came down to Themistocles saying that the King commanded him to make good his promises by applying himself to the Hellenic problem; then, neither embittered by anything like anger against his former fellow-citizens, nor lifted up by the great honor and power he was to have in the war, but possibly thinking his task not even approachable, both because Hellas had other great generals at the time, and especially because Cimon was so marvelously successful in his campaigns; yet most of all out of regard for the reputation of his own achievements and the trophies of those early days; having decided that his best course was to put a fitting end to his life, he made a sacrifice to the gods, then called his friends together, gave them a farewell clasp of his hand, and, as the current story goes, drank bull&#x27;s blood, or as some say, took a quick poison, and so died in Magnesia, in the sixty-fifth year of his life...They say that the King, on learning the cause and the manner of his death, admired the man yet more, and continued to treat his friends and kindred with kindness.

It was rumored that after his death, Themistocles&#x27;s bones were transported to Attica in accordance with his wishes, and buried in his native soil in secret, it being illegal to bury an Athenian traitor in Attica. The Magnesians built a &quot;splendid tomb&quot; in their marketplace for Themistocles, which still stood during the time of Plutarch, and continued to dedicate part of their revenues to the family of Themistocles. Nepos in the 1st century BC wrote about a statue of Themistocles visible in the forum of Magnesia. The statue also appears on a coin type of Roman emperor Antoninus Pius minted in Magnesia in the 2nd century CE.

=== Succession and descendants ===

Archeptolis, son of Themistocles, became a Governor of Magnesia after his father&#x27;s death . Archeptolis also minted his own silver coinage as he ruled Magnesia, and it is probable that part of his revenues continued to be handed over to the Achaemenids in exchange for the maintenance of their territorial grant. Themistocles and his son formed what some authors have called &quot;a Greek dynasty in the Persian Empire&quot;.

From a second wife, Themistocles also had a daughter named Mnesiptolema, whom he appointed as priestess of the Temple of Dindymene in Magnesia, with the title of &quot;Mother of the Gods&quot;. Mnesiptolema would eventually marry her half-brother Archeptolis, homopatric (but not homometric) marriages being permitted in Athens.

Themistocles also had several other daughters, named Nicomache, Asia, Italia, Sybaris, and probably Hellas, who married the Greek exile in Persia Gongylos and still had a fief in Persian Anatolia in 400/399 BC as his widow.

Themistocles also had three other sons, Diocles, Polyeucteus and Cleophantus, the latter possibly a ruler of Lampsacus. One of the descendants of Cleophantus still issued a decree in Lampsacus around 200 BC mentioning a feast for his own father, also named Themistocles, who had greatly benefited the city. Later, Pausanias wrote that the sons of Themistocles &quot;appear to have returned to Athens&quot;, and that they dedicated a painting of Themistocles in the Parthenon and erected a bronze statue to Artemis Leucophryene, the goddess of Magnesia, on the Acropolis. They may have returned from Asia Minor in old age, after 412 BC, when the Achaemenids took again firm control of the Greek cities of Asia, and they may have been expelled by the Achaemenid satrap Tissaphernes sometime between 412 and 399 BC. In effect, from 414 BC, Darius II had started to resent increasing Athenian power in the Aegean and had Tissaphernes enter into an alliance with Sparta against Athens, which in 412 BC led to the Persian conquest of the greater part of Ionia.

Plutarch, in the 1st century AD, indicates that he met in Athens a lineal descendant of Themistocles (also called Themistocles) who was still being paid revenues from Asia Minor, 600 years after the events in question.

== Assessments ==

=== Character ===

It is possible to draw some conclusions about Themistocles&#x27;s character. Perhaps his most evident trait was his massive ambition; &quot;In his ambition he surpassed all men&quot;; &quot;he hankered after public office rather as a man in delirium might crave a cure&quot;. He was proud and vain, and anxious for recognition of his deeds. His relationship with power was of a particularly personal nature; while he undoubtedly desired the best for Athens, many of his actions also seem to have been made in self-interest. He also appears to have been corrupt (at least by modern standards), and was known for his fondness of bribes.

Yet, set against these negative traits, was an apparently natural brilliance and talent for leadership:

:Themistocles was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled. By his own native capacity, alike unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities. An able theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his practice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment in matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine, whether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness of his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have surpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an emergency.

Both Herodotus and Plato record variations of an anecdote in which Themistocles responded with subtle sarcasm to an undistinguished man who complained that the great politician owed his fame merely to the fact that he came from Athens. As Herodotus tells it:

:Timodemus of Aphidnae, who was one of Themistocles&#x27;s enemies but not a man of note, was crazed with envy and spoke bitterly to Themistocles of his visit to Lacedaemon, saying that the honors he had from the Lacedaemonians were paid him for Athens&#x27; sake and not for his own. This he kept saying until Themistocles replied, &#x27;This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of Belbina I would not have been honored in this way by the Spartans, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of Athens.&#x27; Such was the end of that business.

As Plato tells it, the heckler hails from the small island of Seriphus; Themistocles retorts that it is true that he would not have been famous if he had come from that small island, but that the heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in Athens.

Themistocles was undoubtedly intelligent, but also possessed natural cunning; &quot;the workings of his mind [were] infinitely mobile and serpentine&quot;. Themistocles was evidently sociable and appears to have enjoyed strong personal loyalty from his friends. At any rate, it seems to have been Themistocles&#x27;s particular mix of virtues and vices that made him such an effective politician.

=== Historical reputation ===

Themistocles died with his reputation in tatters, a traitor to the Athenian people; the &quot;saviour of Greece&quot; had turned into the enemy of liberty. However, his reputation in Athens was rehabilitated by Pericles in the 450s BC, and by the time Herodotus wrote his history, Themistocles was once again seen as a hero. Thucydides evidently held Themistocles in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above). Diodorus also extensively praises Themistocles, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: &quot;Now on the subject of the high merits of Themistocles, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded.&quot; Indeed, Diodorus, whose history includes Alexander the Great and Hannibal, goes so far as to say that
But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man&#x27;s natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts Themistocles holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore, one may well be amazed that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius. Plutarch offers a more nuanced view of Themistocles, with more of a critique of Themistocles&#x27;s character. He does not detract from Themistocles&#x27;s achievements, but also highlights his failings.
Napoleon compared himself to Themistocles after the Battle of Waterloo, in his surrender letter;
Royal Highness, – Exposed to the factions which divide my country, and to the enmity of the great Powers of Europe, I have terminated my political career; and I come, like Themistocles, to throw myself upon the hospitality () of the British people. I claim from your Royal Highness the protections of the laws, and throw myself upon the most powerful, the most constant, and the most generous of my enemies.|Napoleon. (letter of surrender to the Prince Regent; translation).

=== Political and military legacy ===
Undoubtedly the greatest achievement of Themistocles&#x27;s career was his role in the defeat of Xerxes&#x27; invasion of Greece. Against overwhelming odds, Greece survived, and classical Greek culture, so influential in Western civilization, was able to develop unabated. Moreover, Themistocles&#x27;s doctrine of Athenian naval power, and the establishment of Athens as a major power in the Greek world, were of enormous consequence during the 5th century BC. In 478 BC, the Hellenic alliance was reconstituted without the Peloponnesian states into the Delian League, in which Athens was the dominant power. This was essentially a maritime alliance of Athens and her colonies, the Aegean islands, and the Ionian cities. The Delian league took the war to Persia, eventually invading Persian territory and dominating the Aegean. Under Pericles&#x27; guidance, the Delian league evolved into the Athenian Empire, the zenith of Athenian power and influence. Themistocles seems to have deliberately set Athens up as a rival to Sparta in the aftermath of Xerxes&#x27; invasion, basing this strategy on Athenian naval power (contrasted with the power of the Spartan army). Tension grew throughout the century between Athens and Sparta, as they competed to be the leading state in Greece. Finally, in 431 BC, this tension erupted into the Peloponnesian War, the first of a series of conflicts that tore Greece apart for the next century.

Diodorus provides a rhetorical summary that reflects on Themistocles&#x27;s achievements:
What other man, while Sparta still had the superior strength and the Spartan Eurybiades held the supreme command of the fleet, could by his single-handed efforts have deprived Sparta of that glory? Of what other man have we learned from history that by a single act he caused himself to surpass all the commanders, his city all the other Greek states, and the Greeks the barbarians? In whose term as general have the resources been more inferior and the dangers they faced greater? Who, facing the united might of all Asia, has found himself at the side of his city when its inhabitants had been driven from their homes, and still won the victory?Modern scholars have endorsed this view, seeing Themistocles as a quintessential leader and strategist able to transform his city in pursuit of his naval doctrine.

The South American plant genus &quot;Themistoclesia&quot; (named by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch, 1851) is named in honour of Themistocles.

<doc id="31074" wikidata="Q3024935" url="?curid=31074" title="Toonie">
<text>The toonie (also spelled twonie or twoonie), formally the Canadian two-dollar coin (, nicknamed or ), was introduced on February 19, 1996, by Minister of Public Works Diane Marleau. it possesses the highest monetary value of any circulating Canadian coin. The toonie is a bi-metallic coin which on the reverse side features an image of a polar bear by artist Brent Townsend. The obverse, since 2023, bears a portrait of King Charles III. It has the words &quot;Charles III / &quot;; . 

The coin is manufactured using a patented distinctive bi-metallic coin-locking mechanism. The coins are estimated to last 20 years. The discontinued two-dollar bill was less expensive to manufacture but lasted only one year on average.

On April 10, 2012, the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) announced design changes to the loonie and toonie, which include new security features.

Coins minted prior to 2012 consist of an aluminum bronze inner core with a pure nickel outer ring; but in March–May 2012, the composition of the inner core switched to aluminum bronze coated with multi-ply plated brass, and the outer ring switched to steel coated with multi-ply plated nickel. The weight dropped from 7.30 to 6.92g, and the thickness changed from 1.8 to 1.75 mm. The Mint said that multi-ply plated steel technology, already used in Canada&#x27;s smaller coinage, produces an electromagnetic signature that is harder to counterfeit than that of regular alloy coins; also, using steel provides cost savings and avoids fluctuations in the price or supply of nickel.

==Naming==
&quot;Toonie&quot; is a portmanteau word combining the number &quot;two&quot; with the name of the loonie, Canada&#x27;s one-dollar coin. It is occasionally spelled &quot;twonie&quot; or &quot;twoonie&quot;, but Canadian newspapers and the Royal Canadian Mint use the &quot;toonie&quot; spelling.

Jack Iyerak Anawak, member of Parliament from Nunatsiaq (the electoral district representing what is now the territory of Nunavut), suggested the name &quot;Nanuq&quot; [nanook, polar bear] in honour of the Inuit and their northern culture; however, this proposal went largely unnoticed beside the popular &quot;toonie&quot;.

The name &quot;toonie&quot; became so widely accepted that in 2006, the RCM secured the rights to it. A competition to name the bear resulted in the name &quot;Churchill&quot;, a reference both to Winston Churchill and to the common polar bear sightings in Churchill, Manitoba.

==Launch==
Finance Minister Paul Martin announced the replacement of the $2 banknote with a coin in the 1995 Canadian federal budget speech. The RCM spent to canvass 2,000 Canadian households regarding which of the 10 theme options they preferred.

Under the direction of Hieu C. Truong, the RCM engineering division designed the two-dollar coin to be made from two different metals. The metals for the bimetallic coin would be lighter and thinner than those produced anywhere in the world. To join the two parts, the engineering division selected a bimechanical locking mechanism. By the end of 1996, the Winnipeg facility had struck 375 million of these coins. The coin was officially launched at Ben&#x27;s Deli in Montreal on February 19, 1996.

The weight of the coin was originally specified as .

The community of Campbellford, Ontario, home to the coin&#x27;s designer, constructed an toonie monument, similar to the &quot;Big Loonie&quot; in Echo Bay and the Big Nickel in Sudbury.

Unlike the loonie before it, the toonie and the $2 bill were not produced concurrently with each other, as the $2 bill was withdrawn from circulation on February 16, 1996, three days prior to the toonie&#x27;s introduction.

==Commemorative editions==
==Specimen set editions==
From 2010 to 2015, the Royal Canadian Mint issued a two-dollar coin that depicts a different and unique image of a young animal on the coin&#x27;s reverse. These special toonies have limited mintages and are available only in the six-coin specimen sets.
==First strikes==

==Separation of metals==
A failure in the bimetallic locking mechanism in the first batch of toonies caused some coins to separate if struck hard or frozen. Despite media reports of defective toonies, the RCM responded that the odds of a toonie falling apart were about one in 60 million. Deliberately attempting to separate a toonie is considered to be &quot;defacing coin currency&quot;, a summary offence under section 456 of the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot;.

<text>Tirana ( , ; ) is the capital and largest city of Albania. It is located in the centre of the country, enclosed by mountains and hills, with Dajti rising to the east and a slight valley to the northwest overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe, with 2,544 hours of sun per year.

Tirana was founded in 1614 by Ottoman Albanian general Sylejman Pasha Bargjini, centered on the Old Mosque and &quot;türbe&quot;. The site of present-day Tirana has been continuously inhabited since the Iron Age and was likely the core of the Illyrian Kingdom of the Taulantii, which in Classical Antiquity was centred in the hinterland of Epidamnus. Following the Illyrian Wars, it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire; the heritage of that period is reflected by the Mosaics of Tirana. With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fourth century, most of Albania came under the control of the eastern Byzantine Empire, as evident by the Petrelë Castle built during the reign of Justinian I. The city was fairly unimportant until the 20th century, when the Congress of Lushnjë proclaimed it as Albania&#x27;s capital after the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912. 

Classified as a gamma-world-city, Tirana is the most important economic, financial, political, and trade centre in Albania due to its significant location in the centre of the country and its modern air and road transportation. As the seat of power of the Government of Albania, it hosts the official residences of the President and Prime Minister of Albania and the Parliament of Albania. The city was announced as the European Youth Capital for 2022.

== History ==

=== Early development ===
The area of Tirana has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times with the earliest recognised reference found at the Cave of Pëllumbas belonging to the Palaeolithic period. Illyrians were the first population of the area and formed most likely the core of the Illyrian kingdom of the Taulantii, which in classical antiquity was centered in the hinterland of Epidamnus. When the Romans arrived in Illyria after their victory of the Illyrian Wars, they populated and integrated the area into their empire under the political control of the city of Rome. The oldest surviving discovery from this period is a Roman house dating to the 3rd century, which was transformed into an aisleless church with a mosaic floor. A castle, possibly known as &quot;Tirkan&quot;, was built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I between the 4th and 6th century and later restored by Ahmed Pasha Toptani in the 18th century.
Tirana is mentioned in Venetian documents in the 1350s as well as in 1418: &quot;...the resident Pjeter, son of late Domenik from the village of Tirana...&quot;. Records of the first land registrations under the Ottomans in 1431–32 show that Tirana consisted of 60 inhabited areas, with nearly 2,028 houses and 7,300 inhabitants. In 1510, Marin Barleti, an Albanian Catholic priest and scholar, in the biography of the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg, &quot;Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis&quot; (&quot;The story of life and deeds of Skanderbeg, the prince of Epirotes&quot;), referred to this area as a small village, distinguishing between &quot;Little Tirana&quot; and &quot;Great Tirana&quot;. It is later mentioned in 1572 as &quot;Borgo di Tirana&quot;.

According to Hahn, the settlement had already started to develop as a bazaar and included several watermills, even before 1614, when Sulejman Bargjini, a local ruler, built the Old Mosque, a small commercial centre, and a &quot;hammam&quot; (Turkish bath). This is confirmed by oral sources, which state that there were two earlier mosques 300–400 m from the Old Mosque, towards today&#x27;s Ali Demi Street. The Mosque of Reç and the Mosque of Mujo were positioned on the left side of the Lana River and were older than the Old Mosque. Later, the Et&#x27;hem Bey Mosque, built by Molla Bey of Petrela, was constructed. It employed the best artisans in the country and was completed in 1821 by Molla&#x27;s son Etëhem, who was also Sulejman Bargjini&#x27;s great-nephew.

In 1800, the first newcomers arrived in the settlement, the so-called &quot;ortodoksit&quot;. They were Aromanians from villages near Korçë and Pogradec, who settled around modern day Tirana Park on the Artificial Lake. They started to be known as the &quot;llacifac&quot; and were the first Christians to arrive after the creation of the town. In 1807, Tirana became the centre of the Subprefecture of Krujë-Tirana. After 1816, Tirana languished under the control of the &quot;Toptani&quot; family of Krujë. Later, Tirana became a sub-prefecture of the newly created Vilayet of Shkodër and the Sanjak of Durrës. In 1889, the Albanian language started to be taught in Tirana&#x27;s schools, and the patriotic club Bashkimi was founded in 1908.
===Modern development===
On 28 November 1912, the national flag was raised in Vlorë by President Ismail Qemali, marking the symbolic birth of Albania as a sovereign country. The next years, however, were marked by turmoil. During the Balkan Wars, Tirana was temporarily occupied by the Serbian army and it took part in uprising of the villages led by Haxhi Qamili. In August 1916, the first city map was compiled by the specialists of the Austro-Hungarian army. Following the capture of the town of Debar by Serbia, many of its Albanian inhabitants fled to Turkey, the rest went to Tirana. Of those that ended up in Istanbul, some of their number migrated to Albania, mainly to Tirana where the Dibran community (people from Dibër County) formed an important segment of the city&#x27;s population from 1920 onward and for some years thereafter. On 8 February 1920, the Congress of Lushnjë proclaimed Tirana as the temporary capital of Albania, which had gained independence in 1912. The city acquired that status permanently on 31 December 1925. In 1923, the first regulatory city plan was compiled by Austrian architects. The centre of Tirana was the project of Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini, well-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy.
Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre.
The plan underwent revisions by Albanian architect Eshref Frashëri, Italian architect Castellani and Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler.
The modern Albanian parliament building served as an officers&#x27; club. It was there that, in September 1928, Zog of Albania was crowned King Zog I, King of the Albanians.

Tirana was the venue for the signing of the Pact of Tirana between Fascist Italy and Albania.
During the rule of King Zog, many Muhaxhirs emigrated towards Tirana, which led to a growing population in the capital city in the early 20th century.

In 1939, Tirana was captured by Fascist forces, who appointed a puppet government. In the meantime, Italian architect Gherardo Bosio was asked to elaborate on previous plans and introduce a new project in the area of present-day Mother Teresa Square. A failed assassination attempt was made on Victor Emmanuel III of Italy by a local resistance activist during a visit to Tirana. In November 1941, two emissaries of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ), Miladin Popović and Dušan Mugoša, called a meeting of three Albanian communist groups and founded the Communist Party of Albania, and Enver Hoxha soon emerged as its leader.

The town soon became the centre of the Albanian communists, who mobilised locals against Italian fascists and later Nazi Germans, while spreading ideological propaganda. On 4 February 1944, the Gestapo, supported by the forces of Xhafer Deva, executed 86 anti-fascists in Tirana. On 17 November 1944, the town was liberated after a fierce battle between the Communists and German forces. The Nazis eventually withdrew and the communists seized power.
From 1944 to 1991, massive socialist-style apartment complexes and factories were built, while Skanderbeg Square was redesigned, with a number of buildings demolished. For instance, Tirana&#x27;s former Old Bazaar and the Orthodox Cathedral were razed to the ground in order to build the Soviet-styled Palace of Culture. The northern portion of the main boulevard was renamed Stalin Boulevard and his statue was erected in the city square. Because private car ownership was banned, mass transportation consisted mainly of bicycles, trucks and buses. After Hoxha&#x27;s death, a pyramidal museum was constructed in his memory by the government.

Before and after the proclamation of Albania&#x27;s policy of self-imposed isolationism, a number of high-profile figures paid visits to the city, such as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer. In 1985, Enver Hoxha&#x27;s funeral was held in Tirana. A few years later, Mother Teresa became the first religious figure to visit the country after the end of Albania&#x27;s long anti-religious atheist stance. She paid respects to her mother and sister resting at a local cemetery.

Starting at the campus and ending at Skanderbeg Square with the toppling of Enver Hoxha&#x27;s statue, the city saw significant demonstrations by University of Tirana students demanding political freedoms in the early 1990s. On the political aspect, the city witnessed a number of events. Personalities visited the capital, such as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Pope John Paul II.
The former visit came amidst the historical setting after the fall of communism, as hundreds of thousands were chanting in Skanderbeg Square Baker&#x27;s famous saying of &quot;Freedom works!&quot;.
Pope John Paul II became the first major religious leader to visit Tirana, though Mother Teresa had visited few years prior.

During the Balkans turmoil in the mid-1990s, the city experienced dramatic events such as the unfolding of the 1997 unrest in Albania and a failed coup d&#x27;état on 14 September 1998.

In 1999, following the Kosovo War, Tirana Airport became a NATO airbase, serving its mission in the former Yugoslavia.

=== Contemporary ===


During his term from 2000 to 2011, the former mayor of Tirana, Edi Rama, undertook a campaign to demolish illegal constructed buildings across Tirana as well as along the river banks of Lanë to bring the area to its pre-1990 state. In an attempt to widen roads, Rama authorized the bulldozing of private properties so that they could be paved over, thus widening streets. Most main roads underwent reconstruction, including the Unaza, Rruga e Kavajës and the main boulevard. Rama also led the initiative to paint the façades of Tirana&#x27;s buildings in bright colours, although much of their interiors continued to degrade. Rama&#x27;s critics claimed that he focused too much attention on cosmetic changes without fixing any of the major problems such as shortages of drinking water and electricity.

In June 2007, George W. Bush traveled to Tirana on an official state visit, becoming the first U.S. President to visit the former communist country. In 2008, the Gërdec explosions were felt in the capital as windows were shattered and citizens shaken. In January 2011, the Albanian opposition demonstrations were triggered in front of the governmental buildings in Tirana protesting against political corruption and state capture, particularly associated with the former prime minister Sali Berisha&#x27;s government. In September 2014, Pope Francis made an official state visit to Tirana simultaneously becoming the second pontiff to visit Albania, after Pope John Paul II in 1992.

Following the municipal elections of 2015, power was transferred from the Democratic Party representative Lulzim Basha to the Socialist Party candidate Erion Veliaj. Albania then underwent a territorial reform, in which defunct communes were merged with municipalities. Thirteen of Tirana&#x27;s former communes were integrated as administrative units joining the existing eleven.
Since then, Tirana is undergoing significant changes in infrastructure, law enforcement and new projects, as well as continuing the ones started by Veliaj&#x27;s predecessor. In their first few council meetings, 242 social houses got allocated to families in need. Construction permits were suspended until the capital&#x27;s development plan is revised and synthesized.

Between December 2018 and February 2019, a series of demonstrations erupted in the central areas of Tirana and other cities of the country in response to a controversial law on higher education, poor quality of teaching, high tuition rates and corruption. In September 2019, Tirana was ravaged by a 5.6 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter located near Durrës. Two months after, in November 2019, another strong earthquake with the magnitude of 6.4 hit the region again resulting in comparatively few damages in Tirana. The same month, Tirana was announced as the European Youth Capital for 2022 with a planned program including events of cultural and social importance.
In December 2022, Tirana hosted the EU-Western Balkans summit, marking the inaugural summit to be held outside the European Union&#x27;s borders. On 21 September 2024, it was reported that Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama was planning to create the Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order, a sovereign microstate for the Order within Tirana.

== Geography ==
Tirana extends at the Plain of Tirana in the centre of Albania between the mount of Dajti in the east, the hills of Kërrabe, Sauk and Vaqarr in the south, and a valley to the north overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The average altitude is about above sea level, with a maximum of at Maja Mincekut of Mali me Gropa in Shenmeri.

The city is surrounded by two important protected areas: the Dajti National Park and Mali me Gropa-Bizë-Martanesh Protected Landscape. In winter, the mountains are often covered with snow and are a popular retreat for the population of Tirana, which rarely receives snowfalls. In terms of biodiversity, the forests are mainly composed of pine, oak and beech, while its interior relief is dotted with canyons, waterfalls, caves, lakes and other landforms. Thanks to its natural heritage, it is considered the &quot;Natural Balcony of Tirana&quot;. The mountain can be reached by a narrow asphalt mountain road onto an area known as Fusha e Dajtit. From this small area there is a view of Tirana and its plain.

Tiranë river flows through the city, as does the Lanë river. Tirana is home to several artificial lakes, including Tirana, Farka, Tufina, and Kashar. The present municipality was formed in the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities of Baldushk, Bërzhitë, Dajt, Farkë, Kashar, Krrabë, Ndroq, Petrelë, Pezë, Shëngjergj, Tirana, Vaqarr, Zall-Bastar and Zall-Herr, which became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the city of Tirana.

=== Climate ===

Tirana has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification and receives enough precipitation during summer to avoid the Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) classification.

The average precipitation in Tirana is about per year. The city receives the majority of precipitation in winter months, which occurs from November to March, and less in summer months, from June to September. In terms of precipitation, both rain and snow, the city is ranked among the wettest cities in Europe.

Temperatures vary throughout the year from an average of in January to in July. Springs and summers are very warm to hot often reaching over from May to September. During autumn and winter, from November to March, the average temperature drops and is not lower than . The city receives approximately 2500 hours of sun.

=== Urbanism ===

In September 2015, Tirana organized its first vehicle-free day, joining forces with numerous cities across the globe to fight against the existing problem of urban air pollution. This initiative resulted in a considerable drop in both air and noise pollution, encouraging the Municipality to organise a vehicle-free day every month.

The city suffers from problems related to overpopulation, such as waste management, high levels of air pollution and significant noise pollution.
Over the last decades, air pollution has become a pressing concern as the number of cars has increased. These are mostly 1990s and early 2000s diesel cars, while it is widely believed that the fuel used in Albania contains larger amounts of sulfur and lead than in the European Union. Effective 1 January 2019, the government has imposed an import ban of used vehicles made prior to 2005 in an effort to curb pollution, encourage the buying of new cars from certified domestic dealerships, and to improve overall road safety. Another source of pollution are PM10 and PM2.5 inhaled particulate matter and NO2 gases resulting from rapid growth in the construction of new buildings and expanding road infrastructure.

Untreated solid waste is present in the city and outskirts. Additionally, there have been complaints of excessive noise pollution. Despite the problems, the Grand Park at the Artificial Lake has some effect on absorbing CO2 emissions, while over 2.000 trees have been planted around sidewalks.

Works for four new large parks have started in the summer of 2015 located in Kashar, Farkë, Vaqarr, and Dajt. These parks are part of the new urban plan striving to increase the concentration of green spaces in the capital. The government has included designated green areas around Tirana as part of the Tirana Greenbelt where construction is not permitted or limited.
== Politics ==

=== Administration ===

The municipality of Tirana is encompassed in the County of Tirana within the Central Region of Albania and consists of the rural administrative units of Baldushk, Bërzhitë, Dajt, Farkë, Kashar, Krrabë, Ndroq, Petrelë, Pezë, Shëngjergj, Vaqarr, Zall-Bastar, Zall-Herr and Tirana. The administrative unit of Tirana is further partitioned into eleven urban administrative units, namely Tirana 1, Tirana 2, Tirana 3, Tirana 4, Tirana 5, Tirana 6, Tirana 7, Tirana 8, Tirana 9, Tirana 10 and Tirana 11.

The Mayor of Tirana along with the Cabinet of Tirana exercises executive power. The Assembly of Tirana functions as the city parliament and consists of 55 members, serving four-year terms. It primarily deals with budget, global orientations and relations between the city and the Government of Albania. It has 14 committees and its chairman is Aldrin Dalipi from the Socialist Party. Each of the members have a specific portfolio such as economy, finance, juridical, education, health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.

In 2000, the centre of Tirana from the central campus of University of Tirana in the Mother Teresa Square up to the Skanderbeg Square, was declared the place of Cultural Assembly, and given state protection. The historical core of the capital lies around pedestrian only Murat Toptani Street, while the most prominent city district is Blloku. In 2010, the municipality undertook the installing of street name signs and entrance numbers while every apartment entrance was physically stamped.
=== National capital ===

Tirana is the capital city of the Republic of Albania thus playing an essential role in shaping the political and economic life of the country. It is the home to government functions and institutions for which the government of Albania is responsible, as for instance the executive, juridical and legislative branches of Albania.

The President and Prime Minister of Albania officially reside and work in Tirana specifically at the Presidenca and Kryeministria, respectively, nevertheless the Parliament of Albania is headquartered at the Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard. Tirana is also the home to the national Constitutional Court and Supreme Court. Important national institutions housed in Tirana include the Appeal Court and Administrative Court.

The Bank of Albania is located at the Skanderbeg Square while other institutions such as the ministries of Culture, Defence, Education, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Health, Infrastructure, Internal Affairs, Justice and Tourism are spread over Tirana. The city is also the home to all the consulates and embassies in Albania, thereby making it an important centre for international diplomacy in the country.
=== International relations ===
Tirana is a founding member of the Union of Albanian Municipalities in the Region. Tirana is twinned with Ankara, Beijing, Bursa, Doha, Florence, Kharkiv, Sarajevo and has signed partnership agreements with Verona and Zagreb. It has also signed special bilateral agreements with Zaragoza.

== Economy ==

Tirana is the heart of the economy of Albania and the most industrialised and economically fastest growing region in Albania. Of the main sectors, the tertiary sector is the most important for the economy of Tirana and employs more than 68% of work force of Tirana. 26% of the working population makes up the secondary sector followed by the primary sector with only 5%.

The city began to develop at the beginning of the 16th century as it was part of the Ottoman Empire, when a bazaar was established, and its craftsmen manufactured silk and cotton fabrics, leather, ceramics and iron, silver and gold artefacts. In the 20th century, the city and its surrounding areas expanded rapidly and became the most heavily industrialised region of the country.

The most significant contribution is made by the tertiary sector which has developed considerably since the fall of communism in Albania. Forming the financial centre of the country, the financial industry is a major component of the city&#x27;s tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to privatization and the commendable monetary policy. All of the most important financial institutions, such as the Bank of Albania and the Albanian Stock Exchange are centred in Tirana as well as most of the banking companies such as the Banka Kombëtare Tregtare, Raiffeisen Bank, Credins Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank and Tirana Bank.

The telecommunication industry represents another major and growing contributor to the sector. A rapid development occurred as well as after the end of communism and decades of isolationism mainly due to the new national policy of reform and opening up sped up the industry&#x27;s development. Vodafone, Telekom Albania and Eagle are the leading telecommunication providers in Tirana, as in all the country.

The tourism industry of the city has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the economy. Tirana has been officially dubbed as &#x27;The Place Beyond Belief&#x27; by local authorities. The increasing number of international arrivals at the Tirana International Airport and Port of Durrës from across Europe, Australia and Asia has rapidly grown the number of foreign visitors in the city.

The largest hotels of the city are the Tirana International Hotel, Maritim Plaza Tirana both situated in the heart of the city near Skanderbeg Square, and the Hyatt-owned luxury Mak Hotel Tirana located next to the Air Albania Stadium, where Mariott Tirana Hotel is also planned to open. Other major hotels present in central Tirana include the Rogner Hotel, Hilton Garden Inn Tirana, Xheko Imperial Hotel, Best Western Premier Ark Hotel, and Mondial Hotel.
== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
==== Air ====

Tirana is served by Nënë Tereza International Airport, which is simultaneously the premier air gateway to the country. The airport was officially named in honour of the Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary, Mother Teresa. It connects Tirana with many destinations in different countries across Europe, Africa, and Asia. The airport carried more than 3.3 million passengers in 2019 and is also the principal hub for the country&#x27;s flag carrier, Air Albania.

==== Road ====
The city&#x27;s geographical location in the centre of Albania has long established the city as an integral terminus for the national road transportation, thus connecting the city to all parts of Albania and the neighbouring countries. The Rruga Shtetërore 1 (SH1) connects Tirana with Shkodër and Montenegro in the north, and constitutes an essential section of the proposed Adriatic–Ionian motorway.
The Rruga Shtetërore 2 (SH2) continues in the west and provides direct connection to Durrës on the Adriatic Sea. The Rruga Shtetërore 3 (SH3) is being transformed to the Autostrada 3 (A3) and follows the ancient Via Egnatia. It significantly constitutes a major section of the Pan-European Corridor VIII and links the city with Elbasan, Korçë and Greece in the south. Tirana is further connected, through the Milot interchange in the northwest, with Kosovo following as part of the Autostrada 1 (A1).

During the communist regime in Albania, a plan for the construction of a ring road around Tirana arose in 1989s with no implementation until the 2010s. It is of major importance, especially concerning the demographic growth of the metropolitan region of Tirana as well as the importance of the economy. Although, constructions for the nowadays completed southern section of the ring road started in 2011, however, the northern and eastern sections are still in the planning process.

==== Rail ====

Rail lines of Hekurudha Shqiptare (HSH) connected Tirana with all of the major cities of Albania, including Durrës, Shkodër and Vlorë. In 2013, the Tirana Railway Station was closed and moved to Kashar by the city government in order to create space for the New Boulevard () project. The new Tirana Station will be constructed in Laprakë, which is projected to be a multifunctional terminal for rail, tram and bus transportation. City officials have also talked about a light rail extension all the way to the location of the former rail station.
The new rail line from Tirana through Nënë Tereza International Airport to Durrës has started construction.

In 2012, the Tirana municipality published a report according to which a project on the construction of two tram lines was under evaluation. The tram lines would have a total length of . The plan was never implemented. Under the plan, the two tram lines would have intersected in Skanderbeg Square. The public transport in Tirana is, for now, focused only in the city centre, so that the people living in the suburbs have fewer or no public transport connections.

==== Bus ====

Tirana&#x27;s bus network is its primary and only system of public transport. The system has 16 lines serving the urban core, with another 14 suburban lines serving its outer regions. The urban network is made up of 8 radial lines, 5 diagonal lines, and 3 circular or semi-circular lines.

Busses often get stuck in traffic. There were only of dedicated bus lines in 2020.

There were 451 bus stops on the entire urban network in 2020, extending to over . Services operate every day, regardless of holidays and weekends, from 06:00 to 24:00. The entire network had an average headway of 9 minutes on a daily basis in 2018 and in the first half of 2019.

Nearly 257,000 residents lived within a walking area from a bus stop when surveyed in Tirana’s strategic transport study in 2019. That was approximately 35% of the population living inside the Municipal unit of Tirana.

A single-ride ticket costs 40 Lek, and no hourly or daily options are available. Disabled people and veterans may ride for free. An electronic ticketing system is under implementation.
==== Cycling ====

During the administration of mayor Erion Veliaj, the government of Tirana has significantly increased the creation and expansion of a cycling infrastructure in the city in order to reduce traffic congestion as well as to improve the sustainable transportation. Ecovolis was launched in 2011 offering rental services for bicycles at different centrally located stations for a small fee. The international bicycle sharing system, Mobike, launched its operations on 8 June 2018 by deploying 4000 bicycles in the city. Both services are no longer available.

Safe cycling paths are still relatively rare, despite improvements in recent years. Paths are often blocked by parked cars or construction. Other obstructions which decrease ride quality, such as drain holes, are also prevalent. There were only around of cycling routes in 2020.

=== Education ===

Tirana has the highest concentration of institutions of tertiary education in Albania, consisting of numerous academies, colleges and universities. Most prominent among these is the University of Tirana with campuses around the city and more than 28,000 students from all backgrounds. The Polytechnic University of Tirana is another distinguished institution and also the most renowned engineering and technical university in the country. The four other public institutions in Tirana are the University of Arts, University of Agriculture, University of Medicine and University of Sports.

The educational system of Tirana has expanded substantially over the past years with the renovations of existing school facilities and the construction of new schools. For primary and secondary education, a variety of schools are available, tagged with the public, private and international labels. Some of the international schools are the Tirana International School, Albanian International School, British School, Montessori School, Memorial School and World Academy. The public primary and secondary Servete Maçi School won an award at the 2020 International Architecture Awards.

=== Health ===

There are numerous public and private hospitals as well as smaller public and private health care facilities in the territory of Tirana. The Mother Teresa University Hospital is one of the largest medical tertiary institutions of the country. Other medical institutions include the Shefqet Ndroqi University Hospital, Koço Gliozheni Hospital, Mbretëresha Gjeraldinë Hospital and the Military Hospital.

== Demography ==
The Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) estimated the population of the municipality of Tirana at 598,176 in the 2023 census. With a population density of 502 people per square kilometre, Tirana is the most densely populated municipality in the country. The encompassing metropolitan area, consisting of the regions of Durrës and Tirana, has a combined population of approximately 1 million amounting to nearly one third of the country&#x27;s total population.

Historically, Tirana has experienced a steady population increase in the past years, especially after the fall of communism in the late twentieth century as well as the beginning of the twenty-first century. The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fueled by migrants from all over the country often in search of employment and improved living conditions. Between 1820 and 1955, the population of Tirana tenfolded while during the period from 1989 to 2011, the city&#x27;s population grew annually by approximately 2.7%. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city had a rate of growth less than 1% annually until the 1970s, then down to less than 8% per year until the middle 20th century figures.
Tirana&#x27;s population is composed by a mixture of different cultural and ethnic groups from Southern Europe. The most represented ethnicities are Albanians (84.10%), Greeks (0.35%), Aromanians (0.11%), Macedonians (0.07%) and Italians (0.03%).

In Albania, a secular state with no state religion, the freedom of belief, conscience and religion is explicitly guaranteed in the constitution of Albania. Tirana is religiously diverse and has many places of worship catering to its religious population whom are adherents of Islam, Christianity and Judaism but also of Atheism and Agnosticism. They all maintain their Albanian headquarters spread across the territory of Tirana. Nevertheless, the Bektashi Order leadership established their world centre also in the city.

In the 2011 census, 55.7% of the population of the municipality of Tirana was counted as Muslim, 3.4% as Bektashis and 11.8% as Christian including 5.4% as Roman Catholic and 6.4% as Eastern Orthodox. The remaining 29.1% of the population reported having no religion or did not provide an adequate answer. The census of 2011 did not included specific municipality level data for other religious groups. The Roman Catholic Church is represented in Tirana by the Archdiocese of Tiranë and Durrës, with the St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral as the seat of the prelacy. The Albanian Orthodox community is served by the Archbishop of Tirana in the Resurrection Cathedral.

==Culture==


Tirana offers a blend of traditional and modern lifestyle with a variety of arts, food, entertainment, music and night life. Its population celebrates a wide range of religious and other festivals including Christmas, Eid, Hanukkah and Nowruz. Another festival is Dita e Verës taking place every year on 14 March, during which the Albanians celebrate the end of winter and the arrival of spring.

Among the local institutions are the National Library, that keeps more than a million books, periodicals, maps, atlases, microfilms and other library materials. The city has five well-preserved traditional houses (museum-houses), 56 cultural monuments, eight public libraries.

There are many domestic and foreign cultural institutions in Tirana, amongst them the British Council, Canadian Institute of Technology as well as the German Goethe-Institut and Friedrich Ebert Foundation. Other cultural institutions include the Chinese Confucius Institute, Greek Hellenic Foundation for Culture, Italian Istituto Italiano di Cultura and the French Alliance Française.

=== Architecture ===
Tirana is home to a mixture of architectural styles reflecting the influential periods in its history. Its current appearance was considerably shaped by two totalitarian regimes, once by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini during the Second World War and the regime of Enver Hoxha in the aftermath. The Palace of Brigades, the ministries buildings, the government building and the municipality hall are designed by Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini, both well-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy. The Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard was built in 1930 and given the name King Zog I Boulevard.
In the 20th century, the part from Skanderbeg Square up to the train station was named Stalin Boulevard. The Royal Palace or Palace of Brigades previously served as the official residence of King Zog I. It has been used by different Albanian governments for various purposes. Because of the outbreak of World War II, and the 1939 Italian invasion of Albania, Zog I fled Albania and never had a chance to see the Palace fully constructed. The Italians finished it and used it as the Army Headquarters. The Palace took its nickname Palace of Brigades because it was taken from the Italians by a people&#x27;s army brigade.

In the 21st century, Tirana turned into a proper modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces. In June 2016, the Mayor of Tirana Erion Veliaj and the Italian architect Stefano Boeri announced the start of the works for the redaction of the Master Plan &quot;Tirana 2030&quot;.
Tirana is a densely-built area and still offers several public parks throughout its districts, graced with green gardens. The Grand Park is the most important green space in Tirana. It is one of the most visited areas by local citizens. The park includes many children&#x27;s playgrounds, sport facilities and landmarks such as the Saint Procopius Church, the Presidential Palace, the Botanical Gardens, the Tirana Zoo, the Amphitheatre, the Monument of the Frashëri Brothers and many others.

The Rinia Park was built during the Communist era. It bordered by Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard to the east, Gjergi Fishta Boulevard and Bajram Curri Boulevard to the south, Rruga Ibrahim Rugova to the west and Rruga Myslym Shyri to the north. The Taivani Centre is the main landmark in the park and houses cafés, restaurants, fountains, and a bowling lane in the basement. The Summer Festival takes place every year in the park, to celebrate the end of winter and the rebirth of nature and a rejuvenation of spirit amongst the Albanians.

As of 2020 it was announced that the Municipality of Tirana will build more green spaces and will plant more trees.
=== Museums ===

Tirana is the home to a number of museums dedicated to a wide array of arts. The National Museum of History is located at the Skanderbeg Square and the most representative museum of Tirana. The mosaic above the entrance is the most dominant feature of the museum displaying the story of how the Albanian people have fought against invasion and occupation throughout history.

Founded in 1948, the National Museum of Archaeology at the Mother Teresa Square displays a wide collection of research and discoveries belonging to the archaeological locations around Albania. It exhibits span from prehistory through antiquity and the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, offering an overview of the country&#x27;s historical diversity.

The National Art Gallery is considered the most important gallery in Albania housing one of the greatest collections of paintings in the region. Located at the Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard, it holds approximately 4.500 works of art including the most important collection of Albanian art of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The Bunk&#x27;art Museum consists of two underground bunkers built under the orders and direction of Hoxha during the communist era. Located at the Fadil Deliu Street and Abdi Toptani Street respectively, the bunkers have been transformed into a history museum and contemporary art gallery with exhibits from the Second World War and Cold War.

The Museum of Secret Surveillance was founded in 2017 and is housed within a twentieth century mansion, the building known as the &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, near the Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard. It commemorates and honours the victims who fell to the communist terrorism and violence during the communist period in Albania. Other museums include the Natural Sciences Museum, which has branches in zoology, botany and geology, the former Enver Hoxha Museum and the Bunk&#x27;art Museum.

The Bektashi Museum was opened at the World Headquarters of the Bektashi on 7 September 2015. The museum contains exhibits relating to Bektashi history and leadership.

===Cuisine===

As in other parts of Albania, agricultural traditions are of great significance to the Albanians in Tirana, substantially appreciated for the production of food such as cheese, olives and wine. In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain by becoming the country with the most coffee houses per capita in the world with 654 coffee houses per 100,000 inhabitants. This is due to coffee houses closing down in Spain due to the economic crisis, and the fact that as many cafes open as they close in Albania. In addition, the fact that it was one of the easiest ways to make a living after the fall of communism in Albania, together with the country&#x27;s Ottoman legacy further reinforce its strong dominance in Albania.

The Tirana region is known for the Fergesa traditional dish made with either peppers or liver, and is found at a number of traditional restaurants in the city and agri-tourism sites on the outskirts of Tirana.

===Sports===
Being the capital, Tirana is the centre of sport in Albania, where activity is organised across amateur and professional levels. It is home to many major sporting facilities. Starting from 2007, the Tirana Municipality has built up to 80 sport gardens in most of Tirana&#x27;s neighborhoods. One of the latest projects is the reconstruction of the existing Olympic Park, that will provide infrastructure for most intramural sports.

Tirana hosted in the past three major events, the 2006 European Promotion Cup for Men, 2011 World Mountain Running Championships and the 2013 European Weightlifting Championships.
There are two major stadiums, the former Qemal Stafa Stadium and the Selman Stërmasi stadium. The former was demolished in 2016 to make way for the new national stadium. The new stadium called the &quot;Air Albania Stadium&quot; was constructed on the same site of the former Qemal Stafa Stadium and it is planned to open in late 2019. It will have an underground parking, Marriott Tirana Hotel, shops and bars and will be used for entertainment events. Tirana&#x27;s sports infrastructure is developing fast because of the investments from the municipality and the government.

Football is the most widely followed sport in Tirana as well as in the country, having numerous club teams including the KF Tirana, Partizani Tirana, and Dinamo Tirana. It is popular at every level of society, from children to wealthy professionals. In football, as of April 2012, the Tirana-based teams have won a combined 57 championships out of 72 championships organised by the FSHF, i.e. 79% of them. Another popular sport in Albania is basketball, represented in particular by the teams KB Tirana, BC Partizani, BC Dinamo, Ardhmëria and also the women&#x27;s PBC Tirana.

Recently two rugby teams were created: Tirana Rugby Club, founded in 2013 and Ilirët Rugby Club founded in 2016.

===Media===
As the capital, Tirana is the most significant location for the Albanian media industry whose content is distributed throughout Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-speaking territories. Tirana is the home to most of the national and international television stations, including the national broadcaster, Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH), along with all its television and radio networks. The three largest Albanian commercial broadcasters, such as Televizioni Klan, Top Channel and Vizion Plus, also maintains their headquarters in the city. The European broadcaster, Euronews, operates a franchise in the city as well as the American broadcaster CNN.

Tirana is also a principal location for the largest Albanian newspapers, magazines and publications. The newspapers with the largest circulations in Albania are published in Tirana, including Gazeta Shqip, Gazeta Tema, Koha Jonë and Panorama. Gazeta Shqiptare, one of the oldest Albanian-language newspapers in Albania, operates and has its headquarters in the city. Tirana also has a well-established English-language newspaper, notably the daily of Tirana Times.

<text>The Wedding Planner is a 2001 American romantic comedy film directed by Adam Shankman, in his feature film directorial debut, written by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis, and starring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey.

==Plot==
Ambitious San Francisco wedding planner Mary Fiore is reintroduced to childhood acquaintance Massimo by her father Salvatore, who wants them to marry, but Mary declines. Hoping to persuade her boss, Geri, to make her a partner at their company, Mary is hired to plan catering heiress Fran Donolly&#x27;s society wedding to long-term boyfriend &quot;Eddie&quot;. While reporting her success to her colleague Penny on the phone, Mary&#x27;s shoe heel gets stuck in a manhole cover. As she struggles to free herself, a taxicab collides with a dumpster that comes hurtling towards her. A nearby man pulls her out of the way of the speeding dumpster just in time, and she thanks him before fainting.

Waking up in the hospital, Mary meets her rescuer, pediatrician Steve Edison. Penny invites Steve to attend an outdoor movie with them, but makes an excuse to leave the pair alone together. Mary and Steve dance to an alfresco screening of &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot; but are interrupted by a heavy downpour before they can kiss.

At a dance lesson with a client, Mary encounters Fran, who introduces her to her fiancé &quot;Eddie&quot;, none other than Steve. Fran leaves them to dance together, and Mary angrily rebukes Steve for leading her on behind Fran&#x27;s back. Penny reminds Mary that her career is more important than her feelings and persuades her to continue planning Fran and Steve&#x27;s wedding.

On a visit to a potential wedding venue in Napa Valley, Massimo appears and, to Mary&#x27;s horror, introduces himself as her fiancé. While riding through the estate with Fran&#x27;s parents, Mrs. Donolly&#x27;s singing frightens Mary&#x27;s horse. Steve rescues Mary again and admonishes her for condemning his actions when she was also engaged.

At home, Mary scolds her father for trying to set her up with Massimo. Salvatore reveals that his marriage to her mother, which Mary has viewed as the perfect relationship, was arranged and only became a loving relationship months later, leaving Mary conflicted.

While visiting another potential venue, Fran reveals she is going on a week-long business trip and leaves Mary and Steve to continue preparations. They apologize for their angry words and soon become friends. They run into Wendy and Keith, whom Mary reveals was once her fiancé until she caught him cheating with Wendy on the night of their rehearsal dinner.

Intoxicated and struggling to get into her apartment, Mary breaks down, lamenting that Keith is married and expecting a baby while she is alone and miserable. Steve gets Mary inside and comforts her as she sobers up, insisting that Keith was a fool to pick Wendy over her. Steve leaves but quickly returns and confesses his feelings for Mary. She replies that she respects Fran too much to let anything happen between them and sends Steve away.

Fran confesses to Mary that she is unsure if she is still in love with Steve. Ignoring her own heart, Mary convinces Fran to continue with the wedding. At a birthday party, Massimo offers Mary a heartfelt proposal, and she reluctantly accepts; the two couples prepare for their respective weddings. Leaving Penny to coordinate the Donolly wedding, Mary goes to marry Massimo at the town hall. Steve asks Fran if they are doing the right thing, and she admits that she does not want to get married. They part amicably, Fran leaving to enjoy their honeymoon alone. Penny reveals Mary&#x27;s marriage plans to Steve, and he rushes to stop her.

At the town hall, Massimo and Mary prepare to marry, but her father stops the ceremony, realizing the wedding is not what Mary wants. Mary, having given up on true love, insists that life is not a fairy tale and that marrying Massimo is the right thing to do but realizes he is not the one for her and leaves.

Steve arrives to find Salvatore and Massimo, who reveals that he could not proceed with the wedding knowing Mary was actually in love with Steve. Steve reveals his feelings to Salvatore, who encourages him to go after her. Steve and Massimo ride off on Massimo&#x27;s scooter to the park, where another outdoor movie is starting. Steve finds Mary, asks her to dance, and they kiss.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Casting===
The original actors set to play Mary and Steve were Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brendan Fraser, respectively. They were replaced with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Both couples eventually dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; for Gellar, leaving Lopez and McConaughey to be the eventual stars.

===Filming===
Many of the scenes were shot in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, specifically at the Music Concourse (between the old De Young Museum and the old California Academy of Sciences), the Japanese Tea Garden and The Huntington Library and Gardens. The first wedding ceremony is filmed inside the chapel at Stanford University.

==Reception==
&quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; was released in the United States on January 26, 2001, by Sony Pictures Releasing.

===Box office===
&quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; grossed $60.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $34.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $94.7 million.

In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $13.5 million from 2,785 theaters on its opening weekend (the Super Bowl weekend), opening at number one at the box office. Lopez&#x27;s second album &quot;J.Lo&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the same week, making Lopez the first entertainer to achieve a number-one album and film simultaneously in the same week.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Instead of being light and charming, this romantic comedy is heavy-handed and contrived in its execution. Also, it&#x27;s too unoriginal.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable&quot; reviews.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Lisa Schwarzbaum compared the film unfavorably to &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, writing, &quot;Where Julia Roberts turned the world on with her huggability, Lopez&#x27;s vibe is that of someone afraid to get mussed. And where Rupert Everett was divine as a sidekick, McConaughey is mortally ordinary as a main dish who spends most of his time smiling like a party guest.&quot; Kimberly Jones of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; noted that the two leading characters being mistreated was the biggest disappointment from &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;, feeling that while Lopez and McConaughey have &quot;enormous charisma&quot; (referencing Lopez&#x27;s work on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Out of Sight&quot; as an example), the &quot;blandness of &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; burlap-sacks their appeal in an altogether dowdy outing for two stars who deserve much snazzier threads.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the &quot;undeniable charisma&quot; of the film&#x27;s stars along with their &quot;goofiness&quot; makes &quot;&quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; more painless than it has a right to be.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s Robert Koehler described &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; as &quot;an attractive bridesmaid but hardly a gorgeous bride among romantic comedies.&quot; Michael Thomson from the BBC wrote, &quot;Unfortunately, after the two leads become less wired in each other&#x27;s presence, and the sexual tension begins to droop, everyone seems to be reading an autocue.&quot; For her role in the film, Lopez was nominated for Worst Actress at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards.

<text>The Problem of Pain is a 1940 book on the problem of evil by C. S. Lewis, in which Lewis argues that human pain, animal pain, and hell are not sufficient reasons to reject belief in a good and powerful God.

Lewis states that his writing is &quot;not &quot;primarily&quot; arguing the truth of Christianity but describing its origin - a task ... necessary if we are to put the problem of pain in its right setting&quot;. He begins by addressing the flaws in common arguments against the belief in a just, loving, and all-powerful God such as: &quot;If God were good, He would make His creatures perfectly happy, and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.&quot; Topics include human suffering and sinfulness, animal suffering, and the problem of hell, and seeks to reconcile these with an omnipotent force beyond ourselves.

== Summary ==

=== Introduction ===
Lewis starts with his former atheistic stance and paints in broad strokes the &quot;problem of pain&quot;. He asks how, if the world is so bad, did humans ever attribute it to a benevolent deity? He then describes three attributes that all developed religions have and a fourth attribute peculiar to Christianity.

1) An experience with the Numinous (a sort of awe, dread, and a general sense of experiencing something otherworldly &quot;uncanny&quot;).

2) An acknowledgement of morality.

3) The Numinous as guardian of the morality.

4) Actual historical events.

=== Divine Omnipotence ===
Lewis states the problem of pain again in a simpler way: &quot;If God were good, He would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty, He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore, God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.&quot;
Lewis says that if the popular meanings attached to the words are the best or only possible then the problem is unanswerable. The possibility of answering it depends on understanding the words &#x27;good,&#x27; &#x27;almighty,&#x27; and &#x27;happy&#x27; in a bigger sense.

He discusses the nature of &quot;impossible&quot; with the conclusion that anything self-contradictory is not under the auspice of God’s omnipotence because it would be a non-entity; anything is possible with God.

Lewis then talks about the nature of nature/matter. Because there are things outside an individual and God, things cannot be configured to suit the individual perfectly. He also introduces the concept of Free Will and how that further inhibits everyone being pain-free all the time, although he does allow and say miracles do exist. Lewis postulates that maybe this world is not the &#x27;best of all possible&#x27; universes but the only possible one. 
He acknowledges the objection that if God is good and he saw how much suffering it would produce why would he do it. Lewis doesn’t know how to answer that type of question and says that that is not his objective, but only to conceive how goodness (assured on other grounds) and suffering are without contradiction.

=== Divine Goodness ===
Lewis draws an analogy to compare our understanding of goodness to that of God’s. He says it differs like that of a child’s attempt at drawing a circle for the first time to that of a perfect circle. He goes on to say that people don’t want a good God or a Father but a &quot;senile benevolence who likes to see the young people enjoying themselves.&quot; Love and kindness are not one and the same thing. Lewis then summarizes all the different kinds of loves and analogies in scripture that describe God’s relation to humans. Lewis says that the problem of pain is insoluble if we attach a &quot;trivial meaning to the word ‘love’.&quot; God loves His goodness into us and our highest activity is response and not initiation; the love may cause us pain but only because the object needs alteration to become fully lovable.

=== Human Wickedness ===
Lewis starts off by asking why humans need so much alteration. Immediately he shares the Christian answer that humans have used free will to become very bad. He then talks about when Jesus and the apostles preached people understood a real consciousness deserving a divine anger, but in the 20th century people don’t believe they are &quot;mortally ill&quot;. He blames misattributing kindness to ourselves and the effect of psychoanalysis on the public mind for driving out a healthy sense of shame from our collective minds.

Lewis acknowledges the critique of what specific, individual harm have we done to God for God to be always angry. Lewis says that when a person feels real guilt, this critique falls away. &quot;When we merely say that we are bad, the ‘wrath’ of God seems a barbarous doctrine; as soon as we perceive our badness, it appears inevitable, a mere corollary from God’s goodness.&quot; 

He then goes on to add a few considerations &quot;to make the reality less incredible&quot;.

1) We are deceived by looking on the outside of things: we should not mistake our inevitably limited utterances for a full account of the worst that is inside.

2) While there is a social conscious and corporate guilt, don’t let the idea distract you from your own &quot;old-fashioned guilts&quot; that have nothing to do with the ‘system’. Often, it’s an excuse for evading the real issue. Once we’ve learned of our individual corruption, we can go on to think about corporate guilt.

3) &quot;We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin.&quot;

4) We must guard against the feeling that there is ‘safety in number’.

5) Different ages excelled in different virtues. Other times might have been more courageous or chaste but God was not content with them, so why should he be content with us.

6) All the virtues need to control one another, if not then the virtue which stands above others will tumble all into vice.

7) The Holiness of God is something more and other than moral perfection.

8) Don’t shift blame for human behavior to the Creator. While it is not possible to follow the moral law perfectly, &quot;the ultimate problem must not be used as one more means of evasion&quot;. You could be as pious as the early Christians but many don’t intend it.

Lewis then says that he doesn’t believe in the doctrine of Total Depravity on logical and experiential grounds. Also, shame is of value, not as an emotion but for the insight that it provides. He shares how he notices that the holier a man is the more fully aware he is of his vileness.

=== The Fall of Man ===
Lewis explains how the Christian answer to human wickedness is the doctrine of the Fall: &quot;Man is now a horror to God and to himself and a creature ill-adapted to the universe not because God made him so but because he has made himself so by the abuse of his free will.&quot;

He details two &quot;sub-Christian&quot; theories which the doctrine of the Fall guards against: Monism and Dualism. The first saying God, being above good and evil, produces impartially the effects to which we call good and evil. The second saying there’s an equal and independent power that produces evil.

Lewis says that he doesn’t think the doctrine of the Fall answers whether it was better for God to create or not to create. Or if it is ‘just’ to punish individuals for the faults of their remote ancestors.

He then reviews the story from Genesis 3 and follows it with an argument saying that we cannot call our early ancestors more ‘savage’ than we are today. He gives a defense of civilizations past and says they were probably just as civilized like us but in different ways.

He concludes that science has nothing to say against the doctrine of the Fall, but acknowledges a more philosophical problem. That the idea of sin presupposes a law to sin against and the first man could not commit the first sin. Lewis points out though that the doctrine doesn’t say the sin was a social sin but a sin against God, an act of disobedience. Lewis says, &quot;We must look for the great sin on a deeper and more timeless level than that of social morality.&quot; 

Lewis shares how Saint Augustine called this sin Pride and all humans face it when they become aware of God as God and itself as self. He gives a few illustrations of this choice then paints a picture of what he guesses actually happened when Man fell.

After his illustration, Lewis says, &quot;the act of self-will on the part of the creature, which constitutes an utter falseness to its creaturely position, is the only sin that can be conceived as the Fall&quot;. God then began &quot;ruling&quot; Man not by the laws of the spirit but by the laws of nature. Therefore, the human spirit moved from being the master of human nature to become a mere lodger or prisoner in its own house. Lewis then says this condition was passed down biologically. He says that our present condition is because we are a part of a spoiled species, not that we’re suffering for the rebellion of remote ancestors.

Lewis says that his explanation is shallow for he has said nothing about the trees of life and knowledge of good and evil, and nothing about what the apostle Paul has said on the subject. He also uses an analogy to quantum physics in that when we try to draw illustrations we are moving further away from reality. He does use an example from the Old Testament to show how original sin might have been passed down if we take a more communal/societal view of things. He sums up the chapter by saying &quot;man, as a species, spoiled himself, and that good, to us in our present state, must therefore mean primarily remedial or corrective good&quot;.

=== Human Pain ===
He says that pain is inherent in a world where souls meet and souls acting wickedly towards each other probably accounts for four-fifths of the World’s pain. And he says it’s a legitimate question to ask why humans are given permission to torture each other. He refines his previous statement that the people can only experience remedial good and says it’s an incomplete answer. He classifies pain into two senses: 1) a physical sensation and 2) any experience, physical or mental, that person dislikes.

He says that the proper aim of any creature is to self-surrender – to offer back the will which we claim as our own, and this necessity is a daily occurrence which is inherently painful. He says this process is made easier through pain itself because 1) people would not surrender if all was well, so pain is recognizable and unmasked evil; &quot;every man knows something is wrong when he is being hurt&quot;. 2) Pain shatters the illusion that we have enough for ourselves. 3) We know we’re acting for God’s sake if the material action of our choice is painful or at least contrary to our inclinations.

For the first, Lewis says sadists and masochists are no different, they just isolate and exaggerate an aspect of normal pleasure. The sadists exaggerates the moment of union by saying &quot;I am such a master that I even torment you&quot; and the masochist exaggerates the complementary side by saying &quot;I am so enthralled that I welcome even pain at your hands.&quot; If these people recognized pain for what it was, their habits would cease to provide a pleasurable stimulus.

To underline his point he says probably the most famous line from this book: &quot;God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.&quot;

He says that a recognition of this truth underlies the universal feeling that bad men ought to suffer – a sense of retribution. While some people want to do away with retribution, Lewis says that to do so would make all punishment unjust and any act to correct behavior would contradict itself. On another level, Lewis says that we experience a thirst for revenge. This passion though loses sight of the end in the means.
He notes how biblical ancestors probably meant retribution when they spoke of God’s ‘vengeance’. Pain gives the only opportunity for bad men to amend.

=== Human Pain, Continued ===
In this chapter Lewis discusses six propositions that are not connected but need saying for a complete view of human pain:

1) &quot;There is a paradox about tribulation in Christianity.&quot; 

2) &quot;If tribulation is a necessary element in redemption we must anticipate that it will never cease till God sees the world to be either redeemed or no further redeemable.&quot;

3) The Christian doctrine of self-surrender and obedience is purely theological and not political.

4) &quot;We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun, and some ecstasy… Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.&quot; 

5) &quot;We must never make the problem of pain worse than it is by vague talk about ‘unimaginable sum of human misery’.&quot; 

6) Of all evils, pain is only sterilized or disinfected evil. Is this about perspective? Lewis distinguishes between pain and evil.

=== Hell ===
Lewis restates that allowing free will means that some people will choose rebellion and not all will be saved. He says that there was no other doctrine that he wished he could remove more, that it has the support of scripture, Jesus Christ himself, and reason. While some overdo it and tragedies have come from espousing the doctrine, Christians preach it because it is a terrible possibility and its horrors are worse.

Lewis then states the real problem: &quot;so much mercy, yet still there is Hell&quot;. He first says that the doctrine is not tolerable but it is moral. Then lays out the ordinary objections and his responses to them.

1) Many people, Lewis says, object to retributive punishment. He reminds readers of a previous chapter of how he showed a core of righteousness in punishment/pain and how it could lead to repentance. But what if the punishment didn’t lead there? He asks the reader if they could really allow a wicked person to go forever into eternity happy and thinking they had the last laugh? If a person wouldn’t allow that, then is that feeling their own wickedness or spite? Or does it reveal the conflict between Justice and Mercy? He quotes Aquinas and Aristotle who says that suffering and shame, respectively, are not good in and of themselves but as a means to an end. He finishes his response to this objection by saying &quot;to condone an evil is simply to ignore it, to treat it as if it were good&quot;.

Before going to the next objection Lewis references Christ’s words about Hell. In addition to Hell being like a sentence given at a tribunal, Christ says that men prefer darkness to light and that men choose Hell as a final act of cutting themselves off from all things that are not themselves.

2) The second objection Lewis responds to is the disproportion between eternal damnation and transitory sin: if hell is for eternity then it as a punishment far outweighs anything we could do on earth. Lewis responds by first saying that the idea of eternity as a mere prolongation of time is uncertain and offers his metaphor for what eternity might really look like. He also says that a finality of judgment must come some time and omniscience would know when.

3) A third objection is the &quot;fruitful intensity of the pains of hell&quot; as depicted famously in medieval art and passages of scripture. Lewis says destruction implies the creation of something else, like ashes, gases, and heat after burning a log, so what if Hell is the ‘remains’ of souls? Then Lewis says, &quot;What is cast (or casts itself) into hell is not a man: it is ‘remains’. To be a complete man means to have the passions obedient to the will and the will offered to God: to have been a man – to be an ex-man or ‘damned ghost’ – would presumably mean to consist of a will utterly centered in its self and passions utterly uncontrolled by the will.&quot; He then finishes off suggesting &quot;hell is hell, not from its own point of view, but from the heavenly point of view&quot;.

4) The fourth objection he states is that no &quot;charitable man&quot; blessed in heaven could stay there while even one human soul was in hell, and if so would he be more merciful than God? Lewis says that this objection assumes that heaven and hell &quot;co-exist in unilinear time&quot; like the histories of two countries. Lewis points to Christ who emphasizes not the point of duration but that of finality. He says that we know more about heaven than we do of hell &quot;for heaven is the home of humanity… It is in no sense parallel to heaven: it is ‘the darkness outside’, the outer rim where being fades away into nonentity&quot;.

5) The final objection says that the ultimate loss of a single soul means the defeat of omnipotence. Lewis agrees that it does. He says that by creating beings with free will God submits to the possibility of such a defeat. Lewis calls this defeat a miracle, &quot;for to make things which are not Itself and thus to become, in a sense, capable of being resisted by its own handiwork, is the most astonishing and unimaginable of all feats we attribute to a deity&quot;.

Lewis concludes the chapter by saying that all answers to objections of hell are themselves a question: &quot;What are you asking God to do?&quot; Whatever it is you would like God has already done. To forgive them? It is already done. To leave them alone? That is what He does. Also, Lewis reminds the reader that in discussing Hell we should not keep our friends and enemies before our eyes since both obscure reason, but to think of ourselves.

=== Animal Pain ===
Lewis turns his attention to another facet of the problem of pain, that of animal pain. He says the Christian explanation for human pain doesn’t work because so far as we can see animals are incapable of sin or virtue so they neither deserve pain nor are improved by it. It is not an unimportant question though since all &quot;plausible grounds for questioning the goodness of God is very important indeed&quot;.

Lewis admits that whatever we say about animal pain is purely speculative. He says that we can deduce from the doctrine that God is good that the appearance of cruelty in the animal kingdom is an illusion. But everything after that is guesswork he says.

He continues though by ruling out another speculation. He says that the ruthless biological competition has no moral importance: good and evil only appear with sentience. 
Lewis raises three questions: 1) why do animals suffer? 2) how did disease and pain enter the animal world? 3) how can animal suffering be reconciled with the justice of God?
Although admitting that we don’t know the answer to the first question he still offers his guesses. He begins by distinguishing between types of animals then distinguishing between sentience and consciousness. He says that sentience is experiencing a &quot;succession of perceptions&quot; where consciousness sees the experiences a part of a larger whole. For example, a sentient being would have the experience of thing A then thing B then thing C where consciousness sees it as having the experience of ABC. He says humans are sentient but unconscious when they are sleepwalking.

Lewis allows that some higher form animals (like apes and elephants) might have a rudimentary individual self but says that their suffering might not be suffering in any real sense and humans might be projecting themselves onto the beasts.

Answering the second question, Lewis says that the Fall of Man could have brought about animal suffering. Animal nature could have also been corrupted prior to Adam by Satan because the &quot;intrinsic evil of the animal world lies in the fact that some animals live by destroying each other&quot;. Lewis pontificates that Man might have been brought into the World to perform a redemptive function.

Lastly, Lewis responds to the question of justice and animal suffering by making somewhat of a joke. He says that if one wants to make room for animal immortality, although the scriptures are silent, then &quot;a heaven for mosquitoes and a hell for men could very conveniently be combined&quot;. He goes on though to say that the objection of scripture’s silence would be fatal only if Christian revelation intended to be a system to answer all questions. Lewis says that &quot;the curtain has been rent at one point, and at one point only, to reveal our immediate practical necessities and not to satisfy our intellectual curiosity&quot;.

He says though, assuming that their selfhood is not an illusion, animals cannot be considered in and of themselves. &quot;Man is to be understood only in his relation to God. The beasts are to be understood only in their relation to man and, through man, to God.&quot; Lewis then tries to correct the notion that many people have that the ‘real’ or ‘natural’ animal is the wild one while the tame animal is unnatural. Lewis says that Christians must believe that since they were given dominion over beasts that everything they do concerning them is either a lawful exercise or a sacrilegious abuse. So the tame animal is the only natural one and any real self it has is owed entirely to its master, and if the animal does have immortality it is through their master. Lewis admits that he’s only talking about a privileged case and not about wild animals or those ill-treated domestic ones.

Lewis says that Christians hesitate to suppose animal immorality for two reasons: 1) it would obscure the spiritual difference between beast and man and 2) it would be a clumsy assertion of Divine goodness.

He continues with further speculations before concluding the chapter saying, &quot;I think the lion, when he has ceased to be dangerous, will still be awful: indeed, what we shall then first see that of which the present fangs and claws are a clumsy, and satanically perverted, imitation. There will still be something like the shaking of a golden mane: and often the good Duke will say, ‘Let him roar again.’&quot;

=== Heaven ===
Lewis starts off the last chapter of the book by stating that not mentioning heaven is &quot;leaving out almost the whole of one side of the account&quot; and would not be a Christian one. 
He says that we don’t need to be afraid that heaven is a bribe because heaven offers us nothing that &quot;a mercenary soul can desire&quot;, that the pure in heart will see God because they are the only ones who want to. &quot;Love, by definition, seeks to enjoy its object&quot; like a man wanting to marry the woman he loves.

Lewis paints the picture that there’s a signature on each soul that we’re aware of but don’t have all the details about and that we can never really possess. He says heredity and environment might produce this signature but those are only the instruments by which God creates a soul. &quot;The mold in which a key is made would be a strange thing, if you had never seen a key: and the key itself a strange thing if you had never seen a lock.&quot; 
He continues to paint a beautiful illustration of heaven and how it would fit every real, human desire we ever had. How you, listener, will behold Him and not another. &quot;God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love.&quot; He goes on &quot;The world is like a picture with a golden background, and we the figures in that picture. Until you step off the plane of the picture into the large dimensions of death you cannot see the gold.&quot;

If this opinion is false, he says, then something better than his opinion is waiting. That heaven is &quot;doubtless the continually successful, yet never complete, attempt by each soul to communicate its unique vision to all others (and that by means whereof earthly art and philosophy are but clumsy imitations) is also among the ends for which the individual was created. For union exists only between distincts.&quot; Lewis shows how this is even demonstrated in the Trinity: &quot;The Father eternally begets the Son and the Holy Ghost proceeds: deity introduces distinction within itself so that the union of reciprocal loves may transcend mere arithmetical unity or self-identity.&quot;

Lewis furthers the illustration saying that the soul is a hollow that God continually fills in eternity followed by a constant emptying, self-dying, self-giving by the soul so as to become more truly itself. This self-sacrifice, Lewis says, is not something we can escape by remaining earthly or being saved. &quot;What is outside this self-giving is simply and solely Hell&quot;. This &quot;holy game&quot; is a party led by God himself where he gives Himself eternally and receives Himself back in sacrifice.

He finishes by saying that &quot;all pains and pleasures we have known on earth are early initiations in the movements of that dance… it does not exist for us, but we for it&quot;.

=== Appendix ===
Lewis takes this opportunity to color in some lines using some clinical experiences from a fellow Inkling – Dr. R. Havard. He talks about the effects of physical and mental pain, the latter of which Lewis says is the hardest to bear and less visible. He points out the phenomenon that many recognize and answer the challenge of pain and preserve their serenity and selflessness and sometimes produce brilliant work and sharpen their characters into tempered steel.
He concludes the book by saying &quot;Pain provides an opportunity for heroism; the opportunity is seized with surprising frequency.&quot;

==Relation to other works==

Lewis&#x27; philosophical approach in &quot;Problem of Pain&quot; bears some similarity to his later, more personal, approach to the problem of evil in &quot;A Grief Observed,&quot; a reflection on his own experiences of grief and anguish after the death of his wife.

<text>A teaspoon (tsp.) is a small spoon that can be used to stir a cup of tea or coffee, or as a tool for measuring volume. The size of teaspoons ranges from about 2.5 to 7.3 ml (about 0·088 to 0·257 imperial fluid ounce or 0·085 to 0·247 US fluid ounce). For dosing of medicine and, in places where metric units are used, for cooking purposes, a teaspoonful is defined as 5 ml (about 0·18 imperial fluid ounce or 0·17 US fluid ounce), and standard measuring spoons are used.

==Cutlery==

A teaspoon is a small spoon suitable for stirring and sipping the contents of a cup of tea or coffee, or adding a portion of loose sugar to it. These spoons have heads more or less oval in shape. Teaspoons are a common part of a place setting.

Teaspoons with longer handles, such as iced tea spoons, are commonly used also for ice cream desserts or floats. Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the dessert spoon, the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals. Much less common is the coffee spoon, which is a smaller version of the teaspoon, intended for use with the small type of coffee cup. Another teaspoon, called an &quot;orange spoon&quot; (in American English: grapefruit spoon), tapers to a sharp point or teeth, and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes. A bar spoon, equivalent to a teaspoon, is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks.

A container designed to hold extra teaspoons, called a &quot;spooner&quot;, usually in a set with a covered sugar container, formed a part of Victorian table service.

== History ==

The teaspoon is a European invention. Small spoons were common in Europe since at least the 13th century. These special spoons were introduced almost simultaneously with tea and coffee (Pettigrew points to use in the mid-17th century). Originally teaspoons were exotic items, precious and small, resembling the demitasse spoons of the later times. Also used for coffee, these spoons were usually made of gilt silver, and were available with a variety of handle shapes: plain, twisted, decorated with knobs, also known as &quot;knops&quot;, hence the &quot;knop-top&quot; name for such spoons. Widespread use and modern size date back to the Georgian era. 
The teaspoon is first mentioned in an advertisement in a 1686 edition of the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, teaspoons, probably of English origin, are present on the 1700 Dutch painting by Nicholas Verkolje, &quot;A Tea Party&quot;.

A special dish for resting the teaspoons, a &quot;spoon boat&quot;, was a part of the tea set in the 18th century. At that time, the spoons were playing important role in the tea drinking etiquette: a spoon laid &quot;across&quot; the teacup indicated that the guest did not need any more tea, otherwise, the hostess was obligated to offer a fresh cup of tea, and it was considered impolite to refuse the offering. Pettigrew reports that sometimes the spoons were numbered to make it easier to match the cups with the guests after a refill.

== Unit of measure ==

In some countries, a teaspoon (occasionally teaspoonful) is a cooking measure of volume, especially widely used in cooking recipes and pharmaceutic medical prescriptions. In English it is abbreviated as &quot;tsp.&quot; or, less often, as &quot;t.&quot;, &quot;ts.&quot;, or &quot;tspn.&quot;. The abbreviation is never capitalized because a capital letter is customarily reserved for the larger tablespoon (&quot;Tbsp.&quot;, &quot;T.&quot;, &quot;Tbls.&quot;, or &quot;Tb.&quot;).

A small scale study in Greece found that household teaspoons are a poor approximation of the standard tsp measure. The study investigated the accuracy of teaspoons as a measuring tool for liquid medicine. They surveyed 71 teaspoons from 25 houses and found that the volume varied between 2.5 and 7.3 ml (about 0·088 to 0·257 imperial fluid ounce or 0·085 to 0·247 US fluid ounce).

===Metric teaspoon===
The metric teaspoon as a unit of culinary measure is 5 ml, equal to , international metric tablespoon, or Australian metric tablespoon.

===United States customary unit===

As a unit of culinary measure, one teaspoon in the United States is tablespoon, exactly  millilitres (ml), 1 US customary fluid drams, US customary fl. oz, US cup, US liquid gallon, or  (0.30078125) cubic inches.

For nutritional labeling and medicine in the US, the teaspoon is defined the same as a metric teaspoonprecisely 5 millilitres (mL).

===British culinary measurement unit===
Traditionally, in the United Kingdom, 1 teaspoon is 1 British imperial fluid drachm ( British imperial fluid ounce). 1 UK teaspoon is the equivalence of UK tablespoon, UK dessert spoon, or 2 UK salt spoons.

===Dry ingredients===
For dry granular or powdered ingredients (e.g., salt, flour, spices, and especially beverages involving tea and sugar), a recipe may call for the spoon to be filled in a certain way that changes the volume of the ingredient. As with much of cooking, these measures are by their nature inexact. This can be exacerbated here by failing to use a real teaspoon: a teaspoon&#x27;s greater area supports considerably more to be heaped above it than a deeper hemispherical measuring spoon, so if using a measuring spoon, one will typically use less than called for by the recipe. The definitions of &quot;spoonful&quot; vary, in particular, in a typical American recipe a &quot;spoon&quot; without clarification stands for a &quot;level&quot; spoon (the one with no ingredient showing above the rim of the spoon bowl), while a British cookbook would mean a &quot;round&quot; or &quot;heaped&quot; spoon, with the ingredient peaking above the rim: 
* A &quot;scant&quot; teaspoon is one which has been filled to slightly less than level.
* A &quot;level&quot; teaspoon, which is the default &quot;teaspoon&quot; if no adjective is given, refers to an approximately leveled filling of the spoon, producing the same volume as for liquids. The excess of ingredient can be scraped off by a knife.
* A &quot;rounded&quot; teaspoon is roughly symmetrical with as much ingredient above the rim as is in the spoon below the rim, giving a measure roughly equivalent to two level teaspoons.
* A &quot;heaping&quot; (North American English) or &quot;heaped&quot; (UK English) teaspoon is a larger inexact measure consisting of the amount obtained by scooping the dry ingredient up as high as possible to balance on a spoon. This quantity can vary considerably, up to 5 amounts of ingredient in the level spoon. Many cookbooks treat heaped and rounded spoons interchangeably.
Lincoln used the spoon measure without adjectives to define either a rounded one (for flour and sugar) or a level one (for salt and spices).

=== Apothecary ===

As an unofficial but once widely used unit of apothecaries&#x27; measure, the teaspoon is equal to 1 fluid dram (or drachm) and thus of a tablespoon or of a fluid ounce. The apothecaries&#x27; teaspoon was formally known by the Latin &quot;cochleare minus&quot; (&quot;cochl. min.&quot;) to distinguish it from the tablespoon or &quot;cochleare majus&quot; (&quot;cochl. maj.&quot;).

When tea-drinking was first introduced to England circa 1660, tea was rare and expensive, as a consequence of which teacups and teaspoons were smaller than today. This situation persisted until 1784, when the Commutation Act reduced the tax on tea from 119% to 12.5%. As the price of tea declined, the size of teacups and teaspoons increased. By the 1850s, the teaspoon as a unit of culinary measure had increased to of a tablespoon, but the apothecary unit of measure remained the same. Nevertheless, the teaspoon, usually under its Latin name, continued to be used in apothecaries&#x27; measures for several more decades, with the original definition of one fluid dram.

<text>A tablespoon (tbsp., Tbsp., Tb., or T.) is a large spoon. In many English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving; however, in some regions, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating.

By extension, the term is also used as a cooking measure of volume. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated &quot;tbsp.&quot; or &quot;Tbsp.&quot; and occasionally referred to as a tablespoonful to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States liquid tablespoon is approximately 14.8mL (exactly US fluid ounce; about 0.52 imperial fluid ounce), a British tablespoon is approximately 14.2mL (exactly imperial fluid ounce; about 0.48 US fluid ounce), an international metric tablespoon is exactly 15mL (about 0.53 imperial fluid ounce or 0.51 US fluid ounce), and an Australian metric tablespoon is 20mL (about 0.7 imperial fluid ounce or 0.68 US fluid ounce). The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is defined by neither law nor custom but only by preferences, and may or may not significantly approximate the measurement.

== Dining ==
Before about 1700, it was customary for Europeans to bring their own spoons to the table. Spoons were carried as personal property in much the same way as people today carry wallets, key rings, etc. From about 1700 the place setting became popular, and with it the &quot;table-spoon&quot; (hyphenated), &quot;table-fork&quot; and &quot;table-knife&quot;. Around the same time the tea-spoon and dessert-spoon first appeared, and the table-spoon was reserved for eating soup. The 18th century witnessed a proliferation of different sorts of spoons, including the mustard-spoon, salt-spoon, coffee-spoon, and soup-spoon.

In the late 19th century UK, the dessert-spoon and soup-spoon began to displace the table-spoon as the primary implement for eating from a bowl, at which point the name &quot;table-spoon&quot; took on a secondary meaning as a much larger serving spoon. At the time the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary was published in 1928, &quot;tablespoon&quot; (which by then was no longer hyphenated) still had two definitions in the UK: the original definition (eating spoon) and the new definition (serving spoon).

Victorian and Edwardian era tablespoons used in the UK are often 25mL (about 0.88 imperial fluid ounce or 0.85 US fluid ounce) or sometimes larger. They are used only for preparing and serving food, not as part of a place-setting. Common tablespoons intended for use as cutlery (called dessert spoons in the UK, where a tablespoon is always a serving spoon) usually hold 7–14mL (about 0.25–0.49 imperial fluid ounce or 0.24–0.47 US fluid ounce), considerably less than some tablespoons used for serving.

== Culinary measure ==
===Naming===
In recipes, an abbreviation like &quot;tbsp.&quot; is usually used to refer to a tablespoon, to differentiate it from the smaller teaspoon (&quot;tsp.&quot;). Some authors additionally capitalize the abbreviation, as &quot;Tbsp.&quot;, while leaving &quot;tsp.&quot; in lower case, to emphasize that the larger tablespoon, rather than the smaller teaspoon, is wanted. The tablespoon abbreviation is sometimes further abbreviated to &quot;Tb.&quot; or &quot;T&quot;.

===Traditional definitions===
In most places, one tablespoon equals three teaspoons. In Australia and the UK, one tablespoon equals four teaspoons.

====International metric====
An international metric tablespoon is exactly equal to 15mL. It is the equivalence of 1 metric dessert spoons or 3 metric teaspoons.

====Australian metric====
The Australian metric tablespoon is different from that of the rest of the world. The Australian official definition of the tablespoon as a unit of volume is:

This definition was promulgated by the Metric Conversion Board in the 1970s, as part of the country’s metrication process. There is not a distinct Australian metric dessert spoon or metric teaspoon.

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, 1 tablespoon is traditionally 4 British imperial fluid drachms ( British imperial fluid ounce).

====United States====
The traditional U.S. interpretation of the tablespoon as a unit of volume is:

In nutrition labeling in the U.S., a tablespoon is defined as 15mL (about 4.22 British imperial fluid drachms (0.53 British imperial fluid ounce) or 4.06 US customary fluid drams (0.51 US customary fluid ounce)).

===Dry measure===
For dry ingredients, if a recipe calls for a &quot;level tablespoon&quot;, the usual meaning without further qualification, is measured by filling the spoon and scraping it level. In contrast, a &quot;heaped&quot;, &quot;heaping&quot;, or &quot;rounded&quot; spoonful is not leveled off, and includes a heap above the spoon. The exact volume of a heaped tablespoon depends somewhat on the shape and curvature of the measuring spoon being used and largely upon the physical properties of the substance being measured, and so is not a precise unit of measurement. If neither a rounded nor a level tablespoon is specified, a level tablespoon is used, just as a cup of flour is a level cup unless otherwise specified.

==Apothecary measure==
In the 18th century, the table-spoon became an unofficial unit of the apothecaries&#x27; system of measures, equal to 4 drams ( fl oz, 14.8 ml). It was more commonly known by the Latin name &quot;cochleare majus&quot; (abbreviated &quot;cochl. maj.&quot;) or, in apothecaries&#x27; notation, &quot;f℥ss&quot; or &quot;f℥ß&quot; (fluid ℥, i.e. ounce, semis, one-half).

<text>The Seekers were an Australian folk-influenced pop group originally formed in Melbourne in 1962. They were the first Australian pop music group to achieve major chart and sales success in the United Kingdom and the United States. They were especially popular during the 1960s, with their best-known configuration of Judith Durham on vocals, piano and tambourine; Athol Guy on double bass and vocals; Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar, banjo and vocals; and Bruce Woodley on guitar, mandolin, banjo and vocals.

The group had Top 10 hits in the 1960s with &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot;, &quot;A World of Our Own&quot;, &quot;Morningtown Ride&quot;, &quot;Someday, One Day&quot;, &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; and &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as &quot;concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock&quot;. In 1967, they were named as joint &quot;Australians of the Year&quot; – the only group thus honoured. In July 1968, Durham left to pursue a solo career and the group disbanded. Keith Potger formed a new group in the UK, the New Seekers, which had a hit single in 1971 with &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;.

In 1995, the Seekers were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2011. Woodley&#x27;s and Dobe Newton&#x27;s song &quot;I Am Australian&quot;, which was recorded by the Seekers as well as Durham with Russell Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu, has become an unofficial Australian anthem. With &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; and &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, the group also achieved success in the United States, but not nearly at the same level as in the rest of the world. The Seekers have sold over 50 million records worldwide and were individually honoured as Officers of the Order of Australia in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of June 2014.

==Early years==
The Seekers were formed in 1962 in Melbourne by Athol Guy on double bass, Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar and Bruce Woodley on guitar. Guy, Potger and Woodley had all attended Melbourne Boys High School in Victoria. In the late 1950s, Potger led the Trinamics, a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll group, Guy led the Ramblers and, with Woodley, they decided to form a doo-wop music group, the Escorts. The Escorts had Ken Ray as the lead singer and in 1962 they became &quot;The Seekers&quot;. Ray left the group to get married. His place was taken by Judith Durham, an established traditional jazz singer who added a distinctive female lead voice. She had earlier recorded an extended play disc on W&amp;G Records with the Melbourne group Frank Traynor&#x27;s Jazz Preachers.

Durham and Guy had met when they both worked in an advertising agency – initially Durham only sang periodically with the Seekers, when not performing at local jazz clubs. She was replaced in Traynor&#x27;s jazz ensemble by Margret RoadKnight. The Seekers performed folk-influenced pop music and soon gathered a strong following in Melbourne. Durham&#x27;s connections with W&amp;G Records led to the group&#x27;s later signing a recording contract with the label. Their debut album, &quot;Introducing the Seekers&quot;, was released in 1963. Their debut single, released in mid-1963, was the African American spiritual song &quot;Kumbaya&quot;. Their second single was the traditional historic Australian bush ballad from 1894, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, which appeared in November and which reached the Melbourne &quot;Top 40&quot; singles chart. and peaked at number 74 on the national chart. When being photographed for the album&#x27;s cover, Potger was replaced by Ray – his day job with the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) as a radio producer barred him from involvement in a commercial enterprise.

==Discovery in the United Kingdom==
The Seekers were offered a twelve-month position as on-board entertainment on the Sitmar Line passenger cruise ship &quot;Fairsky&quot; in March 1964. In May, they travelled to the UK and had intended to return to Australia after staying ten weeks, but upon arrival they were offered work by a London booking agency, the Grade Organisation. They signed there with World Record Club and issued a single, &quot;Myra&quot;, co-written by the group. The group regularly appeared on a British TV show series, &quot;Call in on Carroll&quot;, hosted by Ronnie Carroll.

After filling in on a bill headlined by singer Dusty Springfield, they met her brother, songwriter and producer Tom Springfield, who had experience with writing folk-pop material and lyrics/tunes with the siblings&#x27; earlier group The Springfields. He penned &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot;, which they recorded in November 1964. It was released by EMI Records, on their Columbia Graphophone Company (Columbia)
label, in December and was championed by the offshore radio station &quot;Radio Caroline&quot; which frequently played and promoted their music. Despite the fact that the group had not signed a contract with EMI, the single reached the UK &quot;Top 50&quot; and began selling well. In February 1965, it reached No.1 in the UK and Australia, and No.4 in the United States where it was released on EMI&#x27;s Capitol Records label. &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; was the seventh biggest-selling single in Britain for 1965 though their own &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;, released later in the year, would eventually eclipse it – and went on to sell 1.75 million copies worldwide.

The Seekers were the first Australian pop group to have a Top 5 hit in Australia, the UK and the US. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as &quot;concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop oriented to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock&quot;. The distinctive soprano voice of Durham, the group&#x27;s vocal harmonies and memorable songs encouraged the British media, including the national broadcasting agency on radio and television, the BBC, to give them exposure, allowing them to appeal to a broad cross-section of the young British folk, pop and rock music audience.

==String of hits==
The Seekers achieved their first success in the United States in 1965 with their hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; reaching peaks of No. 4 for pop and No. 2 for easy listening on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine charts. They followed &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; with &quot;What Have They Done to the Rain?&quot; in February 1965 which did not chart in the Top 40.

The group were named &quot;Best New Group of 1964&quot; at the April 1965 &quot;New Musical Express&quot; Poll Winners Awards. They appeared at the annual celebratory Wembley Empire Pool concert, on a bill which included the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Dusty Springfield and the Animals. In May, another Tom Springfield composition was issued, &quot;A World of Our Own&quot;, which reached Top 3 in Australia and the UK and Top 20 in the US. Malvina Reynolds&#x27; lullaby &quot;Morningtown Ride&quot; was issued in Australia in July and peaked in the Top 10. That same month, Durham had to temporarily leave the group due to emergency nasal surgery; she was replaced on live dates from July to early September by Scottish-born singer Ellen Wade.

Durham quickly returned to the group and their next single, &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;, appeared in November 1965. The melody is based on a Russian folk song, while the lyrics were written by Tom Springfield; it reached No. 1 on both the Australian and the UK charts and, at its peak, the single was selling around 93,000 copies a day in the UK alone. However, although &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; became a signature song for the group, it was not a great success in North America, peaking at No. 105 in the US and missing the Canadian charts completely.

On 16 November 1965, they appeared at a Royal Command Performance at the London Palladium before Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Also in 1965, the group met Paul Simon, of the American duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, who was pursuing a solo career in the UK following the initial poor chart success of the duo&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;. In 1966, the Seekers released the Simon-penned &quot;Someday One Day&quot;, which reached No. 4 in Australia and No. 11 in the UK. Their version was Simon&#x27;s first UK success as a songwriter and his first major hit as a composer separately from his work with Art Garfunkel. Woodley co-wrote some songs with Simon, including &quot;Cloudy&quot;, &quot;I Wish You Could Be Here&quot; and &quot;Red Rubber Ball&quot; which became an American No. 2 single for the Cyrkle. The Seekers&#x27; version was provided on their 1966 album &quot;Come the Day&quot; (released on the album &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; in the US).

Early in 1966, after returning to Australia, the Seekers filmed their first TV special, &quot;At Home with the Seekers&quot;. In November, a re-recorded version of &quot;Morningtown Ride&quot; was released in the UK which reached No. 2. The song had been recorded earlier as an Australian single on the 1964 album &quot;Hide and Seekers&quot; and appeared on the 1965 American debut, &quot;The New Seekers&quot;.

In December 1966 they issued &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, which became their highest charting American hit when it reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 in February 1967. It was the title song and theme for the British film of the same name starring Lynn Redgrave and James Mason and sold 3.5 million copies worldwide. They were awarded a gold record certificate by the Recording Industry Association of America. Meanwhile, it was No. 3 in the UK and No. 1 in Australia. Its writers, Jim Dale and Tom Springfield, were nominated for the 1967 Academy Award for Best Original Song of 1966, but the Oscar was won by the title song of the film &quot;Born Free&quot;.

In February 1967, &quot;Morningtown Ride&quot; reached the Top 50 in the US.

==Return to Australia and breakup==
In March 1967, the Seekers returned to Australia for a homecoming tour, which included a performance for Music for the People at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, attended by an estimated audience of 200,000. The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; (1968) listed it as the greatest attendance at a concert in the Southern Hemisphere. Melburnians were celebrating the annual Moomba festival, a free community festival, and many thousands were enjoying other attractions but are included in the crowd estimate. The Seekers were accompanied during their 20-minute set by the Australian Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hector Crawford. Film of their appearance was incorporated into their 1967 Australian television special, &quot;The Seekers Down Under&quot;, which was screened on Channel 7 and drew a then record audience of over 6 million. It was also screened in the UK on BBC1 on 24 June 1968, and repeated on 27 December 1968.

In January 1968, on Australia Day, in recognition of its achievements, the group was named joint Australians of the Year – the only group of people to have this honour bestowed upon them. They personally accepted their awards from John Gorton, the Prime Minister of Australia, during their tour. During this visit, the group filmed another TV special, &quot;The World of the Seekers&quot;, which was screened in cinemas before being screened nationally on Channel 9 to high ratings and is in the Top 10 most watched TV shows of the 20th century in Australia.

On 14 February 1968, during the New Zealand tour, Durham approached the other group members to announce that she was leaving the Seekers to pursue a solo career and the group subsequently disbanded. Their final performance was on 7 July 1968, and was shown on BBC One as a television special called &quot;Farewell the Seekers&quot;, with an audience of more than 10 million viewers. The special had been preceded by a month-long season at London&#x27;s Talk of the Town nightclub and a live recording of one of their shows was released as a live album, &quot;Live at the Talk of the Town&quot;. It reached No. 2 on the UK charts. Also in July, the compilation album &quot;The Seekers&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot; was released and spent 17 weeks at No. 1 in Australia. It was released as &quot;The Best of The Seekers&quot; in the UK and spent six weeks at No. 1 in 1969, managing to knock &quot;The Beatles (White Album)&quot; off the top of the charts and preventing the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; from reaching the top spot. The album spent 125 weeks in the charts in the UK.

==Reunions in the 1970s and 1980s==

Following the Seekers&#x27; split, Durham pursued a solo career. She released a Christmas album called &quot;For Christmas with Love&quot; (recorded in Hollywood, California) and later signed with A&amp;M Records, releasing more albums including &quot;Gift of Song&quot; and &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;. Guy hosted his own TV show in Australia, &quot;A Guy Called Athol&quot;, before entering (Liberal Party) politics in 1973. In 1969, Keith Potger formed and managed a new group, the New Seekers, in the UK who also charted highly with their successful song &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)&quot;. Woodley released several solo albums and focused on songwriting, including co-writing the patriotic song &quot;I Am Australian&quot; with Dobe Newton (of the Bushwackers) in 1987.

From 1972, Guy, Potger and Woodley planned on reforming the Seekers without Durham. By 1975 they had recruited Louisa Wisseling, a semi-professional folk singer formerly with Melbourne group the Settlers. They had a top 10 Australian hit with the Woodley-penned &quot;The Sparrow Song&quot;. Woodley left the group in June 1977 and was replaced by Buddy England, a former 1960s pop singer and member of the Mixtures. In 1978, Guy was replaced by Peter Robinson (ex-the Strangers) and Cheryl Webb replaced Wisseling as lead vocalist, leaving only Keith Potger from the original Seekers line-up. In 1980 the group released an album, &quot;A little bit of Country&quot;, and toured periodically until the mid &#x27;80s. In 1988, Guy, Potger and Woodley reformed the Seekers with Julie Anthony, a cabaret singer. In May, the group sang &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; at the World Expo 88 in Brisbane. In March 1989, the group released the album &quot;Live On&quot;, which peaked in the top 30 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. In June 1990, Anthony left and was replaced by Karen Knowles, a former teen pop singer on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;. However the distinctive timbre of Durham&#x27;s voice was missing from their sound and the group split again.

==1990s, 2000s and 2010s==

The Seekers reunited late in 1992, with the classic line-up of Durham, Guy, Potger and Woodley. In March 1992, all four met together for the first time in 20 years at a restaurant in Toorak, an inner suburb of Melbourne. Before then they had never talked about reforming; they just wanted to get to know each other again. It was two months later that they decided to do a reunion concert, which led to a 102-date tour. The 25-Year Silver Jubilee Reunion Celebration tour in 1993 was sufficiently successful that the group continued to perform and record together, on and off, until shortly before Judith Durham&#x27;s death in August 2022. From 1993 until 2022 they staged several sell-out tours of Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The group issued several new albums, including the studio albums &quot;Future Road&quot; in October 1997 (which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart) and &quot;Morningtown Ride to Christmas&quot; (which reached the top 20 in 2001) Both albums were certified platinum.

In 1995, the group were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. In the build up to the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics, an ABC TV satire, &quot;The Games&quot;, parodied the Seekers in the final episode, &quot;The End&quot;. Durham had suffered a broken hip and sang &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; in a wheelchair at the closing ceremony of the related Paralympic Games on 29 October. &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot; was a 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation six-part documentary on the history of Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. The Seekers featured on the second episode, &quot;Ten Pound Rocker 1963–1968&quot;, broadcast on 22 August, in which Durham and Woodley discussed their early work on a cruise ship, meeting Tom Springfield and their success in Britain. Four of their songs were played during the episode: &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot;, &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;, &quot;A World of Our Own&quot; and &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;.

In October 2002, on the 40th anniversary of their formation, they were the subjects of a special issue of Australian postage stamps. On 1 September 2006, they were presented with the Key to the City by Melbourne&#x27;s Lord Mayor, John So. In February 2009, the SBS TV program &quot;RocKwiz&quot; hosted a 50th anniversary concert at the Myer Music Bowl, &quot;RocKwiz Salutes the Bowl&quot;, which included &quot;World of Our Own&quot; performed by Rebecca Barnard and Billy Miller and &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; by Durham.

In 2004 a DVD, &quot;The Seekers at Home and Down Under&quot;, was released. It consists of a 1966 television documentary on the Seekers and a 1967 special. The cover includes a photo from the 1966 documentary.

In October 2010, &quot;The Best of the Seekers&quot; (1968) was listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. Also in October, they were scheduled to tour various Australian cities in support of violinist André Rieu and his orchestra. However, the tour was postponed when Rieu was taken ill. They released another &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation in May 2011 which peaked in the top 40. That month they supported Rieu on the rescheduled Australian tour. &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of the Sounds of Australia registry in 2011. &quot;The Seekers&#x27; Golden Jubilee Tour&quot; kicked off 2013 in May, celebrating fifty years since the group had formed in December 1962. Performing in Sydney, Brisbane, Newcastle and Melbourne, they received rave reviews to sold-out audiences. However, Judith Durham suffered a brain haemorrhage after their first concert in Melbourne. The rest of the Australian tour and later-to-be-staged UK tour were postponed; the former continued in November, while the UK tour took place in May and June 2014, ending with two performances at the Royal Albert Hall, London.

In November 2015, during a tour of Guy&#x27;s new group, Athol Guy and Friends, featuring Jenny Blake on vocals, the group were joined by Potger and Woodley for a one-performance fundraiser hosted by the school. The performance featured many of the Seekers&#x27; hits as well as other songs that had influenced them over the years. The performance closed with a performance of &quot;I Am Australian&quot;, which Guy introduced as a song that was pertinent given &quot;what was happening around the world&quot; at the time.

In 2015, they were inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

In April 2019, the Seekers released &quot;Farewell&quot;, a live recording from their 2013 50th anniversary tour. Following Durham&#x27;s retirement from live performance, the group continued as &quot;The Original Seekers&quot; with the addition of long-time producer and guitarist and singer Michael Cristiano as the group&#x27;s &quot;fourth voice&quot;. In June 2019, they released a new studio album titled &quot;Back to Our Roots&quot; also produced by Michael Cristiano. The album features Guy, Potger and Woodley joining with Cristiano on songs they had sung prior to Durham&#x27;s tenure with the group. The album was released with &quot;The Original Seekers&quot; as the group&#x27;s name.

==2020s==
On 28 April 2020, Universal Music Australia announced that a trilogy of Seekers&#x27; compilation albums would be released over the following twelve months under the title &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot;, featuring rarities and lost classics. &quot;Hidden Treasures – Volume 1&quot; was released on 22 May 2020 and peaked at number 21 on the ARIA Charts. &quot;Volume 2&quot; was released October the same year.

In a 2021 interview, Keith Potger said the group members were considering ways to commemorate their 60th anniversary, in 2022.

==Death of Judith Durham==
On 5 August 2022, Judith Durham died from bronchiectasis, a chronic lung disease, at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, aged 79. She was cremated.

The Seekers&#x27; final recording together, &quot;Carry Me&quot;, was unveiled by Athol Guy at Durham&#x27;s state memorial service. Written by Bruce Woodley, the song was completed by Woodley, Potger and Guy adding their vocals and instrumentation to Durham&#x27;s vocals.

<doc id="31086" wikidata="Q5811" url="?curid=31086" title="Masaccio">
<text>Masaccio (, ; ; December 21, 1401 – summer 1428), born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was a Florentine artist who is regarded as the first great Italian painter of the Quattrocento period of the Italian Renaissance. According to Vasari, Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at imitating nature, recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality. He employed nudes and foreshortenings in his figures. This had seldom been done before him.

The name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning &quot;clumsy&quot; or &quot;messy&quot; Tom. The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as Masolino (&quot;little/delicate Tom&quot;).

Despite his brief career, he had a profound influence on other artists and is considered to have started the Early Italian Renaissance in painting with his works in the mid- and late-1420s. He was one of the first to use linear perspective in his painting, employing techniques such as vanishing point in art for the first time. He moved away from the International Gothic style and elaborate ornamentation of artists like Gentile da Fabriano to a more naturalistic mode that employed perspective and chiaroscuro for greater realism.

Masaccio died at the age of twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death. Upon hearing of Masaccio&#x27;s death, Filippo Brunelleschi said: &quot;We have suffered a great loss.&quot;

==Early life==
Masaccio was born to Giovanni di Simone Cassai and Jacopa di Martinozzo in Castel San Giovanni di Altura, now San Giovanni Valdarno (today part of the province of Arezzo, Tuscany). His father was a notary and his mother the daughter of an innkeeper of Barberino di Mugello, a town a few miles north of Florence. His family name, Cassai, comes from the trade of his paternal grandfather Simone and granduncle Lorenzo, who were carpenters/cabinet makers (&quot;casse&quot;, hence &quot;cassai&quot;). Masaccio&#x27;s father died in 1406, when he was only five; later that same year a brother was born, named Giovanni (1406–1486) after his father. He also was to become a painter, with the nickname of Lo Scheggia meaning &quot;the splinter&quot;. In 1412 Monna Jacopa married an elderly apothecary, Tedesco di maestro Feo, who already had several daughters, one of whom grew up to marry the only other documented painter from Castel San Giovanni, Mariotto di Cristofano (1393–1457).

There is no evidence for Masaccio&#x27;s artistic education; however, Renaissance painters traditionally began an apprenticeship with an established master around the age of 12. Masaccio would likely have had to move to Florence to receive his training, but he was not documented in the city until he joined the painters guild (the Arte de&#x27; Medici e Speziali) as an independent master on January 7, 1422, signing as &quot;Masus S. Johannis Simonis pictor populi S. Nicholae de Florentia.&quot;

==First works==
The first works attributed to Masaccio are the San Giovenale Triptych (1422), now in the Masaccio Museum of Sacred Art in Cascia di Reggello near Florence, and the &quot;Virgin and Child with Saint Anne&quot; (Sant&#x27;Anna Metterza) (c. 1424) at the Uffizi. The San Giovenale altarpiece was discovered in 1961 in the church of San Giovenale at Cascia di Reggello, very close to Masaccio&#x27;s hometown. It depicts the Virgin and Child with angels in the central panel, Sts. Bartholomew and Blaise on the left panel, and Sts. Juvenal (i.e. San Giovenale) and Anthony Abbot in the right panel. The painting has lost much of its original framing, and its surface is badly abraded. Nevertheless, Masaccio&#x27;s concern to suggest three-dimensionality through volumetric figures and foreshortened forms is apparent, and stands as a revival of Giotto&#x27;s approach, rather than a continuation of contemporary trends. 
 The second work was perhaps Masaccio&#x27;s first collaboration with the older and already-renowned artist, Masolino da Panicale (1383/4–c. 1436). The circumstances of the two artists&#x27; collaboration are unclear; since Masolino was considerably older, it seems likely that he brought Masaccio under his wing, but the division of hands in the &quot;Virgin and Child with Saint Anne&quot; is so marked that it is hard to see the older artist as the controlling figure in this commission. Masolino is believed to have painted the figure of St. Anne and the angels that hold the cloth of honor behind her, while Masaccio painted the more important Virgin and Child on their throne. Masolino&#x27;s figures are delicate, graceful and somewhat flat, while Masaccio&#x27;s are solid and hefty.

==Maturity==
In Florence, Masaccio could study the works of Giotto and become friends with Brunelleschi and Donatello. According to Vasari, at their prompting in 1423 Masaccio travelled to Rome with Masolino: from that point he was freed of all Gothic and Byzantine influence, as seen in his altarpiece for the Carmelite Church in Pisa. The traces of influences from ancient Roman and Greek art that are present in some of Masaccio&#x27;s works presumably originated from this trip: they should also have been present in a lost &quot;Sagra&quot;, (today known through some drawings, including one by Michelangelo), a fresco commissioned for the consecration ceremony of the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence (April 19, 1422). It was destroyed when the church&#x27;s cloister was rebuilt at the end of the 16th century.

==Brancacci Chapel==

In 1424, the &quot;duo preciso e noto&quot; (&quot;well and known duo&quot;) of Masaccio and Masolino was commissioned by the powerful and wealthy Felice Brancacci to execute a cycle of frescoes for the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. With the two artists probably working simultaneously, the painting began around 1425, but for unknown reasons the chapel was left unfinished, and was completed by Filippino Lippi in the 1480s. The iconography of the fresco decoration is somewhat unusual; while the majority of the frescoes represent the life of St. Peter, two scenes, on either side of the threshold of the chapel space, depict the temptation and expulsion of Adam and Eve. As a whole, the frescoes recount the life of St Peter as if it were the story of salvation. The style of Masaccio&#x27;s scenes shows the influence of Giotto especially. Figures are large, heavy, and solid; emotions are expressed through faces and gestures; and there is a strong impression of naturalism throughout the paintings. Unlike Giotto, however, Masaccio uses linear and atmospheric perspective, directional light, and &quot;chiaroscuro&quot;, which is the representation of form through light and color without outlines. As a result, his frescoes are even more convincingly lifelike than those of his trecento predecessor.

===Works of the chapel===
&quot;The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden&quot;, depicts a distressed Adam and Eve, chased from the garden by a threatening angel. Adam covers his entire face to express his shame, while Eve covers her breasts and groin. The fresco had a huge influence on Michelangelo and his work. Another major work is &quot;The Tribute Money&quot; in which Jesus and the Apostles are depicted as neo-classical archetypes. Scholars have often noted that the shadows of the figures all fall away from the chapel window, as if the figures are lit by it; this is an added stroke of verisimilitude and further tribute to Masaccio&#x27;s innovative genius. In the &quot;Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus&quot;, he painted a pavement in perspective, framed by large buildings to obtain a three-dimensional space in which the figures are placed proportionate to their surroundings. In this he was a pioneer in applying the newly discovered rules of perspective.

In September 1425 Masolino left the work and went to Hungary. It is not known if this was because of money quarrels with Felice or an artistic divergence with Masaccio. It has also been supposed that Masolino planned this trip from the very beginning, and needed a close collaborator who could continue the work after his departure. But Masaccio left the frescoes unfinished in 1426 in order to respond to other commissions, probably coming from the same patron. However, it has also been suggested that the declining finances of Felice Brancacci were insufficient to pay for any further work, so the painter sought work elsewhere.
Masaccio returned in 1427 to work again in the Carmine, beginning the &quot;Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus&quot;, but apparently left it, too, unfinished, although it has been suggested that the painting was severely damaged later in the century because it had contained portraits of the Brancacci family, at that time excoriated as enemies of the Medici. This painting was either restored or completed more than fifty years later by Filippino Lippi.

Some of the scenes completed by Masaccio and Masolino were lost in a fire in 1771; we know about them only through Vasari&#x27;s biography. The surviving parts were extensively blackened by smoke. In the twentieth century, the removal of marble slabs covering two areas of the paintings revealed the original appearance of the work.

==&quot;Pisa Altarpiece&quot;==
On February 19, 1426, Masaccio was commissioned by Giuliano di Colino degli Scarsi da San Giusto, for the sum of 80 florins, to paint a major altarpiece, the &quot;Pisa Altarpiece&quot;, for his chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Pisa. The work was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century, and only eleven of about twenty original panels have been rediscovered in various collections around the world. The central panel of the altarpiece (&quot;The Madonna and Child&quot;) is now in the National Gallery, London. Although it is very damaged, the work features a sculptural and human Madonna as well as a convincing perspectival depiction of her throne. Masaccio probably worked on it entirely in Pisa, shuttling back and forth to Florence, where he was still working on the Brancacci Chapel. In these years, Donatello was also working in Pisa at a monument for Cardinal Rinaldo Brancacci, to be sent to Naples. It is suggested that Masaccio&#x27;s first ventures in plasticity and perspective were based on Donatello&#x27;s sculpture, before he could study Brunelleschi&#x27;s more scientific approach to perspective.

==&quot;Holy Trinity&quot;==
Around 1427 Masaccio won a prestigious commission to produce a &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence. No contemporary documents record the patron of the fresco, but recently references to ownership of a tomb at the foot of the fresco have been found in the records of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella Quarter of Florence; this working-class family expressed a long-standing devotion to the Trinity, and may well have commissioned Masaccio&#x27;s painting. Probably it is the male patron who is represented to the left of the Virgin in the painting, while his wife is right of St. John the Evangelist. The fresco, considered by many to be Masaccio&#x27;s masterwork, is the earliest surviving painting to use systematic linear perspective, possibly devised by Masaccio with the assistance of Brunelleschi.

According to the reconstruction Masaccio started by producing a rough drawing of the composition and perspective lines on the wall. The drawing was covered with fresh plaster for making the fresco. To ensure the precise transfer of the perspective lines from the sketch to the plaster, Masaccio inserted a nail in at the vanishing point under the base of the cross and attached strings to it, which he pressed in (or carved into) the plaster. The marks of the preparatory works are still visible.

The sacred figures and the donors are represented above an image of a skeleton lying on a sarcophagus. An inscription seemingly carved into the wall above the skeleton reads: &quot;Io fui gia quel che voi siete e quel ch&#x27;io sono voi anco sarete&quot; (I once was what now you are and what I am, you shall yet be). This skeleton is both a reference to Adam, whose sin brought humans to death, and a reminder to viewers that their time on earth is transitory. It is only through faith in the Trinity, the fresco suggests, that one overcomes this death. The Holy Spirit is seen in the form of a dove, above Jesus. The combination of trinity, death and decay &quot;can be interpreted as a transposition of the Golgotha chapel&quot; in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

==Other paintings==
Masaccio produced two other works, a &quot;Nativity&quot; and an &quot;Annunciation&quot;, now lost, before leaving for Rome, where his companion Masolino was frescoing a chapel with scenes from the life of St. Catherine in the Basilica di San Clemente. It has never been confirmed that Masaccio collaborated on that work, even though it is possible that he contributed to Masolino&#x27;s polyptych for the altar of Santa Maria Maggiore with his panel portraying &quot;St. Jerome and St. John the Baptist&quot;, now in the National Gallery, London. Masaccio died at the end of 1428. According to a legend, he was poisoned by a jealous rival painter.

Only four frescoes undoubtedly from Masaccio&#x27;s hand still exist today, although many other works have been at least partially attributed to him. Others are believed to have been destroyed.

==Legacy==
Masaccio profoundly influenced the art of painting and is considered to have begun the Early Italian Renaissance in painting. According to Vasari, all &quot;most celebrated&quot; Florentine &quot;sculptors and painters&quot; studied his frescoes extensively in order to &quot;learn the precepts and rules for painting well.&quot; He transformed the direction of Italian painting, moving it away from the idealizations of Gothic art, and, for the first time, presenting it as part of a more profound, natural, and humanist world. Moreover, Masaccio influenced a great many artists both while he was alive and posthumously. His influence is particularly notable in the works of Florentine minor masters, such as Andrea di Giusto, Giovanni dal Ponte, and others who attempted to replicate his glowing, lifelike forms, whilst in 1817 Auguste Couder produced &quot;The Death of Masaccio&quot;.

<doc id="31088" wikidata="Q211731" url="?curid=31088" title="Timothy Leary">
<text>Timothy Francis Leary (October 22, 1920 – May 31, 1996) was an American psychologist and author known for his strong advocacy of psychedelic drugs. Evaluations of Leary are polarized, ranging from &quot;bold oracle&quot; to &quot;publicity hound&quot;. According to poet Allen Ginsberg, he was &quot;a hero of American consciousness&quot;, while writer Tom Robbins called him a &quot;brave neuronaut&quot;. President Richard Nixon disagreed, calling Leary &quot;the most dangerous man in America&quot;. During the 1960s and 1970s, at the height of the counterculture movement, Leary was arrested 36 times.

As a clinical psychologist at Harvard University, Leary founded the Harvard Psilocybin Project after a revealing experience with magic mushrooms he had in Mexico in 1960. For two years, he tested psilocybin&#x27;s therapeutic effects, in the Concord Prison Experiment and the Marsh Chapel Experiment. He also experimented with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which was also legal in the U.S. at the time. Other Harvard faculty questioned his research&#x27;s scientific legitimacy and ethics because he took psychedelics himself along with his subjects and allegedly pressured students to join in. Harvard fired Leary and his colleague Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) in May 1963. Many people learned of psychedelics after the Harvard scandal. Leary continued to publicly promote psychedelic drugs and became a well-known figure of the counterculture of the 1960s; he popularized catchphrases that promoted his philosophy, such as &quot;turn on, tune in, drop out&quot;, &quot;set and setting&quot;, and &quot;think for yourself and question authority&quot;.

Leary believed that LSD showed potential for therapeutic use in psychiatry. He developed an eight-circuit model of consciousness in his 1977 book &quot;Exo-Psychology&quot; and gave lectures, occasionally calling himself a &quot;performing philosopher&quot;. He also developed a philosophy of mind expansion and personal truth through LSD. He also wrote and spoke frequently about transhumanism, human space migration, intelligence increase, and life extension (SMI²LE).

== Early life and education ==
Leary was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, an only child in an Irish Catholic household. His father, Timothy &quot;Tote&quot; Leary, was a dentist who left his wife Abigail Ferris when Timothy was 14. He graduated from Classical High School in Springfield.

Leary attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1938 to 1940. He received a Jesuit education there, and was required to learn Latin, rhetoric, and Greek. Under pressure from his father, he left to become a cadet in the United States Military Academy. In his first months at West Point, he received numerous demerits for rule infractions and then got into serious trouble for failing to report rule breaking by cadets he supervised. He was also accused of going on a drinking binge and failing to admit it, and was asked by the Honor Committee to resign. He refused and was shunned by fellow cadets. He was acquitted by a court-martial, but the silencing continued, as well as the onslaught of demerits for small rule infractions. In his sophomore year, his mother appealed to a family friend, United States Senator David I. Walsh, head of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, who investigated personally. The Honor Committee quietly revised its position and announced that it would abide by the court-martial verdict. Leary then resigned and was honorably discharged by the Army. About 50 years later he said that it was &quot;the only fair trial I&#x27;ve had in a court of law&quot;.

To his family&#x27;s chagrin, Leary transferred to the University of Alabama in late 1941 because it admitted him expeditiously. He enrolled in the university&#x27;s ROTC program, maintained top grades, and began to cultivate academic interests in psychology (under the aegis of the Middlebury and Harvard-educated Donald Ramsdell) and biology. Leary was expelled a year later for spending a night in the female dormitory and lost his student deferment in the midst of World War II.

Leary was drafted into the United States Army and received basic training at Fort Eustis in 1943. He remained in the non-commissioned officer track while enrolled in the psychology subsection of the Army Specialized Training Program, including three months of study at Georgetown University and six months at Ohio State University. With limited need for officers late in the war, Leary was briefly assigned as a private first class to the Pacific War-bound 2d Combat Cargo Group (which he later characterized as &quot;a suicide command ... whose main mission, as far as I could see, was to eliminate the entire civilian branch of American aviation from post-war rivalry&quot;) at Syracuse Army Air Base in Mattydale, New York. After a fateful reunion with Ramsdell (who was assigned to Deshon General Hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania, as chief psychologist) in Buffalo, New York, he was promoted to corporal and reassigned to his mentor&#x27;s command as a staff psychometrician. He remained in Deshon&#x27;s deaf rehabilitation clinic for the remainder of the war.

While stationed in Butler, Leary courted Marianne Busch; they married in April 1945. Leary was discharged at the rank of sergeant in January 1946, having earned such standard decorations as the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.

As the war concluded, Leary was reinstated at UA and received credit for his Ohio State psychology coursework. He completed his degree via correspondence courses and graduated in August 1945. After receiving his undergraduate degree, Leary pursued an academic career. In 1946, he received a M.S. in psychology at the Washington State College in Pullman, where he studied under educational psychologist Lee Cronbach. His M.S. thesis was on clinical applications of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.

In 1947, Marianne gave birth to their first child, Susan. Their son, Jack, arrived two years later. In 1950, Leary received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. In the postwar era, Leary was galvanized by the objectivity of modern physics; his doctoral dissertation (&quot;The Social Dimensions of Personality: Group Process and Structure&quot;) approached group therapy as a &quot;psychlotron&quot; from which behavioral characteristics could be derived and quantified in a manner analogous to the periodic table, foreshadowing his later development of the interpersonal circumplex.

== Professorship ==
Leary stayed on in the Bay Area as an assistant clinical professor of medical psychology at the University of California, San Francisco; concurrently, he co-founded Kaiser Hospital&#x27;s psychology department in Oakland, California, and maintained a private consultancy. In 1952, the Leary family spent a year in Spain, living on a research grant. According to Berkeley colleague Marv Freedman, &quot;Something had been stirred in him in terms of breaking out of being another cog in society.&quot;

Leary&#x27;s marriage was strained by infidelity and mutual alcohol abuse. Marianne eventually died by suicide in 1955, leaving him to raise their son and daughter alone. He described himself during this period as &quot;an anonymous institutional employee who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars and drove home each night and drank martinis ... like several million middle-class, liberal, intellectual robots&quot;.

From 1954 or 1955 to 1958, Leary directed psychiatric research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 1957, he published &quot;The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality&quot;, which the &quot;Annual Review of Psychology&quot; called the &quot;most important book on psychotherapy of the year&quot;.

In 1958, the National Institute of Mental Health terminated Leary&#x27;s research grant after he failed to meet with a NIMH investigator. Leary and his children relocated to Europe, where he attempted to write his next book while subsisting on small grants and insurance policies. His stay in Florence was unproductive and indigent, prompting a return to academia.

In late 1959, Leary started as a lecturer in clinical psychology at Harvard University at the behest of Frank Barron (a colleague from Berkeley) and David McClelland. Leary and his children lived in Newton, Massachusetts. In addition to teaching, Leary was affiliated with the Harvard Center for Research in Personality under McClelland. He oversaw the Harvard Psilocybin Project and conducted experiments in conjunction with assistant professor Richard Alpert. In 1963, Leary was terminated for failing to attend scheduled class lectures, though he maintained that he had met his teaching obligations. The decision to dismiss him may have been influenced by his promotion of psychedelic drug use among Harvard students and faculty. The drugs were legal at the time.

Leary&#x27;s work in academic psychology expanded on the research of Harry Stack Sullivan and Karen Horney, which sought to better understand interpersonal processes to help diagnose disorders. Leary&#x27;s dissertation developed the interpersonal circumplex model, later published in &quot;The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality&quot;. The book demonstrated how psychologists could use Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores to predict how respondents might react to various interpersonal situations. Leary&#x27;s research was an important harbinger of transactional analysis, directly prefiguring the popular work of Eric Berne.

== Psychedelic experiments and experiences ==
===Mexico and Harvard research (1957–1963)===

==== Introduction to psychedelic mushrooms ====

On May 13, 1957, &quot;Life&quot; magazine published &quot;Seeking the Magic Mushroom&quot;, an article by R. Gordon Wasson about the use of psilocybin mushrooms in religious rites of the indigenous Mazatec people of Mexico. Anthony Russo, a colleague of Leary&#x27;s, had experimented with psychedelic &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot; mushrooms on a trip to Mexico and told Leary about it. In August 1960, Leary traveled to Cuernavaca, Mexico, with Russo and consumed psilocybin mushrooms for the first time, an experience that drastically altered the course of his life. In 1965, Leary said that he had &quot;learned more about ... [his] brain and its possibilities ... [and] more about psychology in the five hours after taking these mushrooms than ... in the preceding 15 years of studying and doing research&quot;.

Back at Harvard, Leary and his associates (notably Alpert) began a research program known as the Harvard Psilocybin Project. The goal was to analyze psilocybin&#x27;s effects on human subjects (first prisoners, and later Andover Newton Theological Seminary students) from a synthesized version of the drug, one of two active compounds found in a wide variety of hallucinogenic mushrooms, including &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot;. Psilocybin was produced in a process developed by Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, who was famous for synthesizing LSD.

Beat poet Allen Ginsberg heard about the Harvard research project and asked to join. Leary was inspired by Ginsberg&#x27;s enthusiasm, and the two shared an optimism that psychedelics could help people discover a higher level of consciousness. They began introducing psychedelics to intellectuals and artists including Jack Kerouac, Maynard Ferguson, Charles Mingus and Charles Olson.

==== Concord Prison Experiment ====
Leary argued that psychedelic substances—in proper doses, a stable setting, and under the guidance of psychologists—could benefit behavior in ways not easily obtained by regular therapy. He experimented in treating alcoholism and reforming criminals, and many of his subjects said they had profound mystical and spiritual experiences that permanently improved their lives.

The Concord Prison Experiment evaluated the use of psilocybin and psychotherapy in the rehabilitation of released prisoners. Thirty-six prisoners were reported to have repented and sworn off criminality after Leary and his associates guided them through the psychedelic experience. The overall recidivism rate for American prisoners was 60%, whereas the rate for those in Leary&#x27;s project reportedly dropped to 20%. The experimenters concluded that long-term reduction in criminal recidivism could be effected with a combination of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy (inside the prison) along with a comprehensive post-release follow-up support program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous.

==== Dissension over studies ====
The Concord conclusions were contested in a follow-up study on the basis of time differences monitoring the study group vs. the control group and differences between subjects re-incarcerated for parole violations and those imprisoned for new crimes. The researchers concluded that statistically only a slight improvement could be attributed to psilocybin, in contrast to the significant improvement reported by Leary and his colleagues. Rick Doblin suggested that Leary had fallen prey to the Halo Effect, skewing the results and clinical conclusions. Doblin further accused Leary of lacking &quot;a higher standard&quot; or &quot;highest ethical standards in order to regain the trust of regulators&quot;. Ralph Metzner rebuked Doblin for these assertions: &quot;In my opinion, the existing accepted standards of honesty and truthfulness are perfectly adequate. We have those standards, not to curry favor with regulators, but because it is the agreement within the scientific community that observations should be reported accurately and completely. There is no proof in any of this re-analysis that Leary unethically manipulated his data.&quot;

Leary and Alpert founded the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF) in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to carry out studies in the religious use of psychedelic drugs. This was run by Lisa Bieberman (now known as Licia Kuenning), a friend of Leary. &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; called her a &quot;disciple&quot; who ran a Psychedelic Information Center out of her home and published a national LSD newspaper. That publication was actually Leary and Alpert&#x27;s journal &quot;Psychedelic Review&quot; and Bieberman (a graduate of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard, who had volunteered for Leary as a student) was its circulation manager. Leary&#x27;s and Alpert&#x27;s research attracted so much attention that many who wanted to participate in the experiments had to be turned away. To satisfy the curiosity of those who were turned away, a black market for psychedelics sprang up near the Harvard campus.

==== Firing by Harvard ====
Other professors in the Harvard Center for Research in Personality raised concerns about the experiments&#x27; legitimacy and safety. Leary and Alpert taught a class that was required for graduation and colleagues felt they were abusing their power by pressuring graduate students to take hallucinogens in the experiments. Leary and Alpert also went against policy by giving psychedelics to undergraduate students and did not select participants through random sampling. It was also ethically questionable that the researchers sometimes took hallucinogens along with the subjects they were studying. These concerns were printed in &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, leading the university to halt the experiments. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health launched an investigation that was later dropped but the university eventually fired Leary and Alpert.

According to Andrew Weil, Leary (who held an untenured teaching appointment) was fired for missing his scheduled lectures, while Alpert (a tenure-track assistant professor) was dismissed for allegedly giving an undergraduate psilocybin in an off-campus apartment. Harvard President Nathan Pusey released a statement on May 27, 1963, reporting that Leary had left campus without authorization and &quot;failed to keep his classroom appointments&quot;. His salary was terminated on April 30, 1963.

===Millbrook and psychedelic counterculture (1963–1967)===
Leary&#x27;s psychedelic experimentation attracted the attention of three heirs to the Mellon fortune, siblings Peggy, Billy, and Tommy Hitchcock. In 1963, they gave Leary and his associates access to a sprawling 64-room mansion on an estate in Millbrook, New York, where they continued their psychedelic sessions. Peggy directed the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF)&#x27;s New York branch, and Billy rented the estate to IFIF. Peggy persuaded her brothers to let Leary rent a room at the mansion. Leary and Alpert set up a communal group with former Psilocybin Project members at the Hitchcock Estate (commonly known as &quot;Millbrook&quot;). One of the IFIF&#x27;s founding board members, Paul Lee, a Harvard theologian, a participant at Marsh Chapel and a member of the Leary circle, said of the group&#x27;s formation:

The IFIF was reconstituted as the Castalia Foundation after the intellectual colony in Hermann Hesse&#x27;s 1943 novel &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot;. The Castalia group&#x27;s journal was the &quot;Psychedelic Review&quot;. The core group at Millbrook wanted to cultivate the divinity within each person and regularly joined LSD sessions facilitated by Leary. The Castalia Foundation also hosted non-drug weekend retreats for meditation, yoga, and group therapy. Leary later wrote:

We saw ourselves as anthropologists from the 21st century inhabiting a time module set somewhere in the dark ages of the 1960s. On this space colony we were attempting to create a new paganism and a new dedication to life as art.

Lucy Sante of &quot;The New York Times&quot; later described the Millbrook estate as:

the headquarters of Leary and gang for the better part of five years, a period filled with endless parties, epiphanies and breakdowns, emotional dramas of all sizes, and numerous raids and arrests, many of them on flimsy charges concocted by the local assistant district attorney, G. Gordon Liddy.

Others contest the characterization of Millbrook as a party house. In &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, Tom Wolfe portrays Leary as using psychedelics only for research, not recreation. When Ken Kesey&#x27;s Merry Pranksters visited the estate, they received a frosty reception. Leary had the flu and did not play host. After a private meeting with Kesey and Ken Babbs in his room, he promised to remain an ally in the years ahead.

In 1964, Leary, Alpert, and Ralph Metzner coauthored &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;, based on the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;. In it, they wrote:

A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of spacetime dimensions, and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc. Of course, the drug does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key—it opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures.

Leary married model Birgitte Caroline &quot;Nena&quot; von Schlebrügge in 1964 at Millbrook. Both Nena and her brother Bjorn were friends of the Hitchcocks. D. A. Pennebaker, also a Hitchcock friend, and cinematographer Nicholas Proferes documented the event in the short film &quot;You&#x27;re Nobody Till Somebody Loves You&quot;. Charles Mingus played piano. The marriage lasted a year before von Schlebrügge divorced Leary in 1965. She married Indo-Tibetan Buddhist scholar and ex-monk Robert Thurman in 1967 and gave birth to Ganden Thurman that same year. Actress Uma Thurman, her second child, was born in 1970.

Leary met Rosemary Woodruff in 1965 at a New York City art exhibit, and invited her to Millbrook. After moving in, she co-edited the manuscript for Leary&#x27;s 1966 book &quot;Psychedelic Prayers: And Other Meditations&quot; with Ralph Metzner and Michael Horowitz. The poems in the book were inspired by the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, and meant to be used as an aid to LSD trips. Woodruff helped Leary prepare weekend multimedia workshops simulating the psychedelic experience, which were presented around the East Coast.

In September 1966, Leary said in a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine interview that LSD could cure homosexuality. According to him, a lesbian became heterosexual after using the drug. Like most of the psychiatric field, he later decided that homosexuality was not an illness.

By 1966, use of psychedelics by America&#x27;s youth had reached such proportions that serious concern about the drugs and their effect on American culture was expressed in the national press and halls of government. In response to this concern, Senator Thomas Dodd convened Senate subcommittee hearings to try to better understand the drug-use phenomenon, eventually with the intention of &quot;stamping out&quot; such usage by criminalizing it. Leary was one of several expert witnesses called to testify at these hearings. In his testimony, Leary said, &quot;the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them.&quot; He implored the subcommittee not to criminalize psychedelic drug use, which he felt would only serve to exponentially increase its usage among America&#x27;s youth while removing the safeguards that controlled &quot;set and setting&quot; provided. When subcommittee member Ted Kennedy asked Leary whether LSD usage was &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;, Leary replied, &quot;Sir, the motorcar is dangerous if used improperly...Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.&quot; To conclude his testimony, Leary suggested that legislation be enacted that would require LSD users to be adults who were competently trained and licensed, so that such individuals could use LSD &quot;for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.&quot; He argued that without such licensing, the U.S. would face &quot;another era of prohibition.&quot; Leary&#x27;s testimony proved ineffective; on October 6, 1966, just months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California, and by October 1968, it was banned nationwide by the Staggers-Dodd Bill.

In 1966, Folkways Records recorded Leary reading from his book &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;, and released the album &quot;The Psychedelic Experience: Readings from the Book &quot;The Psychedelic Experience. A Manual Based on the Tibetan...&quot;.&quot;

On September 19, 1966, Leary reorganized the IFIF/Castalia Foundation under the name the League for Spiritual Discovery, a religion with LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion&#x27;s adherents, based on a &quot;freedom of religion&quot; argument. Leary incorporated the League for Spiritual Discovery as a religious organization in New York State, and its dogma was based on Leary&#x27;s mantra: &quot;drop out, turn on, tune in&quot;. (The Brotherhood of Eternal Love later considered Leary its spiritual leader, but it did not develop out of the IFIF.) Nicholas Sand, the clandestine chemist for the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, followed Leary to Millbrook and joined the League for Spiritual Discovery. Sand was designated the &quot;alchemist&quot; of the new religion. At the end of 1966, Nina Graboi, a friend and colleague of Leary&#x27;s who had spent time with him at Millbrook, became the director of the Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery in Greenwich Village. The Center opened in March 1967. Leary and Alpert gave free weekly talks there; other guest speakers included Ralph Metzner and Allen Ginsberg. Leary&#x27;s papers at the New York Public Library include complete records of the IFIF, the Castalia Foundation, and the League for Spiritual Discovery.

In late 1966 and early 1967, Leary toured college campuses presenting a multimedia performance called &quot;The Death of the Mind&quot;, attempting an artistic replication of the LSD experience. He said that the League for Spiritual Discovery was limited to 360 members and was already at its membership limit, but encouraged others to form their own psychedelic religions. He published a pamphlet in 1967 called &quot;Start Your Own Religion&quot; to encourage people to do so.

Leary was invited to attend the January 14, 1967 Human Be-In by Michael Bowen, the primary organizer of the event, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. In speaking to the group, Leary coined the famous phrase &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot;. In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, he said the slogan was &quot;given to him&quot; by Marshall McLuhan when the two had lunch in New York City, adding, &quot;Marshall was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, &#x27;Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that&#x27;s a lot,&#x27; to the tune of [the well-known Pepsi 1950s singing commercial]. Then he started going, &#x27;Tune in, turn on, and drop out.&#x27;&quot; Though the more popular &quot;turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; became synonymous with Leary, his actual definition with the League for Spiritual Discovery was: &quot;&quot;Drop Out&quot;—detach yourself from the external social drama which is as dehydrated and ersatz as TV. &quot;Turn On&quot;—find a sacrament which returns you to the temple of God, your own body. Go out of your mind. Get high. &quot;Tune In&quot;—be reborn. Drop back in to express it. Start a new sequence of behavior that reflects your vision.&quot;

Repeated FBI raids ended the Millbrook era. Leary told author and Prankster Paul Krassner of a 1966 raid by Liddy, &quot;He was a government agent entering our bedroom at midnight. We had every right to shoot him. But I&#x27;ve never owned a weapon in my life. I have never had and never will have a gun around.&quot;

In November 1967, Leary engaged in a televised debate on drug use with MIT professor Jerry Lettvin.

===Post-Millbrook===
At the end of 1967, Leary moved to Laguna Beach, California, and made many friends in Hollywood. &quot;When he married his third wife, Rosemary Woodruff, in 1967, the event was directed by Ted Markland of &quot;Bonanza&quot;. All the guests were on acid.&quot;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Leary formulated what became his eight-circuit model of consciousness in collaboration with writer Brian Barritt. The essay &quot;The Seven Tongues of God&quot; claimed that human brains have seven circuits producing seven levels of consciousness. This later became seven circuits in Leary&#x27;s 1973 monograph &quot;Neurologic&quot;, which he wrote while he was in prison. The eight-circuit idea was not exhaustively formulated until the publication of &quot;Exo-Psychology&quot; by Leary and Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Cosmic Trigger&quot; in 1977. Wilson contributed to the model after befriending Leary in the early 1970s, and used it as a framework for further exposition in his book &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot;, among other works.

Leary believed that the first four of these circuits (&quot;the Larval Circuits&quot; or &quot;Terrestrial Circuits&quot;) are naturally accessed by most people at transition points in life such as puberty. The second four circuits (&quot;the Stellar Circuits&quot; or &quot;Extra-Terrestrial Circuits&quot;), Leary wrote, were &quot;evolutionary offshoots&quot; of the first four that would be triggered at transition points as humans evolve further. These circuits, according to Leary, would equip humans to live in space and expand consciousness for further scientific and social progress. Leary suggested that some people might trigger these circuits sooner through meditation, yoga, or psychedelic drugs specific to each circuit. He suggested that the feelings of floating and uninhibited motion sometimes experienced with marijuana demonstrated the purpose of the higher four circuits. The function of the fifth circuit was to accustom humans to life at a zero gravity environment. Leary did not specify the location of the eight circuits in any brain structures, neural organization, or chemical pathways. He wrote that a higher intelligence &quot;located in interstellar nuclear-gravitational-quantum structures&quot; gave humans the eight circuits. A &quot;U.F.O. message&quot; was encoded in human DNA.

Many researchers believed that Leary provided little scientific evidence for his claims. Even before he began working on psychedelics, he was known as a theoretician rather than a data collector. His most ambitious pre-psychedelic work was &quot;Interpersonal Diagnosis Of Personality&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot;, H. J. Eysenck, wrote that Leary created a confusing and overly broad rubric for testing psychiatric conditions. &quot;Perhaps the worst failing of the book is the omission of any kind of proof for the validity and reliability of the diagnostic system,&quot; Eysenck wrote. &quot;It is simply not enough to say&quot; that the accuracy of the system &quot;can be checked by the reader&quot; in clinical practice. In 1965, Leary co-edited &quot;The Psychedelic Reader&quot;. Penn State psychology researcher Jerome E. Singer reviewed the book and singled out Leary as the worst offender in a work containing &quot;melanges of hucksterism&quot;. In place of scientific data about the effects of LSD, Leary used metaphors about &quot;galaxies spinning&quot; faster than the speed of light and a cerebral cortex &quot;turned on to a much higher voltage&quot;.

== Legal troubles ==
Leary&#x27;s first run-in with the law came on December 23, 1965, when he was arrested for marijuana possession. On December 20, 1965, Leary took his two children, Jack and Susan, and his girlfriend Rosemary Woodruff to Mexico for an month-long vacation to rest and write an autobiography. Two days later they had crossed into Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in the late afternoon and discovered that they would have to wait until morning for the appropriate visa for an extended stay. They decided to cross back into Texas to spend the night, and were on the US–Mexico bridge when Rosemary remembered that she had a small amount of marijuana in her possession. It was impossible to throw it out on the bridge, so Susan put it in her clothes. On their return from Mexico to the United States, a US Customs Service woman officer searched Susan and found a silver snuffbox with marijuana. After taking responsibility for the controlled substance, Leary was convicted of possession under the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 on March 11, 1966, sentenced to 30 years in prison, fined $30,000, and ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment. He appealed the case on the basis that the Marihuana Tax Act was unconstitutional, as it required a degree of self-incrimination in blatant violation of the Fifth Amendment.

On December 26, 1968, Leary was arrested again in Laguna Beach, California, this time for the possession of two marijuana &quot;roaches&quot;. Leary alleged that they were planted by the arresting officer, but was convicted of the crime. On May 19, 1969, the Supreme Court concurred with Leary in &quot;Leary v. United States&quot;, declared the Marihuana Tax Act unconstitutional, and overturned his 1966 conviction.

On that same day, Leary announced his candidacy for governor of California against the Republican incumbent, Ronald Reagan. His campaign slogan was &quot;Come together, join the party.&quot; On June 1, 1969, Leary joined John Lennon and Yoko Ono at their Montreal bed-in, and Lennon subsequently wrote Leary a campaign song called &quot;Come Together&quot;.

On January 21, 1970, Leary received a ten-year sentence for his 1968 offense, with a further ten added later while in custody for a prior arrest in 1965, for a total of 20 years to be served consecutively. On his arrival in prison, he was given psychological tests used to assign inmates to appropriate work details. Having designed some of these tests himself (including the &quot;Leary Interpersonal Behavior Inventory&quot;), Leary answered them in such a way that he seemed to be a very conforming, conventional person with a great interest in forestry and gardening. As a result, he was assigned to work as a gardener in a lower-security prison from which he escaped in September 1970, saying that his nonviolent escape was a humorous prank and leaving a challenging note for the authorities to find after he was gone.

For a fee of $25,000, paid by The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Weathermen smuggled Leary out of prison in a pickup truck driven by Clayton Van Lydegraf. The truck met Leary after he had escaped over the prison wall by climbing along a telephone wire. The Weathermen then helped both Leary and Rosemary out of the U.S. (and eventually into Algeria). He sought the patronage of Eldridge Cleaver for $10,000 and the remnants of the Black Panther Party&#x27;s &quot;government in exile&quot; in Algeria, but after a short stay with them said that Cleaver had attempted to hold him and his wife hostage. Cleaver had put Leary and his wife under &quot;house arrest&quot; due to exasperation with their socialite lifestyle.

In 1971, the couple fled to Switzerland, where they were sheltered and effectively imprisoned by a high-living arms dealer, Michel Hauchard, who claimed he had an &quot;obligation as a gentleman to protect philosophers&quot;; Hauchard intended to broker a surreptitious film deal, and forced Leary to assign his future earnings (which Leary eventually won back). In 1972, Nixon&#x27;s attorney general, John Mitchell, persuaded the Swiss government to imprison Leary, which it did for a month, but refused to extradite him to the U.S.

Leary and Rosemary separated later that year; she traveled widely, then moved back to the U.S., where she lived as a fugitive until the 1990s. Shortly after his separation from Rosemary in 1972, Leary became involved with Swiss-born British socialite Joanna Harcourt-Smith, a stepdaughter of financier Árpád Plesch and ex-girlfriend of Hauchard. The couple married in a hotel under the influence of cocaine and LSD two weeks after they were introduced, and Harcourt-Smith used his surname until their breakup in 1977. They traveled to Vienna, then Beirut, and finally ended up in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1972; according to Lucy Sante, &quot;Afghanistan had no extradition treaty with the United States, but this stricture did not apply to American airliners.&quot; American authorities used that interpretation of the law to interdict Leary. &quot;Before Leary could deplane, he was arrested by an agent of the federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.&quot; Leary asserted a different story on appeal before the California Court of Appeal for the Second District, namely:

Leary&#x27;s bail was set at $5 million. The judge at his remand hearing said, &quot;If he is allowed to travel freely, he will speak publicly and spread his ideas&quot;. Facing 95 years in prison, Leary hired criminal defense attorney Bruce Margolin. Leary mostly directed his own defense strategy, which proved unsuccessful: the jury convicted him after deliberating for less than two hours. Leary received five years for his prison escape, added to his original 10-year sentence. In 1973, he was sent to Folsom Prison in California, and put in solitary confinement. While in Folsom, he was placed in a cell next to Charles Manson&#x27;s. They could not see each other, but they could talk together. In their discussions, Manson found it difficult to understand why Leary had given people LSD without trying to control them. At one point, Manson said to Leary, &quot;They took you off the streets so that I could continue with your work.&quot;

Leary became an FBI informant in order to shorten his prison sentence and entered the witness protection program upon his release in 1976. He claimed that he feigned cooperation with the FBI investigation of Weathermen by providing information that they already had or that was of little consequence. The FBI gave him the code name &quot;Charlie Thrush&quot;. In a 1974 news conference, Allen Ginsberg, Ram Dass, and Leary&#x27;s 25-year-old son Jack denounced Leary, calling him a &quot;cop informant&quot;, &quot;liar&quot;, and &quot;paranoid schizophrenic&quot;. No prosecutions stemmed from his FBI reporting. In 1999, a letter from 22 &quot;Friends of Timothy Leary&quot; sought to soften impressions of the FBI episode. It was signed by authors such as Douglas Rushkoff, Ken Kesey, and Robert Anton Wilson. Susan Sarandon, Genesis P-Orridge and Leary&#x27;s goddaughter Winona Ryder also signed. The letter said that Leary had smuggled a message to the Weather Underground informing it &quot;that he was considering making a deal with the FBI&quot; and he then &quot;waited for their approval&quot;. The reported reply was, &quot;We understand.&quot; The letter writers did not provide confirmation that the Weather Underground okayed his cooperation with the FBI.

While in prison, Leary was sued by the parents of Vernon Powell Cox, who had jumped from a third-story window of a Berkeley apartment while under the influence of LSD. Cox had taken the drug after attending a lecture by Leary promoting LSD use. Leary was unable to be present due to his incarceration, and unable to arrange for legal representation; a default judgment was entered against him in the amount of $100,000.

== Post-prison ==
On April 21, 1976, Governor Jerry Brown released Leary from prison. After briefly relocating to Santa Fe, New Mexico, with Harcourt-Smith under the auspices of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program, the couple separated in early 1977.

Leary then moved to the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles, where he resided for the rest of his life. Unable to secure a conventional academic, research, or clinical appointment due to his reputation, he continued to publish books through the independent press while maintaining an upper middle class lifestyle by making paid appearances at colleges and nightclubs as a self-described &quot;stand-up philosopher&quot;. In 1978, he married filmmaker Barbara Blum, also known as Barbara Chase, sister of actress Tanya Roberts. He adopted Blum&#x27;s young son Zachary and raised him as his own. He also took on several godchildren, including Winona Ryder (the daughter of his archivist Michael Horowitz) and technologist Joi Ito.

Leary developed an improbable partnership with former Millbrook-era foe G. Gordon Liddy, the Watergate burglar and conservative radio talk-show host. They toured the lecture circuit in 1982 as ex-cons debating a range of issues, including gay rights, abortion, welfare and the environment. Leary generally espoused left-wing views, while Liddy generally espoused right-wing perspectives. The tour generated massive publicity and considerable funds for both. The 1983 documentary &quot;Return Engagement&quot; chronicled the tour and the release of &quot;Flashbacks&quot;, Leary&#x27;s long-germinating memoir; biographer Robert Greenfield has since asserted that much of what Leary &quot;reported as fact in &quot;Flashbacks&quot; is pure fantasy.&quot;

On September 25, 1988, Leary held a fundraiser for Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ron Paul. Journalist Debra Saunders attended and wrote about her experience.

Leary&#x27;s extensive touring on the lecture circuit continued to ensure his family a comfortable lifestyle throughout the mid-1980s. He associated with a variety of cultural figures, including longtime interlocutors Robert Anton Wilson and Allen Ginsberg; science fiction writers William Gibson and Norman Spinrad; and rock musicians David Byrne and John Frusciante. In addition, he appeared in Johnny Depp&#x27;s and Gibby Haynes&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Stuff&quot;, which chronicled Frusciante&#x27;s squalid living conditions at that time.

Leary continued to take a wide array of drugs (ranging from serotonergic psychedelics to the nascent empathogen MDMA and alcohol and heroin) in private, but consciously eschewed proselytizing substances in media appearances amid the escalation of the war on drugs throughout the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Instead, he served as a prominent advocate for space colonization and life extension. He expounded on the eight-circuit model of consciousness in books such as &quot;Info-Psychology: A Re-Vision of Exo-Psychology&quot;. He invented the acronym &quot;SMI²LE&quot; as a succinct summary of his pre-transhumanist agenda: SM (Space Migration) + I² (intelligence increase) + LE (Life extension).

Leary&#x27;s space colonization plan evolved over the years. Initially, 5,000 of Earth&#x27;s most virile and intelligent individuals would be launched on a vessel (Starseed 1) equipped with luxurious amenities. This idea was inspired by musician Paul Kantner&#x27;s 1970 concept album &quot;Blows Against The Empire&quot;, which was derived from Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s Lazarus Long series. While incarcerated in Folsom State Prison during the winter of 1975–76, he became enamored of Princeton University physicist Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s plans to construct giant Eden-like High Orbital Mini-Earths, as documented in the Robert Anton Wilson lecture &quot;H.O.M.E.s on LaGrange&quot;, using raw materials from the Moon, orbital rock, and obsolete satellites.

In the 1980s, Leary became fascinated by computers, the internet, and virtual reality. He proclaimed that &quot;the PC is the LSD of the 1990s&quot; and enjoined historically technophobic bohemians to &quot;turn on, boot up, jack in.&quot; He became a promoter of virtual reality systems, and sometimes demonstrated a prototype of the Mattel Power Glove as part of his lectures (as in &quot;From Psychedelics to Cybernetics&quot;). He befriended a number of notable people in the field, such as Jaron Lanier and Brenda Laurel, a pioneer in virtual environments and human–computer interaction. During the evanescent heyday of the cyberdelic subculture, he served as a consultant to Billy Idol in the production of the 1993 album &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;.

In January 1989, his daughter Susan, then 41, was arrested in Los Angeles for non-fatally shooting her boyfriend in the head as he slept in December 1988. She was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial for attempted murder on two occasions. After years of mental instability, she died by suicide in jail in September 1990.

Although he considered her the &quot;great love of his life&quot;, Leary and Barbara divorced in 1992; according to friend and collaborator John Perry Barlow, &quot;Tim basically gave me permission to be her lover. He couldn&#x27;t be for her what she needed sexually, so it made more sense for him to anoint someone to do that for him.&quot; Thereafter, he ensconced himself in a diverse circle of prominent figures, including Johnny Depp, Susan Sarandon, Dan Aykroyd, Zach Leary, author Douglas Rushkoff, and &quot;Spin&quot; magazine publisher Bob Guccione, Jr. Despite declining health, he maintained a regular schedule of public appearances through 1994. Reflecting a modicum of political rehabilitation after several failed attempts to adapt &quot;Flashbacks&quot; as a film or television miniseries, he was the subject of a symposium of the American Psychological Association that year.

From 1989 on, Leary began to reestablish his connection to unconventional religious movements with an interest in altered states of consciousness. In 1989, he appeared with Robert Anton Wilson in a dialog called &quot;The Inner Frontier&quot; for the Association for Consciousness Exploration, a Cleveland-based group that had been responsible for his first Cleveland appearance in 1979. After that, he appeared at the Starwood Festival, a major Neo-Pagan event run by ACE in 1992 and 1993. His planned 1994 WinterStar Symposium appearance was canceled due to his declining health. In 1992, in front of hundreds of Neo-Pagans, Leary declared, &quot;I&#x27;ve always considered myself a Pagan.&quot; He also collaborated with Eric Gullichsen on &quot;Load and Run High-tech Paganism: Digital Polytheism&quot;. Shortly before his death on May 31, 1996, he recorded the album &quot;Right to Fly&quot; with Simon Stokes, which was released in July 1996.

== Death ==
In January 1995, Leary was diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer. He then notified Ram Dass and other old friends and began the process of directed dying, which he termed &quot;designer dying&quot;. Leary did not reveal the condition to the press at that time, but did so after Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death in August. Leary and Ram Dass reunited before Leary&#x27;s death in May 1996, as seen in the documentary film &quot;Dying to Know: Ram Dass &amp; Timothy Leary&quot;.

Leary&#x27;s last book was &quot;Chaos &amp; Cyber Culture&quot;, published in 1994. In it he wrote: &quot;The time has come to talk cheerfully and joke sassily about personal responsibility for managing the dying process.&quot; His book &quot;Design for Dying&quot;, which tried to give a new perspective on death and dying, was published posthumously. Leary wrote about his belief that death is &quot;a merging with the entire life process&quot;.

His website team, led by Chris Graves, updated his website on a daily basis as a proto-blog. The website noted his daily intake of various illicit and legal chemical substances, with a predilection for nitrous oxide, LSD and other psychedelic drugs. He was also noted for his trademark &quot;Leary Biscuit&quot;, a cannabis edible consisting of a snack cracker with cheese and a small marijuana bud, briefly microwaved. At his request, his sterile house was redecorated by the staff with an array of surreal ornamentation. In his final months, thousands of visitors, well-wishers and old friends visited him in his California home. Until his last weeks, he gave many interviews discussing his new philosophy of embracing death.

Leary was reportedly excited for a number of years by the possibility of freezing his body in cryonic suspension, and he announced in September 1988 that he had signed up with Alcor for such treatment after having appeared at Alcor&#x27;s grand opening the year before. He did not believe he would be resurrected in the future, but did believe that cryonics had important possibilities, even though he thought it had only &quot;one chance in a thousand&quot;. He called it his &quot;duty as a futurist&quot;, helped publicize the process and hoped that it would work for his children and grandchildren if not for him, although he said that he was &quot;lighthearted&quot; about it. He was connected with two cryonic organizations—first Alcor and then CryoCare—one of which delivered a cryonic tank to his house in the months before his death. Leary initially announced that he would freeze his entire body, but due to lack of funds decided to freeze his head only. Three weeks before his death, Leary changed his mind again and generally refused cryopreservation from both Alcor and CryoCare. He requested that his body be cremated, with his ashes scattered in space.

Leary died aged 75 on May 31, 1996. His death was videotaped for posterity at his request by Denis Berry and Joey Cavella, capturing his final words. Berry was the trustee of Leary&#x27;s archives, and Cavella had filmed Leary during his later years. According to his son Zachary, during his final moments, he clenched his fist and said: &quot;Why?&quot;, then, unclenching his fist, said: &quot;Why not?&quot;. He uttered the phrase repeatedly, in different intonations, and died soon after. His last word, according to Zach, was &quot;beautiful&quot;.

The film &quot;Timothy Leary&#x27;s Dead&quot; (1996) contains a simulated sequence in which he allows his bodily functions to be suspended for the purposes of cryonic preservation. His head is removed and placed on ice. The film ends with a sequence showing the creation of the artificial head used in the film.

Seven grams (¼ oz) of Leary&#x27;s ashes were arranged by his friend at Celestis to be buried in space aboard a rocket carrying the remains of 23 others, including &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry, space colonization advocate Gerard O&#x27;Neill and German-American rocket engineer Krafft Ehricke. A Pegasus rocket containing their remains was launched on April 21, 1997, and remained in orbit for six years until it burned up in the atmosphere.

Leary&#x27;s ashes were given to close friends and family. In 2015, Susan Sarandon brought some of his ashes to the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City, Nevada, and put them into an art installation there. The ashes were burned along with the installation on September 6, 2015.

==Personal life==

Leary was legally married five times, sired three biological children and adopted a fourth child. He also regarded Joanna Harcourt-Smith (his domestic partner from 1972 to 1977) as his common-law wife for the duration of their relationship. His first wife, Marianne Busch, died by suicide.

== Influence ==
Leary was an early influence on applying game theory to psychology, having introduced the concept to the International Association of Applied Psychology in 1961 at its annual conference in Copenhagen. He was also an early influence on transactional analysis. His concept of the four life scripts, dating to 1951, became an influence on transactional analysis by the late 1960s, popularized by Thomas Harris in his book, &quot;I&#x27;m OK, You&#x27;re OK&quot;.

Many consider Leary one of the most prominent figures of the counterculture of the 1960s, and since those times he has remained influential on pop culture, literature, television, film and, especially, music.

Leary coined the influential term reality tunnel, a kind of representative realism. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, everyone interprets the same world differently, hence &quot;Truth is in the eye of the beholder.&quot;

His ideas influenced the work of his friend Robert Anton Wilson. This influence went both ways, with Leary taking just as much from Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; was an in-depth, highly detailed and inclusive work documenting Leary&#x27;s eight-circuit model of consciousness. Although the theory originated in discussions between Leary and a Hindu holy man at Millbrook, Wilson was one of its most ardent proponents and introduced it to a mainstream audience in 1977&#x27;s bestselling &quot;Cosmic Trigger&quot;. In 1989, they appeared together on stage in a dialog called &quot;The Inner Frontier&quot; hosted by the Association for Consciousness Exploration, the same group that had hosted Leary&#x27;s first Cleveland appearance in 1979.

World religion scholar Huston Smith was &quot;turned on&quot; by Leary after being introduced to him by Aldous Huxley in the early 1960s. Smith interpreted the experience as deeply religious, and described it in detailed religious terms in his book &quot;Cleansing of the Doors of Perception&quot;. Smith asked Leary whether he knew the power and danger of what he was conducting research with. In &quot;Mother Jones Magazine&quot;, 1997, Smith commented:

First, I have to say that during the three years I was involved with that Harvard study, LSD was not only legal but respectable. Before Tim went on his unfortunate careening course, it was a legitimate research project. Though I did find evidence that, when recounted, the experiences of the Harvard group and those of mystics were impossible to tell apart—descriptively indistinguishable—that&#x27;s not the last word. There is still a question about the truth of the disclosure. Was the drug-induced mystical experience just an emotional jag that messed up some neural connections? Or was it a genuine disclosure, an epiphany?

==In popular culture==
===In film===

In the 1968 &quot;Dragnet&quot; episode &quot;The Big Prophet&quot;, Liam Sullivan played Brother William Bentley, leader of the Temple of the Expanded Mind, a thinly fictionalized Leary. Bentley held forth for the entire half-hour on the rights of the individual and the benefits of LSD and marijuana, while Joe Friday argued the contrary.

The 1979 musical &quot;Hair&quot; and the 1967 stage performance it is based on make multiple references to Leary.

Leary appears in Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Nice Dreams&quot;, featured in a scene in which he gives Cheech &quot;the key to the universe&quot;.

In 1994, Leary appeared as himself in the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;Elevator&quot;, and also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; as the character Dr. Milo.

In 1996, months before his death, Leary appeared in the feminist science fiction feature film &quot;Conceiving Ada&quot;.

The 1998 movie &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, adapted from Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s 1971 novel, portrays heavy psychedelic drug use and mentions Leary when the protagonist ponders the meaning of the acid wave of the 1960s.

===In music===
&quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot; (1964) was the inspiration for John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, on The Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966).

The Moody Blues recorded two songs about Leary. &quot;Legend of a Mind&quot;, written and sung by Ray Thomas on their album &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot; (1968), begins: &quot;Timothy Leary&#x27;s dead. No, no, no, no, he&#x27;s outside looking in&quot;. The second was &quot;When You&#x27;re a Free Man&quot; on the &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot; album.

Leary recruited Lennon to write a theme song for his California gubernatorial campaign against Ronald Reagan (which was interrupted by Leary&#x27;s prison sentence for cannabis possession), inspiring Lennon to come up with &quot;Come Together&quot; (1969), based on Leary&#x27;s campaign theme and catchphrase.

Leary was present and sang back-up vocals when Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, recorded &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; (1969) during their bed-in in Montreal and is mentioned in the lyrics of the song.

The Who&#x27;s 1970 single &quot;The Seeker&quot; mentions Leary in a sequence where the song&#x27;s protagonist claims that Leary (among other high-profile people) was unable to help them with their search for answers.

While in exile in Switzerland, Leary and British writer Brian Barritt collaborated with the German band Ash Ra Tempel and recorded the album &quot;Seven Up&quot; (1973). He is credited as a songwriter, and his lyrics and vocals can be heard throughout the album. Commenting on the work of his friend H. R. Giger, a surrealist artist from Switzerland who won an Academy Award for his work on the film &quot;Alien&quot;, Leary noted:
During the height of rave culture from the 1980s to mid-2000s, recordings of Leary and other psychedelic thinkers speaking were often mixed into electronic music. The Shamen honored him in the song &quot;Ebenezer Goode&quot; on their album &quot;Boss Drum&quot;. 

In 1995, Leary had a cameo at the end of the video for alternative rock group Blind Melon&#x27;s song &quot;Galaxie&quot;.

The Marcy Playground song &quot;It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, from its 1999 album &quot;Shapeshifter&quot;, mentions joining Leary &quot;in a cryogenic freeze&quot;.

===In comic books===
In 1973, &quot;El Perfecto Comics&quot; was organized by Aline Kominsky and published by The Print Mint to raise funds for the Timothy Leary Defense Fund. The comic features 31 underground artists contributing mostly one-pagers about drug experiences (primarily LSD). The front cover and a contributed one-page story are by Robert Crumb.

In 1979, Last Gasp published the one-shot edition &quot;Neurocomics: Timothy Leary&quot;. &quot;Evolved from transmissions of Dr. Timothy Leary as filtered through Pete Von Sholly &amp; George DiCaprio&quot;, it is based on Leary&#x27;s writings related to life, the brain, and intelligence. DiCaprio collaborated with Leary on the script.

== Works ==
Leary authored or coauthored more than 20 books and was featured on more than a dozen audio recordings. His acting career included over a dozen appearances in movies and television shows in various roles and over 30 appearances as himself. He also produced and/or collaborated with others in the creation of multimedia presentations and computer games.

In 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the New York Public Library had acquired Leary&#x27;s personal archives, including papers, videotapes, photographs and other archival material from the Leary estate, including correspondence and documents relating to Allen Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Ken Kesey, Arthur Koestler, G. Gordon Liddy and other prominent cultural figures. The collection became available in September 2013.

<text>They Might Be Giants, often abbreviated as TMBG, is an American alternative rock and children’s band formed in 1982 by John Flansburgh and John Linnell. During TMBG&#x27;s early years, Flansburgh and Linnell frequently performed as a musical duo, often accompanied by a drum machine. In the early 1990s, TMBG expanded to include a backing band. The duo&#x27;s current backing band consists of Marty Beller, Dan Miller and Danny Weinkauf. They have been credited as vital in the creation and growth of the prolific DIY music scene in Brooklyn in the mid-1980s.

The group has been noted for its unique style of alternative music, typically using surreal, humorous lyrics, experimental styles and unconventional instruments. Over their career, they have found success on the modern rock and college radio charts. They have also found success in children&#x27;s music with several educational albums, and in theme music for television programs and films.

TMBG have released 23 studio albums. &quot;Flood&quot; has been certified platinum, while their children&#x27;s music albums &quot;Here Come the ABCs&quot;, &quot;Here Come the 123s&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes Science&quot; have all been certified gold. The duo has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, winning two. Flansburgh and Linnell won for writing &quot;Boss of Me&quot;, the theme to &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (Best Film or Television Theme) and They Might Be Giants won for &quot;Here Come the 123s&quot; (Best Children&#x27;s Album). Linnell and Flansburgh were also nominated for a Tony Award for Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre along with other composers of the show for &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical&quot;. In total, the group has sold over 4 million records.

==History==

===Earlier years (1981–1989)===
Johns Linnell and Flansburgh first met as teenagers growing up in Lincoln, Massachusetts. They began writing songs together while attending Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School but did not form a band at that time. The two attended separate colleges after high school and Linnell joined The Mundanes, a new wave group from Rhode Island. The two reunited in 1981 after moving to Brooklyn (to the same apartment building on the same day) to continue their career.

At their first concert, They Might Be Giants were introduced as and performed under the name El Grupo De Rock and Roll (Spanish for &quot;the Rock and Roll Band&quot;), because the show was a Sandinista rally in Central Park, and a majority of the audience members spoke Spanish. They had previously chosen a name that, according to John Flansburgh, was &quot;so bad that John [Linnell] and I have made a vow that we will never tell anyone, even our children.&quot; Soon discarding this name, the band assumed the name of the 1971 film &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; (starring George C. Scott and Joanne Woodward), which is in turn taken from a &quot;Don Quixote&quot; passage about how Quixote mistook windmills for evil giants. According to Dave Wilson, in his book &quot;Rock Formations&quot;, the name They Might Be Giants had been used and subsequently discarded by a friend of the band who had a ventriloquism act. The name was then adopted by the band, who had been searching for a more suitable name.

A common misconception is that the name of the band is a reference to themselves and an allusion to future success. In an interview, John Flansburgh said that the words &quot;they might be giants&quot; are just a very outward-looking forward thing which they liked. He clarified this in the documentary movie &quot;Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)&quot; by explaining that the name refers to the outside world of possibilities that they saw as a fledgling band. In an earlier radio interview, John Linnell described the phrase as &quot;something very paranoid sounding&quot;.

The duo began performing their own music in and around New York City at the East Village Pyramid Club – Flansburgh on guitar, Linnell on accordion and saxophone and accompanied by a drum machine or prerecorded backing track on audio cassette. Their atypical instrumentation, along with their songs which featured unusual subject matter and clever wordplay, soon attracted a strong local following. Their performances also featured absurdly comical stage props such as oversized fezzes and large cardboard cutout heads of newspaper editor William Allen White. Many of these props would later turn up in their first music videos. From 1984 to 1987, They Might Be Giants were the house band at the Pyramid Club and Darinka, a Lower East Side performance art club run by Gary Ray. They played on the stage there one weekend a month and by the end of their three-year stint, their performances were selling out. On March 30, 1985, TMBG released their 7&quot; flexi-disc, dubbed &quot;Wiggle Diskette&quot; at Darinka. The disc included demos of the songs &quot;Everything Right Is Wrong Again&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Miss Me&quot;.

=== Dial-A-Song (1985–2008)===

At one point, Linnell broke his wrist in a biking accident, and Flansburgh&#x27;s apartment was burgled, stopping them from performing for a time. During this hiatus, they began recording their songs onto an answering machine, and then advertising the phone number in local newspapers such as &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, using the moniker &quot;Dial-A-Song&quot;. They also released a demo cassette, which earned them a review in &quot;People&quot; magazine. Authored by Michael Small, the review caught the attention of Bar/None Records, who signed them to a recording deal.

From the 1980s until 1998, Dial-A-Song consisted of an answering machine with a tape of the band playing various songs. The machine played one track at a time, ranging from demos and uncompleted work to mock advertisements the band had created. It was often difficult to access due to the popularity of the service and the dubious quality of the machines used. About this, one of Dial-A-Song&#x27;s many slogans over the years was the tongue-in-cheek &quot;Always Busy, Often Broken&quot;. The number, (718) 387–6962, was a local Brooklyn number and was charged accordingly, but the band advertised it with the line: &quot;Free when you call from work&quot;.

At one point in 1988, the Dial-A-Song answering machine recorded a conversation between two people who had listened to Dial-A-Song, then questioned how they made money out of it. An excerpt from the conversation has been included as a hidden track on the EP for &quot;(She Was A) Hotel Detective.&quot; In the late &#x27;90s, TMBG started switching to a digital unit to update the format for Dial-A-Song, but due to frequent crashes, the band returned to the original format.

In March 2000, TMBG started the website dialasong.com, which was more reliable than the original, phone-based version, as it used a Flash document to stream the songs.

In 2002, Dial-A-Song&#x27;s answering machine broke down, and fans responded by sending new similar models. In the following year, Dial-A-Song resumed service with a new answering machine. By 2005, a computer system from TechTV was provided to maintain the system, but technical difficulties started bringing the system to an end.

In 2006, Dial-A-Song became increasingly difficult to maintain as a result of unreliable answering machines that had to be replaced. The stress placed upon the answering machine in addition to its age caused excessive wear, and the machine broke down soon after. In August, Dial-A-Song ceased production and because fans started taking advantage of the internet, it was replaced with a page promoting the They Might Be Giants podcasts.

John Linnell stated in an interview in early 2008 that Dial-A-Song had died of a technical crash, and that the Internet had taken over where the machine left off. On November 15, 2008, the Dial-A-Song number was officially disconnected, though the number has at times been re-used in a similar style by other independent artists.

In 2015, Dial-A-Song was reactivated with a new toll-free number: (844) 387–6962.

===&quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; and &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1986–1989)===
The duo released their self-titled debut album in 1986, which became a college radio hit. The video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot;, filmed in the New York State Pavilion built for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair in Queens, became a hit on MTV in 1987, earning them a broader following. In 1988, they released their second album, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, named after the duo&#x27;s hometown. It featured the song &quot;Ana Ng&quot; which reached No. 11 on the US Modern Rock chart. Both albums were produced on 8-track tape at Dubway Studios in New York City.

===Move to Elektra (1989–1992)===
In 1989, They Might Be Giants signed with Elektra Records and released their third album &quot;Flood&quot; the following year. &quot;Flood&quot; earned them a platinum album, largely thanks to the success of &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; which reached number three on the U.S. Modern Rock chart, as well as &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;, a cover of a song originally recorded by the Four Lads.

In 1990, &quot;Throttle&quot; magazine interviewed They Might Be Giants and clarified the meaning of the song &quot;Ana Ng&quot;: John Flansburgh said, &quot;Ng is a Vietnamese name. The song is about someone who&#x27;s thinking about a person on the exact opposite side of the world. John looked at a globe and figured out that if Ana Ng is in Vietnam and the person is on the other side of the world, then it must be written by someone in Peru&quot;.

Further interest in the band was generated when two cartoon music videos were created by Warner Bros. Animation for &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;: &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; and &quot;Particle Man&quot;. The videos reflected TMBG&#x27;s high &quot;kid appeal&quot;, resulting from their often absurd songs and pop melodies.

In 1991, Bar/None Records released the B-sides compilation &quot;Miscellaneous T&quot;. Though consisting of previously released material (save for the &quot;Purple Toupee&quot; B-sides, which were not available publicly), it gave new fans a chance to hear the Johns&#x27; earlier non-album work without having to hunt down the individual EPs.

In early 1992, They Might Be Giants released &quot;Apollo 18&quot;. The heavy space theme coincided with TMBG being named Musical Ambassadors for International Space Year. Singles from the album included &quot;The Statue Got Me High&quot;, &quot;I Palindrome I&quot;, and &quot;The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)&quot;. &quot;Apollo 18&quot; was also notable for being one of the first albums to take advantage of the CD player&#x27;s shuffle feature. The song &quot;Fingertips&quot; actually comprised 21 separate tracks — short snippets that not only acted together to make the song but that when played in random order would be interspersed between the album&#x27;s full-length songs. Due to mastering errors, the U.K. and Australian versions of &quot;Apollo 18&quot; contained &quot;Fingertips&quot; as one track.

===Recruiting a band (1992–1998)===
Following &quot;Apollo 18&quot;, for live shows, Flansburgh and Linnell (who themselves play the guitar and accordion or saxophone, respectively) decided to move away from recorded backing tracks and recruited a supporting band (Kurt Hoffman of The Ordinaires on reeds and keyboards, longtime Pere Ubu bassist Tony Maimone, and drummer Jonathan Feinberg).

&quot;John Henry&quot; was released in 1994. Influenced by their more conventional lineup, this album marked a departure from their previous releases with more of a guitar-heavy sound. It was released to mixed reviews amongst fans and critics alike.

Their next album, &quot;Factory Showroom&quot;, was released in 1996 to little fanfare. The band had quickly moved away from the feel of &quot;John Henry&quot;, and &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; returns to the more diverse sounds of their earlier albums, despite the inclusion of two guitarists, the second being Eric Schermerhorn who provided several guitar solos.

They left Elektra after the duo refused to do a publicity show, amongst other exposure-related disputes.

In 1998, they released a mostly live album &quot;Severe Tire Damage&quot; from which came the single &quot;Doctor Worm,&quot; a studio recording.

Around this same time period, Danny Weinkauf (bass) and Dan Miller (guitar) were recruited for their recording and touring band. Both had been members of the bands Lincoln and Candy Butchers which were previous opening acts for TMBG. Weinkauf and Miller continue to work with the band to the present day.

===Beyond Elektra and move to Restless Records (1999–2003)===
For most of their career, TMBG has made innovative use of the Internet. As early as 1992, the band was sending news updates to their fans via Usenet newsgroups. In 1999, They Might Be Giants became the first major-label recording artist to release an entire album exclusively in MP3 format. The album, &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot;, is sold through Emusic.

Also, in 1999, the band contributed the song &quot;Dr. Evil&quot; to the motion picture &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;. Over their career, the band has performed on numerous movie and television soundtracks, including &quot;The Oblongs&quot;, the ABC News miniseries &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;Ed and His Dead Mother&quot;. They also performed the theme music &quot;Dog on Fire&quot;, composed by Bob Mould, for &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;.
They composed and performed the music for the TLC series &quot;Resident Life&quot;, the theme song for the Disney Channel programs &quot;Higglytown Heroes&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;, and songs about the cartoons &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;.

During this time, the band also worked on a project for McSweeney&#x27;s, a publishing company and literary journal. The band wrote a McSweeney&#x27;s theme song and forty-four songs for an album that was meant to be listened to with the journal, with each track corresponding to a particular story or piece of artwork. Labeled &quot;They Might Be Giants vs. McSweeney&#x27;s&quot;, the disk appears in issue No. 6 of &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;.
Contributing the single &quot;Boss of Me&quot; as the theme song to the hit television series &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, as well as to the show&#x27;s compilation CD, brought a new audience to the band. Not only did the band contribute the theme, but songs from all of the Giants&#x27; previous albums were used on the show: for example, the infamous punching-the-kid-in-the-wheelchair scene from the first episode was done to the strains of &quot;Pencil Rain&quot; from &quot;Lincoln&quot;. Another song to feature in the series was &quot;Spiraling Shape&quot;. &quot;Boss of Me&quot; became the band&#x27;s second top-40 hit in the UK which they performed on long-running UK television programme Top of the Pops, and in 2002, won the duo a Grammy Award.

On September 11, 2001, they released the album &quot;Mink Car&quot; on Restless Records. It was their first full album release of new studio material since 1996 and their first since parting ways with Elektra. The making of that album, including a record signing event at a Manhattan Tower Records, was included in a documentary directed by A. J. Schnack titled &quot;Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)&quot;. The film was released on DVD in 2003.

In 2002, they released &quot;No!&quot;, their first album &quot;for the entire family&quot;. Using the enhanced CD format, it included an interactive animation for most of the songs. They followed it up in 2003 with their first book, an illustrated children&#x27;s book with an included EP, &quot;Bed, Bed, Bed&quot;.

===Podcasting, independent releases, and children&#x27;s music (2004–2015)===
In 2004, the band created one of the first artist-owned online music stores, at which customers could purchase and download MP3 copies of their music, both new releases and many previously released albums. By creating their own store, the band could keep money that would otherwise go to record companies. With the redesign of the band&#x27;s website in 2010, the store was reincarnated.

Also, in 2004, the band released its first new &quot;adult&quot; rock work since the release of &quot;No!&quot;, the EP &quot;Indestructible Object&quot;. This was followed by a new album, &quot;The Spine&quot;, and an associated EP, &quot;The Spine Surfs Alone&quot;. It was at this time that Dan Hickey was replaced by Marty Beller, who had previously collaborated with TMBG. For the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Experimental Film&quot;, TMBG teamed up with Homestar Runner creators Matt and Mike Chapman to create an animated music video. The band&#x27;s collaboration with the Brothers Chaps also included several Puppet Jam segments with puppet Homestar and the music for a Strong Bad email titled &quot;Different Town&quot;. In 2008 they recorded a track for the 200th Strong Bad e-mail, where Linnell provided the voice of The Poopsmith.

TMBG also contributed a track to the 2004 &quot;Future Soundtrack for America&quot; compilation, a project compiled by John Flansburgh with the help of Spike Jonze and Barsuk Records. The band contributed &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler Too&quot;, a political campaign song from the presidential election of 1840. The compilation was released by Barsuk and featured indie, alternative, and high-profile acts such as Death Cab for Cutie, The Flaming Lips, and Bright Eyes. All proceeds went to progressive organizations such as Music for America and MoveOn.org.

Flansburgh and Linnell made a guest appearance in &quot;Camp&quot;, the January 11, 2004, episode of the animated sitcom &quot;Home Movies&quot;. They voice both a pair of camp counselors and members of a strange hooded male bonding cult. On May 10, 2004, they made a guest appearance on the final episode of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; called &quot;Bluestock&quot; alongside Toni Braxton, Macy Gray, and India.Arie. They Might Be Giants were in a letter for Joe and Blue.

Following the &quot;Spine on the Hiway Tour&quot; of 2004, the band announced that they would take an extended hiatus from touring to focus on other projects, such as a musical produced by Flansburgh and written by his wife, Robin &quot;Goldie&quot; Goldwasser, titled &quot;People Are Wrong!&quot;.

2005 saw the release of &quot;Here Come the ABCs&quot;, TMBG&#x27;s follow-up to the successful children&#x27;s album &quot;No!&quot;. The Disney Sound label released the CD and DVD separately on February 15, 2005. To promote the album, Flansburgh and Linnell along with drummer Marty Beller embarked on a short tour, performing for free at many Borders locations. In November 2005, &quot;Venue Songs&quot; was released as a two-disc CD/DVD set narrated by John Hodgman. It is a concept album based on all of the &quot;venue songs&quot; from their 2004 tour.

TMBG covered the Devo song &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; in the 2005 Disney film &quot;Sky High&quot;. In 2008, they rerecorded the song &quot;Take Out The Trash&quot; (from &quot;The Else&quot;) in Simlish for inclusion in &quot;The Sims 2: Freetime&quot;.

From 2005 to 2014, They Might Be Giants made podcasts on a monthly, sometimes bi-monthly, basis. Each edition included remixes of previous songs, rarities, covers, and new songs and skits recorded specifically for the podcast.

The band contributed 14 original songs for the 2006 Dunkin&#x27; Donuts ad campaign, &quot;America Runs on Dunkin&#x27;&quot;, including &quot;Things I Like to Do&quot;, &quot;Pleather&quot;, and &quot;Fritalian&quot;.

The band has produced and performed three original songs for Playhouse Disney series: one for &quot;Higglytown Heroes&quot; and two for &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse features two original songs performed by group, including the opening theme song, in which a variant of a Mickey Mouse Club chant (&quot;Meeska Mooska Mickey Mouse!&quot;) is used to summon the Clubhouse, and &quot;Hot Dog!&quot;, the song used at the end of the show. The song references Mickey&#x27;s first spoken words in the 1929 short &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot;.

They also recorded a cover of the Disney song, &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; for the film &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot; and wrote and performed the theme song for &quot;The Drinky Crow Show&quot;. The band was recruited to provide original songs for the Henry Selick-directed film adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Coraline&quot; but were dropped because their music was not &quot;creepy&quot; enough. Only one song, titled &quot;Other Father Song&quot;, was kept for the film with Linnell singing as the titular &quot;Other Father&quot;.

Their twelfth album, &quot;The Else&quot;, was released July 10, 2007, on Idlewild Recordings (and distributed by Zoë Records for the CD version), with an earlier digital release on May 15 at the iTunes Store. Advance copies were made available to stations by mid-June 2007. The album was produced by Pat Dillett (David Byrne) and the Dust Brothers (Beck, Beastie Boys). On February 12, 2009, They Might Be Giants performed the song &quot;The Mesopotamians&quot; from the album on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

In the rest of 2007, They Might Be Giants wrote a commissioned piece for Brooklyn-based robotic music outfit League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots and performed for three dates at the event, and covered the Pixies &quot;Havalina&quot; for American Laundromat Records &quot;Dig For Fire - a tribute to PIXIES&quot; compilation.

The band&#x27;s 13th album, &quot;Here Come the 123s&quot;, a DVD/CD follow-up to 2005&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Here Come the ABCs&quot; children&#x27;s project, was released on February 5, 2008. On April 10, 2008, They Might Be Giants performed the song &quot;Seven&quot; from the album on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. In 2009, the album won the Grammy Award for &quot;Best Musical Album For Children&quot; during the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.

The band&#x27;s fourteenth album, &quot;Here Comes Science&quot;, a science-themed children&#x27;s album. This album introduced listeners to natural, formal, social, and applied sciences. It was released on September 1, 2009, and nominated for a Grammy Award on December 1, 2010.

On November 3, They Might Be Giants sent out a newsletter stating, &quot;The Avatars of They&quot;, a set of sock puppets the Johns manipulate for shows, would have an album in 2012, suggesting another children&#x27;s album. However, a new adult album titled &quot;Join Us&quot; was released on July 19, 2011.

On October 3, 2011, Artix Entertainment announced that the band would be performing in-game for a special musical event to commemorate the 3rd birthday of their popular MMORPG AdventureQuest Worlds. They were featured in AdventureQuest World&#x27;s special third birthday event as John and John.

On March 5, 2013, the band released their sixteenth adult studio album, &quot;Nanobots&quot;, on their Idlewild Recordings label in the US and on British indie label Lojinx in Europe.

The live album &quot;Flood Live in Australia&quot; was made available for free digital download by the band in 2015. Also in 2015, the band reactivated its Dial-A-Song service under the banner of Dial-A-Song-Direct, promising to release one new song every week for the entire year, beginning with the track &quot;Erase&quot; on January 5. Several of these songs were planned to be collected on a new studio rock album entitled &quot;Glean&quot; on April 21, 2015.

The band released their newest children&#x27;s album, &quot;Why?&quot;, on November 27, 2015. It was their fifth children&#x27;s album and the first children&#x27;s album to be released under their own label, Idlewild Recordings.

In a video released on December 20, 2015, John Flansburgh announced that the band would be taking a temporary break following their 2016 U.S. tour.

===Dial-A-Song revival, &quot;Phone Power&quot;, &quot;I Like Fun,&quot; and &quot;Book&quot; (2015–present)===
Dial-A-Song was revived in 2015, with a new phone number ((844) 387–6962), the website, and a radio network. In late 2017, the band announced via Twitter that Dial-A-Song would return again, in a modified format, starting in January 2018.

On March 8, 2016, the band released &quot;Phone Power&quot;, their nineteenth studio album and the third containing songs from the 2015 revival of their Dial-a-Song service. This was the first TMBG album to be sold as a &quot;pay what you want&quot; download, available ahead of the physical release on June 10.
The band&#x27;s twentieth album, &quot;I Like Fun&quot; was released on January 19, 2018. Their twenty-first and twenty-second studio albums, &quot;My Murdered Remains&quot; and &quot;The Escape Team&quot;, were both released on December 10, 2018. &quot;My Murdered Remains&quot; contains songs from Dial-A-Song.

In 2016, They Might Be Giants were involved in the SpongeBob SquarePants musical; they contributed the song &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot;.

In October 2019, the band recorded a new version of their song &quot;Hot Dog&quot; for the third season of the Disney Channel preschool series &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;, re-titled as &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot; for that season. It premiered on Disney Junior on October 14, 2019.

In July 2020, the band announced that they would be releasing an album titled &quot;Book&quot; in 2021. The album was released on November 12, 2021.

In August 2020, the band recorded a song for a CNN documentary about the electoral college called &quot;Who Are the Electors?&quot;.

The band announced a 30th anniversary Flood tour for 2020; however, it was postponed, and dates were rescheduled several times due to the COVID pandemic. Shortly after resuming live tours again in June 2022, John Flansburgh was involved in a car accident while on his way home from the June 8 concert. He suffered several broken ribs but had a positive prognosis from doctors. Several tour dates were again postponed while he recovered; however, the tour has since resumed.

In November 2022, &quot;Book&quot; was nominated for a 65th Annual Grammy Awards in the category of &quot;Best Boxed or Special Limited-Edition Package&quot;.

On September 2, 2023, the band announced that their international Flood tour would be postponed until October 2024 due to health issues, however no private details were publicly addressed.

<text>Titanite, or sphene (), is a calcium titanium nesosilicate mineral, CaTiSiO5. Trace impurities of iron and aluminium are typically present. Also commonly present are rare earth metals including cerium and yttrium; calcium may be partly replaced by thorium.

==Nomenclature==
The International Mineralogical Association Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (CNMMN) adopted the name titanite and &quot;discredited&quot; the name sphene as of 1982, although commonly papers and books initially identify the mineral using both names. Sphene was the most commonly used name until the IMA decision, although both were well known. Some authorities think it is less confusing as the word is used to describe any chemical or crystal with oxidized titanium such as the rare earth titanate pyrochlores series and many of the minerals with the perovskite structure. The name sphene continues to be publishable in peer-reviewed scientific literature, e.g. a paper by Hayden et al. was published in early 2008 in the journal Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology. Sphene persists as the informal name for titanite gemstones.

==Physical properties==

Titanite, which is named for its titanium content, occurs as translucent to transparent, reddish brown, gray, yellow, green, or red monoclinic crystals. These crystals are typically sphenoid in habit and are often twinned. Possessing a subadamantine tending to slightly resinous luster, titanite has a hardness of 5.5 and a weak cleavage. Its specific gravity varies between 3.52 and 3.54. Titanite&#x27;s refractive index is 1.885–1.990 to 1.915–2.050 with a strong birefringence of 0.105 to 0.135 (biaxial positive); under the microscope this leads to a distinctive high relief which combined with the common yellow-brown colour and lozenge-shape cross-section makes the mineral easy to identify. Transparent specimens are noted for their strong trichroism, the three colours presented being dependent on body colour. Owing to the quenching effect of iron, sphene exhibits no fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some titanite has been found to be metamict, in consequence of structural damage due to radioactive decomposition of the often significant thorium content. When viewed in thin section with a petrographic microscope, pleochroic halos can be observed in minerals surrounding a titanite crystal.

==Occurrence==
Titanite occurs as a common accessory mineral in intermediate and felsic igneous rocks and associated pegmatites. It also occurs in metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schists and skarns. Source localities include: Pakistan; Italy; Russia; China; Brazil; Tujetsch, St. Gothard, Switzerland; Madagascar; Tyrol, Austria; Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada; Sanford, Maine, Gouverneur, Diana, Rossie, Fine, Pitcairn, Brewster, New York and California in the US.

==Uses==
Titanite is a source of titanium dioxide, TiO2, used in pigments.

As a gemstone, titanite is usually some shade of chartreuse, but can be brown or black. Hue depends on iron (Fe) content, with low Fe content causing green and yellow colours, and high Fe content causing brown or black hues. Zoning is typical in titanite. It is prized for its exceptional dispersive power (0.051, B to G interval) which exceeds that of diamond. Jewelry use of titanite is limited, both because the stone is uncommon in gem quality and is relatively soft.

Titanite can also be used as a U-Pb geochronometer, specifically in metamorphic terranes.

==In popular culture==
Titanite is commonly mentioned in the Dark Souls video game series as a material used to upgrade weapons and various other items.

<doc id="31092" wikidata="Q355217" url="?curid=31092" title="Time management">
<text>Time management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities—especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency and productivity.

Time management involves demands relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests and commitments. Using time effectively gives people more choices in managing activities. Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools and techniques, especially when accomplishing specific tasks, projects and goals complying with a due date.

Initially, the term time management encompassed only business and work activities, but eventually the term comprised personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in managing projects, as it determines the project completion time and scope.

== Cultural views of time management ==
Differences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a linear time view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America along with most Northern European countries, such as Germany, Switzerland and England. People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time. This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more monochronic, or preferring to do only one thing at a time. As a result, this focus on efficiency often leads to a culture of punctuality and a strong emphasis on meeting deadlines.

Another cultural time view is the multi-active time view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the better. This creates a sense of happiness. Multi-active cultures are &quot;polychronic&quot; or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy. In these cultures, people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations. In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last and instead focus on having high-quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.

A final cultural time view is a cyclical time view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence there is an unlimited amount of it. This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia, including Japan and China. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to focus on completing tasks correctly, thus most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have, before acting on their plans. Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage. Consequently, this awareness often leads to a greater emphasis on relationships and the quality of interactions over strict adherence to schedules.

==Neuropsychology==
Excessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.

==Setting priorities and goals==

These goals are recorded and may be broken down into a project, an action plan or a simple task list. For individual tasks or for goals, an importance rating may be established. Deadlines may be set and priorities assigned. This process results in a plan with a task list, schedule or calendar of activities. Authors may recommend daily, weekly, monthly or other planning periods, associated with different scope of planning or review. This is done in various ways, as follows:

===ABC analysis===
The ABC method for time management developed by Alan Lakein involves categorizing tasks into three labels: A, B, and C.

;A Tasks: These are the highest priority and most urgent tasks. They include work that must be completed promptly, such as projects with a deadline.
;B Tasks: These tasks are important but not necessarily associated with a specific deadline. They should be completed as soon as possible.
;C Tasks: These are the least important tasks. They can be done when time permits and don&#x27;t require immediate attention.

===Pareto analysis===
The Pareto principle is the idea that 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. Applied to productivity, it means that 80% of results can be achieved by doing 20% of tasks. If productivity is the aim of time management, then these tasks should be prioritized higher.

=== The Eisenhower Method ===
The &quot;Eisenhower Method&quot; or &quot;Eisenhower Principle&quot; is a method that utilizes the principles of importance and urgency to organize priorities and workload. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: &quot;I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.&quot; Eisenhower did not claim this insight for his own, but attributed it to an (unnamed) &quot;former college president.&quot;

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an &quot;Eisenhower Box&quot; or &quot;Eisenhower Decision Matrix&quot;). Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as follows.

# Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.
# Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done personally, e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.
# Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated, e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.
# Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped, e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.

==Implementation of goals==
A task list (also called a to-do list or &quot;things-to-do&quot;) is a list of tasks to be completed such as chores or steps toward completing a project. It is an inventory tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to memory.

Task lists are used in self-management, business management, project management and software development. It may involve more than one list.

When one of the items on a task list is accomplished, the task is checked or crossed off. The traditional method is to write these on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil, usually on a note pad or clip-board. Task lists can also have the form of paper or software checklists.

Writer Julie Morgenstern suggests &quot;do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts&quot; of time management that include:
* Map out everything that is important, by making a task list.
* Create &quot;an oasis of time&quot; for one to manage.
* Say &quot;No&quot;.
* Set priorities.
* Do not drop everything.
* Do not think a critical task will get done in one&#x27;s spare time.

Numerous digital equivalents are now available, including personal information management (PIM) applications, smartphone apps, and web-based task list applications, many of which are free.

=== Task list organization ===

Task lists are often diarized (notes written in a diary) and tiered (having rows of organized notes). The simplest tiered system includes a general to-do list (or task-holding file) to record all the tasks the person needs to accomplish and a daily to-do list which is created each day by transferring tasks from the general to-do list. An alternative is to create a &quot;not-to-do list&quot;, to avoid unnecessary tasks.

Task lists are often prioritized in the following ways.
* A daily list of things to do, numbered in the order of their importance and done in that order one at a time as daily time allows, is attributed to consultant Ivy Lee (1877–1934) as the most profitable advice received by Charles M. Schwab (1862–1939), president of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.
* An early advocate of &quot;ABC&quot; prioritization was Alan Lakein, in 1973. In his system &quot;A&quot; items were the most important (&quot;A-1&quot; the most important within that group), &quot;B&quot; next most important, &quot;C&quot; least important.
* A particular method of applying the &quot;ABC method&quot; assigns &quot;A&quot; to tasks to be done within a day, &quot;B&quot; a week, and &quot;C&quot; a month.
* To prioritize a daily task list, one either records the tasks in the order of highest priority, or assigns them a number after they are listed (&quot;1&quot; for highest priority, &quot;2&quot; for second highest priority, etc.) which indicates in which order to execute the tasks. The latter method is generally faster, allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly.
* Another way of prioritizing compulsory tasks (group A) is to put the most unpleasant one first. When it is done, the rest of the list feels easier. Groups B and C can benefit from the same idea, but instead of doing the first task (which is the most unpleasant) right away, it gives motivation to do other tasks from the list to avoid the first one.

Various writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following.
* Management of the list can take over from implementing it. This could be caused by procrastination by prolonging the planning activity. This is akin to analysis paralysis. As with any activity, there&#x27;s a point of diminishing returns.
* To remain flexible, a task system must allow for disaster. A company must be ready for a disaster. Even if it is a small disaster, if no one made time for this situation, it can metastasize, potentially causing damage to the company.
* To avoid getting stuck in a wasteful pattern, the task system should also include regular (monthly, semi-annual, and annual) planning and system-evaluation sessions, to weed out inefficiencies and ensure the user is headed in the direction he or she truly desires.
* If some time is not regularly spent on achieving long-range goals, the individual may get stuck in a perpetual holding pattern on short-term plans, like staying at a particular job much longer than originally planned.

=== Software applications ===

Many companies use time tracking software to track an employee&#x27;s working time, billable hours, etc., e.g. law practice management software.

Many software products for time management support multiple users. They allow the person to give tasks to other users and use the software for communication and to prioritize tasks.

Task-list applications may be thought of as lightweight personal information manager or project management software.

Modern task list applications may have built-in task hierarchy (tasks are composed of subtasks which again may contain subtasks), may support multiple methods of filtering and ordering the list of tasks, and may allow one to associate arbitrarily long notes for each task.

===Time management systems===

Time management systems often include a time clock or web-based application used to track an employee&#x27;s work hours. Time management systems give employers insights into their workforce, allowing them to see, plan and manage employees&#x27; time. Doing so allows employers to manage labor costs and increase productivity. A time management system automates processes, which eliminates paperwork and tedious tasks.

===GTD (Getting Things Done)===
The Getting Things Done method, created by David Allen, is to finish small tasks immediately and for large tasks to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they are easy to see and manage. &quot;The truth is, it takes more energy to keep something inside your head than outside,&quot; says Allen.

===Pomodoro===
Francesco Cirillo&#x27;s &quot;Pomodoro Technique&quot; was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992. The technique is the namesake of a Pomodoro (Italian for tomato) shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university. The &quot;Pomodoro&quot; is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros. Through experimentation involving various workgroups and mentoring activities, Cirillo determined the &quot;ideal Pomodoro&quot; to be 20–35 minutes long.

The Evolution of Time Management: From Task Organization to Self-Management

Over time, the concept of time management has changed from simple tools like checklists to more complex techniques that emphasize setting priorities and coordinating tasks with objectives and values. The third generation of time management places a strong emphasis on setting objectives, organizing each day, and ranking tasks according to importance. A fourth generation has emerged, focusing on self-management rather than just managing time. It highlights the importance of managing expectations, relationships, and results, distinguishing between urgent and important tasks. Effective time management involves using personalized tools that cater to individual needs and planning in weekly terms to prioritize goals and adapt to unexpected events. Success in today&#x27;s work environment depends on utilizing the right tools and strategies to achieve goals efficiently.

==Related concepts==

Time management is related to the following concepts.
*Return on time invested: Effective time management is essential for maximizing Return on Time Invested (ROTI). By prioritizing tasks and organizing schedules, individuals can ensure that time is allocated to activities yielding the highest value. 
* Project management: Time management can be considered to be a project management subset and is more commonly known as project planning and project scheduling. Time management has also been identified as one of the core functions identified in project management.
* Attention management relates to the management of cognitive resources, and in particular, the time that humans allocate their mind (and organize the minds of their employees) to conduct some activities.
* Timeblocking is a time management strategy that specifically advocates for allocating chunks of time to dedicated tasks in order to promote deeper focus and productivity.

<doc id="31098" wikidata="Q940536" url="?curid=31098" title="The Damned (band)">
<text>The Damned are an English rock band formed in London in 1976 by lead vocalist Dave Vanian, guitarist Brian James, bassist (and later guitarist) Captain Sensible and drummer Rat Scabies. They were the first punk band from the United Kingdom to release a single, &quot;New Rose&quot; (1976), release a studio album, &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; (1977) and tour the United States. Nine of the band&#x27;s singles charted on the UK Singles Chart Top 40.

The band briefly dissolved after &quot;Music for Pleasure&quot; (1977), the follow-up to their debut studio album, was critically dismissed. They quickly reformed without Brian James and released &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; (1979). In the 1980s, they released four studio albums: &quot;The Black Album&quot; (1980), &quot;Strawberries&quot; (1982), &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; (1985) and &quot;Anything&quot; (1986), which saw the band moving toward a gothic rock style. The latter two albums did not feature Sensible, who had left the band in 1984. In 1988, James and Sensible rejoined to play a series of reunion gigs, one of which was released the next year as the live album &quot;Final Damnation&quot; (1989). Their fast-driven punk rock has been cited for influencing and shaping the emergence of hardcore punk in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United Kingdom and the United States.

The Damned again reformed for a tour in 1991. In 1995, they released a new studio album, &quot;Not of This Earth&quot;, which was Scabies&#x27;s last with the band. This was followed by &quot;Grave Disorder&quot; (2001), &quot;So, Who&#x27;s Paranoid?&quot; (2008) and &quot;Evil Spirits&quot; (2018), their first studio album in the Official Charts top-10 list, landing at No. 7. Their most recent album, &quot;Darkadelic&quot;, was released in 2023 and also made it into the Official Charts top-10 list, landing at No. 9. Despite experiencing numerous lineup changes, the formation of Vanian, Sensible, keyboardist Monty Oxymoron, drummer Pinch and bassist Stu West had been together from 2004 until 2017, when West left the band and former bassist Paul Gray rejoined. In 2019, drummer Pinch left the band, and in February 2022 he was replaced by Will Taylor, who left in November 2023, when Scabies rejoined.

As one of the first gothic rock bands, the Damned, featuring lead singer Vanian&#x27;s baritone singing, dark lyrics and vampire-themed costume, were a major influence on the goth subculture.

==History==
===Formation and Stiff years (1976–1978)===
Prior to The Damned, Dave Vanian (David Lett), Captain Sensible (Raymond Burns) and Rat Scabies (Chris Millar) had been members of the band Masters of the Backside, which also included future Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde. Brian James (Brian Robertson) had been a member of London SS, a band that never played live but also included musicians who later found fame in the Clash and Generation X. Scabies knew James through a failed audition as the drummer for London SS. When they decided to start their own band, with James on guitar and Scabies on drums, they invited Sid Vicious, later of the Sex Pistols, and Dave Vanian to audition to be the singer. However, only Vanian appeared, and he was added to the band. Sensible became the band&#x27;s bassist, and the four called themselves the Damned. Chrissie Hynde would later write: &quot;Without me, they were probably the most musically accomplished punk outfit in town.&quot;

The Damned played their first show on 6 July 1976, supporting the Sex Pistols at the 100 Club. A lo-fi recording of the show was later released as &quot;Live at the 100 Club&quot; (2007). As part of London&#x27;s burgeoning punk scene, the Damned again played the club on 20 September for the 100 Club Punk Festival.

On 22 October, five weeks before the release of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, Stiff Records released the Damned&#x27;s first single &quot;New Rose&quot;, thus making them the first UK punk band to release a single. The single&#x27;s B-side was a fast-paced cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot;. &quot;New Rose&quot; was described by critic Ned Raggett as a &quot;deathless anthem of nuclear-strength romantic angst.&quot;

When the Sex Pistols released their single, they took the Damned, along with the Clash and Johnny Thunders&#x27; Heartbreakers, as openers for their December &quot;Anarchy Tour of the UK&quot;. Many of the tour dates were cancelled by organizers or local authorities, with only seven of approximately 20 scheduled shows taking place. The Damned were expelled from the tour before its end by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren.

The Damned released their debut studio album &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; on 18 February 1977. Produced by Nick Lowe, it was the first studio album released by a British punk band and included a new single, &quot;Neat Neat Neat&quot;. The band toured to promote the album, in March opening for T. Rex on their final tour before Marc Bolan&#x27;s death that September. Later that spring, they became the first British punk band to tour the United States. According to Brendan Mullen, founder of the Los Angeles club the Masque, their first tour of the U.S. found them favouring very fast tempos, helping to inspire the first wave of West Coast hardcore punk. Author Ian Winwood wrote, &quot;In terms of placing boots on the ground, it is The Damned who can be credited as having had the most influence on American punk rock.&quot;

That August, Lu Edmonds was added as a second guitarist. Although not yet obvious in their music, the band were heavily inspired by psychedelic rock. They unsuccessfully tried to recruit the reclusive Syd Barrett to produce their second studio album. They settled for his former Pink Floyd bandmate Nick Mason. In November 1977, the album was released as &quot;Music for Pleasure&quot; and was quickly dismissed by critics. Its failure precipitated the band&#x27;s exit from Stiff Records. Scabies was also displeased with the album and quit the band after the recording. He was replaced by future Culture Club drummer Jon Moss, who played with the Damned until they dissolved in February 1978.

===Reformation and &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; (1978–1979)===
The former members of the band worked on a series of brief side projects and solo recordings, all making little commercial impact. Scabies formed a one-off band called &quot;Les Punks&quot; for a late 1978 gig. Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of the Damned (without Brian James or Edmonds) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist Lemmy of Hawkwind and Motörhead. The Damned tentatively reformed with the &quot;Les Punks&quot; lineup in early 1979, but originally performed as &quot;The Doomed&quot; to avoid potential trademark problems. Sensible switched to guitar and keyboards, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances and a slightly longer period with Henry Badowski on bass, the bassist position was filled by Algy Ward, formerly of the Saints. During a December 1978 tour of Scotland, Gary Holton substituted for Vanian.

The band officially went by the Damned again, playing their first gig under that name in April 1979 and signing a recording contract with Chiswick Records. They returned to the studio and released the charting singles &quot;Love Song&quot; and &quot;Smash It Up&quot;, followed by 1979&#x27;s &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; and then a cover version of Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;White Rabbit&quot;. Vanian&#x27;s vocals had by now expanded from the high baritone of the early records to a smoother crooning style.

&quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; (1979) featured a strong 1960s garage-rock influence with a Farfisa organ on several songs. Recording at London&#x27;s Wessex Studios at the same time as the Clash were there to record &quot;London Calling&quot; (1979), Joe Strummer and Mick Jones made an uncredited vocal appearance on the title track. &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; (1979) received largely positive reviews; Ira Robbins and Jay Pattyn of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; described it as &quot;a great record by a band many had already counted out.&quot;

===Shift towards gothic rock (1980–1987)===
Ward left the band in 1980, to be replaced by Paul Gray, formerly of Eddie and the Hot Rods. &quot;The Black Album&quot; was released later that year, produced by the band themselves apart from one track produced by Hans Zimmer, with three sides of the double album consisting of studio tracks, including the theatrical 17-minute song &quot;Curtain Call&quot;. Side 4 featured a selection of live tracks recorded at Shepperton Studios. It was their last album for Chiswick.

In 1981, the Damned released &quot;Friday 13th&quot;, a four-song EP that featured the original tracks &quot;Disco Man&quot;, &quot;Billy Bad Breaks&quot;, &quot;Limit Club&quot; and a cover version of the Rolling Stones song &quot;Citadel&quot;.

In 1982, the Damned released their only studio album for Bronze Records, &quot;Strawberries&quot;. The band had now expanded to a quintet with the addition of full-time keyboardist Roman Jugg. At the time, Sensible was splitting his time between the Damned and his own solo career, having reached chart success in the UK with the 1982 number-one hit &quot;Happy Talk&quot;. The band&#x27;s next album, a one-off side project recorded without Sensible, was the soundtrack to an imaginary 1960s movie called &quot;Give Daddy the Knife, Cindy&quot;. For this limited-run album of 1960s cover songs, the band was billed as Naz Nomad and the Nightmares.

In 1984, the Damned performed on the BBC Two sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot; with their song &quot;Nasty&quot;, featuring new bassist Bryn Merrick (replacing Gray) and both Jugg and Sensible on guitar. Sensible played his last concert with the band at Brockwell Park before leaving to pursue his solo career.

From the earliest days of the band, Vanian had adopted a vampire-like appearance onstage, with chalk-white makeup and formal dress. With Sensible gone, Vanian&#x27;s image became more characteristic of the band as a whole. The Damned signed a recording contract with major label MCA Records, and the &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; album followed in July 1985, preceded by the UK No. 21 single &quot;Grimly Fiendish&quot;. Other hits from the same album were &quot;The Shadow of Love&quot; with a gloomy gothic sound, and the lighter &quot;Is It a Dream?&quot;.

In January 1986, the non-album single &quot;Eloise&quot;, a cover version of the 1968 hit by Barry Ryan, became a No. 3 chart success in the UK, the band&#x27;s highest chart placing to date.

&quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;&#x27;s December 1986 followup &quot;Anything&quot; was a commercial failure, although MCA included one of its tracks (&quot;In Dulce Decorum&quot;) on the &quot;Miami Vice II&quot; soundtrack release. The cover of Love&#x27;s &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; was also released as a single.

Late in 1987, the Damned began to work on a new studio album for MCA, but the output of these sessions remains unreleased as the record contract was dissolved. Two of the new songs (&quot;Gunning for Love&quot; and &quot;The Loveless and the Damned&quot;) were later rerecorded by the Dave Vanian and the Phantom Chords side project.

===Reunion and farewell tours (1988–89)=== 
In June 1988, James and Sensible rejoined the group temporarily for three live appearances, including a concert at the London Town and Country Club that was released the following year as the album &quot;Final Damnation&quot;. 

In June 1989, James and Sensible rejoined the group for two UK appearances billed as &quot;The Final Curtain&quot;. In July this lineup performed a farewell tour of the U.S. and in December they performed a further five UK gigs advertised as the &quot;We Really Must Be Going Now&quot; tour. 

===Second and third reformations (1990–1995)===
Although officially on hiatus, the Damned released &quot;Fun Factory&quot; a song which was recorded in 1982 with the Sensible/Vanian/Scabies/Gray lineup and intended to be released as a single at that time. However, the bankruptcy of their record company prevented the release of the song for nine years. The year&#x27;s second single, &quot;Prokofiev&quot;, was recorded by Scabies, Vanian and Brian James, and was sold on a 1991 reunion tour of the U.S.

In 1993, the band reformed with a new lineup featuring Scabies, Vanian, guitarists Kris Dollimore (formerly of the Godfathers), Alan Lee Shaw and bassist Moose Harris (formerly of New Model Army). Around this time, two prominent rock groups each covered a Damned song: Guns N&#x27; Roses recorded &quot;New Rose&quot; for their &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; 1993 album, while the Offspring covered &quot;Smash It Up&quot; for the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; soundtrack (1995). Both cover versions enjoyed major-label distribution and created more exposure to the Damned&#x27;s sound, sometimes to a younger audience unfamiliar with the group.

The reformed Damned toured regularly for about two years and released a new studio album, &quot;Not of This Earth&quot;, in November 1995, which was promoted with a series of long tours prior to its release. However, by the time when the album was released, the Damned had yet again split, partly as the result of legal battles; Vanian and Sensible accused Scabies of releasing &quot;Not of This Earth&quot; (1995) without proper authorization.

===Return of Captain Sensible and new lineup (1996–2003)===
Sensible rejoined Vanian in 1996 and yet another formation of the Damned appeared. This initially featured bassist Paul Gray, who was later replaced by Patricia Morrison, previously of Bags, the Gun Club and The Sisters of Mercy.

By February 1999, the Damned consisted of Vanian, Sensible, Morrison and new recruits Monty Oxymoron on keyboards and Spike T. Smith on drums. Smith later joined Morrissey&#x27;s live band and recommended that the Damned recruit Andy (Pinch) Pinching, a founding member of English Dogs, to replace him on drums. Garrie Dreadful, a recruit from Sensible&#x27;s solo band, had played drums from 1997 to 1999 before Smith&#x27;s arrival. In 2001, the band released the album &quot;Grave Disorder&quot; on Dexter Holland&#x27;s Nitro Records label and promoted it with continual touring. A spring tour of the U.S. was planned in 2002 supporting Rob Zombie. However, the band withdrew after a few shows. Sensible said that &quot;gothic punk was completely lost on the predominantly metal crowds.&quot; In the summer, the band played the Vans Warped Tour in the U.S.

===Lineup change, 40th anniversary, and new album (2004–2019)===

Morrison and Vanian married and had a daughter, Emily, born on 9 February 2004. Around this time, Morrison retired from performing with the band, although she remained involved with the Damned as their manager. Her replacement on bass was Stu West.

In 2006, the Damned released the single &quot;Little Miss Disaster&quot; and a live DVD &quot;MGE25&quot; documenting a 2004 Manchester concert celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; (1979). On 21 October 2006, BBC Radio 2 broadcast an hour-long documentary titled &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; concerning the recording of the Damned&#x27;s first single &quot;New Rose&quot; and the group&#x27;s place in the 1976 London punk scene. Featuring interviews with James, Sensible, Scabies, Glen Matlock, Don Letts and Chrissie Hynde, the programme discussed the bands and personalities around the scene, particularly the Anarchy in the U.K. tour.

On 28 October 2008, the Damned released their tenth studio album, &quot;So, Who&#x27;s Paranoid?&quot;, a digital release, followed by a physical release on the English Channel label on 10 November (UK) and 9 December (U.S.). To promote the album, the band appeared twice on American television, including a visit to &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;. The band undertook a 23-date UK tour to promote their new studio album, supported by Devilish Presley and Slicks Kitchen.

In November 2009, the band supported Motörhead on the UK leg of their world tour.

Continual touring occurred throughout the UK and Europe over the next few years. In 2012, the Damned played South America for the first time, with dates in São Paulo and Buenos Aires. They returned to the Rhythm Festival, one of only four headline acts to return over the festival&#x27;s seven-year history. In 2012, the Damned announced that they would return for 2013&#x27;s Rebellion Festival alongside the Exploited, the Casualties and others.

On 7 November 2014, Sensible and Vanian appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor&quot; podcast.

In 2015, the Damned were featured in a documentary by director Wes Orshoski titled &quot;The Damned: Don&#x27;t You Wish That We Were Dead&quot;. The documentary charts the history of the band against a backdrop of archival footage, new interviews and tour footage from 2011 to 2014.

After the release of the film on 12 September 2015, former bassist Bryn Merrick, who had played on &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; (1985) and &quot;Anything&quot; (1986), died of throat cancer. At the time of his death, he had been playing in a Ramones tribute band called Shamones.

In May 2016, the band played a 40th anniversary show at the Royal Albert Hall.

In the summer of 2017, &quot;Neat Neat Neat&quot; was prominently featured in the action film &quot;Baby Driver&quot; and its soundtrack. On 11 September 2017, the band announced that Stu West was leaving the band and that former bassist Paul Gray would be returning for the new studio album. &quot;Evil Spirits&quot;, the band&#x27;s eleventh album and first in ten years, was released on 13 April 2018. It peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart, their highest-ever chart position, topping their previous high of No. 11 in 1985 (&quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;). The album, which was largely crowdfunded through PledgeMusic, was recorded in November 2017 in New York City and was produced by Tony Visconti. The album was preceded by the first single, &quot;Standing on the Edge of Tomorrow&quot;, in January 2018 along with the singles &quot;Devil in Disguise&quot; and &quot;Look Left&quot; in March 2018 and &quot;Procrastination&quot; in April 2018.

On 23 May 2019, the Damned started a tour performing their third studio album, &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; (1979), which they had not played in full since its release. The tour included venues such as the House of Blues, Punk Rock Bowling and Music Festival and Rebellion Festival.

===Departure of Pinch, original lineup reunion, drummer changes, and Scabies&#x27; return (2019–present)===
On 25 October 2019, Pinch announced his departure after 20 years with the band. His last gig was the Damned&#x27;s show at the London Palladium on 27 October 2019.

On 21 October 2020, the Damned announced that in 2021 the original lineup of Vanian, Sensible, James and Scabies would play a series of shows. This would mark the first time in more than two decades that James and Scabies had played with Vanian and Sensible. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the postponement of the tour until 2022.

In February 2022, Pinch was replaced by drummer Will Taylor. In February 2023, the band&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Darkadelic&quot;, was announced and it was released on 28 April 2023. The album was preceded by the singles and music videos for &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; on 3 February 2023, &quot;Beware of the Clown&quot; on 10 March 2023 and &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Realise&quot; on 21 April 2023. All three music videos were directed by Martin Gooch.

Former bassist Algy Ward, who had played on &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot;, died on 17 May 2023. After leaving the Damned, Ward had formed the NWOBHM band Tank in 1980.

Will Taylor announced his departure as the Damned&#x27;s drummer in November 2023. Later that month, it was announced that original drummer Scabies had rejoined the band on a permanent basis.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-144 (; NATO reporting name: Charger) is a Soviet supersonic passenger airliner designed by Tupolev in operation from 1968 to 1999.

The Tu-144 was the world&#x27;s first commercial supersonic transport aircraft with its prototype&#x27;s maiden flight from Zhukovsky Airport on 31 December 1968, two months before the British-French Concorde. The Tu-144 was a product of the Tupolev Design Bureau, an OKB headed by aeronautics pioneer Aleksey Tupolev, and 16 aircraft were manufactured by the Voronezh Aircraft Production Association in Voronezh. The Tu-144 conducted 102 commercial flights, of which only 55 carried passengers, at an average service altitude of and cruised at a speed of around (Mach 2). The Tu-144 first went supersonic on 5 June 1969, four months before Concorde, and on 26 May 1970 became the world&#x27;s first commercial transport to exceed Mach 2.

Reliability and developmental issues restricted the viability of the Tu-144 for regular use; these factors, together with repercussions of the 1973 Paris Air Show Tu-144 crash, projections of high operating costs, and rising fuel prices and environmental concerns outside the Soviet Union, caused foreign customer interest to wane. The Tu-144 was introduced into commercial service with Aeroflot between Moscow and Alma-Ata on 26 December 1975 and starting 1 November 1977 passenger flights began; it was withdrawn less than seven months later after a new Tu-144 variant crash-landed during a test flight on 23 May 1978. The Tu-144 remained in commercial service as a cargo aircraft until the cancellation of the Tu-144 program in 1983. The Tu-144 was later used by the Soviet space program to train pilots of the Buran spacecraft, and by NASA for supersonic research until 1999. The Tu-144 made its final flight on 26 June 1999 and surviving aircraft were put on display in Russia, the former Soviet Union and Germany, or into storage.

==Background==

Given the vast size of the Soviet Union, supersonic travel was seen as economically feasible, especially for government employees travelling between Moscow and Siberian cities. Flying was the only practical alternative to week-long rail journeys, and supersonic transport could significantly cut travel times. While the idea of SSTs was controversial in the West due to noise and environmental pollution concerns, the Soviet Union planned to continue with their development, largely for its long Siberian and Central Asian routes. With ample airspace, flight corridors were likely to avoid built-up areas. Even if international landing rights were not granted, the Tu-144 could still be used for domestic and regional flights.

Aeroflot, the flag carrier of the Soviet Union, had an extensive network of interconnected airfields and increasing international reach, with hopes of extending flights to Sydney, Australia. Initial estimates suggested that 20 Tu-144s would suffice for Aeroflot&#x27;s domestic and international needs.

Given the geopolitical climate during the Cold War period, the Soviet Union was intent on not just matching, but surpassing Western advancements, particularly in aerospace technology. The idea of the West getting ahead and leaving the Soviet Union behind was unthinkable. The directive from Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union at that time, was clear: not only prevent the West from getting ahead, but also compete fiercely, even to the extent of leapfrogging their technological advancements, if necessary.
The aircraft was seen as a formidable challenge to the United States&#x27; dominance in the field of civil aviation.

==Development==


The Soviet government published the concept of the Tu-144 in an article in the January 1962 issue of the magazine &quot;Technology of Air Transport&quot;. The air ministry started development of the Tu-144 on 26 July 1963, 10 days after the design was approved by the Council of Ministers. The plan called for five flying prototypes to be built in four years, with the first aircraft to be ready in 1966.

Despite the similarity in appearance of the Tu-144 to the Anglo-French supersonic aircraft (which earned it the nickname &quot;Concordski&quot;), there were significant differences between the two aircraft. The Tu-144 is bigger and faster than the Concorde (M2.15 vs. M2.04). Concorde used an electronic engine control package from Lucas, which Tupolev was not permitted to purchase for the Tu-144 as it could also be used on military aircraft. Concorde&#x27;s designers used fuel as coolant for the cabin air conditioning and for the hydraulic system (see Concorde for details). Tupolev also used fuel/hydraulic heat exchangers, but used cooling turbines for the cabin air.

The Tu-144 prototype was a full-scale demonstrator aircraft with the very different production aircraft being developed in parallel. The MiG-21I (1968; Izdeliye 21–11; &quot;Analog&quot;) I = Imitator (&quot;Simulator&quot;) was a testbed for the wing design of the Tu-144 but came too late to provide inputs for the first prototype. The findings of the MiG-21I led to the completely redesigned wing of the following aircraft. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144&#x27;s wing lacked Concorde&#x27;s conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including spanwise and chordwise camber.

They also added two small retractable surfaces called a moustache canard, with fixed double-slotted leading-edge slats and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.

Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift, but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to .

==Design==
Along with early Tu-134s, the Tu-144 was one of the last commercial aircraft with a braking parachute. The Tu-144 was not fitted with any reverse thrust capabilities, and so the parachute was used as the sole alternative. A prototype without passenger seats was fitted with ejection seats for pilots.

;Materials:
The aircraft was designed for a 30,000-hour service life over 15 years. Airframe heating and the high temperature properties of the primary structural materials, which were aluminium alloys, set the maximum speed at Mach 2.2. 15% by weight was titanium and 23% non-metallic materials. Titanium or stainless steel were used for the leading edges, elevons, rudder and the rear fuselage engine-exhaust heat shield.

===Engines===

SSTs for M2.2 had been designed in the Soviet Union before Tupolev was tasked with developing one. Design studies for the Myasishchev SST had shown that a cruise specific fuel consumption (SFC) of not more than 1.2 kg/kgp hr would be required. The only engine available in time with the required thrust and suitable for testing and perfecting the aircraft was the afterburning Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofan with a cruise SFC of 1.58 kg/kgp hr. Development of an alternative engine to meet the SFC requirement, a non-afterburning turbojet, the Kolesov RD-36-51A, began in 1964. It took a long time for this engine to achieve acceptable SFC and reliability. In the meantime the NK-144 high SFC gave a limited range of about , far less than Concorde. A maximum speed of (Mach 2.35) was reached with afterburning. Afterburners were added to Concorde to meet its take-off thrust requirement and were not necessary for supersonic cruise; the Tu-144 used maximum afterburner for take-off and minimum for cruise.

The Tu-144S, of which nine were produced, was fitted with the Kuznetsov NK-144A turbofan to address lack of take-off thrust and surge margin. SFC at M2.0 was 1.81 kg/kgp hr. A further improvement, the NK-144V, achieved the required SFC, but too late to influence the decision to use the Kolesov RD-36-51.

The Tu-144D, of which five were produced (plus one uncompleted), was powered by the Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet with an SFC of 1.22 kg/kgp hr. The range with full payload increased to 5,330 km compared to 6,470 km for Concorde. Plans for an aircraft with a range in excess of range were never implemented.

The engine intakes had variable intake ramps and bypass flaps with positions controlled automatically to suit the engine airflow. They were very long to help prevent surging; twice as long as those on Concorde. Jean Rech (Sud Aviation) states the need for excessive length was based on the misconception that length was required to attenuate intake distortion. The intakes were to be shortened by 10 feet on the projected Tu-144M.

The Kolesov RD-36-51 had an unusual translating plug nozzle as an alternative to a variable con-di nozzle, either of which give the variable area ratio required for the range of nozzle pressures which come from low inlet ram at low speeds to high at Mach 2. A plug nozzle was studied for Concorde but rejected as it was not certain that it could be cooled adequately during afterburner operation. The RD-36-51 had no afterburner.

===Airframe===
The aircraft was assembled from parts machined from large slabs, many over long and wide. While at the time, this approach was heralded as an advanced feature of the design, it turned out that finished parts contained defects which had not been detected in the raw material. Cracks formed at the defects at load levels below that which the part was expected to withstand. Once a crack started to grow, it spread quickly over many metres, with no crack-arresting design feature to stop it. In 1976, during repeat-load and static testing at TsAGI (Russia&#x27;s &quot;Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute&quot;), a Tu-144S airframe cracked at 70% of the design flight load with cracks running many metres in both directions from their origin.

Two Tu-144S airframes suffered structural failures during laboratory testing just prior to the Tu-144 entering passenger service. The problem, discovered in 1976, may have been known prior to this testing; a large crack was discovered in the airframe of the prototype Tu-144 (aircraft 68001) during a stopover in Warsaw following its appearance at the 1971 Paris Air Show. Polish sources say the crack was discovered after the aircraft made an emergency landing due to the failure of both left-hand engines; however, an Aeroflot spokesperson denied the damage and disputed the circumstances of the landing.

Later the same year, a test airframe was subjected to a test simulating the temperatures and pressures occurring during a flight. High skin temperatures of were caused by kinetic heating when the boundary layer air reached during cruise. The Tu-144 was placed in an environmental chamber and heated to simulate the skin getting hot quickly, during acceleration to cruising speed, while the underlying structure took a while to reach its equilibrium temperature. This thermal effect caused internal stresses and the situation was reversed while slowing down and descending. The pressure in the cabin, which caused additional stresses, was changed at the same time as the skin heating to simulate climbing to cruise altitude and then descending. Repeatedly cycling the temperature and pressure, as happened with the aircraft in service, caused fatigue damage and the airframe failed in a similar way to that of the TsAGI load testing.

According to , an aerospace aluminium and beryllium alloys expert, the Tu-144 design allowed a higher incidence of defects in the alloy structure, leading to the fatal in-air breakup of the aircraft in the 1973 Paris Air Show Tu-144 crash. This conclusion was supported by some of the designers involved in the aircraft&#x27;s development. Vadim Razumikhin wrote that the load factor experienced by the plane at the moment of the break-up was less than the design limit. If the stress tests had been conducted earlier, the disaster may have been averted. Eventually, the airframe was strengthened and the control system was modified to prevent overstressing the aircraft.

==Flight testing==
Tu-144 suffered from a rush in the design process to the detriment of thoroughness and quality. According to Concorde technical flight manager Brian Calvert, &quot;the rush to get [Tu-144] airborne exacted a heavy penalty later&quot;. Concorde&#x27;s first flight was originally scheduled for February 1968, but was pushed back several times until March 1969 in order to iron out problems and test components more thoroughly. The rush is apparent even in outward timing: the 1963 government decree launching the Tu-144 programme defined that the Tu-144 should fly in 1968; it first flew on the last day of 1968 (31 December) to fulfill government goals set five years earlier.

==Production==
Sixteen airworthy Tu-144 airplanes were built:
* the prototype Tu-144, registration number 68001
* a pre-production Tu-144, number 77101
* nine production Tu-144S, numbers 77102 to 77110
* five Tu-144D models, numbers 77111 to 77115.
Although its last commercial passenger flight was in 1978, production of the Tu-144 did not cease until 1983, when construction of the final airframe was stopped and left partially complete. The last production aircraft, Tu-144D number 77116, was not completed and was left derelict for many years on Voronezh East airfield. There was at least one ground test airframe for static testing in parallel with the development of prototype 68001.

==Operational history==
===Entry into service===
The introduction of the Tu-144 into passenger service was timed to the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution, as was duly noted in Soviet officials&#x27; speeches delivered at the airport before the inaugural flight – whether the aircraft was actually ready for passenger service was deemed of secondary importance. Even the outward details of the inaugural Tu-144 flight betrayed the haste of its introduction into service: several ceiling panels were ajar, service trays stuck, window shades dropped without being pulled, reading lights did not work, not all toilets worked and a broken ramp delayed departure half an hour. On arrival to Alma-Ata, the Tu-144 was towed back and forth for 25 minutes to align it correctly with the exit ramp. Flight testing time logged on the prototype (68001) was 180 hours; flight testing time until the completion of state acceptance tests was 1509 hours, followed with 835 hours of flight time of service tests until the commencement of passenger service.

The Tu-144S went into service on 26 December 1975, flying mail and freight between Moscow and Alma-Ata in preparation for passenger services, which commenced on 1 November 1977. The type certificate was issued by the USSR Gosaviaregister on 29 October 1977.

The passenger service ran a semi-scheduled service until the first Tu-144D experienced an in-flight failure during a pre-delivery test flight, crash-landing on 23 May 1978 with two crew fatalities. The Tu-144&#x27;s 55th and last scheduled passenger flight occurred on 1 June 1978.

An Aeroflot freight-only service recommenced using the new production variant &quot;Tu-144D&quot; (&quot;D&quot; for &quot;Dal&#x27;nyaya&quot; – &quot;long range&quot;) aircraft on 23 June 1979, including longer routes from Moscow to Khabarovsk made possible by the more efficient Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet engines, which also increased the maximum cruising speed to Mach 2.15.

There were only 103 scheduled flights before the Tu-144 was removed from commercial service.

===Early flights===
During 102 flights and 181 hours of freight and passenger flight time, the Tu-144S suffered more than 226 failures; 80 of them occurred in flight and 80 of them were severe enough to affect the flight schedule. The most frequent sources of trouble were the flight instruments, navigation gear, radios, and autopilot.

After the inaugural flight, two subsequent flights during the next two weeks were cancelled and the third flight rescheduled. The official reason given by Aeroflot for cancellation was bad weather at Alma-Ata; however when the journalist called the Aeroflot office in Alma-Ata about local weather, the office said that the weather there was perfect and one aircraft had already arrived that morning. Subsequent and significant documented Tu-144 failures included insufficient cabin pressurisation in flight on 27 December 1977, a landing gear switch fault on 29 January 1978 that indicated that the gear was lowered when it was in fact retracted, and engine-exhaust duct overheating causing the flight to be aborted and returned to the takeoff airport on 14 March 1978. Additionally, a metal fatigue problem was discovered in the tip of the aircraft&#x27;s vertical stabilizer; this was mitigated by adding a titanium doubler plate.

Aleksey Tupolev, Tu-144 chief designer, and two USSR vice-ministers (of aviation industry and of civil aviation) had to be personally present at Domodedovo airport before each scheduled Tu-144 departure to review the condition of the aircraft and make a joint decision on whether it could be released into flight. Subsequently, flight cancellations became less common, as several Tu-144s were docked at Moscow&#x27;s Domodedovo International Airport.

====Incident on 25 January 1978====
Tu-144 pilot Aleksandr Larin remembers a troublesome flight around 25 January 1978. The flight with passengers suffered the failure of 22 to 24 onboard systems. Seven to eight systems failed before takeoff, but given the large number of foreign TV and radio journalists and also other foreign notables aboard the flight, it was decided to proceed with the flight to avoid the embarrassment of cancellation. After takeoff, failures continued to multiply. While the aircraft was supersonic en route to the destination airport, Tupolev bureau&#x27;s crisis centre predicted that the front and left landing gear would not extend and that the aircraft would have to land on the right gear alone, at a landing speed of over . Due to expected political fallout, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was personally notified of what was going on in the air. With the accumulated failures, an alarm siren went off immediately after takeoff, with sound and volume similar to that of a civil defence warning. The crew could not figure a way to switch it off so the siren stayed on throughout the remaining 75 minutes of the flight. Eventually, the captain ordered the navigator to borrow a pillow from the passengers and stuff it inside the siren&#x27;s horn. After all the suspense, all landing gear extended and the aircraft landed.

A subsequent flight of Tu-144 on around 30 May 1978, not long before the type was withdrawn from passenger service, involved valve failure on one of the fuel tanks.

===Cabin noise===
A problem for passengers was the very high noise level inside the cabin, measuring at least 90–95 dB on average. The noise came from the engines; unlike Concorde, it could only sustain supersonic speeds using afterburners continuously. In addition, the active heat insulation system used for the air conditioning, which used the flow of spent cabin air, was described as excessively noisy. Passengers seated next to each other could have a conversation only with difficulty, and those seated two seats apart could not hear each other even when screaming and had to pass hand-written notes instead. Noise in the rear of the cabin was described as unbearable.

===Later use===

The Tu-144 programme was cancelled by a Soviet government decree on 1 July 1983 that also provided for future use of the remaining Tu-144 aircraft as airborne laboratories. In 1985, Tu-144D were used to train pilots for the Soviet Buran space shuttle. In 1986–1988 Tu-144D No. 77114, built in 1981, was used for medical and biological research of high-altitude atmosphere radiological conditions. Further research was planned but not completed, due to lack of funding.

===Use by NASA===
In the early 1990s, Judith de Paul, and her company IBP Aerospace brokered an agreement with Tupolev, NASA, Rockwell and later Boeing. They offered a Tu-144 as a testbed for NASA&#x27;s High Speed Commercial Research program, which was intended to design a second-generation supersonic jetliner called the High Speed Civil Transport. In 1995, Tu-144D No. 77114 (with only 82.5 hours of flight time) was taken out of storage and after extensive modification at a cost of US$350million, designated the &quot;Tu-144LL&quot; (where LL is a Russian abbreviation for Flying Laboratory, , &quot;Letayushchaya Laboratoriya&quot;). The aircraft made 27 flights in Russia during 1996 and 1997. Though regarded as a technical success, the project was cancelled for lack of funding in 1999.

This aircraft was reportedly sold in 2001 online, but the aircraft sale did not proceed. Tejavia Systems, the company handling the transaction, reported that the deal was not signed as the replacement Kuznetsov NK-321 engines also used in a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber were military hardware and the Russian government would not allow them to be exported.

In 2003, after the retirement of Concorde, there was renewed interest from several wealthy individuals who wanted to use the Tu-144LL for a transatlantic record attempt, despite the high cost of a flight readiness overhaul even if military authorities would authorize the use of NK-321 engines outside Russian Federation airspace.

==Reasons for failure and cancellation==

===Limited routes===
Only one commercial route, Moscow to Alma-Ata (now Almaty), was ever used and flights were limited to one a week, despite there being eight Tu-144S certified aircraft available and a number of other routes suitable for supersonic flights, suggesting that the Aeroflot decision-makers had little confidence in the Tu-144 commercial viability when passenger service began in 1977.

===Failure to acquire Western technology===

In the late 1970s, Soviet insiders were intensely hopeful in conversations with Western counterparts of reintroducing Tu-144 passenger service for the 1980 Moscow Olympic games, even perhaps for flights to Western Europe, given the aircraft&#x27;s high visibility, but apparently the technical condition of the aircraft weighed against such re-introduction even for token flights.

There were unprecedented Soviet requests for Western technological aid with the development of the Tu-144. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 air intakes. (The design of air intakes&#x27; variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (a.k.a. water deflectors or &quot;mud flaps&quot; that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers. Soviet approaches were also reported in British tabloids at the time, such as the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;.

===Compressor disc and other failures===
On 31 August 1980, Tu-144D (77113) suffered an uncontained compressor disc failure in supersonic flight which damaged part of the airframe structure and systems. The crew was able to perform an emergency landing at Engels-2 strategic bomber base.

On 12 November 1981, a Tu-144D&#x27;s RD-36-51 engine was destroyed during bench tests, leading to a temporary suspension of all Tu-144D flights. It became the final blow, which resulted in the cancellation of the project by the Ministry of Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

One of the Tu-144Ds (77114, a.k.a. aircraft 101) suffered a crack across the bottom panel of its wing.

===Economic inefficiency===
Global trends facilitated the transition of jet transportation from a luxury available only to the elite, to a widespread form of mass transportation. Although the 1973 oil crisis did not directly impact decision-making processes within the Soviet Union, the expansion of Soviet air travel in the late 1970s made the supply of aviation fuel a growth constraint, and it was obvious that potential Western buyers were heavily dissuaded by high fuel prices. By the late 1970s, Soviet promotional efforts shifted to the Ilyushin Il-86, a more economically efficient jumbo jet that went on to become the country&#x27;s flagship airliner. Moon notes that in 1976, Aeroflot was promoting the Il-86 over the Tu-144, despite the latter&#x27;s incipient and long-awaited entry into service.

G.A. Cheryomukhin, an aerodynamics engineer who took part in the design and certification of Tu-144, wrote that the Ministry of Civil Aviation was concerned that the continuation and expansion of the SST&#x27;s operation would have forced the Ministry to make significant long-term investments.

Moon concluded that economic efficiency alone would not have doomed the Tu-144 altogether; continuation of token flights for reasons of political prestige would have been possible, if only the aircraft itself would have allowed for it, but it did not. The Tu-144 was to a large extent intended to be, and trumpeted as, a symbol of Soviet technological prestige and superiority.

===Tupolev design bureau and rivalry with Ilyushin===
Fridlyander and Moon point out that by the early 1970s, Tupolev&#x27;s bureau had to work on other projects, including the Tu-154 and Tu-204 passenger aircraft, and the Tu-22M and Tu-160 bombers. Despite large and high-priority resource investment in the Tu-144 development programme and the fact that a large part of the whole Soviet R&amp;D infrastructure was subordinated to the Tu-144 project, parallel project development overwhelmed the bureau causing it to lose focus and make design errors.

Alexander Poukhov, one of the Tu-144 design engineers who subsequently rose to be one of the bureau&#x27;s senior designers, estimated in 1998 that the Tu-144 project was 10–15 years beyond the USSR&#x27;s capabilities at that time.

Moon suggests that Tupolev&#x27;s difficulties in developing the Tu-144, together with a need to prioritize bomber development, prompted Soviet leaders to shift airliner development to the rival Ilyushin design bureau, which had recently introduced the successful Il-76 military transport and was developing the Il-86 to move much larger numbers of passengers at a much lower per-seat cost than the Tu-144. Moon contrasts the Ilyushin bureau&#x27;s careful advance research into operating costs and its marketing surveys of Aeroflot customers with the &quot;technocratic futurism&quot; embodied by the Tu-144, suggesting that Soviet leaders recognized that the Il-86 better addressed real-world transportation needs in the Soviet Union and elsewhere.

==Cessation of Tu-144D production==
The decision to cease Tu-144D production was issued on 7 January 1982, followed by a USSR government decree dated 1 July 1983 to cease the whole Tu-144 programme and to use produced Tu-144 aircraft as flying laboratories.

===Soviet leadership failure===
Howard Moon, who authored &quot;Soviet SST&quot; in 1989, attributed the downfall of the ostensibly promising Tu-144 programme to the Soviet leadership&#x27;s decision to leverage it as a political weapon against the West. He regarded the programme as both an &quot;astounding achievement&quot; and a &quot;magnificent failure&quot;.

The rushed introduction to service of poorly tested aircraft happened previously with another Tupolev project that had high political visibility and prestige: the Tu-104 passenger jet-liner was the first successful Soviet passenger jet in service. In a decision-making similar to the Tu-144-story, the Soviet government introduced the Tu-104 into passenger service before satisfactory stability and controllability had been achieved. During high-altitude and high-speed flight the aircraft was prone to longitudinal instability, and also at high altitudes, it had a narrow range of angle of attack separating the aircraft from stalls known as coffin corner. These problems created the preconditions for spin dives, that happened twice before the Tu-104 was eventually properly tested and the problem was resolved.

===Personal factors===
, a notable Soviet aircraft designer, considered the primary reason for ending the Soviet Supersonic Transport project to be the personal factor—the role of the Chief Designer, who failed to show due courage and defend his Bureau&#x27;s brainchild following the tragic event near Yegoryevsk. &quot;Cowardice and progress are incompatible,&quot; Selyakov sternly summarized.

G.A. Cheryomukhin identified several major &quot;blows&quot; to the Tu-144 project. The first three were the death of Andrei Tupolev in 1972, the disaster at the Air Show in 1973, and the death of the active and authoritative Minister of the USSR&#x27;s Aviation Industry (1907–1977). Dementyev had been at the helm of the domestic aviation industry for many years and was one of the champions of the SST program. The fourth blow came with Aleksey Tupolev&#x27;s direction on 30 May 1978, to cancel the SST flight and temporarily halt aircraft operations. Cheryomukhin bitterly noted, &quot;...our own leader – A.A. Tupolev – personally stopped the operation of the Tu-144, depriving the world of a source of evidence of the rationality of supersonic flight over land...&quot;

==After project cancellation==
After ceasing the Tu-144 programme, Tu-144D No. 77114 (aircraft 101 or 08-2) carried out test flights between the 13–20 July 1983 to establish 13 world records registered with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).
 These records established an altitude of with a range of loads up to 30 tonnes, and a sustained speed of over a closed circuit of up to with similar loads.

To put the numbers in perspective, Concorde&#x27;s service ceiling under a typical Transatlantic flight payload of 10 tonnes is , and this is higher than the record set by the Tu-144D. According to unverified sources, during a 26 March 1974 test flight a Concorde reached its maximum speed ever of (Mach 2.23) at an altitude of , and during subsequent test flights reached maximum altitude of .

Concorde was originally designed for cruising speeds up to Mach 2.2, but its regular service speed was limited to Mach 2.02 to extend airframe life. One of Tupolev&#x27;s web site pages states that &quot;TU-144 and TU-160 aircraft operation has demonstrated expediency of limitation of cruise supersonic speed of M=2.0 to provide structure service life and to limit cruising altitude&quot;.

===Proposed military versions===

Early configurations of the Tu-144 were based on the unbuilt Tupolev Tu-135 bomber, retaining the latter aircraft&#x27;s canard layout, wings and nacelles. Deriving from the Tu-135 bomber, Tupolev&#x27;s early design for supersonic passenger airplane was code-named Tu-135P before acquiring the Tu-144 project code.

Over the course of the Tu-144 project, the Tupolev bureau created designs of a number of military versions of Tu-144 but none were ever built. In the early 1970s, Tupolev was developing the Tu-144R intended to carry and air-launch up to three solid-fueled ICBMs. The launch was to be performed from within Soviet air space, with the aircraft accelerating to its maximum speed before releasing the missiles. The original design was based on the Tu-144S, but later changed to be derived from the Tu-144D. Another version of the design was to carry air-launched long-range cruise missiles similar to the Kh-55. The study of this version envisioned the use of liquid hydrogen for the afterburners.

In the late 1970s, Tupolev contemplated the development of a long-range heavy interceptor (DP-2) based on the Tu-144D also able to escort bombers on long-range missions. Later this project evolved into an aircraft for electronic countermeasures (ECM) to suppress enemy radars and facilitate bomber&#x27;s penetration through enemy air defenses (Tu-144PP). In the early 1980s this functionality was supplanted with theatre and strategic reconnaissance (Tu-144PR).

The dimmer civil prospects for Tu-144 were becoming apparent the more Tupolev tried to &quot;sell&quot; the aircraft to the military. One of the last attempts to sell a military version of the Tu-144 was the Tu-144MR, a project for a long-range reconnaissance aircraft for the Soviet Navy intended to provide targeting information to the Navy&#x27;s ships and submarines on sea and oceanic theaters of operations. Another proposed navy version was to have a strike capability (two Kh-45 air-to-surface cruise missiles), along with a reconnaissance function. The Tu-144MR was also to have served as a carrier aircraft for the Tupolev Voron reconnaissance drone, designed to compete with the Lockheed D-21 and influenced by it, but the project never materialised.

The military was unreceptive to Tupolev&#x27;s approaches. Vasily Reshetnikov, the commander of Soviet Long-Range Aviation and subsequently, a vice-commander of the Soviet Air Force, remembers how, in 1972, he was dismayed by Tupolev&#x27;s attempts to offer for military use the aircraft that &quot;fell short of its performance target, was beset by reliability problems, fuel-thirsty and difficult to operate&quot;.

Reshetnikov goes on to remember:
The development and construction of the supersonic airliner, the future Tu-144, was included in the five-year plan and was under the auspices of the influential D.F. Ustinov (then Soviet minister of defence and confidant of Brezhnev, who represented interests of defence industries lobby in opposition to the military) who regarded this mission as a personal responsibility – not so much to his country and people as to &quot;dear Leonid Il&#x27;ych&quot; (Brezhnev) whom he literally worshipped, sometimes to the point of shamelessness... Yet the supersonic passenger jet was apparently not making headway and, to the dismay of its curator, it looked as though Brezhnev might be disappointed. It was then that Dmitry Fedorovich (Ustinov) jumped at someone&#x27;s idea to foist Aeroflot&#x27;s &quot;bride in search of a wedding&quot; on the military. After it had been rejected in bomber guise, Ustinov used the Military Industrial Commission (one of the most influential Soviet government bodies) to promote the aircraft to the Strategic Aviation as a reconnaissance or ECM platform, or both. It was clear to me that these aircraft could not possibly work in concert with any bomber or missile carrier formation; likewise I could not imagine them operating solo as &quot;Flying Dutchmen&quot; in a war scenario, therefore I resolutely turned down the offer.

Naval Aviation Commander Aleksandr Alekseyevich Mironenko, followed suit:

Ustinov could not be put off that easily. He managed to persuade the Navy C-in-C (admiral) S.G. Gorshkov who agreed to accept the Tu-144 for Naval Aviation service as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft without consulting anyone on the matter. Mironenko rebelled against this decision, but the commander-in-chief would not hear of heed – the issue is decided, period. On learning of this I was extremely alarmed: if Mironenko had been pressured into taking the Tu-144, this meant I was going to be next. I made a phone call to Aleksandr Alekseyevich, urging him to take radical measures; I needn&#x27;t have called because even without my urging Mironenko was giving his C-in-C a hard time. Finally Ustinov got wind of the mutiny and summoned Mironenko to his office. They had a long and heated discussion but eventually Mironenko succeeded in proving that Ustinov&#x27;s ideas were unfounded. That was the last time we heard of Tu-144.

==Aircraft on display==

While several Tu-144s were donated to museums in Moscow Monino, Samara and Ulyanovsk, at least two Tu-144D remained in open storage in Moscow Zhukovsky.

As of June 2010, two aircraft (tail numbers СССР-77114 and СССР-77115) are located outdoors at Gromov Flight Research Institute, Zhukovsky (at coordinates and ). Previously, they were displayed at MAKS Airshows. Tail number 77115 was bought in 2005 by the Heros Club of Zhukovsky and still on display at MAKS as of 2019. In 2019, tail number 77114 was repainted in Aeroflot livery and put on display in front of the Gromov Flight Research institute main gate.

A Tu-144S, registration СССР-77106, is on display at Central Air Force Museum of Russia in Monino. Its maiden flight was on 4 March 1975, the final one on 29 February 1980. The aircraft was used to assess the effectiveness of the air-conditioning systems and to solve some problems on the fuel system. It can be considered the first production aircraft, being the first to be equipped for commercial use and delivered to Aeroflot. The first operational flight was on 26 December 1975 between Moscow and Alma-Ata carrying cargo and mail.

Another Tu-144, tail number СССР-77107, is on open display in Kazan and located at . The aircraft was constructed in 1975 and was a production model intended for passenger use. However, it was only used during test flights. On 29 March 1976 it made its last flight to Kazan. This aircraft was put on sale on eBay in 2017.

TU-144S, tail number СССР-77108, is on display in the museum of Samara State Aerospace University (). It made its maiden flight on 12 December 1975, and its final flight on 27 August 1987. Development works on navigation system were made in this aircraft as well as flight-director approach.

TU-144S, tail number СССР-77110, is on display at the Ulyanovsk Aircraft Museum in Ulyanovsk. Maiden flight occurred on 14 February 1977, the final Flight on 1 June 1984. This aircraft was the second of the two aircraft used for regular passengers&#x27; flights on Moscow – Alma-Ata route. In 1977 it flew to Paris to take part in the XXXII Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport. This was the last appearance of a Tu-144 in West Europe.
СССР-77110 was the last aircraft produced of the model Tu-144S, powered with Kuznetsov NK-144A engines.
In the first half of 2008 the cabin was open for visits and between August and September was restored and painted in the original Aeroflot livery.

The only Tu-144 on display outside the former Soviet Union, tail number СССР-77112, was acquired by the Auto &amp; Technikmuseum Sinsheim in Germany, where it was shipped – not flown – in 2001 and where it now stands, in its original Aeroflot livery, on display next to an Air France Concorde. As of 2017, the Technikmuseum Sinsheim remains the only museum in the world where the Tu-144 and Concorde are on display together.

==Incidents and accidents==

===Paris Air Show crash===

At the Paris Air Show on 3 June 1973, the development program of the Tu-144 suffered severely when the first &quot;Tu-144S&quot; production airliner (reg 77102) crashed.

At the end of the officially approved demonstration flight, which was an exact repeat of the previous day&#x27;s display, instead of landing as expected, the aircraft entered a very steep climb before making a violent downwards manoeuvre. As it tried to recover, the aircraft broke apart and crashed, destroying 15 houses and killing all six people on board the Tu-144 and eight more on the ground.

Gordon et al. state that the flight crew had departed from the approved flight profile for the display. They were under instructions to outperform the Concorde display by all means. During the unapproved, and therefore unrehearsed manoeuvres, the stability and control augmentation system was not operating. If it had been, it would have prevented the loads that caused the port wing to fail.

A popular Soviet theory for the crash was that the Tu-144 tried to avoid a French Mirage chase-plane that was attempting to photograph its canards, which were very advanced for the time, and that the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other to cover up such details. The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in industrial espionage. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Soviet crew was not told about the Mirage&#x27;s flight), though not its role in the crash. The official press release did state: &quot;though the inquiry established that there was no real risk of collision between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised&quot;.

===Yegoryevsk crash===

On 23 May 1978, the Tu-144 supersonic passenger jet was to make a test flight before delivery to Aeroflot. At an altitude of 3,000 m, a fire started at the APU located in the port wing. A turn was made to return to the airport and both engines located in the right wing (engines no. 3 and 4) were shut down and the aircraft began to lose altitude. Fire trailed the aircraft and the cockpit filled with smoke. Subsequently, the no. 1 (outer left) engine failed. Six minutes after the fire started, the crew managed to belly-land the aircraft in a field near Yegoryevsk. On impact, the nose cone collapsed under the fuselage, penetrating the compartment in which two flight engineers were seated, killing both.
It was later determined that, 27 minutes prior to the ignition, a fuel line had ruptured, causing eight tons of fuel to leak into several compartments on the right wing. The fuel readings were judged incorrect by the flight engineers and thus were not reported to the commander. In addition to the two flight engineers killed on impact, six other crewmembers were injured. The Tu-144 was withdrawn from passenger service soon afterward, though a 2019 post-mortem by CNN reported that it was already &quot;on its way out&quot; before then.

<doc id="31105" wikidata="Q490481" url="?curid=31105" title="Turing (programming language)">
<text>Turing is a high-level, general purpose programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, at University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada. It was designed to help students taking their first computer science course learn how to code. Turing is a descendant of Pascal, Euclid, and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics.

Turing 4.1.0 is the latest stable version. Versions 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 do not emit stand alone .exe files. Versions pre-4.1.0 have outdated syntax and functions.

==Overview==
Named after British computer scientist Alan Turing, Turing is used mainly as a teaching language at the high school and university level. Two other versions exist, Object-Oriented Turing and Turing+, a systems programming variant. In September 2001, &quot;Object Oriented Turing&quot; was renamed &quot;Turing&quot; and the original Turing was renamed &quot;Classic Turing&quot;. Turing is now unsupported by Holt Software Associates in Toronto, Ontario. Turing was widely used in high schools in Ontario as an introduction to programming.

On November 28, 2007, Turing, which was previously a commercial programming language, became freeware, available to download from the developer&#x27;s website free of charge for personal, commercial, and educational use.&lt;ref name=&quot;holtsoft/old_index&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The makers of Turing, Holt Software Associates, have since ceased operations, and Turing has seen no further development since November 25, 2007.

==Syntax==
Turing is designed to have a very lightweight, readable, intuitive syntax. Here is the entire &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program in Turing with syntax highlighting:

 put &quot;Hello World!&quot;

Turing avoids semicolons and braces, using explicit end markers for most language constructs instead, and allows declarations anywhere. Here is a complete program defining and using the traditional recursive function to calculate a factorial.

 % Accepts a number and calculates its factorial
 function factorial (n: int) : real
 if n = 0 then
 result 1
 else
 result n * factorial (n - 1)
 end if
 end factorial
 var n: int
 loop
 put &quot;Please input an integer: &quot; ..
 get n
 exit when n &gt;= 0
 put &quot;Input must be a non-negative integer.&quot;
 end loop
 put &quot;The factorial of &quot;, n, &quot; is &quot;, factorial (n)

==Open implementations==

Currently, there are two open source alternative implementations of Turing: Open Turing, an open source version of the original interpreter, and TPlus, a native compiler for the concurrent system programming language variant Turing+. OpenT, a project to develop a Turing compiler, was discontinued.

===Open Turing===

Open Turing is an open-source implementation of the original Turing interpreter for Windows written by Tristan Hume. It includes speed improvements, new features such as OpenGL 3D and a new code editor. It is fully backwards compatible with the closed-source implementation.

===TPlus===
TPlus is an open-source implementation of original (non-Object-Oriented) Turing with systems programming extensions developed at the University of Toronto and ported to Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X at Queen&#x27;s University in the late 1990s. TPlus implements Turing+ (Turing Plus), a concurrent systems programming language based on the original Turing programming language. Some, but not all, of the features of Turing Plus were eventually subsumed into the present Object-Oriented Turing language. Turing Plus extends original Turing with processes, monitors (as specified by C.A.R. Hoare), and language constructs needed for system programming such as binary input-output, separate compiling, variables at absolute addresses, type converters and other features.

== Turing+ ==
Turing+ (Turing Plus) is a concurrent systems programming language based on the Turing programming language designed by James Cordy and Ric Holt, then at the University of Toronto, Canada, in 1987. Some, but not all, of the features of Turing+ were eventually subsumed into Object-Oriented Turing. Turing+ extended original Turing with processes and monitors (as specified by C.A.R. Hoare) as well as language constructs needed for systems programming such as binary input-output, separate compiling, variables at absolute addresses, type converters, and other features.

Turing+ was explicitly designed to replace Concurrent Euclid in systems-programming applications. The TUNIS operating system, originally written in Concurrent Euclid, was recoded to Turing+ in its MiniTunis implementation. Turing+ has been used to implement several production software systems, including the language TXL.

== Object-Oriented Turing ==
Object-Oriented Turing is an extension of the Turing programming language and a replacement for Turing Plus created by Ric Holt of the University of Toronto, Canada, in 1991. It is imperative, object-oriented, and concurrent. It has modules, classes, single inheritance, processes, exception handling, and optional machine-dependent programming.

There is an integrated development environment under the X Window System and a demo version. Versions exist for Sun-4, MIPS, RS-6000, NeXTSTEP, Windows 95, and others.

<doc id="31106" wikidata="Q20140" url="?curid=31106" title="Trackball">
<text>A trackball is a pointing device consisting of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball about two axes—like an upside-down ball mouse with an exposed protruding ball. Users roll the ball to position the on-screen pointer, using their thumb, fingers, or the palm of the hand, while using the fingertips to press the buttons.

With most trackballs, operators have to lift their finger, thumb or hand and reposition in on the ball to continue rolling, whereas a mouse would have to be lifted itself and re-positioned. Some trackballs have notably low friction, as well as being made of a dense material such as phenolic resin, so they can be spun to make them coast. The trackball&#x27;s buttons may be in similar positions to those of a mouse, or configured to suit the user.

Large trackballs are common on CAD workstations for easy precision. Before the advent of the touchpad, small trackballs were common on portable computers (such as the BlackBerry Tour) where there may be no desk space on which to run a mouse. Some small &quot;thumballs&quot; are designed to clip onto the side of the keyboard and have integral buttons with the same function as mouse buttons.

== History ==
The trackball was invented as part of a post-World War II-era radar plotting system named Comprehensive Display System (CDS) by Ralph Benjamin when working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service. Benjamin&#x27;s project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick. Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented a &quot;ball tracker&quot; system called the &quot;roller ball&quot; for this purpose in 1946. The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built and the device was kept as a military secret. Production versions of the CDS used joysticks.

The CDS system had also been viewed by a number of engineers from Ferranti Canada, who returned to Canada and began development of the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s DATAR system in 1952. Principal designers Tom Cranston, Fred Longstaff and Kenyon Taylor chose the trackball as the primary input, using a standard five-pin bowling ball as the roller. DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin&#x27;s display, but used a digital computer to calculate tracks, and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals.

DATAR&#x27;s trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several additional rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined.

Since 1966, the American company &quot;Orbit Instrument Corporation&quot; produced a device named &quot;X-Y Ball Tracker&quot;, a trackball, which was embedded into radar flight control desks.

A similar trackball device at the German &#x27; was constructed by a team around of Telefunken as part of the development for the Telefunken computer infrastructure around the main frame , process computer TR 86 and video terminal SIG 100-86, which began in 1965. This trackball was called &#x27; (German for &quot;rolling ball&quot;). Somewhat later, the idea of &quot;reversing&quot; this device led to the introduction of the first computer ball mouse (still named &quot;&quot;, model RKS 100-86), which was offered as an alternative input device to light pens and trackballs for Telefunken&#x27;s computer systems since 1968.

In later trackball models the electrical contacts were replaced by an optical chopper wheel, which had small slots cut into it in rather than electrical contacts. With an LED for illumination from one side and an optical sensor on the other, rotation of the wheel periodically blocks and unblocks the light, so the sensor produces electrical pulses to indicate that rotation is occurring.

Mice used the same basic system for determining motion, but had the problem that the ball was in contact with the desk or mousepad. In order to provide smooth motion the balls were often covered with an anti-slip surface treatment, which was, by design, sticky. Rolling the mouse tended to pick up any dirt and drag it into the system where it would clog the chopper wheels, demanding cleanup. In contrast the trackball is in contact only with the user&#x27;s hand, which tends to be cleaner. In the late 1990s both mice and trackballs began using direct optical tracking which follows dots on the ball, avoiding the need for anti-slip surface treatment.

As with modern mice, most trackballs now have an auxiliary device primarily intended for scrolling. Some have a scroll wheel like most mice, but the most common type is a “scroll ring” which is spun around the ball. Kensington&#x27;s SlimBlade Trackball similarly tracks the ball itself in three dimensions for scrolling.

 and into the 2020s, two major companies developed and produce consumer trackballs, Logitech and Kensington, although Logitech has narrowed its product line to two models. Other smaller companies occasionally offer a trackball in their product line. Microsoft produced popular models including The Microsoft Trackball Explorer, but has since discontinued all of its products.

In September 2017 Logitech announced release of MX-Ergo Mouse, which was released after 6 years of its last trackball mouse.

== Special applications ==

Large trackballs are sometimes seen on computerized special-purpose workstations, such as the radar consoles in an air-traffic control room or sonar equipment on a ship or submarine. Modern installations of such equipment may use mice instead, since most people now already know how to use one. However, military mobile anti-aircraft radars, commercial airliners (such as Airbus A380 and Airbus A350) and submarine sonars tend to continue using trackballs, since they can be made more durable and more fit for fast emergency use. Large and well made ones allow easier high precision work, for which reason they may still be used in these applications (where they are often called &quot;tracker balls&quot;) and in computer-aided design.

Trackballs have appeared in video games, particularly early arcade games (see a &quot;List of trackball arcade games&quot;). In March 1978, Sega released &quot;World Cup&quot;, an association football game with trackball controls. In October 1978, Atari released &quot;Atari Football&quot;, which popularized the use of a trackball, with the game&#x27;s developers mentioning it was inspired by an earlier Japanese association football game. Other notable trackball games include Atari&#x27;s &quot;Centipede&quot; and &quot;Missile Command&quot; – Atari trademarked it &quot;TRAK-BALL&quot;.

Console trackballs, now fairly rare, were common in the early 1980s: the Atari 2600 and 5200 consoles, as well as the competing ColecoVision console, though using a joystick as their standard controller, each had one as an optional peripheral. The Apple Pippin, a console introduced in 1996, had a trackball built into its gamepad as standard. Trackballs were occasionally used in e-sports prior to the mainstreaming of optical mice in the early 2000s because they were more reliable than ball mice, but now they are extremely rare because optical mice offer superior speed and precision. Trackballs remain in use in pub golf machines (such as Golden Tee) to simulate swinging the club.

Trackballs have also been regarded as excellent complements to analog joysticks, as pioneered by the Assassin 3D, a trackball released in 1996 with joystick pass-through capability. Later in 1996, Mad Catz released the Panther XL, which was based on the Assassin 3D. This combination provides for two-hand aiming and a high accuracy and consistency replacement for the traditional mouse and keyboard combo generally used on first-person shooter games. Many such games natively support joysticks and analog player movement, like Valve&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot; and id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot; series. , one professional eSport player was known for using a trackball.

Trackballs are provided as the pointing device in some public internet access terminals. Unlike a mouse, a trackball can easily be built into a console, and cannot be ripped away or easily vandalized. Two examples are the Internet browsing consoles provided in some UK McDonald&#x27;s outlets, and the BT Broadband Internet public phone boxes. This simplicity and ruggedness also makes them ideal for use in industrial computers.

Because trackballs for personal computers are stationary, they may require less space for operation than a mouse, simplifying use in confined or cluttered areas such as a small desk or a rack-mounted terminal. They are generally preferred in laboratory setting for the same reason.

Trackballs were often included in laptop computers, but since the late 1990s these have been replaced by touchpads and pointing sticks. Trackballs are still used as separate input devices with standard desktop computers, but this application is also moving to touchpads due to the prevalence of multi touch gesture control in new desktop operating systems.

== Ergonomics ==
People with a mobility impairment use trackballs as an assistive technology input device. Access to an alternative pointing device has become even more important for them with the dominance of graphically-oriented operating systems. There are many alternative systems to be considered. The control surface of a trackball is easier to manipulate and the buttons can be activated without affecting the pointer position.

Trackball users also often state that they are not limited to using the device on a flat desk surface. Trackballs can be used whilst browsing a laptop in bed, or wirelessly from an armchair to a PC playing a movie. They are also useful for computing on boats or other unstable platforms where a rolling deck could produce undesirable input.

Trackballs are generally either thumb-operated, with a ball about an inch in diameter or smaller moved by one digit (almost always the thumb) and the buttons clicked by others, or finger-operated, with a ball over two inches in diameter operated by the middle fingers and the buttons by the thumb and little finger. Users favor one format or another for reasons of comfort, mobility, precision, or because it reduces strain on one part of the hand/wrist. Most, but not all, finger-operated designs are symmetrical in design, making them usable by both hands, while thumb-operated designs are by their nature asymmetric or “handed,” allowing the smallest examples to be held in the air. Thumb-operated trackballs are not generally available in left-handed configurations, due to small demand.

Some computer users prefer a trackball over the more common mouse for ergonomic reasons. There seems to be no conclusive evidence from studies performed to determine which type of pointing device works best for most applications. Application users are encouraged to test different devices, and to maintain proper posture and scheduled breaks for comfort. Some disabled users find trackballs easier since they only have to move their thumb relative to their hand, instead of moving the whole hand, while others incur unacceptable fatigue of the thumb. Elderly people sometimes have difficulty holding a mouse still while double-clicking; the trackball allows them to let go of the ball while using the button.

At times when a user is browsing menus or websites rather than typing, it is also possible to hold a trackball in the right hand like a television remote control, operating the ball with the right thumb and pressing the buttons with the left thumb, thus giving the fingers a rest.

== Mobile devices ==
Some mobile devices have trackballs, including those in the BlackBerry range, the T-Mobile Sidekick 3, and many early HTC smartphones. These miniature trackballs are made to fit within the thickness of a mobile device, and are controlled by the tip of a finger or thumb. These have mostly been replaced on smartphones by touch screens, although on the BlackBerry range they were replaced by an &quot;optical trackball&quot; or &quot;optical trackpad&quot; before later being replaced with touch screens.

== On mice ==
In lieu of a scroll wheel, some mice include a tiny trackball sometimes called a scroll ball. A popular example is Apple&#x27;s Mighty Mouse. Mice with a larger trackball on a side may be designed to stay stationary, using the trackball to move the mouse cursor instead of moving the mouse.

<doc id="31109" wikidata="Q751913" url="?curid=31109" title="Tape drive">
<text>A tape drive is a data storage device that reads and writes data on a magnetic tape. Magnetic-tape data storage is typically used for offline, archival data storage. Tape media generally has a favorable unit cost and long archival stability.

A tape drive provides sequential access storage, unlike a hard disk drive, which provides direct access storage. A disk drive can move to any position on the disk in a few milliseconds, but a tape drive must physically wind tape between reels to read any one particular piece of data. As a result, tape drives have very large average access times. However, tape drives can stream data very quickly off a tape when the required position has been reached. For example, Linear Tape-Open (LTO) supports continuous data transfer rates of up to 360 MB/s, a rate comparable to hard disk drives.

== Design ==

Magnetic-tape drives with capacities of less than one megabyte were first used for data storage on mainframe computers in the 1950s. , capacities of 20 terabytes or higher of uncompressed data per cartridge were available.

In early computer systems, magnetic tape served as the main storage medium because although the drives were expensive, the tapes were inexpensive. Some computer systems ran the operating system on tape drives such as DECtape. DECtape had fixed-size indexed blocks that could be rewritten without disturbing other blocks, so DECtape could be used like a slow disk drive.

Data tape drives may use advanced data integrity techniques such as multilevel forward error correction, shingling, and linear serpentine layout for writing data to tape.

Tape drives can be connected to a computer with SCSI, Fibre Channel, SATA, USB, FireWire, FICON, or other interfaces. Tape drives are used with autoloaders and tape libraries which automatically load, unload, and store multiple tapes, increasing the volume of data that can be stored without manual intervention.

In the early days of home computing, floppy and hard disk drives were very expensive. Many computers had an interface to store data via an audio tape recorder, typically on Compact Cassettes. Simple dedicated tape drives, such as the professional DECtape and the home ZX Microdrive and Rotronics Wafadrive, were also designed for inexpensive data storage. However, the drop in disk drive prices made such alternatives obsolete.

=== Data compression ===
As some data can be compressed to a smaller size than the original files, it has become commonplace when marketing tape drives to state the capacity with the assumption of a 2:1 compression ratio; thus a tape with a capacity of 80 GB would be sold as &quot;80/160&quot;. The true storage capacity is also known as the native capacity or the raw capacity. The compression ratio actually achievable depends on the data being compressed. Some data has little redundancy; large video files, for example, already use compression and cannot be compressed further. A database with repetitive entries, on the other hand, may allow compression ratios better than 10:1.

=== Technical limitations ===

A disadvantageous effect termed occurs during read/write if the data transfer rate falls below the minimum threshold at which the tape drive heads were designed to transfer data to or from a continuously running tape. In this situation, the modern fast-running tape drive is unable to stop the tape instantly. Instead, the drive must decelerate and stop the tape, rewind it a short distance, restart it, position back to the point at which streaming stopped and then resume the operation. If the condition repeats, the resulting back-and-forth tape motion resembles that of shining shoes with a cloth. Shoe-shining decreases the attainable data transfer rate, drive and tape life, and tape capacity.

In early tape drives, non-continuous data transfer was normal and unavoidable. Computer processing power and available memory were usually insufficient to provide a constant stream, so tape drives were typically designed for &quot;start-stop&quot; operation. Early drives used very large spools, which necessarily had high inertia and did not start and stop moving easily. To provide high start, stop and seek performance, several feet of loose tape was played out and pulled by a suction fan down into two deep open channels on either side of the tape head and capstans. The long thin loops of tape hanging in these &quot;vacuum columns&quot; had far less inertia than the two reels and could be rapidly started, stopped and repositioned. The large reels would move as required to keep the slack tape in the vacuum columns.

Later, most tape drives of the 1980s introduced the use of an internal data buffer to somewhat reduce start-stop situations. These drives are often referred to as &quot;tape streamers&quot;. The tape was stopped only when the buffer contained no data to be written, or when it was full of data during reading. As faster tape drives became available, despite being buffered, the drives started to suffer from the shoe-shining sequence of stop, rewind, start.

Some newer drives have several speeds and implement algorithms that dynamically match the tape speed level to the computer&#x27;s data rate. Example speed levels could be 50 percent, 75 percent and 100 percent of full speed. A computer that streams data slower than the lowest speed level (e.g., at 49 percent) will still cause shoe-shining.

== Media ==

Magnetic tape is commonly housed in a casing such as a cassette or cartridge—for example, the 4-track cartridge and the Compact Cassette. The cassette contains magnetic tape to provide different audio content using the same player. The outer shell, made of plastic, sometimes with metal plates and parts, permits ease of handling of the fragile tape, making it far more convenient and robust than having spools of exposed tape. Simple analog cassette audio tape recorders were commonly used for data storage and distribution on home computers at a time when floppy disk drives were very expensive. The Commodore Datasette was a dedicated data version using the same media.

== History ==


== Capacity ==
Manufacturers often specify the capacity of tapes using data compression techniques; compressibility varies for different data (commonly 2:1 to 8:1), and the specified capacity may not be attained for some types of real data. , tape drives capable of higher capacity were still being developed.

In 2011, Fujifilm and IBM announced that they had been able to record 29.5 billion bits per square inch with magnetic-tape media developed using Barium Ferrite (BaFe) particles and nanotechnologies, allowing drives with true (uncompressed) tape capacity of 35 TB. The technology was not expected to be commercially available for at least a decade.

In 2014, Sony and IBM announced that they had been able to record 148 billion bits per square inch with magnetic tape media developed using a new vacuum thin-film forming technology able to form extremely fine crystal particles, allowing true tape capacity of 185 TB.

On December 15, 2020, Fujifilm and IBM announced a Strontium Ferrite (SrFe) technology able, in theory, to store 580 TB per tape cartridge.

<doc id="31112" wikidata="Q12142" url="?curid=31112" title="Tesseract">
<text>In geometry, a tesseract or 4-cube is a four-dimensional hypercube, analogous to a two-dimensional square and a three-dimensional cube. Just as the perimeter of the square consists of four edges and the surface of the cube consists of six square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of eight cubical cells, meeting at right angles. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes.

The tesseract is also called an 8-cell, C8, (regular) octachoron, or cubic prism. It is the four-dimensional measure polytope, taken as a unit for hypervolume. Coxeter labels it the polytope. The term &quot;hypercube&quot; without a dimension reference is frequently treated as a synonym for this specific polytope.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces the word &quot;tesseract&quot; to Charles Howard Hinton&#x27;s 1888 book &quot;A New Era of Thought&quot;. The term derives from the Greek ( &#x27;four&#x27;) and ( &#x27;ray&#x27;), referring to the four edges from each vertex to other vertices. Hinton originally spelled the word as &quot;tessaract&quot;.

== Geometry ==
As a regular polytope with three cubes folded together around every edge, it has Schläfli symbol {4,3,3} with hyperoctahedral symmetry of order 384. Constructed as a 4D hyperprism made of two parallel cubes, it can be named as a composite Schläfli symbol {4,3} × { }, with symmetry order 96. As a 4-4 duoprism, a Cartesian product of two squares, it can be named by a composite Schläfli symbol {4}×{4}, with symmetry order 64. As an orthotope it can be represented by composite Schläfli symbol { } × { } × { } × { } or { }4, with symmetry order 16.

Since each vertex of a tesseract is adjacent to four edges, the vertex figure of the tesseract is a regular tetrahedron. The dual polytope of the tesseract is the 16-cell with Schläfli symbol {3,3,4}, with which it can be combined to form the compound of tesseract and 16-cell.

Each edge of a regular tesseract is of the same length. This is of interest when using tesseracts as the basis for a network topology to link multiple processors in parallel computing: the distance between two nodes is at most 4 and there are many different paths to allow weight balancing.

A tesseract is bounded by eight three-dimensional hyperplanes. Each pair of non-parallel hyperplanes intersects to form 24 square faces. Three cubes and three squares intersect at each edge. There are four cubes, six squares, and four edges meeting at every vertex. All in all, a tesseract consists of 8 cubes, 24 squares, 32 edges, and 16 vertices.

===Coordinates===

A &quot;unit tesseract&quot; has side length , and is typically taken as the basic unit for hypervolume in 4-dimensional space. &quot;The&quot; unit tesseract in a Cartesian coordinate system for 4-dimensional space has two opposite vertices at coordinates and , and other vertices with coordinates at all possible combinations of s and s. It is the Cartesian product of the closed unit interval in each axis.

Sometimes a unit tesseract is centered at the origin, so that its coordinates are the more symmetrical formula_1 This is the Cartesian product of the closed interval formula_2 in each axis.

Another commonly convenient tesseract is the Cartesian product of the closed interval in each axis, with vertices at coordinates . This tesseract has side length 2 and hypervolume .

===Net===
An unfolding of a polytope is called a net. There are 261 distinct nets of the tesseract. The unfoldings of the tesseract can be counted by mapping the nets to &quot;paired trees&quot; (a tree together with a perfect matching in its complement).

===Construction===

The construction of hypercubes can be imagined the following way:
* 1-dimensional: Two points A and B can be connected to become a line, giving a new line segment AB.
* 2-dimensional: Two parallel line segments AB and CD separated by a distance of AB can be connected to become a square, with the corners marked as ABCD.
* 3-dimensional: Two parallel squares ABCD and EFGH separated by a distance of AB can be connected to become a cube, with the corners marked as ABCDEFGH.
* 4-dimensional: Two parallel cubes ABCDEFGH and IJKLMNOP separated by a distance of AB can be connected to become a tesseract, with the corners marked as ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP. However, this parallel positioning of two cubes such that their 8 corresponding pairs of vertices are each separated by a distance of AB can only be achieved in a space of 4 or more dimensions.
The 8 cells of the tesseract may be regarded (three different ways) as two interlocked rings of four cubes.

The tesseract can be decomposed into smaller 4-polytopes. It is the convex hull of the compound of two demitesseracts (16-cells). It can also be triangulated into 4-dimensional simplices (irregular 5-cells) that share their vertices with the tesseract. It is known that there are such triangulations and that the fewest 4-dimensional simplices in any of them is 16. 

The dissection of the tesseract into instances of its characteristic simplex (a particular orthoscheme with Coxeter diagram ) is the most basic direct construction of the tesseract possible. The characteristic 5-cell of the 4-cube is a fundamental region of the tesseract&#x27;s defining symmetry group, the group which generates the B4 polytopes. The tesseract&#x27;s characteristic simplex directly &quot;generates&quot; the tesseract through the actions of the group, by reflecting itself in its own bounding facets (its &quot;mirror walls&quot;).

=== Radial equilateral symmetry ===
The radius of a hypersphere circumscribed about a regular polytope is the distance from the polytope&#x27;s center to one of the vertices, and for the tesseract this radius is equal to its edge length; the diameter of the sphere, the length of the diagonal between opposite vertices of the tesseract, is twice the edge length. Only a few uniform polytopes have this property, including the four-dimensional tesseract and 24-cell, the three-dimensional cuboctahedron, and the two-dimensional hexagon. In particular, the tesseract is the only hypercube (other than a zero-dimensional point) that is &quot;radially equilateral&quot;. The longest vertex-to-vertex diagonal of an formula_3-dimensional hypercube of unit edge length is formula_4 which for the square is formula_5 for the cube is formula_6 and only for the tesseract is formula_7 edge lengths.

An axis-aligned tesseract inscribed in a unit-radius 3-sphere has vertices with coordinates formula_8

=== Properties ===

For a tesseract with side length :

* Hypervolume (4D): formula_9
* Surface &quot;volume&quot; (3D): formula_10
*Face diagonal: formula_11
*Cell diagonal: formula_12
*4-space diagonal: formula_13

=== As a configuration ===
This configuration matrix represents the tesseract. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, and cells. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole tesseract. The diagonal reduces to the f-vector (16,32,24,8).

The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column&#x27;s element occur in or at the row&#x27;s element. For example, the 2 in the first column of the second row indicates that there are 2 vertices in (i.e., at the extremes of) each edge; the 4 in the second column of the first row indicates that 4 edges meet at each vertex.

The bottom row defines they facets, here cubes, have f-vector (8,12,6). The next row left of diagonal is ridge elements (facet of cube), here a square, (4,4).

The upper row is the f-vector of the vertex figure, here tetrahedra, (4,6,4). The next row is vertex figure ridge, here a triangle, (3,3).

formula_14

==Projections==
It is possible to project tesseracts into three- and two-dimensional spaces, similarly to projecting a cube into two-dimensional space.

The &quot;cell-first&quot; parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has a cubical envelope. The nearest and farthest cells are projected onto the cube, and the remaining six cells are projected onto the six square faces of the cube.

The &quot;face-first&quot; parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has a cuboidal envelope. Two pairs of cells project to the upper and lower halves of this envelope, and the four remaining cells project to the side faces.

The &quot;edge-first&quot; parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has an envelope in the shape of a hexagonal prism. Six cells project onto rhombic prisms, which are laid out in the hexagonal prism in a way analogous to how the faces of the 3D cube project onto six rhombs in a hexagonal envelope under vertex-first projection. The two remaining cells project onto the prism bases.

The &quot;vertex-first&quot; parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has a rhombic dodecahedral envelope. Two vertices of the tesseract are projected to the origin. There are exactly two ways of dissecting a rhombic dodecahedron into four congruent rhombohedra, giving a total of eight possible rhombohedra, each a projected cube of the tesseract. This projection is also the one with maximal volume. One set of projection vectors are , , .






== Tessellation ==
The tesseract, like all hypercubes, tessellates Euclidean space. The self-dual tesseractic honeycomb consisting of 4 tesseracts around each face has Schläfli symbol {4,3,3,4}. Hence, the tesseract has a dihedral angle of 90°.

The tesseract&#x27;s radial equilateral symmetry makes its tessellation the unique regular body-centered cubic lattice of equal-sized spheres, in any number of dimensions.

== Related polytopes and honeycombs ==
The tesseract is 4th in a series of hypercube:
The tesseract (8-cell) is the third in the sequence of 6 convex regular 4-polytopes (in order of size and complexity).

As a uniform duoprism, the tesseract exists in a sequence of uniform duoprisms: {&quot;p&quot;}×{4}.

The regular tesseract, along with the 16-cell, exists in a set of 15 uniform 4-polytopes with the same symmetry. The tesseract {4,3,3} exists in a sequence of regular 4-polytopes and honeycombs, {&quot;p&quot;,3,3} with tetrahedral vertex figures, {3,3}. The tesseract is also in a sequence of regular 4-polytope and honeycombs, {4,3,&quot;p&quot;} with cubic cells.
The regular complex polytope 4{4}2, , in formula_15 has a real representation as a tesseract or 4-4 duoprism in 4-dimensional space. 4{4}2 has 16 vertices, and 8 4-edges. Its symmetry is 4[4]2, order 32. It also has a lower symmetry construction, , or 4{}×4{}, with symmetry 4[2]4, order 16. This is the symmetry if the red and blue 4-edges are considered distinct.

==In popular culture==
Since their discovery, four-dimensional hypercubes have been a popular theme in art, architecture, and science fiction. Notable examples include:

* &quot;And He Built a Crooked House&quot;, Robert Heinlein&#x27;s 1940 science fiction story featuring a building in the form of a four-dimensional hypercube. This and Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;The No-Sided Professor&quot;, published in 1946, are among the first in science fiction to introduce readers to the Moebius band, the Klein bottle, and the hypercube (tesseract).
* &quot;Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)&quot;, a 1954 oil painting by Salvador Dalí featuring a four-dimensional hypercube unfolded into a three-dimensional Latin cross.
* The Grande Arche, a monument and building near Paris, France, completed in 1989. According to the monument&#x27;s engineer, Erik Reitzel, the Grande Arche was designed to resemble the projection of a hypercube.
* &quot;Fez&quot;, a video game where one plays a character who can see beyond the two dimensions other characters can see, and must use this ability to solve platforming puzzles. Features &quot;Dot&quot;, a tesseract who helps the player navigate the world and tells how to use abilities, fitting the theme of seeing beyond human perception of known dimensional space.
The word &quot;tesseract&quot; has been adopted for numerous other uses in popular culture, including as a plot device in works of science fiction, often with little or no connection to the four-dimensional hypercube; see Tesseract (disambiguation).

<text>Richard Hell and the Voidoids were an American punk rock band, formed in New York City in 1976 and fronted by Richard Hell, a former member of the Neon Boys, Television and the Heartbreakers.

== History ==
Kentucky-born Richard Meyers moved to New York City after dropping out of high school in 1966, aspiring to become a poet. He and his best friend from high school, Tom Miller, founded the rock band the Neon Boys which became Television in 1973. The pair adopted stage names; Miller called himself Verlaine after Paul Verlaine, a French poet he admired, and Meyers became Richard Hell because, as he has said, it described his condition.

The group was the first rock band to play the club CBGB, which soon became a breeding ground for the early punk rock scene in New York. Hell had an energetic stage presence and wore torn clothing held together with safety pins and his hair spiked, which was to be influential in punk fashion. In 1975, after a failed management deal with the New York Dolls, impresario Malcolm McLaren claimed to have brought these ideas back with him to England and eventually incorporated them into the Sex Pistols&#x27; image, a claim which Sex Pistols&#x27; front man John Lydon/Johnny Rotten disputes, citing his own existing use of safety pins and spiked hair (dyed green) prior to joining the Pistols.

Disputes with Verlaine led to Hell&#x27;s departure from Television in April 1975, and he co-founded the Heartbreakers with New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders. Hell did not last long with this band, and he began recruiting members for a new band in early 1976. For guitarists, Hell found Robert Quine and Ivan Julian—Quine had worked in a bookstore with Hell, and Julian responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. They lifted drummer Marc Bell, later Marky Ramone, from Wayne County. The band was named &quot;the Voidoids&quot; after a novel Hell had been writing.

Musically, Hell drew inspiration from acts such as Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, protopunk band the Stooges and fellow New Yorker group the Velvet Underground, a group with a reputation for heroin-fueled rock and roll with poetic lyrics. Quine&#x27;s admiration of the Velvet Underground led him to make hours&#x27; worth of bootleg recordings of the band in the late 1960s. Hell also drew from—and covered—garage rock bands such as the Seeds and the Count Five that were found on the &quot;&quot; compilation of 1972. The Voidoids&#x27; music was also characterized as art punk.

Hell had written the song &quot;Blank Generation&quot; while still in Television; he had played it regularly with the band since at least 1975, and later with the Heartbreakers. The Voidoids released a 7&quot; &quot;Blank Generation&quot; EP in 1976 on Ork Records including &quot;Blank Generation&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;You Gotta Lose&quot;. The cover featured a black-and-white cover photo taken by Hell&#x27;s former girlfriend Roberta Bayley, depicting a bare-chested Hell with an open jeans zipper. It was an underground hit, and the band signed to Sire Records for its album debut.

Aside from the influential Quine, Julian and future Ramone Bell, at various times the band included Naux Maciel, Michael Allison, Jahn Xavier, former Contortions and Raybeats guitarist Jody Harris and Golden Palominos leader Anton Fier.

== Legacy ==
The Voidoids are considered to have pioneered the &quot;punk look&quot; and studded appearance which also became popular later on in the UK via the Sex Pistols. Lydon disputes the Voidoids influence on British punk appearance.

<doc id="31115" wikidata="Q14296" url="?curid=31115" title="Top-level domain">
<text>A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet after the root domain. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last non-empty label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is .com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the ICANN, an Internet multi-stakeholder community, which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.

==History==
Originally, the top-level domain space was organized into three main groups: &quot;Countries&quot;, &quot;Categories&quot;, and &quot;Multiorganizations&quot;. An additional &quot;temporary&quot; group consisted of only the initial DNS domain, .arpa, and was intended for transitional purposes toward the stabilization of the domain name system.

==Types==
 IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:
* Infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA): This group consists of one domain, the Address and Routing Parameter Area. It is managed by IANA on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force for various purposes specified in the Request for Comments publications.
* Generic top-level domains (gTLD): Top-level domains with three or more characters
* Generic restricted top-level domains (grTLD): These domains are managed under official ICANN-accredited registrars.
* Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD): These domains are proposed and sponsored by private agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility to use the TLD. Use is based on community theme concepts; these domains are managed under official ICANN accredited registrars.
* country-code top-level domains (ccTLD): Two-letter domains established for countries or territories. With some historical exceptions, the code for any territory is the same as its two-letter ISO 3166 code.
** Internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD): ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, or Chinese).
* Test top-level domains (tTLD): These domains were installed under .test for testing purposes in the IDN development process; these domains are not present in the root zone.

Countries are designated in the Domain Name System by their two-letter ISO country code; there are exceptions, however (e.g., .uk). This group of domains is, therefore, commonly known as country-code top-level domains (ccTLD). Since 2009, countries with non–Latin-based scripts may apply for internationalized country code top-level domain names, which are displayed in end-user applications in their language-native script or alphabet, but use a Punycode-translated ASCII domain name in the Domain Name System.

Generic top-level domains (formerly &quot;categories&quot;) initially consisted of .gov, .edu, .com, .mil, .org, and .net. More generic TLDs have been added, such as .info.

The authoritative list of current TLDs in the root zone is published at the IANA website at https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/.

==Internationalized country code TLDs==
An internationalized country code top-level domain (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end-user application, such as a web browser, in its language-native script or alphabet (such as the Arabic alphabet), or a non-alphabetic writing system (such as Chinese characters). IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.

ICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009, and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 scripts.

==Infrastructure domain==
The domain .arpa was the first Internet top-level domain. It was intended to be used only temporarily, aiding in the transition of traditional ARPANET host names to the domain name system. However, after it had been used for reverse DNS lookup, it was found impractical to retire it, and is used today exclusively for Internet infrastructure purposes such as in-addr.arpa for IPv4 and ip6.arpa for IPv6 reverse DNS resolution, uri.arpa and urn.arpa for the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System, and e164.arpa for telephone number mapping based on NAPTR DNS records. For historical reasons, .arpa is sometimes considered to be a generic top-level domain.
==Reserved domains==
A set of domain names is reserved by the Internet Engineering Task Force as special-use domain names. The practice originated in RFC 1597 for reserved address allocations in 1994 and reserved top-level domains in RFC 2606 of 1999, with additional reservations in later RFCs. These reserved names should not be used in production networks that utilize the global domain name system.
==Historical domains==
In the late 1980s, InterNIC created the .nato domain for use by NATO. NATO considered none of the then-existing TLDs as adequately reflecting their status as an international organization. Soon after this addition, however, InterNIC also created the .int TLD for the use by international organizations in general, and persuaded NATO to use the second level domain &quot;nato.int&quot; instead. The &quot;nato&quot; TLD, no longer used, was finally removed in July 1996.

Other historical TLDs are .cs for Czechoslovakia (now using .cz for Czech Republic and .sk for Slovakia), .dd for East Germany (using .de after reunification of Germany), .yu for SFR Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro (now using .ba for Bosnia and Herzegovina, .hr for Croatia, .me for Montenegro, .mk for North Macedonia, .rs for Serbia and .si for Slovenia), .zr for Zaire (now .cd for the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and .an for Netherlands Antilles (now .aw for Aruba, .cw for Curaçao and .sx for Sint Maarten). In contrast to these, the TLD .su has remained active despite the collapse of the Soviet Union that it represents. Under the chairmanship of Nigel Roberts, ICANN&#x27;s ccNSO is working on a policy for the retirement of ccTLDs that have been removed from ISO 3166.

==Proposed domains==
Around late 2000, ICANN discussed and finally introduced .aero, .biz, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, and .pro TLDs. Site owners argued that a similar TLD should be made available for adult and pornographic websites to settle the dispute of obscene content on the Internet, to address the responsibility of US service providers under the US Communications Decency Act of 1996. Several options were proposed including &quot;xxx&quot;, &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;adult&quot;. The .xxx top-level domain eventually went live in 2011.

An older proposal consisted of seven new gTLDs: arts, firm, .info, nom, rec, .shop, and .web. Later .biz, .info, .museum, and .name covered most of these old proposals.

During the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris in 2008, ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a &quot;significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains&quot;. This program envisioned the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well as a new application and implementation process. Observers believed that the new rules could result in hundreds of new gTLDs being registered.

On 13 June 2012, ICANN announced nearly 2,000 applications for top-level domains, which began installation throughout 2013. The first seven – &quot;bike&quot;, &quot;clothing&quot;, &quot;guru&quot;, &quot;holdings&quot;, &quot;plumbing&quot;, &quot;singles&quot;, and &quot;ventures&quot; – were released in 2014.

===Rejected domains===
ICANN rejected several proposed domains to include .home and .corp due to conflicts regarding gTLDs that are in use in internal networks.

Investigation into the conflicts was conducted at ICANN&#x27;s request by Interisle Consulting. The resulting report was to become known as the Name Collision issue, which was first reported at ICANN 47.

==Dotless domains==

Due to the structure of DNS, each node in the tree has its own collection of records, and since top-level domains are nodes in DNS, they have records of their own. For example, querying &quot;org&quot; itself (with a tool such as dig, host, or nslookup) returns information on its nameservers:

&quot;Dotless domains&quot; are top-level domains that take advantage of that fact, and implement A, AAAA or MX DNS records to serve webpages or allow incoming email directly on a TLD – for example, a webpage hosted on &quot;http://example/&quot;, or an email address &quot;user@example&quot;.

ICANN and IAB have spoken out against the practice, classifying it as a security risk among other concerns. ICANN&#x27;s Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) additionally claims that SMTP &quot;requires at least two labels in the FQDN of a mail address&quot; and, as such, mail servers would reject emails to addresses with dotless domains.

ICANN has also published a resolution in 2013 that prohibits the creation of dotless domains on gTLDs. ccTLDs, however, fall largely under their respective country&#x27;s jurisdiction, and not under ICANN&#x27;s. Because of this, there have been many examples of dotless domains on ccTLDs in spite of ICANN&#x27;s vocal opposition.

As of September 2023, that is the case of:

* Anguilla&#x27;s .ai, online at http://ai./ ()&lt;br&gt;It simply displays a notice that the website is no longer public.
* Uzbekistan&#x27;s .uz, online at https://uz./ ()&lt;br&gt;It&#x27;s a mirror of https://cctld.uz/, albeit with an invalid certificate.

Other ccTLDs with A or AAAA records, as of September 2023, include: .cm, .tk and .ws.

A similar query to &quot;org&quot;″s presented above can be made for &quot;ai&quot;, which shows A and MX records for the TLD:

Historically, many other ccTLDs have had A or AAAA records. On 3 September 2013, as reported by the IETF, they were the following: .ac, .dk, .gg, .io, .je, .kh, .sh, .tm, .to, and .vi.

===New TLDs===
Following a 2014 resolution by ICANN, newly registered TLDs must implement the following A, MX, TXT, and SRV apex DNS records – where codice_1 stands for the registered TLD – for at least 90 days:

This requirement is meant to avoid domain name collisions when new TLDs are registered. For example, programmers may have used custom local domains such as &quot;foo.bar&quot; or &quot;test.dev&quot;, which would both collide with the creation of gTLDs .bar in 2014 and .dev in 2019.

While this does create apex DNS records of type A and MX, they do not qualify as a dotless domain, as the records should not point to real servers. For instance, the A record contains the IP 127.0.53.53, a loopback address (see IPv4 § Addressing), picked as a mnemonic to indicate a DNS-related problem, as DNS uses port 53.

==Pseudo-domains==

Several networks, such as BITNET, CSNET, and UUCP, existed that were in widespread use among computer professionals and academic users, but were not interoperable directly with the Internet and exchanged mail with the Internet via special email gateways. For relaying purposes on the gateways, messages associated with these networks were labeled with suffixes such as .bitnet, .oz, .csnet, or .uucp, but these domains did not exist as top-level domains in the public Domain Name System of the Internet.

Most of these networks have long since ceased to exist, and although UUCP still gets significant use in parts of the world where Internet infrastructure has not yet become well established, it subsequently transitioned to using Internet domain names, and pseudo-domains now largely survive as historical relics. One notable exception is the 2007 emergence of SWIFTNet Mail, which uses the swift pseudo-domain.

The anonymity network Tor formerly used the top-level pseudo-domain .onion for onion services, which can only be reached with a Tor client because it uses the Tor onion routing protocol to reach the hidden service to protect the anonymity of users. However, the pseudo-domain became officially reserved in October 2015. i2p provides a similar hidden pseudo-domain, .i2p, and Namecoin uses the .bit pseudo-domain.

<text>The Temple of Set (TOS) is an occult initiatory order founded in 1975. A new religious movement and form of Western esotericism, the Temple espouses a religion known as Setianism, whose practitioners are called Setians. This is sometimes identified as a form of Satanism, although this term is not often embraced by Setians and is contested by some academics.
The Temple was established in the United States in 1975 by Michael Aquino, an American political scientist, military officer, and a high-ranking member of Anton LaVey&#x27;s Church of Satan. Dissatisfied with LaVey&#x27;s materialistic approach, abolition of regional groups, and commercialization of Church degrees, Aquino resigned and – according to his own claim – embarked on a ritual to invoke Satan, who revealed to him a sacred text called &quot;The Book of Coming Forth by Night&quot;. According to Aquino, in this work Satan revealed his true name to be that of Set, which had been the name used by his followers in ancient Egypt. Aquino was joined in establishing the Temple by a number of other dissatisfied members of LaVey&#x27;s Church, and soon various Setian groups were established across the United States.
Setians believe that Set is the one real god and that he has aided humanity by giving them a questioning intellect, the &quot;Black Flame&quot;, which distinguishes them from other animal species. Set is held in high esteem as a teacher whose example is to be emulated but he is not worshipped as a deity. Highly individualistic in basis, the Temple promotes the idea that practitioners should seek self-deification and thus attain an immortality of consciousness.
Setians believe in the existence of magic as a force which can be manipulated through ritual, however the nature of these rituals is not prescribed by the Temple. Specifically, Aquino described Setian practices as &quot;black magic&quot;, a term which he defines idiosyncratically.
Following initiation into the Temple, a Setian can proceed along a series of six degrees, each of which requires greater responsibilities to the group; as a result, most members remain in the first two degrees. Governed by a high priest or high priestess and a wider Council of Nine, the Temple is also divided into groups known as &quot;pylons&quot;, through which Setians can meet or correspond in order to advance their magical work in a particular area. Pylons of the Temple are now present in the United States, Australia, and Europe, with estimates placing the Temple&#x27;s membership between 200 and 500.

==Definition==

The Temple of Set is a new religious movement, and draws upon earlier forms of Western esotericism. Among academic scholars of religious studies, there has been some debate as to whether the Temple of Set can be characterized as &quot;Satanism&quot; or not. The religious studies scholars Asbjorn Dyrendal, Massimo Introvigne, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aa. Petersen describes the Temple of Set as a Satanic group, despite its reluctance to use the term &quot;Satanism&quot;, because it is an offshoot of the Church of Satan which continues to use satanic mythology. Conversely, the scholar Kennet Granholm argued that it should not be considered a form of Satanism because it does not place an emphasis on the figure of Satan. Granholm acknowledged that it was an &quot;actor in the Satanic milieu&quot; and part of the wider left-hand path group of esoteric traditions. He suggested that it could also be seen as a form of &quot;Post-Satanism&quot;, thereby continuing to reflect its historical origins within religious Satanism.

The Temple of Set is far more rooted in esoteric ideas than the Church of Satan had been. It has thus been termed &quot;Esoteric Satanism&quot;, a term used to contrast it with the &quot;Rational Satanism&quot; found in LaVeyan Satanism. Accordingly, it has been labelled the &quot;intellectual wing of esoteric Satanism&quot;, with the Temple presenting itself as an intellectual religion. Aquino possessed a P.h.D. in political science and this formal education was reflected in the way that he presented his arguments, in which he draws broadly upon Western philosophy and science.

==History==

===Foundation===

Born in 1946, Michael Angelo Aquino was a military intelligence officer specializing in psychological warfare. In 1969 he joined Anton LaVey&#x27;s Church of Satan and rose rapidly through the group&#x27;s ranks. In 1970, while he was serving with the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, Aquino was stationed in Bến Cát in South Vietnam when he wrote a tract titled &quot;Diabolicon&quot; in which he reflected upon his growing divergence from the Church of Satan&#x27;s doctrines. In this tract, teachings about the creation of the world, God, and humanity are presented, as is the dualistic idea that Satan complements God. The character of Lucifer is presented as bringing insight to human society, a depiction of Lucifer that was inherited from John Milton&#x27;s seventeenth-century epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. By 1971 Aquino was ranked as a Magister Caverns of the IV° within the Church&#x27;s hierarchy, was editor of its publication &quot;The Cloven Hoof&quot;, and sat on its governing Council of Nine. In 1973 he rose to the previously unattained rank of Magister Templi of IV°. According to Satanism scholars Per Faxneld and Jesper Petersen, Aquino had effectively become LaVey&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot;.

Nonetheless there were things that Aquino disliked about the Church of Satan; he thought that it had attracted many &quot;fad-followers, egomaniacs, and assorted oddballs, whose primary interest in becoming Satanists was to flash their membership cards for cocktail-party notoriety&quot;. When, in 1975, LaVey abolished the system of regional groups, or &quot;grottos&quot;, and declared that in the future all degrees would be given in exchange for financial or other contributions to the Church, Aquino became increasingly disaffected; he resigned from the organization on June 10, 1975. While LaVey seems to have held a pragmatic and practical view of the degrees and of the Satanic priesthood, intending them to reflect the social role of the degree holder within the organization, Aquino and his supporters viewed the priesthood as being spiritual, sacred and irrevocable. Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen describe Aquino as, in effect, accusing LaVey of the sacrilege of simony. 

Aquino then provided what has been described as a &quot;foundation myth&quot; for his Setian religion. Having departed the Church, he embarked on a ritual intent on asking Satan for advice on what to do next. According to his account, at Midsummer 1975, Satan appeared and revealed that he wanted to be known by his true name, Set, which had been the name used by his worshippers in ancient Egypt. Aquino produced a religious text, &quot;The Book of Coming Forth by Night&quot;, which he alleged had been revealed to him by Set through a process of automatic writing. According to Aquino, &quot;there was nothing overtly sensational, supernatural, or melodramatic about &quot;The Book of Coming Forth By Night&quot; working. I simply sat down and wrote it.&quot; The book proclaimed Aquino to be the Magus of the new Aeon of Set and the heir to LaVey&#x27;s &quot;infernal mandate&quot;. Aquino later stated that the revelation that Satan was Set necessitated his own exploration of Egyptology, a subject about which he had previously known comparatively little. 

Aquino&#x27;s &quot;Book of Coming Forth by Night&quot; makes reference to &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, a similarly revealed text produced by the occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which provided the basis for Crowley&#x27;s religion of Thelema. In Aquino&#x27;s book, &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making reference to &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley&#x27;s heir as LaVey&#x27;s, and Aquino&#x27;s work would engage with Crowley&#x27;s writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.

In establishing the Temple, Aquino was joined by other ex-members of LaVey&#x27;s Church, and soon Setian groups, or &quot;pylons&quot;, were established in various parts of the United States. The structure of the Temple was based largely on those of the ceremonial magical orders of the late nineteenth century, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Ordo Templi Orientis.
Aquino has stated that he believed LaVey not to be merely a charismatic leader but to have been actually appointed by Satan himself (referring to this charismatic authority as the &quot;Infernal Mandate&quot;) to found the Church. After the split of 1975, Aquino believed LaVey had lost the mandate, which the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; then transferred to Aquino and a new organization, the Temple of Set. According to both the historian of religion Mattias Gardell and journalist Gavin Baddeley, Aquino displayed an &quot;obsession&quot; with LaVey after his departure from the Church, for instance by publicly releasing court documents that reflected negatively on his former mentor, among them restraining orders, divorce proceedings, and a bankruptcy filing. In turn, LaVey lampooned the new Temple as &quot;Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot;&quot;. In 1975, the Temple incorporated as a non-profit Church in California, and later that year secured state and federal recognition and tax-exempted status.

===Later development===

Many members of the Temple had voiced their opposition to Aquino&#x27;s position of power within it. Aquino relinquished his office of High Priest in 1979 to Ronald Keith Barrett, who produced an inspired text of his own, titled &quot;The Book of Opening the Way&quot;. Barrett&#x27;s approach was later criticized as &quot;more mystical than magical&quot; by Temple members. Barrett&#x27;s leadership was also criticized as authoritarian, resulting in a decline in the Temple&#x27;s membership. Barrett resigned his office and severed ties with the organization in May 1982. He subsequently established his own Temple of Anubis, which he led until his 1998 death; it survived until the early 2010s. After Barrett&#x27;s departure, Aquino retook leadership of the Temple of Set. During this period, the sociologist Gini Graham Scott clandestinely participated in the Temple, using her observations as the basis for her 1983 book &quot;The Magicians: A Study of the Use of Power in a Black Magic Group&quot;.

After receiving his PhD in political science from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1980, Aquino worked as an adjunct professor at Golden Gate University until 1986 while continuing to serve in the United States Army as an Active Guard Reserve officer at the Presidio of San Francisco.
He was fascinated with the connections between occultism and Nazism, resulting in some accusations that he was sympathetic to Nazi ideology. In 1983, he performed a solitary rite at Walhalla, the subterranean section of the Wewelsburg castle in Germany that was utilized as a ceremonial space by the Schutzstaffel&#x27;s Ahnenerbe group during the Nazi period. This resulted in his formation of the Order of the Trapezoid, lifting the name directly from the early governing body of the Church of Satan to repackage it as a Setian version whose members considered themselves a chivalric order of knights. From 1987 through to 1995, the Grand Master of the Order of the Trapezoid was Edred Thorsson, who had joined the Temple of Set in 1984 and risen to the Fifth Degree in 1990. Thorsson exerted a &quot;discernible influence&quot; over the Setian community through his books, in which he combined aspects of Satanic philosophy with the Modern Pagan religion of Heathenry. In 1980, he founded the Texas-based Rune-Gild The Ring of Troth which shared many of the Temple&#x27;s key philosophical tenets but with a focus on the study of runes and their applications in magical practice.

In the 1980s, Aquino attracted greater publicity for his Temple through appearances on television talk shows like &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and &quot;Geraldo&quot;. In 1987, during the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, the three-year-old daughter of a Christian clergyman accused Aquino of sexually abusing her during Satanic rites held at his Russian Hill home. Responding to the allegations, police raided Aquino&#x27;s home. However, after no evidence was found to substantiate the allegation and it was revealed that Aquino was living in Washington D.C. at the time of the alleged abuse, the police dropped felony charges. Aquino attempted to bring formal charges against the chaplain and psychiatrist who had encouraged the girl&#x27;s claims, although he was more successful in bringing legal action against two books—Carl A. Raschke&#x27;s &quot;Painted Black&quot; and Linda Blood&#x27;s &quot;The New Satanists&quot;—that had suggested that he was guilty. He then left the Presidio and was transferred to St. Louis. In 1994, Aquino retired from active service in the Army, being honourably transferred to the Retired Reserve and awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.

While the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria declined, Aquino continued to be a figure of prominence in &quot;mind control&quot; conspiracy theories because of his career as a psychological warfare officer in the US Army. In the United Kingdom during this same period, tabloids like the &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; published sensationalist articles about the Temple. In the mid-1990s, a group of British Setians approached the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey and encouraged him to conduct research into the group so as to combat misconceptions about them. The Temple first registered a website in 1997, the same year as the Church of Satan. It would also establish its own intranet, allowing for communication between Setians in different parts of the world.

One member of the Temple was the New Zealander Kerry Bolton, who split to form his own Order of The Left Hand Path in 1990. In 1995, another couple who joined were LaVey&#x27;s daughter Zeena Schreck and her husband Nikolas Schreck, both of whom were vocal critics of Zeena&#x27;s father.

In 1996, Don Webb became the high priest of the Temple, a position that he held until 2002. He was replaced by Zeena Schreck but she resigned after six weeks and was replaced by Aquino, who took charge once more. In that year, Zeena led a schism within the organization establishing her own Berlin-based group, The Storm, which she later renamed the Sethian Liberation Movement. 

Aquino stood down as High Priest again in 2004, to be replaced by Patricia Hardy who was elected to the position of High Priestess. Although no longer in charge of the organization, he nevertheless remained its most visible spokesperson.

Aquino died on September 1, 2019.

==Ideology==

===Writings===
In addition to the &quot;Book of Coming Forth by Night&quot;, in which Set himself is purported to speak, the Temple&#x27;s philosophy and teachings are revealed in a series of occult writings titled the &quot;Jeweled Tablets of Set&quot;. Each tablet is keyed to a specific degree in the Temple hierarchy. Only the introduction to the first tablet (&quot;Crystal Tablet of Set&quot;), titled &quot;Black Magic&quot;, is available for non-members. The &quot;Ruby Tablet&quot;, which is available for second-degree members, is the lengthiest and most diverse of the tablets.

The private Temple literature is not regarded as secret per se, but is kept restricted because it contains materials which, according to the Temple, may be dangerous to the non-initiated.

===Self-deification and Xeper===

The human individual is at the centre of Setian philosophy. The Temple places great emphasis on the development of the individual, postulating self-deification as the ultimate goal.
The realization of the true nature of the Setian is termed &quot;becoming&quot; or &quot;coming into being&quot; and is represented by the Egyptian hieroglyphic term &quot;kheper&quot;, or &quot;Xeper&quot; (a phonetic of _Xpr_), as the Temple of Set prefers to write it. This term is described in &quot;The Book of Coming Forth by Night&quot; as &quot;the Word of the Aeon of Set&quot;.
Members attempt &quot;to preserve and strengthen&quot; their &quot;isolate, psyche-centric existence&quot; through adherence to the left-hand path. This idea is in opposition to the traditional goal of Hermetic and Western mystical practices, which is the surrendering of the ego into a union with either God or the universe.

The Temple teaches that the true self, or &quot;essence&quot;, is immortal, and &quot;Xeper&quot; is the ability to align consciousness with this essence. Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual&#x27;s subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge understood as a conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping with its emphasis on the individual, the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.

Barrett presented &quot;Xem&quot; as his Aeonic Word to the Setians, presenting it as a natural and necessary further development of Aquino&#x27;s &quot;Xeper&quot;. Aquino later acknowledged &quot;Xem&quot; as a worthwhile magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett&#x27;s insistence on its exclusivity as incompatible with the Temple&#x27;s individualistic philosophy.

===Set===
Aquino&#x27;s understanding of Satan differed from the atheistic interpretation promoted by LaVey, and the Temple&#x27;s theology differs from that of the Church of Satan. The Temple states that the name &quot;Satan&quot; was originally a corruption of the name &quot;Set&quot;. The Temple of Set promotes the idea that Set is a real entity, and accordingly has been described as being &quot;openly theistic&quot;. It further argues that Set is ageless and is the only real god in existence, with all others having been created by the human imagination. Set is described as having given humanity—through the means of non-natural evolution—the &quot;Black Flame&quot; or the &quot;Gift of Set&quot;. This refers to humanity&#x27;s questioning intellect which sets the species apart from other animals and gives it an &quot;isolate self-consciousness&quot; and the possibility to attain divinity. Aquino argued that the idea of the Gift of Set was inadvertently promoted to a wider audience in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. According to Aquino, the black monolith which imparts human-level intelligence onto prehistoric apes in the film was a symbol of Set.

While Setians are expected to revere Set, they do not worship him, instead regarding him as a teacher and a guide. He is portrayed as a role model on which Setians can base their own deification. According to Webb, &quot;we do not worship Set - only our own potential. Set was and is the patron of the magician who seeks to increase his existence through expansion.&quot;

Embracing the idea of aeons from Crowley&#x27;s Thelema, Aquino adopted the Crowleyan tripartite division between the Aeon of Isis, Aeon of Osiris, and Aeon of Horus, but added to that the Aeon of Satan, which he dates from 1966 to 1975, and then the Aeon of Set, which he dated from 1975 onward. Despite presenting these chronological parameters, Aquino also portrayed the aeons less as time periods and more as mind-sets that can co-exist alongside one another. Thus, he stated that &quot;A Jew, Christian or Muslim exists in the Æon of Osiris, a Wiccan in that of Isis, and a Thelemite in that of Horus&quot;.

===Magic===

Aquino placed an emphasis on what he deemed to be the division between the objective and subjective universes. In the Setian religion, the objective world is understood as representing the natural world and humanity&#x27;s collective meaning systems, while the subjective universe is understood as the individually experienced world and individual meaning systems. Following earlier esotericists like Crowley, Aquino characterized magic as &quot;causing change in accordance with will&quot;. Unlike LaVey, Aquino expressed belief in the division between black magic and white magic. He described white magic as &quot;a highly-concentrated form of conventional religious ritual&quot;, characterizing it as being &quot;more versatile&quot;, &quot;less difficult&quot;, and &quot;less dangerous&quot; than black magic. However, he criticized white magic as &quot;fraud and/or self-delusion&quot; which deceives the consciousness into thinking that it has been accepted in the objective universe.

Aquino divided black magic into two forms: lesser black magic and greater black magic. He stated that lesser black magic entails &quot;impelling&quot; things that exist in the &quot;objective universe&quot; into doing a desired act by using &quot;obscure physical or behavioral laws&quot; and into this category he placed stage magic, psychodramas, politics, and propaganda. Conversely, he used the term greater black magic in reference to changes in the subjective universe of the magician, allowing them to realize their self in accordance with the principle of &quot;Xeper&quot;. Among Setians it is accepted that there may be changes in the objective universe as a result of greater black magic, but such effects are considered secondary to the impact that they have upon the subjective universe.

Within the Temple, rituals are typically known as &quot;workings&quot;, and are most often carried out alone. Stressing the religion&#x27;s individualist nature, there are no rituals that are specifically prescribed by the Temple. Aquino also emphasized that in order to achieve a desired aim, the Setian should carry out physical actions alongside magical ones. There are no regular occasions which are marked by fixed rituals, and the Temple has no calendar of festivals.

==Insignia==
The Temple uses an inverted pentagram as its insignia, known as the &quot;Pentagram of Set&quot; to Setians. The use of the geometric shape is derived from the Sigil of Baphomet used by the Church of Satan, although stripped of its overtly Satanic add-ons. The Temple explains the meaning and significance of the pentagram by referring to Pythagorean ideas and &quot;mathematical perfection&quot;. At Setian gatherings, members wear the pentagram as a medallion. The medallion is colored according to the initiation degree of the Setian.

Both the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set also use the trapezoid symbol. The version used by the Church includes flames, a pitchfork and the number 666, while the trapezoid of the Temple has a left-facing Egyptian sceptre, and the number 666 stylized in geometric shapes rather than as clear numbers.

==Structure==

The internal structure of the Temple of Set is closely reminiscent of that of the Church of Satan as it existed in the 1970s.

===Degrees===
All members of the Temple must be affiliated with a pylon, and thus membership is by application, requiring contact with a Setian priestess or priest followed by an evaluation period. The participation of non-initiated in the Temple&#x27;s rituals are forbidden, due to the belief that their rituals would be dangerous in the wrong hands.

The Temple of Set recognizes several stages or degrees of initiation. The degrees indicate the individual Setian&#x27;s development and skill in magic. The degree structure is based on that of the Church of Satan, which in turn was based on the degrees of a nineteenth-century occult group, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Temple terms the progression through degrees as &quot;recognitions&quot;, because the organization&#x27;s philosophy sees that the individual member initiates themselves and that the Temple merely acknowledges this by granting the degree. These degrees are:
#Setian (First Degree)
#Adept (Second Degree)
#Priest / Priestess of Set (Third Degree)
#Magister / Magistra Templi (Fourth Degree)
#Magus / Maga (Fifth Degree)
#Ipsissimus / Ipsissima (Sixth Degree)

The priesthood of the Temple of Set consists of members holding the third degree or higher; those in the first and second degrees are considered &quot;lay members&quot; of the Temple. The first degree serves as a space for mutual evaluation, in which the Temple assesses whether the individual is appropriate for the group, and the individual decides whether they wish to further their involvement with it. Full membership comes with recognition to the second degree. Many members do not advance beyond the second degree, nor is this expected of them, as while the first and second degree members use the organization&#x27;s teachings and tools for their own development, the priesthood involves greater responsibilities towards the organization, such as being its official representatives.

Recognition is performed by members of the priesthood. The fourth degree, which is acknowledged by the high priest/priestess, entails that the individual is so advanced in their magical skills that they are able to found their own school of magic, represented in the different orders of the Temple. The fifth degree can only be awarded by the unanimous decision of the Council of Nine and by the approval of the Temple&#x27;s high priest/priestess. A fifth degree member has the power to utter and define a concept which somehow affects the philosophy of the organization, such as the concept of &quot;Xeper&quot; defined by Aquino in 1975. Only a handful of members have attained this degree and most &quot;fifth-degree&quot; concepts defined in such a manner are no longer studied in the organization. The final sixth degree represents a Magus &quot;whose Task is complete&quot;. This degree is held by a very select few in the Temple, although any fifth-degree member can assume the sixth degree based on their own assessment.

===Leadership===

The organization is led by a high priest/priestess, who is also the public face of the Temple. The high priest is chosen among fourth or higher degree members by the chairman of the Council of Nine. This ruling council has nine members chosen from the priesthood (third degree or higher), whose mandate lasts for nine years with a new member being elected every year. The chairman of the council is chosen from among the council members each year. The council has the ultimate ruling power in the Temple and even the high priest is responsible to it. The Temple also has an executive director, whose task is to deal with administrative issues.

Since its founding in 1975, the temple has had the following high priests/priestesses:
* Michael A. Aquino (1975–1979, 1982–1996, 2002–2004)
* Ronald K. Barrett (1979–1982)
* Don Webb (1996–2002)
* Zeena Schreck (2002)
* Patricia Hardy (2004–2013)
* James Fitzsimmons (2013–present)

===Pylons, elements, and orders===

In addition to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory &quot;Orders&quot; and &quot;Elements&quot; and local groups called &quot;Pylons&quot;. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple&#x27;s members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon is to provide a space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member&#x27;s home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a &quot;Sentinel&quot;. The term &quot;pylon&quot; derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.

&quot;Elements&quot; are loosely structured interest groups, where specific themes and issues are addressed. They can be open for non-members and are commonly in operation only for short periods. Topics of interest include, for example, animal rights, which was the subject of the Arkte element operated by Aquino&#x27;s wife Lilith.

There are sections of the Temple known as &quot;Orders&quot;, each of which focus on a particular theme, for instance ancient Egypt, Norse culture, Tantric Hinduism, or vampirism. Others focus on a particular skill, for instance the Order of Uart focuses on the visual arts and the Order of Taliesin on music. Orders can be understood as schools of different aspects of magic providing different paths of initiation. Orders are led by grand masters, who will usually be the founder of the order. In longer-lived orders the founder may have a successive grand master. Orders are founded by members of the fourth degree. When members reaches the second degree of initiation, they are expected to join an order of their own choosing. In normal circumstances, a Setian is only permitted to join one order, however special dispensation can be obtained for a practitioner to join two.

Setians also hold annual International Conclaves. First Degree Initiates who obtain sponsorship by a member of the Priesthood are permitted to attend the International Conclave and Regional Gatherings.

==Demographics==
In 2000, the Temple had thirteen pylons, which were operating in the United States, Australia, Germany, and across Sweden and Finland. The extent of the Temple&#x27;s membership has not been publicly revealed by the group; however, in 2005 Petersen noted that academic estimates for the Temple&#x27;s membership varied from between 300 and 500, and Granholm suggested that in 2007 the Temple contained circa 200 members. The Temple&#x27;s members come from a variety of racial backgrounds.

In 1999, the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine suggested that in Britain there were 100 members of the Temple at most, and possibly &quot;considerably fewer&quot;. In 2001 the scholar Gareth Medway posited that the group had 70 to 80 members in the United Kingdom, adding that it was the largest Satanic group then active in the country. In 2009, Harvey concurred with La Fontaine&#x27;s assessment, although still believed that it was the largest Satanic group in the United Kingdom. He noted that most members were male, between the ages of twenty and fifty, and that—despite his expectation that they might be political extremists—they endorsed mainstream political positions, with all those whom he communicated with stating that they had voted for either the Conservative Party, Labour Party, or Liberal Democrats.

<text>Tate Modern is an art gallery in London, housing the United Kingdom&#x27;s national collection of international modern and contemporary art (created from or after 1900). It forms part of the Tate group together with Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives. It is located in the former Bankside Power Station, in the Bankside area of the London Borough of Southwark.

Tate Modern is one of the largest museums of modern and contemporary art in the world. As with the UK&#x27;s other national galleries and museums, there is no admission charge for access to the collection displays, which take up the majority of the gallery space, whereas tickets must be purchased for the major temporary exhibitions.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the museum was closed for 173 days in 2020, and attendance plunged by 77 per cent to 1,432,991. However, it recovered strongly in 2022, with 3,883,160 visitors, making it the third most visited in Britain and the fourth-most visited art museum in the world.

The nearest railway and London Underground station is Blackfriars, which is 550 yards (0.5 km) from the gallery.

== History ==

=== Bankside Power Station ===
After sharing the Millbank site with Tate Britain for many decades, since 2000 Tate Modern has occupied the converted former Bankside Power Station. This was originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Battersea Power Station, and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. It is directly across the river from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The power station closed in 1981.

Prior to redevelopment, the power station was a long, steel framed, brick clad building with a substantial central chimney standing . The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east–west – the huge main Turbine Hall in the centre, with the boiler house to the north and the switch house to the south.

=== Initial redevelopment ===
For many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers. Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to list the building was refused. In April 1994 the Tate Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of Herzog &amp; de Meuron were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The £134 million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and was completed in January 2000.

The most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An electrical substation, taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company EDF Energy while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern&#x27;s main exhibition spaces.
The history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary &quot;Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern&quot;. The conversion work was carried out by Carillion.

=== Opening and initial reception ===
Tate Modern was opened by the Queen on 11 May 2000.

Tate Modern received 5.25 million visitors in its first year. The previous year the three existing Tate galleries had received 2.5 million visitors combined.

=== Extension project ===

Tate Modern had attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it had been in preparation since 2004. These plans focused on the south west of the building with the intention of providing 5,000 m2 of new display space, almost doubling the amount of display space.

The southern third of the building was retained by the French State owned power company EDF Energy as an electrical substation. In 2006, the company released the western half of this holding and plans were made to replace the structure with a tower extension to the museum, initially planned to be completed in 2015. The tower was to be built over the old oil storage tanks, which would be converted to a performance art space. Structural, geotechnical, civil, and façade engineering and environmental consultancy was undertaken by Ramboll between 2008 and 2016.

This project was initially costed at £215 million. Of the money raised, £50 million came from the UK government; £7 million from the London Development Agency; £6 million from philanthropist John Studzinski; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and Elisabeth Murdoch.

In June 2013, international shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer pledged £10 million to the extension project, making it to 85% of the required funds. Eyal Ofer, chairman of London-based Zodiac Maritime Agencies, said the donation made through his family foundation would enable &quot;an iconic institution to enhance the experience and accessibility of contemporary art&quot;. The Tate director, Nicholas Serota, praised the donation saying it would help to make Tate Modern a &quot;truly twenty-first-century museum&quot;.

==== The Tanks ====
The first phase of the expansion involved the conversion of three large, circular, underground oil tanks originally used by the power station into accessible display spaces and facilities areas. These opened on 18 July 2012 and closed on 28 October 2012 as work on the tower building continued directly above. They reopened following the completion of the Switch House extension in June 2016.

Two of the Tanks are used to show live performance art and installations while the third provides utility space. Tate describes them as &quot;the world&#x27;s first museum galleries permanently dedicated to live art&quot;.

==== The Switch House ====

A ten-storey tower, high from ground level, was built above the oil tanks.

The original western half of the Switch House was demolished to make room for the tower and then rebuilt around it with large gallery spaces and access routes between the main building and the new tower on level 1 (ground level) and level 4. The new galleries on level 4 have natural top lighting. A bridge built across the turbine hall on level 4 provides an upper access route.

The new building opened to the public on 17 June 2016.

The design, again by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, has been controversial. It was originally designed with a glass stepped pyramid, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping façade in brick latticework (to match the original power-station building) despite planning consent to the original design having been previously granted by the supervising authority.

The extension provides of additional gross internal area for display and exhibition spaces, performance spaces, education facilities, offices, catering and retail facilities as well as a car parking and a new external public space.

In May 2017, the Switch House was formally renamed the Blavatnik Building, after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, who contributed a &quot;substantial&quot; amount of the £260 million cost of the extension. Sir Nicholas Serota commented, &quot;Len Blavatnik&#x27;s enthusiastic support ensured the successful realisation of the project and I am delighted that the new building now bears his name&quot;.

== Galleries ==
The collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and contemporary art dating from 1900 until today.

Levels 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Each of those floors is split into a large east and west wing with at least 11 rooms in each. Space between these wings is also used for smaller galleries on levels 2 and 4. The Boiler House shows art from 1900 to the present day.

The Switch House has eleven floors, numbered 0 to 10. Levels 0, 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Level 0 consists of the Tanks, spaces converted from the power station&#x27;s original fuel oil tanks, while all other levels are housed in the tower extension building constructed above them. The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.

The Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six storeys tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0. The eastern end provides a very large space that can be used to show exceptionally large artworks due to its unusual height.

== Exhibitions ==

=== Collection exhibitions ===

The main collection displays consist of 8 areas with a named theme or subject. Within each area there are some rooms that change periodically showing different works in keeping with the overall theme or subject. The themes are changed less frequently. There is no admission charge for these areas.

As of June 2016 the themed areas were:
* &quot;Start Display&quot;: A three-room display of works by major artists to introduce the basic ideas of modern art.
* &quot;Artist and Society&quot;
* &quot;In The Studio&quot;
* &quot;Materials and Objects&quot;
* &quot;Media Networks&quot;
* &quot;Between Object and Architecture&quot;
* &quot;Performer and Participant&quot;
* &quot;Living Cities&quot;

There is also an area dedicated to displaying works from the Artist Rooms collection.

==== History of the collection exhibitions ====
Since the Tate Modern first opened in 2000, the collections have not been displayed in chronological order but have been arranged thematically into broad groups. Prior to the opening of the Switch House there were four of these groupings at a time, each allocated a wing on levels 3 and 5 (now levels 2 and 4).

The initial hanging from 2000 to 2006:
* &quot;History/Memory/Society&quot;
* &quot;Nude/Action/Body&quot;
* &quot;Landscape/Matter/Environment&quot;
* &quot;Still Life/Object/Real Life&quot;

The first rehang at Tate Modern opened in May 2006. It eschewed the thematic groupings in favour of focusing on pivotal moments of twentieth-century art. It also introduced spaces for shorter exhibitions in between the wings. The layout was:
* &quot;Material Gestures&quot;
* &quot;Poetry and Dream&quot;
* &quot;Energy and Process&quot;
* &quot;States of Flux&quot;

In 2012, there was a partial third rehang. The arrangement was:
* &quot;Poetry and Dream&quot;
* &quot;Structure and Clarity&quot;
* &quot;Transformed Visions&quot;
* &quot;Energy and Process&quot;
* &quot;Setting the Scene&quot; – A smaller section, located between wings, covering installations with theatrical or fictional themes.

=== Temporary exhibitions ===

==== The Turbine Hall ====

The Turbine hall, which once housed the electricity generators of the old power station, is five storeys tall with 3,400 square metres of floorspace. It is used to display large specially-commissioned works by contemporary artists, between October and March each year.

From 2000 until 2012, the series was named after its corporate sponsor, Unilever. In this time the company provided £4.4m sponsorship in total including a renewal deal of £2.2m for a period of five years agreed in 2008.
This series was planned to last the gallery&#x27;s first five years, but the popularity of the series led to its extension until 2012.

The artists who have exhibited commissioned work in the Turbine Hall as part of The Unilever Series are:
In 2013, Tate Modern signed a sponsorship deal worth around £5 million with Hyundai to cover a ten-year program of commissions, then considered the largest amount of money ever provided to an individual gallery or museum in the United Kingdom. The first commission for the Hyundai series is Mexican artist, Abraham Cruzvillegas.

The artists who have exhibited commissioned work in the Turbine Hall as part of the Hyundai series thus far are:
When there is no series running, the Turbine Hall is used for occasional events and exhibitions. In 2011 it was used to display Damien Hirst&#x27;s &quot;For The Love of God&quot;. A sell-out show by Kraftwerk in February 2013 crashed the ticket hotline and website, causing a backlash from the band&#x27;s fans. In 2018 the Turbine Hall was used for two performances of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum&quot; and Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Gruppen&quot;.

==== Major temporary exhibitions ====
Two wings of the Boiler House are used to stage the major temporary exhibitions for which an entry fee is charged. These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the Gilbert and George retrospective due to the size and number of the works.

A 2014 show of Henri Matisse provided Tate Modern with London&#x27;s best-attended charging exhibition, and with a record 562,622 visitors overall, helped by a nearly five-month-long run. In 2018, Joan Jonas had a retrospective exhibition.

&quot;A Year in Art: Australia 1992&quot;, featuring contemporary Indigenous Australian art of 1992, which opened in June 2021, was extended until September 2022 owing to its popularity.

==== The Tanks ====
The Tanks, located on level 0, are three large underground oil tanks, connecting spaces and side rooms originally used by the power station and refurbished for use by the gallery. One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection. The Tanks have also been used as a venue for live music.

==== Project Space ====
The Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) was a smaller gallery located on the north side of the Boiler House on level 1 which housed exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically ran for 2–3 months and then travelled to the collaborating institution for display there. The space was only accessible by leaving the building and re-entering using a dedicated entrance. It is no longer used as gallery space.

==== Other areas ====
Works are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members&#x27; rooms. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the Boiler House building.

== Other facilities ==
In addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:
* A large performance space in one of the tanks on level 0 used to show a changing programme of performance works for which there is sometimes an entrance charge.
* The Starr Auditorium and a seminar room on level 1 which are used to show films and host events for which there is usually an entrance charge.
* The Clore Education Centre, Clore Information Room and McAulay Studios on level 0 which are facilities for use by visiting educational institutions.
* One large and several small shops selling books, prints and merchandise.
* A cafe, an espresso bar, a restaurant and bar and a members&#x27; room.
* Tate Modern community garden, co-managed with Bankside Open Spaces Trust

== Access and environs ==

The closest station is Blackfriars via its new south entrance. Other nearby stations include Southwark, as well as St Paul&#x27;s and Mansion House north of the river which can be reached via the Millennium Bridge. The lampposts between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange to show pedestrian visitors the route.

There is also a riverboat pier just outside the gallery called Bankside Pier, with connections to the Docklands and Greenwich via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain.

To the west of Tate Modern is an area currently under redevelopment following the demolitions of Ludgate House, the former headquarters of Express Newspapers and Sampson House, a massive late Brutalist office building.

=== Transport connections ===

* At the exit of Southwark tube station, orange lamposts direct visitors to Tate Modern.

== Directors ==
The following have served as Director of the Tate Modern:
* Lars Nittve (1998–2001)
* Vicente Todolí (2003–2010)
* Chris Dercon (2010–2016)
* Frances Morris (2016–2023)
* Karin Hindsbo (2023–Present)

== Protests ==
Since 2010 there have been a series of protest art performances by the art collective &quot;Liberate Tate&quot; demanding the Tate to &quot;disengage from BP as a sponsor, and stop allowing Tate to be used to deflect attention away from the devastating impacts that BP has around the world.&quot; BP is criticised for operations in relation with petroleum exploration in the Arctic, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, oil sands and climate change. In June 2015 a group of artists occupied Tate Modern for 25 hours.
== Incidents ==
In 2012 and 2024, two people fell to their deaths from the galleries&#x27; balconies. In 2019, a six-year old child from France was thrown off the 10th floor by a teenager with a history of violent conduct. The child survived but sustained life-changing injuries.

<text>Theophanu Skleraina (; also &quot;Theophania&quot;, &quot;Theophana&quot;, &quot;Theophane&quot; or &quot;Theophano&quot;; Medieval Greek ; AD 955 15 June 991) was empress of the Holy Roman Empire by marriage to Emperor Otto II, and regent of the Empire during the minority of their son, Emperor Otto III, from 983 until her death in 991.
She was the niece of the Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes. Theophanu was known to be a forceful and capable ruler, and her status in the history of the Empire was in many ways exceptional. According to Wilson, &quot;She became the only consort to receive the title &#x27;co-empress&#x27; (&quot;coimperatrix augusta&quot;), and it was envisaged she would succeed as sole ruler if Otto II died without a son.&quot;

==Early life==
According to the marriage certificate issued on 14 April 972 Theophanu is identified as the &quot;neptis&quot; (niece or granddaughter) of Emperor John I Tzimiskes (925–976, reigned 969–976) who was of Armenian and Byzantine Greek descent. She was of distinguished noble heritage: the Vita Mahthildis identifies her as &quot;augusti de palatio&quot; and the Annales Magdeburgenses describe her as &quot;Grecam illustrem imperatoriae stirpi proximam, ingenio facundam&quot;. Recent research tends to concur that she was most probably the daughter of Tzimiskes&#x27; brother-in-law (from his first marriage) Constantine Skleros (c. 920–989) and cousin Sophia Phokas, the daughter of &quot;Kouropalatēs&quot; Leo Phokas, brother of Emperor Nikephoros II (c. 912–969).

==Marriage==
Theophanu was not &quot;born in the purple&quot; as the Ottonians would have preferred. The Saxon chronicler Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg writes that the Ottonian preference was for Anna Porphyrogenita, a daughter of late Emperor Romanos II. Theophanu&#x27;s uncle John I Tzimiskes had overthrown his predecessor Nikephoros II Phokas in 969. Theophanu was escorted back to Rome for her wedding by a delegation of German and Italian churchmen and nobles. When the Ottonian court discovered Theophanu was not a scion of the Macedonian dynasty, as had been assumed, Otto I was told by some to send Theophanu away. His advisors believed that Theophanu&#x27;s relation to the usurper John Tzimiskes would invalidate the marriage as a confirmation of Otto I as Holy Roman Emperor. He was persuaded to allow her to stay when it was pointed out that John Tzimiskes had wed Theodora, a member of the Macedonian dynasty and sister to Emperor Romanos II. John was therefore a Macedonian, by marriage if not by birth. Otto I must have been convinced, because Theophanu and Otto&#x27;s heir, Otto II, were married on 14 April 972.

A reference by the Pope to Emperor Nikephoros II as &quot;Emperor of the Greeks&quot; in a letter while Otto&#x27;s ambassador, Bishop Liutprand of Cremona, was at the Byzantine court, had destroyed the first round of marriage negotiations. With the ascension of John I Tzimiskes, who had not been personally referred to other than as Roman Emperor, the treaty negotiations were able to resume. However, not until a third delegation led by Archbishop Gero of Cologne arrived in Constantinople, were they successfully completed. After the marriage negotiations completed, Theophanu and Otto II were married by Pope John XIII in April 972 and she was crowned as Holy Roman Empress the same day in Rome. According to Karl Leysers&#x27; book &quot;Communications and Power in Medieval Europe: Carolingian and Ottonian,&quot; Otto I&#x27;s choice was not &quot;to be searched for in the parlance of high politics&quot; as his decision was ultimately made on the basis of securing his dynasty with the birth of the next Ottonian emperor.

According to Laura Wangerin, her father-in-law Otto the Great played an instrumental role in establishing her position as a future ruler. But despite his support, she met a lot of opposition and envy due to her foreign origins and education. After his death in 973, she lost her greatest support at court.

==Empress==
Otto II succeeded his father on 8 May 973. Theophanu accompanied her husband on all his journeys, and she is mentioned in approximately one quarter of the emperor&#x27;s formal documents – evidence of her privileged position, influence and interest in affairs of the empire. It is known that she was frequently at odds with her mother-in-law, Adelaide of Italy. The young couple and Adelaide collided with each other in several matters, including Adelaide&#x27;s early association with Henry the Quarrelsome. According to Abbot Odilo of Cluny, Adelaide was very happy when &quot;that Greek woman&quot; died.

Nevertheless, the imperial couple were able to secure the trust of their allies at the 973 Reichstag in Worms, after which they traveled the country together, searching for new alliances and strengthening old ties. The young Theophanu showed diplomatic skills and displayed herself as an active partner in political negotiations.

The Benedictine chronicler Alpert of Metz describes Theophanu as being an unpleasant and chattery woman. Theophanu was also criticized for having introduced new luxurious garments and jewelry into France and Germany. The theologian Peter Damian even asserts that Theophanu had a love affair with John Philagathos, a Greek monk who briefly reigned as Antipope John XVI.

Otto II died suddenly on 7 December 983 at the age of 28, probably from malaria. His three-year-old son, Otto III, had already been appointed King of the Romans during a diet held on Pentecost of that year at Verona. At Christmas, Theophanu had him crowned by the Mainz archbishop Willigis at Aachen Cathedral, with herself ruling as Empress Regent on his behalf. Upon the death of Emperor Otto II, Bishop Folcmar of Utrecht released his cousin, the Bavarian duke Henry the Quarrelsome from custody. Duke Henry allied with Archbishop Warin of Cologne and seized his nephew Otto III in spring 984, while Theophanu was still in Italy in the royal palace of Pavia. Nevertheless he was forced to surrender the child to his mother, who was backed by Archbishop Willigis of Mainz and Bishop Hildebald of Worms.

==Regency==
===Consolidation of power===
Theophanu ruled the Holy Roman Empire as regent for a span of five years, from May 985 to her death in 991, despite early opposition by the Ottonian court. In fact, many queens in the tenth century, on an account of male rulers dying early deaths, found themselves in power, creating an age of greater diversity. Her power as queen, empress and regent was based on the basis of Saxon tradition (which assigned the women an equal role in the family), Byzantine influence (which presented a model of a female counterpart to the emperor) and her mother-in-law Adelaide&#x27;s legacy. Theophanu and her mother-in-law, Adelaide, are known during the empress&#x27; regency to have butted heads frequently—Adelaide of Italy is even quoted as referring to her as &quot;that Greek empress.&quot; However, according to historian and author Simon Maclean, Theophanu&#x27;s rivalry with her mother-in-law is overstated. Theophanu&#x27;s &quot;Greekness&quot; was not an overall issue. Moreover, there was a grand fascination with the culture surrounding Byzantine court in the west that slighted most criticisms to her Greek origin.

Theophanu did not remain merely as an image of the Ottonian empire, but as an influence within the Holy Roman Empire. She intervened within the governing of the empire a total of seventy-six times during the reign of her husband Otto II—perhaps a foreshadowing of her regency. Her first act as regent was in securing her son, Otto III, as the heir to the Holy Roman Empire. Theophanu also placed her daughters in power by giving them high positions in influential nunneries all around the Ottonian-ruled west, securing power for all her children. She welcomed ambassadors, declaring herself &quot;imperator&quot; or &quot;imperatrix&quot;, as did her relative contemporaries Irene of Athens and Theodora; the starting date for her reign being 972, the year of her marriage to the late Otto II. Theophanu&#x27;s regency is a time of considerable peace, as the years 985-991 passed without major crises.

===Internal peace, diplomacy, warfare and cultural achievements===
In the North, she made a treaty with King Eric the Victorious, which promoted an alliance against Slavic tribes as well as reinforced trade and cultural connections. In the East, she sent envoys to Vladimir the Great of Kiev, who was married to the Byzantine princess Anna, sister of Emperor Basil II. Economou notes that, &quot;Theophano had in mind a &#x27;family of kings,&#x27; in parallel to Byzantine tradition: The emperor was the &#x27;father&#x27; of other kings, who were his &#x27;sons&#x27; and &#x27;friends&#x27; (amici) in a kind of family hierarchy. She also adopted the Byzantine model of relations between the emperor and patriarch in her relations to the pope (Ostrogorsky 1956b). The &#x27;family&#x27; of the western empire included the duke of Poland, Mieszko I, Bohemia and Hungary&quot;. Her model of imperial rulership, influenced by Byzantine and Ancient Roman ideas, was taken over by Otto II and especially Otto III who developed it further (although his abrupt death at a very young age prevented it from becoming an established foundation for the future).

According to historian Gerd Althoff, Theophanu&#x27;s prowess in diplomacy could be exaggerated. Royal charters present evidence that magnates were at the core of governing the empire. Althoff highlights this as unusual, since kings or emperors in the middle ages rarely shared such a large beacon of power with nobility.

Theophanu introduced Byzantine protocol, &quot;which influenced dress, crowns and jewelry, eating habits and utensils, even furniture&quot;. Her retinue of scholars brought to the empire Byzantine lawyers&#x27; procedures. The cult of Saint Nicholas in the empire traces its origin from her too.
As she and her husband and her son promoted trade in the Empire, Magdeburg and its traders were granted various privileges. Historical evidences show strong commercial activities in regions from Lüneburg to Halle. There are traces of Byzantine, Slavic as well as Arab traders.

As with many Byzantine monarchs, Theophanu preferred diplomacy, but she did wage wars when necessary and accepted personal risk. She carried out at least one (successful) military expedition herself, in 987, when she marched with an imperial army to assist the Prince-Bishop Notker of Liège against Odo I, Count of Blois.

Due to illness beginning in 988, Theophanu eventually died at Nijmegen and was buried in the Church of St. Pantaleon near her wittum in Cologne in 991. The chronicler Thietmar eulogized her as follows: &quot;&quot;Though [Theophanu] was of the weak sex she possessed moderation, trustworthiness, and good manners. In this way she protected with male vigilance the royal power for her son, friendly with all those who were honest, but with terrifying superiority against rebels&quot;.&quot;

Because Otto III was still a child, his grandmother Adelaide of Italy took over the regency until Otto III became old enough to rule on his own.

==Historiography and depictions in arts==
Theophanu has always attracted considerable controversy from chroniclers and historiographers. While praised by Thietmar of Merseburg and Bruno of Querfurt, she was also criticized by some other scholars, notably Odilo of Cluny, the hagiographer of her mother-in-law and rival Adelaide. Odilo even blamed her for the failed Italian expedition of Otto II. Her modern historiographers are similarly divided, although sees the general trend as leaning towards the positive. Some see her as passive, reactive and conservative while the others see her as extremely future-oriented and energetic; still others like Jestice opine that current evidences are not enough to definitely conclude that Theophanu and the other prominent female Ottonian rulers were extraordinarily talented as individuals or not but it is clear that the Ottonian society (which basically treated women and men as equals, except in physical prowess) allowed women the chance to succeed. Her personal role or non-role in the contact or merging between the Macedonian Renaissance and Ottonian Renaissance inspires a lot of debate as well.

==Commemoration==

The Empress Theophano Prize, awarded by the Empress Theophano Foundation based in Thessaloniki, &quot;rewards individuals or organisations who make an outstanding contribution to bridging Europe&#x27;s historic diversities.&quot;

On the occasion of the millennial commemoration of her death, multiple events in Germany and the Netherlands were organized.

<text>Thomas Gainsborough (; 14 May 1727 (baptised) – 2 August 1788) was an English portrait and landscape painter, draughtsman, and printmaker. Along with his rival Sir Joshua Reynolds, he is considered one of the most important British artists of the second half of the 18th century. He painted quickly, and the works of his maturity are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. Despite being a prolific portrait painter, Gainsborough gained greater satisfaction from his landscapes. He is credited (with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th-century British landscape school. Gainsborough was a founding member of the Royal Academy.

==Youth and training==
Gainsborough was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, the youngest son of John Gainsborough, a weaver and maker of woollen goods, and his wife Mary, sister of the Reverend Humphry Burroughs. One of Gainsborough&#x27;s brothers, Humphrey, is said to have invented the method of condensing steam in a separate vessel, which was of great service to James Watt; another brother, John, was known as &quot;Scheming Jack&quot; because of his passion for designing curiosities.

The artist spent his childhood at what is now Gainsborough&#x27;s House, on Gainsborough Street, Sudbury. He later resided there following the death of his father in 1748 and before his move to Ipswich. The building is now a house-museum dedicated to his life and art.

As a boy he demonstrated impressive drawing and painting skills. At the age of ten he was painting heads and small landscapes, including a miniature self-portrait. Gainsborough left home in 1740 to study art in London, where he trained under engraver Hubert Gravelot but became associated with William Hogarth and his school. He assisted Francis Hayman in decorating the supper boxes at Vauxhall Gardens.

==Career==
===Suffolk===
In 1746, Gainsborough married Margaret Burr, an illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Beaufort, who had settled a £200 annuity on her. The artist&#x27;s work, then mostly consisting of landscape paintings, was not selling well. He returned to Sudbury in 1748–1749 and concentrated on painting portraits. 
While still in Suffolk, Gainsborough painted a portrait of &quot;The Rev. John Chafy Playing the Violoncello in a Landscape&quot; (c. 1750–1752; Tate Gallery, London).

In 1752, he and his family, now including two daughters, Mary (&quot;Molly&quot;, 1750–1826) and Margaret (&quot;Peggy&quot;, 1751–1820), moved to Ipswich. Commissions for portraits increased, but his clients included mainly local merchants and squires. He had to borrow against his wife&#x27;s annuity. Toward the end of his time in Ipswich, he painted a self-portrait, now in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.
===Bath===
In 1759, Gainsborough and his family moved to Bath, living at number 17 The Circus. There, he studied portraits by van Dyck and was eventually able to attract a fashionable clientele. Beginning with the Exhibition of 1761 he sent work to the annual exhibition of the Society of Artists of Great Britain (of which he was one of the earliest members) at Spring Gardens in London. From 1769 he submitted works to the Royal Academy&#x27;s annual exhibitions. The exhibitions helped him enhance his reputation, and he was invited to become a founding member of the Royal Academy in 1769. His relationship with the academy was not an easy one and he stopped exhibiting his paintings in 1773.

Despite Gainsborough&#x27;s increasing popularity and success in painting portraits for fashionable society, he expressed frustration during his Bath period at the demands of such work and that it prevented him from pursuing his preferred artistic interests. In a letter to a friend in the 1760s Gainsborough wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m sick of Portraits and wish very much to take my Viol da Gamba and walk off to some sweet Village where I can paint Landskips [landscapes] and enjoy the fag End of Life in quietness and ease&quot;. Of the men he had to deal with as patrons and admirers, and their pretensions, he wrote:... damn Gentlemen, there is not such a set of Enemies to a real artist in the world as they are, if not kept at a proper distance. They think ... that they reward your merit by their Company &amp; notice; but I ... know that they have but one part worth looking at, and that is their Purse; their Hearts are seldom near enough the right place to get a sight of it.Gainsborough was so keen a viol da gamba player that he had at this stage five of the instruments, three made by Henry Jaye and two by Barak Norman.

===London===

In 1774, Gainsborough and his family moved to London to live in Schomberg House, Pall Mall. A commemorative blue plaque was put on the house in 1951. In 1777, he again began to exhibit his paintings at the Royal Academy, including portraits of contemporary celebrities, such as the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland. Exhibitions of his work continued for the next six years. About this time, Gainsborough began experimenting with printmaking using the then-novel techniques of aquatint and soft-ground etching.
During the 1770s and 1780s Gainsborough developed a type of portrait in which he integrated the sitter into the landscape. An example of this is his portrait of Frances Browne, Mrs John Douglas (1746–1811) which can be seen at Waddesdon Manor. The sitter has withdrawn to a secluded and overgrown corner of a garden to read a letter, her pose recalling the traditional representation of Melancholy. Gainsborough emphasised the relationship between Mrs Douglas and her environment by painting the clouds behind her and the drapery billowing across her lap with similar silvery violet tones and fluid brushstrokes. This portrait was included in his first private exhibition at Schomberg House in 1784.

In 1776, Gainsborough painted a portrait of Johann Christian Bach, the youngest son of Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach&#x27;s former teacher Padre Martini of Bologna, Italy, was assembling a collection of portraits of musicians, and Bach asked Gainsborough to paint his portrait as part of this collection. The portrait now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London.

In 1780, he painted the portraits of King George III and Queen Charlotte and afterwards received other royal commissions. In February 1780, his daughter Molly was married to his musician friend Johann Christian Fischer, to Gainsborough&#x27;s dismay, as he realized that Fischer was forming an attachment to Molly while carrying on flirtation with Peggy. The marriage between Molly and Fischer lasted only eight months, owing to their discord and Fischer&#x27;s deceit.

In 1784, Principal Painter in Ordinary Allan Ramsay died and the King was obliged to give the job to Gainsborough&#x27;s rival and Academy president, Joshua Reynolds. Gainsborough remained the royal family&#x27;s favourite painter, however.

In his later years, Gainsborough often painted landscapes. With Richard Wilson, he was one of the originators of the eighteenth-century British landscape school; though simultaneously, in conjunction with Reynolds, he was the dominant British portraitist of the second half of the 18th century.

William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of him &quot;to his intimate friends he was sincere and honest and that his heart was always alive to every feeling of honour and generosity&quot;. Gainsborough did not particularly enjoy reading but letters written to his friends were penned in such an exceptional conversational manner that the style could not be equalled. As a letter writer Henry Bate-Dudley said of him &quot;a selection of his letters would offer the world as much originality and beauty as is ever traced in his paintings&quot;.

In the 1780s, Gainsborough used a device he called a &quot;Showbox&quot; to compose landscapes and display them backlit on glass. The original box is on display in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum with a reproduction transparency.

He died of cancer on 2 August 1788 at the age of 61. According to his daughter Peggy, his last words were &quot;van Dyck&quot;. He is interred in the churchyard St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew, Surrey, (located on Kew Green). It was his express wish to be buried near his friend Joshua Kirby. Later his wife and nephew Gainsborough Dupont were interred with him. Coincidentally Johan Zoffany and Franz Bauer are also buried in the graveyard. In 2011, an appeal was given to pay the costs of restoration of his tomb, and the tomb was restored in 2012. A street in Kew, Gainsborough Road, is named after him.

==Technique==

The art historian Michael Rosenthal described Gainsborough as &quot;one of the most technically proficient and, at the same time, most experimental artists of his time&quot;. He was noted for the speed with which he applied paint, and he worked more from observations of nature (and of human nature) than from application of formal academic rules. The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused Constable to say, &quot;On looking at them, we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them.&quot;

Gainsborough&#x27;s enthusiasm for landscapes is shown in the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them. His landscapes were often painted at night by candlelight, using a tabletop arrangement of stones, pieces of mirrors, broccoli, and the like as a model. His later work was characterised by a light palette and easy, economical strokes.

Gainsborough&#x27;s only known assistant was his nephew, Gainsborough Dupont.

==Reputation==


His more famous works, &quot;The Blue Boy&quot;; &quot;Mr and Mrs Andrews&quot;; &quot;Portrait of Mrs. Graham&quot;; &quot;Mary and Margaret: The Painter&#x27;s Daughters&quot;; &quot;William Hallett and His Wife Elizabeth, nee Stephen&quot;, known as &quot;The Morning Walk&quot;; and &quot;Cottage Girl with Dog and Pitcher&quot;, display the unique individuality of his subjects. 
His rival, Joshua Reynolds wrote that the painting &quot;Girl with Pigs&quot; was &quot;the best picture he (Gainsborough) ever painted or perhaps ever will&quot;.

Gainsborough&#x27;s works became popular with collectors from the 1850s on, after Lionel de Rothschild began buying his portraits. The rapid rise in the value of pictures by Gainsborough and also by Reynolds in the mid 19th century was partly because the Rothschild family, including Ferdinand de Rothschild began collecting them.

In 2011, Gainsborough&#x27;s portrait of &quot;Miss Read&quot; (Mrs Frances Villebois) was sold by Michael Pearson, 4th Viscount Cowdray, for a record price of £6.54M, at Christie&#x27;s in London. She was a matrilineal descendant of Cecily Neville, Duchess of York.
