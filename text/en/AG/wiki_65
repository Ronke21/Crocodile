<text>The Uyghurs, alternatively spelled Uighurs, Uygurs or Uigurs, are a Turkic ethnic group originating from and culturally affiliated with the general region of Central Asia and East Asia. The Uyghurs are recognized as the titular nationality of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. They are one of China&#x27;s 55 officially recognized ethnic minorities.

The Uyghurs have traditionally inhabited a series of oases scattered across the Taklamakan Desert within the Tarim Basin. These oases have historically existed as independent states or were controlled by many civilizations including China, the Mongols, the Tibetans, and various Turkic polities. The Uyghurs gradually started to become Islamized in the 10th century, and most Uyghurs identified as Muslims by the 16th century. Islam has since played an important role in Uyghur culture and identity.

An estimated 80% of Xinjiang&#x27;s Uyghurs still live in the Tarim Basin. The rest of Xinjiang&#x27;s Uyghurs mostly live in Ürümqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, which is located in the historical region of Dzungaria. The largest community of Uyghurs living outside of Xinjiang are the Taoyuan Uyghurs of north-central Hunan&#x27;s Taoyuan County. Significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs exist in other Turkic countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey. Smaller communities live in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Australia, Russia and Sweden.

Since 2014, the Chinese government has been accused by various organizations, such as Human Rights Watch of subjecting Uyghurs living in Xinjiang to widespread persecution, including forced sterilization and forced labor. Scholars estimate that at least one million Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained in the Xinjiang internment camps since 2017; Chinese government officials claim that these camps, created under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s administration, serve the goals of ensuring adherence to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ideology, preventing separatism, fighting terrorism, and providing vocational training to Uyghurs. Various scholars, human rights organizations and governments consider abuses perpetrated against the Uyghurs to amount to crimes against humanity, or even genocide.

==Etymology==
In the Uyghur language, the ethnonym is written in Arabic script, Уйғур in Uyghur Cyrillic and &quot;Uyghur&quot; or &quot;Uygur&quot; (as the standard Chinese romanization, GB 3304–1991) in Latin; they are all pronounced as . In Chinese, this is transcribed into characters as / , which is romanized in pinyin as &quot;Wéiwú&#x27;ěr&quot;.

In English, the name is officially spelled &quot;Uyghur&quot; by the Xinjiang government but also appears as &quot;Uighur&quot;, &quot;Uigur&quot; and &quot;Uygur&quot; (these reflect the various Cyrillic spellings Уиғур, Уигур and Уйгур). The name is usually pronounced in English as (and thus may be preceded by the indefinite article &quot;a&quot;), although some Uyghurs advocate the use of a more native pronunciation instead (which, in contrast, calls for the indefinite article &quot;an&quot;).

The term&#x27;s original meaning is unclear. Old Turkic inscriptions record the word &quot;uyɣur&quot; (); an example is found on the Sudzi inscription, &quot;I am khan ata of Yaglaqar, came from the Uigur land.&quot; (). It is transcribed into Tang annals as / (Mandarin: &quot;Huíhé&quot;, but probably *[ɣuɒiɣət] in Middle Chinese). It was used as the name of one of the Turkic polities formed in the interim between the First and Second Göktürk Khaganates (AD630–684). The &quot;Old History of the Five Dynasties&quot; records that in 788 or 809, the Chinese acceded to a Uyghur request and emended their transcription to / (Mandarin: &quot;Huíhú&quot;, but [ɣuɒiɣuət] in Middle Chinese).

Modern etymological explanations for the name &quot;Uyghur&quot; range from derivation from the verb &quot;follow, accommodate oneself&quot; and adjective &quot;non-rebellious&quot; (i.e., from Turkic &quot;uy/uð-&quot;) to the verb meaning &quot;wake, rouse or stir&quot; (i.e., from Turkic &quot;oðğur-&quot;). None of these is thought to be satisfactory because the sound shift of /ð/ and /ḏ/ to /j/ does not appear to be in place by this time. The etymology therefore cannot be conclusively determined and its referent is also difficult to fix. The &quot;Huihe&quot; and &quot;Huihu&quot; seem to be a political rather than a tribal designation or it may be one group among several others collectively known as the Toquz Oghuz. The name fell out of use in the 15th century, but was reintroduced in the early 20th century by the Soviet Bolsheviks to replace the previous terms &quot;Turk&quot; and &quot;Turki&quot;. The name is currently used to refer to the settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of the Tarim Basin who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, distinguishable from the nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia.

The earliest record of a Uyghur tribe appears in accounts from the Northern Wei (4th–6th century A.D.), wherein they were named &quot;Yuanhe&quot; (&lt; MC ZS *&quot;ɦʉɐn-ɦət&quot;) and derived from a confederation named / ( &quot;High Carts&quot;), read as &quot;Gāochē&quot; in Mandarin Chinese but originally with the reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciation *[kɑutɕʰĭa], later known as the &quot;Tiele&quot; ( / , &quot;Tiělè&quot;). &quot;Gāochē&quot; in turn has been connected to the Uyghur &quot;Qangqil&quot; ( or Қаңқил).

==Identity==


Throughout its history, the term &quot;Uyghur&quot; has had an increasingly expansive definition. Initially signifying only a small coalition of Tiele tribes in northern China, Mongolia and the Altai Mountains, it later denoted citizenship in the Uyghur Khaganate. Finally, it was expanded into an ethnicity whose ancestry originates with the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 842, causing Uyghur migration from Mongolia into the Tarim Basin. The Uyghurs who moved to the Tarim Basin mixed with the local Tocharians, and converted to the Tocharian religion, and adopted their culture of oasis agriculture. The fluid definition of &quot;Uyghur&quot; and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs create confusion as to what constitutes true Uyghur ethnography and ethnogenesis. Contemporary scholars consider modern Uyghurs to be the descendants of a number of peoples, including the ancient Uyghurs of Mongolia migrating into the Tarim Basin after the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate, Iranic Saka tribes and other Indo-European peoples inhabiting the Tarim Basin before the arrival of the Turkic Uyghurs.

Uyghur activists identify with the Tarim mummies, remains of an ancient people inhabiting the region, but research into the genetics of ancient Tarim mummies and their links with modern Uyghurs remains problematic, both to Chinese government officials concerned with ethnic separatism and to Uyghur activists concerned the research could affect their indigenous claim.

A genomic study published in 2021 found that these early mummies had high levels of Ancient North Eurasian ancestry (ANE, about 72%), with smaller admixture from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA, about 28%), but no detectable Western Steppe-related ancestry. They formed a genetically isolated local population that &quot;adopted neighbouring pastoralist and agriculturalist practices, which allowed them to settle and thrive along the shifting riverine oases of the Taklamakan Desert.&quot; These mummified individuals were long suspected to have been &quot;Proto-Tocharian-speaking pastoralists&quot;, ancestors of the Tocharians, but the authors of this study found no genetic connection with Indo-European-speaking migrants, particularly the Afanasievo or BMAC cultures.

===Origin of modern nomenclature===
The term &quot;Uyghur&quot; was not used to refer to a specific existing ethnicity in the 19th century: it referred to an &#x27;ancient people&#x27;. A late-19th-century encyclopedia entitled &quot;The Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia&quot; said &quot;the Uigur are the most ancient of Turkish tribes and formerly inhabited a part of Chinese Tartary (Xinjiang), now occupied by a mixed population of Turk, Mongol and Kalmuck&quot;. Before 1921/1934, Western writers called the Turkic-speaking Muslims of the oases &quot;Turki&quot; and the Turkic Muslims who had migrated from the Tarim Basin to Ili, Ürümqi and Dzungaria in the northern portion of Xinjiang during the Qing dynasty were known as &quot;Taranchi&quot;, meaning &quot;farmer&quot;. The Russians and other foreigners referred to them as &quot;Sart&quot;, &quot;Turk&quot; or &quot;Turki&quot;. In the early 20th century they identified themselves by different names to different peoples and in response to different inquiries: they called themselves Sarts in front of Kazakhs and Kyrgyz while they called themselves &quot;Chantou&quot; if asked about their identity after first identifying as a Muslim. The term &quot;Chantou&quot; (, meaning &quot;Turban Head&quot;) was used to refer to the Turkic Muslims of Altishahr (now Southern Xinjiang), including by Hui (Tungan) people. These groups of peoples often identify themselves by their originating oasis instead of an ethnicity; for example those from Kashgar may refer to themselves as Kashgarliq or Kashgari, while those from Hotan identity themselves as &quot;Hotani&quot;. Other Central Asians once called all the inhabitants of Xinjiang&#x27;s Southern oases Kashgari, a term still used in some regions of Pakistan. The Turkic people also used &quot;Musulman&quot;, which means &quot;Muslim&quot;, to describe themselves.
Rian Thum explored the concepts of identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in Altishahr (the native Uyghur name for Eastern Turkestan or Southern Xinjiang) before the adoption of the name &quot;Uyghur&quot; in the 1930s, referring to them by the name &quot;Altishahri&quot; in his article &quot;Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism&quot;. Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did have a sense that they were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west, the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz, the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq and the Han Chinese Khitay before they became known as Uyghurs. There was no single name used for their identity; various native names Altishahris used for identify were Altishahrlik (Altishahr person), yerlik (local), Turki and Musulmān (Muslim); the term Musulmān in this situation did not signify religious connotations, because the Altishahris exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz while identifying themselves as Musulmān. Dr. Laura J Newby says the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people considered themselves separate from other Turkic Muslims since at least the 19th century.

The name &quot;Uyghur&quot; reappeared after the Soviet Union took the 9th-century ethnonym from the Uyghur Khaganate, then reapplied it to all non-nomadic Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang. It followed western European orientalists like Julius Klaproth in the 19th century who revived the name and spread the use of the term to local Turkic intellectuals and a 19th-century proposal from Russian historians that modern-day Uyghurs were descended from the Kingdom of Qocho and Kara-Khanid Khanate formed after the dissolution of the Uyghur Khaganate. Historians generally agree that the adoption of the term &quot;Uyghur&quot; is based on a decision from a 1921 conference in Tashkent, attended by Turkic Muslims from the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang). There, &quot;Uyghur&quot; was chosen by them as the name of their ethnicity, although they themselves note that they were not to be confused with the Uyghur Khaganate of medieval history. According to Linda Benson, the Soviets and their client Sheng Shicai intended to foster a Uyghur nationality to divide the Muslim population of Xinjiang, whereas the various Turkic Muslim peoples preferred to identify themselves as &quot;Turki&quot;, &quot;East Turkestani&quot; or &quot;Muslim&quot;.

On the other hand, the ruling regime of China at that time, the Kuomintang, grouped all Muslims, including the Turkic-speaking people of Xinjiang, into the &quot;Hui nationality&quot;. The Qing dynasty and the Kuomintang generally referred to the sedentary oasis-dwelling Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang as &quot;turban-headed Hui&quot; to differentiate them from other predominantly Muslim ethnicities in China. In the 1930s, foreigners travelers in Xinjiang such as George W. Hunter, Peter Fleming, Ella Maillart and Sven Hedin, referred to the Turkic Muslims of the region as &quot;Turki&quot; in their books. Use of the term Uyghur was unknown in Xinjiang until 1934. The area governor, Sheng Shicai, came to power, adopting the Soviet ethnographic classification instead of the Kuomintang&#x27;s and became the first to promulgate the official use of the term &quot;Uyghur&quot; to describe the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang. &quot;Uyghur&quot; replaced &quot;rag-head&quot;.

Sheng Shicai&#x27;s introduction of the &quot;Uighur&quot; name for the Turkic people of Xinjiang was criticized and rejected by Turki intellectuals such as Pan-Turkist Jadids and East Turkestan independence activists Muhammad Amin Bughra (Mehmet Emin) and Masud Sabri. They demanded the names &quot;Türk&quot; or &quot;Türki&quot; be used instead as the ethnonyms for their people. Masud Sabri viewed the Hui people as Muslim Han Chinese and separate from his people, while Bughrain criticized Sheng for his designation of Turkic Muslims into different ethnicities which could sow disunion among Turkic Muslims. After the Communist victory, the Chinese Communist Party under Chairman Mao Zedong continued the Soviet classification, using the term &quot;Uyghur&quot; to describe the modern ethnicity.

In current usage, &quot;Uyghur&quot; refers to settled Turkic-speaking urban dwellers and farmers of the Tarim Basin and Ili who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia. However, Chinese government agents designate as &quot;Uyghur&quot; certain peoples with significantly divergent histories and ancestries from the main group. These include the Lopliks of Ruoqiang County and the Dolan people, thought to be closer to the Oirat Mongols and the Kyrgyz. The use of the term Uyghur led to anachronisms when describing the history of the people. In one of his books, the term Uyghur was deliberately not used by James Millward.

Another ethnicity, the Western Yugur of Gansu, identify themselves as the &quot;Yellow Uyghur&quot; (&quot;Sarïq Uyghur&quot;). Some scholars say the Yugurs&#x27; culture, language and religion are closer to the original culture of the original Uyghur Karakorum state than is the culture of the modern Uyghur people of Xinjiang. Linguist and ethnographer S. Robert Ramsey argues for inclusion of both the Eastern and Western Yugur and the Salar as sub-groups of the Uyghur based on similar historical roots for the Yugur and on perceived linguistic similarities for the Salar.

&quot;&quot;Turkistani&quot; is used as an alternate ethnonym by some Uyghurs. For example, the Uyghur diaspora in Arabia, adopted the identity &quot;&quot;Turkistani&quot;. Some Uyghurs in Saudi Arabia adopted the Arabic nisba of their home city, such as &quot;Al-Kashgari&quot;&quot; from Kashgar. Saudi-born Uyghur Hamza Kashgari&#x27;s family originated from Kashgar.

==Population==

The Uyghur population within China generally remains centered in Xinjiang region with some smaller subpopulations elsewhere in the country, such as in Taoyuan County where an estimated 5,000–10,000 live.

The size of the Uyghur population, particularly in China, has been the subject of dispute. Chinese authorities place the Uyghur population within the Xinjiang region to be just over 12 million, comprising approximately half of the total regional population. As early as 2003, however, some Uyghur groups wrote that their population was being vastly undercounted by Chinese authorities, claiming that their population actually exceeded 20 million. Population disputes have continued into the present, with some activists and groups such as the World Uyghur Congress and Uyghur American Association claiming that the Uyghur population ranges between 20 and 30 million. Some have even claimed that the real number of Uyghurs is actually 35 million. Scholars, however, have generally rejected these claims, with Professor Dru C. Gladney writing in the 2004 book &quot;&quot; that there is &quot;scant evidence&quot; to support Uyghur claims that their population within China exceeds 20 million.

===Genetics===

A study of mitochondrial DNA (2004) (therefore the matrilineal genetic contribution) found the frequency of Western Eurasian-specific haplogroup in Uyghurs to be 42.6% and East Asian haplogroup to be 57.4%. Uyghurs in Kazakhstan on the other hand were shown to have 55% European/Western Eurasian maternal mtDNA.

A study based on paternal DNA (2005) shows West Eurasian haplogroups (J and R) in Uyghurs make up 65% to 70% and East Asian haplogroups (C, N, D and O) 30% to 35%.
One study by Xu et al. (2008), using samples from Hetian (Hotan) only, found Uyghurs have about an average of 60% European or West Asian (Western Eurasian) ancestry and about 40% East Asian or Siberian ancestry (Eastern Eurasian). From the same area, it is found that the proportion of Uyghur individuals with European/West Asian ancestry ranges individually from 40.3% to 84.3% while their East Asian/Siberian ancestry ranges individually from 15.7% to 59.7%. Further study by the same team showed an average of slightly greater European/West Asian component at 52% (ranging individually from 44.9% to 63.1%) in the Uyghur population in southern Xinjiang but only 47% (ranging individually from 30% to 55%) in the northern Uyghur population.

A different study by Li et al. (2009) used a larger sample of individuals from a wider area and found a higher East Asian component of about 70% on average, while the European/West Asian component was about 30%. Overall, Uyghur show relative more similarity to &quot;Western East Asians&quot; than to &quot;Eastern East Asians&quot;. The authors also cite anthropologic studies which also estimate about 30% &quot;Western proportions&quot;, which are in agreement with their genetic results.

A study (2013) based on autosomal DNA shows that average Uyghurs are closest to other Turkic people in Central Asia and China as well as various Chinese populations. The analysis of the diversity of cytochrome B further suggests Uyghurs are closer to Chinese and Siberian populations than to various Caucasoid groups in West Asia or Europe. However, there is significant genetic distance between the Xinjiang&#x27;s southern Uyghurs and Chinese population, but not between the northern Uyghurs and Chinese.

A Study (2016) of Uyghur males living in southern Xinjiang used high-resolution 26 Y-STR loci system high-resolution to infer the genetic relationships between the Uyghur population and European and Asian populations. The results showed the Uyghur population of southern Xinjiang exhibited a genetic admixture of Eastern Asian and European populations but with slightly closer relationship with European populations than to Eastern Asian populations.

An extensive genome study in 2017 analyzed 951 samples of Uyghurs from 14 geographical subpopulations in Xinjiang and observed a southwest and northeast differentiation in the population, partially caused by the Tianshan Mountains which form a natural barrier, with gene flows from the east and west. The study identifies four major ancestral components that may have arisen from two earlier admixed groups: one that migrated from the west harboring a West-Eurasian component associated with European ancestry (25–37%) and a South Asian ancestry component (12–20%) and one from the east, harboring a Siberian ancestry component (15–17%) and an East Asian ancestry component (29–47%). In total, Uyghurs on average are 33.3% West Eurasian, 32.9% East Asian, 17.9% South Asian, and 16% Siberian. Western parts of Xinjiang are more West Eurasian components than East Eurasian. It suggests at least two major waves of admixture, one ~3,750 years ago coinciding with the age range of the mummies with European feature found in Xinjiang, and another occurring around 750 years ago.

A 2018 study of 206 Uyghur samples from Xinjiang, using the ancestry-informative SNP (AISNP) analysis, found that the average genetic ancestry of Uyghurs is 63.7% East Asian-related and 36.3% European-related.

==History==

The history of the Uyghur people, as with the ethnic origin of the people, is a matter of contention. Uyghur historians viewed the Uyghurs as the original inhabitants of Xinjiang with a long history. Uyghur politician and historian Muhammad Amin Bughra wrote in his book &quot;A History of East Turkestan&quot;, stressing the Turkic aspects of his people, that the Turks have a continuous 9000-year-old history, while historian Turghun Almas incorporated discoveries of Tarim mummies to conclude that Uyghurs have over 6400 years of continuous history, and the World Uyghur Congress claimed a 4,000-year history in East Turkestan. However, the official Chinese view, as documented in the white paper &quot;History and Development of Xinjiang&quot;, asserts that the Uyghur ethnic group formed after the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, when the local residents of the Tarim Basin and its surrounding areas were merged with migrants from the khaganate. The name &quot;Uyghur&quot; reappeared after the Soviet Union took the 9th-century ethnonym from the Uyghur Khaganate, then reapplied it to all non-nomadic Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang. Many contemporary western scholars, however, do not consider the modern Uyghurs to be of direct linear descent from the old Uyghur Khaganate of Mongolia. Rather, they consider them to be descendants of a number of peoples, one of them the ancient Uyghurs.

===Early history===
Discovery of well-preserved Tarim mummies of a people European in appearance indicates the migration of a European-looking people into the Tarim area at the beginning of the Bronze Age around 1800 BC. These people may have been of Tocharian origin, and some have suggested them to be the Yuezhi mentioned in ancient Chinese texts. The Tocharians are thought to have developed from the Indo-European speaking Afanasevo culture of Southern Siberia (c. 3500–2500 BC). A study published in 2021 showed that the earliest Tarim Basin cultures had high levels of Ancient North Eurasian ancestry, with smaller admixture from Northeast Asians. Uyghur activist Turgun Almas claimed that Tarim mummies were Uyghurs because the earliest Uyghurs practiced shamanism and the buried mummies&#x27; orientation suggests that they had been shamanists; meanwhile, Qurban Wäli claimed words written in Kharosthi and Sogdian scripts as &quot;Uyghur&quot; rather than Sogdian words absorbed into Uyghur according to other linguists.

Later migrations brought peoples from the west and northwest to the Xinjiang region, probably speakers of various Iranian languages such as the Saka tribes, who were closely related to the European Scythians and descended from the earlier Andronovo culture, and who may have been present in the Khotan and Kashgar area in the first millennium BC, as well as the Sogdians who formed networks of trading communities across the Tarim Basin from the 4th century AD. There may also be an Indian component as the founding legend of Khotan suggests that the city was founded by Indians from ancient Taxila during the reign of Ashoka. Other people in the region mentioned in ancient Chinese texts include the Dingling as well as the Xiongnu who fought for supremacy in the region against the Chinese for several hundred years. Some Uyghur nationalists also claimed descent from the Xiongnu (according to the Chinese historical text the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, the founder of the Uyghurs was descended from a Xiongnu ruler), but the view is contested by modern Chinese scholars.

The Yuezhi were driven away by the Xiongnu but founded the Kushan Empire, which exerted some influence in the Tarim Basin, where Kharosthi texts have been found in Loulan, Niya and Khotan. Loulan and Khotan were some of the many city-states that existed in the Xinjiang region during the Han dynasty; others include Kucha, Turfan, Karasahr and Kashgar. These kingdoms in the Tarim Basin came under the control of China during the Han and Tang dynasties. During the Tang dynasty they were conquered and placed under the control of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West, and the Indo-European cultures of these kingdoms never recovered from Tang rule after thousands of their inhabitants were killed during the conquest. The settled population of these cities later merged with the incoming Turkic people, including the Uyghurs of Uyghur Khaganate, to form the modern Uyghurs. The Indo-European Tocharian language later disappeared as the urban population switched to a Turkic language such as the Old Uyghur language.

The early Turkic peoples descended from agricultural communities in Northeast Asia who moved westwards into Mongolia in the late 3rd millennium BC, where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle. By the early 1st millennium BC, these peoples had become equestrian nomads. In subsequent centuries, the steppe populations of Central Asia appear to have been progressively Turkified by East Asian nomadic Turks, moving out of Mongolia.

=== Uyghur Khaganate (8th–9th centuries) ===
The Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate were part of a Turkic confederation called the Tiele, who lived in the valleys south of Lake Baikal and around the Yenisei River. They overthrew the First Turkic Khaganate and established the Uyghur Khaganate.

The Uyghur Khaganate lasted from 744 to 840. It was administered from the imperial capital Ordu-Baliq, one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia. In 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the Yenisei Kirghiz, another Turkic people. As a result, the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control dispersed and moved out of Mongolia.

===Uyghur kingdoms (9th–11th centuries)===
The Uyghurs who founded the Uyghur Khaganate dispersed after the fall of the Khaganate, to live among the Karluks and to places such as Jimsar, Turpan and Gansu. These Uyghurs soon founded two kingdoms and the easternmost state was the Ganzhou Kingdom (870–1036) which ruled parts of Xinjiang, with its capital near present-day Zhangye, Gansu, China. The modern Yugurs are believed to be descendants of these Uyghurs. Ganzhou was absorbed by the Western Xia in 1036.

The second Uyghur kingdom, the Kingdom of Qocho ruled a larger section of Xinjiang, also known as &quot;Uyghuristan&quot; in its later period, was founded in the Turpan area with its capital in Qocho (modern Gaochang) and Beshbalik. The Kingdom of Qocho lasted from the ninth to the fourteenth century and proved to be longer-lasting than any power in the region, before or since. The Uyghurs were originally Tengrists, shamanists, and Manichaean, but converted to Buddhism during this period. Qocho accepted the Qara Khitai as its overlord in the 1130s, and in 1209 submitted voluntarily to the rising Mongol Empire. The Uyghurs of Kingdom of Qocho were allowed significant autonomy and played an important role as civil servants to the Mongol Empire, but was finally destroyed by the Chagatai Khanate by the end of the 14th century.

===Islamization===

In the tenth century, the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils and other Turkic tribes founded the Kara-Khanid Khanate in Semirechye, Western Tian Shan, and Kashgaria and later conquered Transoxiana. The Karakhanid rulers were likely to be Yaghmas who were associated with the Toquz Oghuz and some historians therefore see this as a link between the Karakhanid and the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate, although this connection is disputed by others.

The Karakhanids converted to Islam in the tenth century beginning with Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, the first Turkic dynasty to do so. Modern Uyghurs see the Muslim Karakhanids as an important part of their history; however, Islamization of the people of the Tarim Basin was a gradual process. The Indo-Iranian Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was conquered by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanids from Kashgar in the early 11th century, but Uyghur Qocho remained mainly Buddhist until the 15th century, and the conversion of the Uyghur people to Islam was not completed until the 17th century.

The 12th and 13th century saw the domination by non-Muslim powers: first the Kara-Khitans in the 12th century, followed by the Mongols in the 13th century. After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, Transoxiana and Kashgar became the domain of his second son, Chagatai Khan. The Chagatai Khanate split into two in the 1340s, and the area of the Chagatai Khanate where the modern Uyghurs live became part of Moghulistan, which meant &quot;land of the Mongols&quot;. In the 14th century, a Chagatayid khan Tughluq Temür converted to Islam, Genghisid Mongol nobilities also followed him to convert to Islam. His son Khizr Khoja conquered Qocho and Turfan (the core of Uyghuristan) in the 1390s, and the Uyghurs there became largely Muslim by the beginning of the 16th century. After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the &quot;infidel Kalmuks&quot; (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist structures in their area.

From the late 14th through 17th centuries, the Xinjiang region became further subdivided into Moghulistan in the north, Altishahr (Kashgar and the Tarim Basin), and the Turfan area, each often ruled separately by competing Chagatayid descendants, the Dughlats, and later the Khojas.

Islam was also spread by the Sufis, and branches of its Naqshbandi order were the Khojas who seized control of political and military affairs in the Tarim Basin and Turfan in the 17th century. The Khojas however split into two rival factions, the &quot;Aqtaghlik&quot; (&quot;White Mountainers&quot;) Khojas (also called the Afaqiyya) and the &quot;Qarataghlik&quot; (&quot;Black Mountainers&quot;) Khojas (also called the Ishaqiyya). The legacy of the Khojas lasted until the 19th century. The Qarataghlik Khojas seized power in Yarkand where the Chagatai Khans ruled in the Yarkent Khanate, forcing the Aqtaghlik Afaqi Khoja into exile.

===Qing rule===

In the 17th century, the Buddhist Dzungar Khanate grew in power in Dzungaria. The Dzungar conquest of Altishahr ended the last independent Chagatai Khanate, the Yarkent Khanate, after the Aqtaghlik Afaq Khoja sought aid from the 5th Dalai Lama and his Dzungar Buddhist followers to help him in his struggle against the Qarataghlik Khojas. The Aqtaghlik Khojas in the Tarim Basin then became vassals to the Dzungars.

The expansion of the Dzungars into Khalkha Mongol territory in Mongolia brought them into direct conflict with Qing China in the late 17th century, and in the process also brought Chinese presence back into the region a thousand years after Tang China lost control of the Western Regions.
The Dzungar–Qing War lasted a decade. During the Dzungar conflict, two Aqtaghlik brothers, the so-called &quot;Younger Khoja&quot; (), also known as Khwāja-i Jahān, and his sibling, the Elder Khoja (), also known as Burhān al-Dīn, after being appointed as vassals in the Tarim Basin by the Dzungars, first joined the Qing and rebelled against Dzungar rule until the final Qing victory over the Dzungars, then they rebelled against the Qing in the Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas (1757–1759), an action which prompted the invasion and conquest of the Tarim Basin by the Qing in 1759. The Uyghurs of Turfan and Hami such as Emin Khoja were allies of the Qing in this conflict, and these Uyghurs also helped the Qing rule the Altishahr Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin.

The final campaign against the Dzungars in the 1750s ended with the Dzungar genocide. The Qing &quot;final solution&quot; of genocide to solve the problem of the Dzungar Mongols created a land devoid of Dzungars, which was followed by the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of other people in Dzungaria. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, Daurs, Solons, Turkic Muslim Taranchis and Kazakh colonists, with one third of Xinjiang&#x27;s total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern area, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang&#x27;s Tarim Basin. In Dzungaria, the Qing established new cities like Ürümqi and Yining. The Dzungarian basin itself is now inhabited by many Kazakhs. The Qing therefore unified Xinjiang and changed its demographic composition as well. The crushing of the Buddhist Dzungars by the Qing led to the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang, migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang, and increasing Turkic Muslim power, with Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing. It was therefore argued by Henry Schwarz that &quot;the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam&quot;.

In Beijing, a community of Uyghurs was clustered around the mosque near the Forbidden City, having moved to Beijing in the 18th century.

The Ush rebellion in 1765 by Uyghurs against the Manchus occurred after several incidents of misrule and abuse that had caused considerable anger and resentment. The Manchu Emperor ordered that the Uyghur rebel town be massacred, and the men were executed and the women and children enslaved.

===Yettishar===
During the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877), Andijani Uzbeks from the Khanate of Kokand under Buzurg Khan and Yaqub Beg expelled Qing officials from parts of southern Xinjiang and founded an independent Kashgarian kingdom called Yettishar (&quot;Country of Seven Cities&quot;). Under the leadership of Yaqub Beg, it included Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, Aksu, Kucha, Korla, and Turpan. Large Qing dynasty forces under Chinese General Zuo Zongtang attacked Yettishar in 1876.

===Qing reconquest===
After this invasion, the two regions of Dzungaria, which had been known as the Dzungar region or the Northern marches of the Tian Shan, and the Tarim Basin, which had been known as &quot;Muslim land&quot; or southern marches of the Tian Shan, were reorganized into a province named &quot;Xinjiang&quot;, meaning &quot;New Territory&quot;.

===First East Turkestan Republic===
In 1912, the Qing dynasty was replaced by the Republic of China. By 1920, Pan-Turkic Jadidists had become a challenge to Chinese warlord Yang Zengxin, who controlled Xinjiang. Uyghurs staged several uprisings against Chinese rule. In 1931, the Kumul Rebellion erupted, leading to the establishment of an independent government in Khotan in 1932, which later led to the creation of the First East Turkestan Republic, officially known as the Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan. Uyghurs joined with Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz and successfully declared their independence on 12 November 1933. The First East Turkestan Republic was a short-lived attempt at independence around the areas encompassing Kashgar, Yarkent, and Khotan, and it was attacked during the Qumul Rebellion by a Chinese Muslim army under General Ma Zhancang and Ma Fuyuan and fell following the Battle of Kashgar (1934). The Soviets backed Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai&#x27;s rule over East Turkestan/Xinjiang from 1934 to 1943. In April 1937, remnants of the First East Turkestan Republic launched an uprising known as the Islamic Rebellion in Xinjiang and briefly established an independent government, controlling areas from Atush, Kashgar, Yarkent, and even parts of Khotan, before it was crushed in October 1937, following Soviet intervention. Sheng Shicai purged 50,000 to 100,000 people, mostly Uyghurs, following this uprising.

===Second East Turkestan Republic===
The oppressive reign of Sheng Shicai fueled discontent by Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of the region, and Sheng expelled Soviet advisors following U.S. support for the Kuomintang of the Republic of China. This led the Soviets to capitalize on the Uyghur and other Turkic people&#x27;s discontent in the region, culminating in their support of the Ili Rebellion in October 1944. The Ili Rebellion resulted in the establishment of the Second East Turkestan Republic on 12 November 1944, in the three districts of what is now the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. Several pro-KMT Uyghurs like Isa Yusuf Alptekin, Memet Emin Bugra, and Mesut Sabri opposed the Second East Turkestan Republic and supported the Republic of China. In the summer of 1949, the Soviets purged the thirty top leaders of the Second East Turkestan Republic and its five top officials died in a mysterious plane crash on 27 August 1949. On 13 October 1949, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army entered the region and the East Turkestan National Army was merged into the PLA&#x27;s 5th Army Corps, leading to the official end of the Second East Turkestan Republic on 22 December 1949.

===Contemporary era===

Mao declared the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 October 1949. He turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and appointed Saifuddin Azizi as the region&#x27;s first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries. The name Xinjiang was changed to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where Uyghurs are the largest ethnicity, mostly concentrated in the south-western Xinjiang.

The Xinjiang conflict is a separatist conflict in China&#x27;s far-west province of Xinjiang, whose northern region is known as Dzungaria and whose southern region (the Tarim Basin) is known as East Turkestan. Uyghur separatists and independence groups claim that the Second East Turkestan Republic was illegally incorporated by China in 1949 and has since been under Chinese occupation.
Uyghur identity remains fragmented, as some support a Pan-Islamic vision, exemplified by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, while others support a Pan-Turkic vision, such as the East Turkestan Liberation Organization. A third group which includes the Uyghur American Association supports a western liberal vision and hopes for a US-led intervention into Xinjiang. Some Uyghur fighters in Syria have also studied Zionism as a model for their homeland. As a result, &quot;no Uyghur or East Turkestan group speaks for all Uyghurs&quot;, and Uyghurs in Pan-Turkic and Pan-Islamic camps have committed violence including assassinations on other Uyghurs who they think are too assimilated to Chinese society. Uyghur activists like Rebiya Kadeer have mainly tried to garner international support for Uyghurs, including the right to demonstrate, although China&#x27;s government has accused her of orchestrating the deadly July 2009 Ürümqi riots.

Eric Enno Tamm&#x27;s 2011 book stated that &quot;authorities have censored Uyghur writers and &#x27;lavished funds&#x27; on official histories that depict Chinese territorial expansion into ethnic borderlands as &#x27;unifications (tongyi), never as conquests (zhengfu) or annexations (tunbing)&#x27; &quot;

====Human rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang====
In 2014, the Chinese government announced a &quot;people&#x27;s war on terror&quot;. Since then, Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been affected by extensive controls and restrictions which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese government has imposed upon their religious, cultural, economic and social lives. In order to forcibly assimilate them, the government has arbitrarily detained more than an estimated one million Uyghurs in internment camps. Human Rights Watch says that the camps have been used to indoctrinate Uyghurs and other Muslims since 2017.

Leaked Chinese government operating procedures state that the main feature of the camps is to ensure adherence to CCP ideology, with the inmates being continuously held captive in the camps for a minimum of 12 months depending on their performance on Chinese ideology tests. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has reported inmates are required to &quot;sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write &#x27;self-criticism&#x27; essays,&quot; and that prisoners are also subjected to physical and verbal abuse by prison guards. Chinese officials have sometimes assigned to monitor the families of current inmates, and women have been detained due to actions by their sons or husbands.

Other policies have included forced labor, suppression of Uyghur religious practices, political indoctrination, severe ill-treatment, forced sterilization, forced contraception, and forced abortion. According to German researcher Adrian Zenz, hundreds of thousands of children have been forcibly separated from their parents and sent to boarding schools. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimates that some sixteen thousand mosques have been razed or damaged since 2017. Associated Press reported that from 2015 to 2018, birth rates in the mostly Uyghur regions of Hotan and Kashgar fell by more than 60%, compared to a decrease by 9.69% in the whole country. The allegation of Uyghur birth rates being lower than those of Han Chinese have been disputed by pundits from &quot;Pakistan Observer&quot;, Antara, and Detik.com. The policies have drawn widespread condemnation, with some characterizing them as a genocide. In an assessment by the UN Human Rights Office, the United Nations (UN) stated that China&#x27;s policies and actions in the Xinjiang region may be crimes against humanity, although it did not use the term genocide. The United States and legislatures in several countries have described the policies as a genocide. The Chinese government denies having committed human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

== Uyghurs of Taoyuan, Hunan ==
Around 5,000 Uyghurs live around Taoyuan County and other parts of Changde in Hunan province. They are descended from Hala Bashi, a Uyghur leader from Turpan (Kingdom of Qocho), and his Uyghur soldiers sent to Hunan by the Ming Emperor in the 14th century to crush the Miao rebels during the Miao Rebellions in the Ming dynasty. The 1982 census recorded 4,000 Uyghurs in Hunan. They have genealogies which survive 600 years later to the present day. Genealogy keeping is a Han Chinese custom which the Hunan Uyghurs adopted. These Uyghurs were given the surname Jian by the Emperor. There is some confusion as to whether they practice Islam or not. Some say that they have assimilated with the Han and do not practice Islam anymore and only their genealogies indicate their Uyghur ancestry. Chinese news sources report that they are Muslim.

The Uyghur troops led by Hala were ordered by the Ming Emperor to crush Miao rebellions and were given titles by him. Jian is the predominant surname among the Uyghur in Changde, Hunan. Another group of Uyghur have the surname Sai. Hui and Uyghur have intermarried in the Hunan area. The Hui are descendants of Arabs and Han Chinese who intermarried and they share the Islamic religion with the Uyghur in Hunan. It is reported that they now number around 10,000 people. The Uyghurs in Changde are not very religious and eat pork. Older Uyghurs disapprove of this, especially elders at the mosques in Changde and they seek to draw them back to Islamic customs.

In addition to eating pork, the Uyghurs of Changde Hunan practice other Han Chinese customs, like ancestor worship at graves. Some Uyghurs from Xinjiang visit the Hunan Uyghurs out of curiosity or interest. Also, the Uyghurs of Hunan do not speak the Uyghur language, instead, they speak Chinese as their native language and Arabic for religious reasons at the mosque.

==Culture==
===Religion===
The ancient Uyghurs believed in many local deities. These practices gave rise to shamanism and Tengrism. Uyghurs also practiced aspects of Zoroastrianism such as fire altars, and adopted Manichaeism as a state religion for the Uyghur Khaganate, possibly in 762 or 763. Ancient Uyghurs also practiced Buddhism after they moved to Qocho, and some believed in Church of the East.

People in the Western Tarim Basin region began their conversion to Islam early in the Kara-Khanid Khanate period. Some pre-Islamic practices continued under Muslim rule; for example, while the Quran dictated many rules on marriage and divorce, other pre-Islamic principles based on Zoroastrianism also helped shape the laws of the land. There had been Christian conversions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but these were suppressed by the First East Turkestan Republic government agents. Because of persecution, the churches were destroyed and the believers were scattered. According to the national census, 0.5% or 1,142 Uyghurs in Kazakhstan were Christians in 2009.

Modern Uyghurs are primarily Muslim and they are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China after the Hui. The majority of modern Uyghurs are Sunnis, although additional conflicts exist between Sufi and non-Sufi religious orders. While modern Uyghurs consider Islam to be part of their identity, religious observance varies between different regions. In general, Muslims in the southern region, Kashgar in particular, are more conservative. For example, women wearing the veil (a piece of cloth covering the head completely) are more common in Kashgar than some other cities. The veil, however, has been banned in cities such as Ürümqi since 2014 after it became more popular there.

There is also a general split between the Uyghurs and the Hui Muslims in Xinjiang and they normally worship in different mosques. The Chinese government discourages religious worship among the Uyghurs, and there is evidence of thousands of Uyghur mosques including historic ones being destroyed. According to a 2020 Australian Strategic Policy Institute report, Chinese authorities since 2017 have destroyed or damaged 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang.

In the early 21st century, a new trend of Islam, Salafism, emerged in Xinjiang, mostly among the Turkic population including Uyghurs, although there are Hui Salafis. These Salafis tended to demonstrate pan-Islamism and abandoned nationalism in favor of a caliphate to rule Xinjiang in the event of independence from China. Many Uyghur Salafis have allied themselves with the Turkistan Islamic Party in response to growing repression of Uyghurs by China.

===Language===

The ancient people of the Tarim Basin originally spoke different languages, such as Tocharian, Saka (Khotanese), and Gandhari. The Turkic people who moved into the region in the 9th century brought with them their languages, which slowly supplanted the original tongues of the local inhabitants. In the 11th century, Mahmud al-Kashgari noted that the Uyghurs (of Qocho) spoke a pure Turkic language, but they also still spoke another language among themselves and had two different scripts. He also noted that the people of Khotan did not know Turkic well and had their own language and script (Khotanese). Writers of the Karakhanid period, Al-Kashgari and Yusuf Balasagun, referred to their Turkic language as &quot;Khāqāniyya&quot; (meaning royal) or the &quot;language of Kashgar&quot; or simply Turkic.

The modern Uyghur language is classified under the Karluk branch of the Turkic language family. It is closely related to Äynu, Lop, Ili Turki and Chagatay (the East Karluk languages) and slightly less closely to Uzbek (which is West Karluk). The Uyghur language is an agglutinative language and has a subject-object-verb word order. It has vowel harmony like other Turkic languages and has noun and verb cases but lacks distinction of gender forms.

Modern Uyghurs have adopted a number of scripts for their language. The Arabic script, known as the Chagatay alphabet, was adopted along with Islam. This alphabet is known as Kona Yëziq (old script). Political changes in the 20th century led to numerous reforms of the scripts, for example the Cyrillic-based Uyghur Cyrillic alphabet, a Latin Uyghur New Script and later a reformed Uyghur Arabic alphabet, which represents all vowels, unlike Kona Yëziq. A new Latin version, the Uyghur Latin alphabet, was also devised in the 21st century.

In the 1990s, many Uyghurs in parts of Xinjiang could not speak Mandarin Chinese.

===Literature===

The literary works of the ancient Uyghurs were mostly translations of Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, but there were also narrative, poetic and epic works apparently original to the Uyghurs. However it is the literature of the Kara-Khanid period that is considered by modern Uyghurs to be the important part of their literary traditions. Among these are Islamic religious texts and histories of Turkic peoples, and important works surviving from that era are &quot;Kutadgu Bilig&quot;, &quot;Wisdom of Royal Glory&quot; by Yusuf Khass Hajib (1069–70), Mahmud al-Kashgari&#x27;s &quot;Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk&quot;, &quot;A Dictionary of Turkic Dialects&quot; (1072) and Ehmed Yükneki&#x27;s &quot;Etebetulheqayiq&quot;. Modern Uyghur religious literature includes the Taẕkirah, biographies of Islamic religious figures and saints. The Turki language &quot;Tadhkirah i Khwajagan&quot; was written by M. Sadiq Kashghari. Between the 1600s and 1900s many Turki-language tazkirah manuscripts devoted to stories of local sultans, martyrs and saints were written. Perhaps the most famous and best-loved pieces of modern Uyghur literature are Abdurehim Ötkür&#x27;s &quot;Iz&quot;, &quot;Oyghanghan Zimin&quot;, Zordun Sabir&#x27;s &quot;Anayurt&quot; and Ziya Samedi&#x27;s novels &quot;Mayimkhan&quot; and &quot;Mystery of the years&quot;.

Exiled Uyghur writers and poets, such as Muyesser Abdul&#x27;ehed, use literature to highlight the issues facing their community.

===Music===

Muqam is the classical musical style. The 12 Muqams are the national oral epic of the Uyghurs. The muqam system was developed among the Uyghur in northwestern China and Central Asia over approximately the last 1500 years from the Arabic maqamat modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of Eurasia and North Africa. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of Xinjiang, such as Dolan, Ili, Kumul and Turpan. The most fully developed at this point is the Western Tarim region&#x27;s 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded by the traditional performers Turdi Akhun and Omar Akhun among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvized their songs, as in Turkish taksim performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.

The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang has been designated by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

Amannisa Khan, sometimes called Amanni Shahan (1526–1560), is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam. Russian scholar Pantusov writes that the Uyghurs manufactured their own musical instruments, they had 62 different kinds of musical instruments, and in every Uyghur home there used to be an instrument called a &quot;duttar&quot;.

Uzbek composer Shakhida Shaimardanova uses themes from Uyghur folk music in her compositions.

===Dance===

Sanam is a popular folk dance among the Uyghur people. It is commonly danced by people at weddings, festive occasions, and parties. The dance may be performed with singing and musical accompaniment. Sama is a form of group dance for Newruz (New Year) and other festivals. Other dances include the Dolan dances, Shadiyane, and Nazirkom. Some dances may alternate between singing and dancing, and Uyghur hand-drums called &quot;dap&quot; are commonly used as accompaniment for Uyghur dances.

===Art===

During the late-19th and early-20th centuries, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region of Xinjiang&#x27;s Silk Road discovered numerous cave temples, monastery ruins, and wall paintings, as well as miniatures, books, and documents. There are 77 rock-cut caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with round arch ceilings often divided into four sections, each with a mural of Buddha. The effect is of an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some ceilings are painted with a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Indians, Persians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naïve while others are masterpieces of religious art.

===Education===
Historically, the education level of Old Uyghur people was higher than the other ethnicities around them. The Buddhist Uyghurs of Qocho became the civil servants of Mongol Empire and Old Uyghur Buddhists enjoyed a high status in the Mongol empire. They also introduced the written script for the Mongolian language. In the Islamic era, education was provided by the mosques and madrassas. During the Qing era, Chinese Confucian schools were also set up in Xinjiang and in the late 19th century Christian missionary schools.

In the late nineteenth and early 20th century, schools were often located in mosques and madrassas. Mosques ran informal schools, known as mektep or &quot;maktab&quot;, attached to the mosques, The &quot;maktab&quot; provided most of the education and its curriculum was primarily religious and oral. Boys and girls might be taught in separate schools, some of which offered modern secular subjects in the early 20th century. In madrasas, poetry, logic, Arabic grammar and Islamic law were taught. In the early 20th century, the Jadidists Turkic Muslims from Russia spread new ideas on education and popularized the identity of &quot;Turkestani&quot;.

In more recent times, religious education is highly restricted in Xinjiang and the Chinese authority had sought to eradicate any religious school they considered illegal. Although Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools ()) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government in Hui Muslim areas since the 1980s, this policy does not extend to schools in Xinjiang due to fear of separatism.

Beginning in the early 20th century, secular education became more widespread. Early in the communist era, Uyghurs had a choice of two separate secular school systems, one conducted in their own language and one offering instructions only in Chinese. Many Uyghurs linked the preservation of their cultural and religious identity with the language of instruction in schools and therefore preferred Uyghur language schools. However, from the mid-1980s onward, the Chinese government began to reduce teaching in Uyghur and starting mid-1990s also began to merge some schools from the two systems. By 2002, Xinjiang University, originally a bilingual institution, had ceased offering courses in the Uyghur language. From 2004 onward, the government policy has been that classes should be conducted in Chinese as much as possible and in some selected regions, instruction in Chinese began in the first grade. A special senior-secondary boarding school program for Uyghurs, the Xinjiang Class, with course work conducted entirely in Chinese was also established in 2000. Many schools have also moved toward using mainly Chinese in the 2010s, with teaching in the Uyghur language limited to only a few hours a week. The level of educational attainment among Uyghurs is generally lower than that of the Han Chinese; this may be due to the cost of education, the lack of proficiency in the Chinese language (now the main medium of instruction) among many Uyghurs, and poorer employment prospects for Uyghur graduates due to job discrimination in favor of Han Chinese. Uyghurs in China, unlike the Hui and Salar who are also mostly Muslim, generally do not oppose coeducation, however girls may be withdrawn from school earlier than boys.

===Traditional medicine===
Uyghur traditional medicine is known as Unani (طب یونانی), as historically used in the Mughal Empire. Sir Percy Sykes described the medicine as &quot;based on the ancient Greek theory&quot; and mentioned how ailments and sicknesses were treated in &quot;Through Deserts and Oases of Central Asia&quot;. Today, traditional medicine can still be found at street stands. Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms and disease history and then the pharmacist pounds up different dried herbs, making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted modern medical science and medicine and applied evidence-based pharmaceutical technology to traditional medicines. Historically, Uyghur medical knowledge has contributed to Chinese medicine in terms of medical treatments, medicinal materials and ingredients and symptom detection.

===Cuisine===
Uyghur food shows both Central Asian and Chinese elements. A typical Uyghur dish is &quot;polu&quot; (or pilaf), a dish found throughout Central Asia. In a common version of the Uyghur &quot;polu&quot;, carrots and mutton (or chicken) are first fried in oil with onions, then rice and water are added and the whole dish is steamed. Raisins and dried apricots may also be added. &quot;Kawaplar&quot; () or &quot;chuanr&quot; (i.e., kebabs or grilled meat) are also found here. Another common Uyghur dish is &quot;leghmen&quot; (, ), a noodle dish with a stir-fried topping (&quot;säy&quot;, from Chinese &quot;cai&quot;, ) usually made from mutton and vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, chili peppers and cabbage. This dish is likely to have originated from the Chinese &quot;lamian&quot;, but its flavor and preparation method are distinctively Uyghur.

Uyghur food (, ) is characterized by mutton, beef, camel (solely bactrian), chicken, goose, carrots, tomatoes, onions, peppers, eggplant, celery, various dairy foods and fruits.

A Uyghur-style breakfast consists of tea with home-baked bread, hardened yogurt, olives, honey, raisins and almonds. Uyghurs like to treat guests with tea, naan and fruit before the main dishes are ready.

&quot;Sangza&quot; (, ) are crispy fried wheat flour dough twists, a holiday specialty. &quot;Samsa&quot; (, ) are lamb pies baked in a special brick oven. &quot;Youtazi&quot; is steamed multi-layer bread. &quot;Göshnan&quot; (, ) are pan-grilled lamb pies. &quot;Pamirdin&quot; () are baked pies stuffed with lamb, carrots and onions. &quot;Shorpa&quot; is lamb soup (, ). Other dishes include &quot;Toghach&quot; () (a type of tandoor bread) and &quot;Tunurkawab&quot; (). &quot;Girde&quot; () is also a very popular bagel-like bread with a hard and crispy crust that is soft inside.

A cake sold by Uyghurs is the traditional Uyghur nut cake.

===Clothing===
Chapan, a coat, and doppa, a type of hat for men, is commonly worn by Uyghurs. Another type of headwear, salwa telpek (&quot;salwa tälpäk&quot;, салва тәлпәк), is also worn by Uyghurs.

In the early 20th century, face covering veils with velvet caps trimmed with otter fur were worn in the streets by Turki women in public in Xinjiang as witnessed by the adventurer Ahmad Kamal in the 1930s. Travelers of the period Sir Percy Sykes and Ella Sykes wrote that in Kashghar women went into the bazar &quot;transacting business with their veils thrown back&quot; but mullahs tried to enforce veil wearing and were &quot;in the habit of beating those who show their face in the Great Bazar&quot;. In that period, belonging to different social statuses meant a difference in how rigorously the veil was worn.

Muslim Turkestani men traditionally cut all the hair off their head. Sir Aurel Stein observed that the &quot;Turki Muhammadan, accustomed to shelter this shaven head under a substantial fur-cap when the temperature is so low as it was just then&quot;. No hair cutting for men took place on the &quot;ajuz ayyam&quot;, days of the year that were considered inauspicious.

===Traditional handicrafts===
Yengisar is famous for manufacturing Uyghur handcrafted knives. The Uyghur word for knife is pichaq (, ) and the word for knifemaking (cutler) is pichaqchiliq (, ). Uyghur artisan craftsmen in Yengisar are known for their knife manufacture. Uyghur men carry such knives as part of their culture to demonstrate the masculinity of the wearer, but it has also led to ethnic tension. Limitations were placed on knife vending due to concerns over terrorism and violent assaults.

=== Livelihood ===
Most Uyghurs are agriculturists. Cultivating crops in an arid region has made the Uyghurs excel in irrigation techniques. This includes the construction and maintenance of underground channels called &quot;karez&quot; that brings water from the mountains to their fields. A few of the well-known agricultural goods include apples (especially from Ghulja), sweet melons (from Hami), and grapes from Turpan. However, many Uyghurs are also employed in the mining, manufacturing, cotton, and petrochemical industries. Local handicrafts like rug-weaving and jade-carving are also important to the cottage industry of the Uyghurs.

Some Uyghurs have been given jobs through Chinese government affirmative action programs. Uyghurs may also have difficulty receiving non-interest loans (per Islamic beliefs). The general lack of Uyghur proficiency in Mandarin Chinese also creates a barrier to access private and public sector jobs.

===Names===
Since the arrival of Islam, most Uyghurs have used &quot;Arabic names&quot;, but traditional Uyghur names and names of other origin are still used by some. After the establishment of the Soviet Union, many Uyghurs who studied in Soviet Central Asia added Russian suffixes to Russify their surnames. Names from Russia and Europe are used in Qaramay and Ürümqi by part of the population of city-dwelling Uyghurs. Others use names with hard-to-understand etymologies, with the majority dating from the Islamic era and being of Arabic or Persian derivation. Some pre-Islamic Uyghur names are preserved in Turpan and Qumul. The government has banned some two dozen Islamic names.

<text>Uppsala ( ; ; archaically spelled &quot;Upsala&quot;) is the capital of Uppsala County and the fourth-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö. It had 177,074 inhabitants in 2019.

Located north of the capital Stockholm, it is also the seat of Uppsala Municipality. Since 1164, Uppsala has been the ecclesiastical centre of Sweden, being the seat of the Archbishop of the Church of Sweden. Uppsala is home to Scandinavia&#x27;s largest cathedral – Uppsala Cathedral, which was the frequent site of the coronation of the Swedish monarch until the late 19th century.

Uppsala Castle, built by King Gustav Vasa, served as one of the royal residences of the Swedish monarchs, and was expanded several times over its history, making Uppsala the secondary capital of Sweden during its greatest extent. Today, it serves as the residence of the Governor of Uppsala County.

Founded in 1477, Uppsala University is the oldest centre of higher education in Scandinavia. Among the many scholars associated with the city are Anders Celsius, inventor of the centigrade temperature scale that now bears his name, and Carl Linnaeus, the father of taxonomy.

Other Uppsala residents include filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, diplomat Dag Hammarskjöld, chemists Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Svante Arrhenius, actress Viveca Lindfors, and singer Malena Ernman.

== History ==

Uppsala originally referred to a location a few kilometres north of the current city, now known as Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala). Today&#x27;s Uppsala was called &quot;Aros,&quot; &#x27;river mouth&#x27;, due to its location at the time at the mouth of the River Fyris in Ekoln, a bay in Lake Mälaren. The name became &quot;Östra Aros&quot; (&#x27;East Aros&#x27;) to distinguish it from &quot;Västra Aros&quot; (present-day Västerås).

Old Uppsala was, according to medieval writer Adam of Bremen, the main pagan centre of Sweden, and the Temple at Uppsala contained magnificent idols of the Norse gods. The Kungsängen plains along the river south of Uppsala have been identified as a possible match for Fyrisvellir, the site of the Battle of Fyrisvellir in the 980s.
Östra Aros was at that time a port town of Gamla Uppsala. In 1160, King Eric Jedvardsson was attacked and killed outside the church of Östra Aros, and later became venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. In 1274, Östra Aros overtook Gamla Uppsala as the main regional centre, and when the cathedral of Gamla Uppsala burnt down, the archbishopric and the relics of Saint Eric were moved to Östra Aros, where the present-day Uppsala Cathedral was erected; it was inaugurated in 1435. The cathedral is built in the Gothic style and is one of the largest in northern Europe, with towers reaching .

The city is the site of the oldest university in Scandinavia, founded in 1477, and is where Carl Linnaeus, one of the renowned scholars of Uppsala University, lived for many years; both his house and garden can still be visited. Uppsala is also the site of the 16th-century Uppsala Castle. The city was severely damaged by a fire in 1702.

Historical and cultural treasures were also lost, as in many Swedish cities, from demolitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but many historic buildings remain, especially in the western part of the city. The arms bearing the lion can be traced to 1737 and have been modernised several times, most recently in 1986. The meaning of the lion is uncertain, but is likely connected to the royal lion, also depicted on the Coat of Arms of Sweden.

In ecclesiastical terms, the place has always belonged to Uppsala parish, from 1961 called Uppsala cathedral parish. The incorporated parts of Uppsala belong to Gamla Uppsala parish, Helga Trefaldighets parish and Vaksala parish. After parish break-up in 1974, parts of the town are located in Gottsunda parish. After further building expansion, some are also in Denmark-Funbo parish, before 2010 in Denmark parish.

Until 1971, the town was part of the district court for Uppsala City Hall Court and has been part of the Uppsala Court since 1971.

== Geography ==
Situated on the fertile Uppsala flatlands of muddy soil, the city features the small Fyris River (Fyrisån) flowing through the landscape surrounded by lush vegetation. Parallel to the river runs the glacial ridge of Uppsalaåsen at an elevation around , the site of Uppsala&#x27;s castle, from which large parts of the town can be seen. The central park &quot;Stadsskogen&quot; (literally &quot;City Forest&quot;) stretches from the south far into town, with opportunities for recreation for many residential areas within walking distance.

Located approximately or 40 minutes by train from the capital, many Uppsala residents work in Stockholm. The train to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport takes 17 minutes, rendering the city easily accessible by air. Just like Stockholm, Uppsala is located on Sweden&#x27;s east coast at the 59th parallel north.

The commercial centre of Uppsala is quite compact. The city has a distinct town and gown divide with clergy, royalty, and academia historically residing in the Fjärdingen neighbourhood on the river&#x27;s western shore, somewhat separated from the rest of the city, and the ensemble of cathedral, castle and university buildings has remained mostly undisturbed to this day. While some historic buildings remain on the periphery of the central core, retail commercial activity is geographically focused on a small number of blocks around the pedestrianized streets and main square on the eastern side of the river, an area that was subject to a large-scale metamorphosis during the economically booming years in the 1960s in particular. During recent decades, a significant part of retail commercial activity has shifted to shopping malls and stores situated in the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, the built-up areas have expanded greatly, and some suburbanization has taken place.

== Higher education ==

=== Universities ===
*Uppsala University. Founded in 1477, under bishop Jakob Ulvsson. Originally a Catholic institution, after limited activity following the Reformation it was re-organised as a Lutheran institution in 1595, following the Uppsala Synod in 1593. The university has a famous anatomical theatre, constructed by the scientist and polymath Olof Rudbeck (1630–1702), in the old university building Gustavianum. The building is now a museum. The university has 13 student fraternities, known as &quot;nations&quot;, each traditionally representing a geographical region of Sweden.
*Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU, Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet, main campus).

=== Other higher education ===
* Johannelunds Teologiska Högskola. A Lutheran theological seminary established in 1862, located in Uppsala since 1970.
* The Newman Institute. A Catholic institution founded in 2001.
* Pingströrelsens teologiska seminarium. A Pentecostal theological seminary, which does not have accreditation from the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education and cannot confer Swedish academic degrees.

== Museums and sights ==

The Fyris river (Fyrisån) neatly divides the city into two different parts: the historic quarter to the west of the river and the modern administrative, residential and commercial city centre to the east. Most of the historical sights and university buildings are in the western part, with a medieval street layout, river views and parks and dominated by the cathedral.

The most outstanding building in Uppsala is the &quot;Domkyrka&quot; (Uppsala Cathedral), Scandinavia&#x27;s largest church building ( high). Together with Uppsala Castle it has dominated Uppsala&#x27;s skyline since its construction in the 13th century and can be seen from a long distance outside the city, other tall buildings being rare.

Facing the west end of the cathedral is the &quot;Gustavianum&quot;, built in 1625 to be the main building of the university, and served as such through most of the 19th century. It contains the Museum of Nordic Antiquities, the Victoria Museum (of Egyptian antiquities) and the university&#x27;s cultural history collections. It also houses a perfectly preserved 17th-century anatomical theatre (used in its time for public dissections). Next to Gustavianum is the 18th century Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, the official residence of the Lutheran Archbishop of Uppsala and the primate of the Church of Sweden.

Across the street from the Gustavianum in the University Park stands the University Hall, erected in 1879–86 in Italian renaissance style. The Uppsala University Coin Cabinet is located in the university main building.

Not far from the university stands the Uppsala University Library (&quot;Carolina Rediviva&quot;), the largest library in Sweden, with over 5 million volumes and some 60,000 manuscripts. The building was built in 1820–41.

On a circa 35-metre high hill to the southwest of the University Library stands &quot;Uppsala Castle&quot;. Its construction was initiated in 1549 by King Gustav Vasa, founder of the Vasa royal dynasty. Today the castle holds several museums, among them the regional art museum, and is the residence of the Uppsala County Governor (&quot;landshövding&quot;).

There are several botanical museums in Uppsala related to the world-famous 18th century botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus; the Botanic Garden next to the castle, the Linnaean Garden in the city centre, and Linnaeus Hammarby, Linnaeus&#x27; summer house in the countryside village of Danmarks Hammarby south of the city.

 north of Uppsala city lies &quot;Gamla Uppsala&quot; (Old Uppsala), the location of the pre-Christian settlement of Uppsala which later provided the new name for the medieval settlement further south. There are few remains, with the exception of several huge burial mounds of pre-Christian monarchs and the previous cathedral from 1164 A.D., traditionally said to be built over the old heathen temple (and recent archaeological investigations seems to support this notion). The site was a major religious centre in Scandinavia in pre-Christian times. After the old cathedral church burned down around 1240 it was only partially restored to a more modest size as it no longer was the seat of the Archbishop. The Gamla Uppsala Museum exhibits archeological finds made during excavations in Gamla Uppsala and related finds from other parts of Uppland, as well as exhibitions on the history of the site itself.

==Transportation==

=== Roads ===
The European route E4 highway passes to the east of the city and provides the main connection by road to Uppsala. Several other smaller roads, such as Riksväg 72 and 55, connects the city with cities such as Enköping and Sala.

=== Public Transport ===
==== Buses ====
Buses within Uppsala Municipality and county are operated by UL. Bus lines in Uppsala go under two categories: city buses, and county buses. City bus lines, of which there are 15, are meant for journeys within the city. County buses, are instead meant for journeys within the wider municipality and county. The type of bus line can be seen by its colour, as city buses are painted green while county buses are painted yellow. Three city buses, 30, 31, and 32, are known as &quot;mjuka linjer&quot;, literally &quot;soft lines&quot;, which are fitted for the elderly and disabled, by having stops closer to places like hospitals and pharmacys, in order to reduce walking distance. 
==== Trains ====
Uppsala Central Station is one of the busiest train stations in Sweden, with around 45 000 passengers per day. The station is served by several different train operators, with Mälartåg, SJ and SL being the primary ones, while Vy operates night trains to Narvik. 

Trains depart Uppsala Central Station in three directions. There are trains to the south, Arlanda, Stockholm and Linköping, to the northwest, Dalarna and Sala, and to the north Gävle, Sundsvall, Östersund and to the northern half of Sweden as well as sleeper trains to Narvik in Norway.

==== Airports ====
While Uppsala has no civilian airport of its own, Arlanda Airport is located about 30 km south of Uppsala. Ärna Air Base north of Uppsala has been proposed for development as a commercial airport, but as of 2024 remains exclusively military.

== Sports ==
The largest arena in Uppsala is Fyrishov and is Sweden&#x27;s fourth most visited, specialized in swimming, sports events, meetings and recreation. The facility includes areas for indoor sports, summer sport and a generous waterpark with waterslides, 50-meter pool, training pool, relaxation area and a large outdoor swimming pool. Accommodation is offered at the Fyrishov cabin area, and at the resort restaurants a good lunch or dinner can be enjoyed. Fyrishov AB&#x27;s business also includes the operation of Gottsundabadet in which there is a 25-metre pool, a 10-metre children&#x27;s pool and gym. The entire facility is open all year round and a large number of meetings and various events are held here annually.

In addition to activities within the arena Fyrishov AB runs Tävlingsstaden Uppsala in a collaboration between the sports organizers, Fyrishov AB, Uppsala, Uppsala Tourism and hotel business. Co-founded in 2006 by Fyrishov AB under the name SM-town Uppsala in 2007 but was expanded to include international events and competitions at high national level. The project aims to develop Uppsala, a leading sports town in Sweden. In 2009 there were 24 SM-competitions and major national and international competitions in Uppsala.

At Fyrishov the city&#x27;s basketball team Uppsala Basket also plays, former KFUM Uppsala, their home games in the Swedish basketball league. There are also athletic club Uppsala, Uppsala, fencing club, Uppsala Judo Club, Sweden&#x27;s oldest judo club, Uppsala volleyball companion, Upsala weightlifting club and Upsala Simsällskap, one of the world&#x27;s oldest swimmingclubs. The sport that draws the most audience is floorball. Uppsala&#x27;s two teams in the Swedish Super League, Storvreta IBK and IK Sirius IBK, have Fyrishov as their home.

One of the most classical sports events, the Swedish bandy final, took place at Studenternas IP 1991–2012. After being played indoors in Stockholm 2013–2017, from 2018 it is again played in Uppsala. It usually attracts a spectator crowd of more than 20,000.

Once every year, the Uppsala Union of Science and Engineering Students arrange a river rafting in the Fyris river with rafts built from styrofoam.

== References in popular culture ==
In the History Channel&#x27;s Canadian-Irish TV series &quot;Vikings&quot;, Uppsala is visited by Ragnar Lothbrok and his entourage to worship the Aesir gods and offer a human sacrifice to appease them. In that visit Lothbrok meets Uppsala&#x27;s King Horik. The episode was criticised for its poorly researched depiction of Uppsala, which was shown as being located in a mountainous region, as well as of its heathen temple, which in the series was built in the style of a medieval Christian stave church.

The literary series Pelle Svanslös (Peter No Tail) which follows the adventures of a cat with no tail and his friends created by author Gösta Knutsson takes place in Uppsala.

Umberto Eco&#x27;s book The Name of the Rose includes a character of a young Scandinavian monk Benno of Uppsala.

<doc id="31792" wikidata="Q160590" url="?curid=31792" title="Utilitarianism">
<text>In ethical philosophy, utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for the affected individuals. In other words, utilitarian ideas encourage actions that lead to the greatest good for the greatest number. Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit different characterizations, the basic idea that underpins them all is, in some sense, to maximize utility, which is often defined in terms of well-being or related concepts. For instance, Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, described &quot;utility&quot; as the capacity of actions or objects to produce benefits, such as pleasure, happiness, and good, or to prevent harm, such as pain and unhappiness, to those affected.

Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as egoism and altruism, egalitarian utilitarianism considers either the interests of all humanity or all sentient beings equally. Proponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of issues, such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results (&quot;act utilitarianism&quot;), or whether agents should conform to rules that maximize utility (&quot;rule utilitarianism&quot;). There is also disagreement as to whether total utility (&quot;total utilitarianism&quot;) or average utility (&quot;average utilitarianism&quot;) should be maximized.

The seeds of the theory can be found in the hedonists Aristippus and Epicurus who viewed happiness as the only good, the state consequentialism of the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi who developed a theory to maximize benefit and minimize harm, and in the work of the medieval Indian philosopher Shantideva. The tradition of modern utilitarianism began with Jeremy Bentham, and continued with such philosophers as John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, R. M. Hare, and Peter Singer. The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics, questions of justice, the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food, and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity.

==Etymology==
&quot;Benthamism&quot;, the utilitarian philosophy founded by Jeremy Bentham, was substantially modified by his successor John Stuart Mill, who popularized the term &quot;utilitarianism&quot;. In 1861, Mill acknowledged in a footnote that, though Bentham believed &quot;himself to be the first person who brought the word &#x27;utilitarian&#x27; into use, he did not invent it. Rather, he adopted it from a passing expression&quot; in John Galt&#x27;s 1821 novel &quot;Annals of the Parish&quot;. However, Mill seems to have been unaware that Bentham had used the term &quot;utilitarian&quot; in his 1781 letter to George Wilson and his 1802 letter to Étienne Dumont.

==Historical background==

=== Pre-modern formulations ===

The importance of happiness as an end for humans has long been argued. Forms of hedonism were put forward by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristippus and Epicurus. Aristotle argued that &quot;eudaimonia&quot; is the highest human good. Augustine wrote that &quot;all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness&quot;. The idea that conduct should to be judged by its consequences also existed within the ancient world. Consequentialist theories were first developed by the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi, who proposed a system that sought to maximize benefit and eliminate harm. Mohist consequentialism advocated communitarian moral goods, including political stability, population growth, and wealth, but did not support the utilitarian notion of maximizing individual happiness. 
Utilitarian ideas can also be found in the work of medieval philosophers. In medieval India, the 8th-century philosopher Śāntideva wrote that we ought &quot;to stop all the present and future pain and suffering of all sentient beings, and to bring about all present and future pleasure and happiness.&quot; In medieval Europe, happiness was explored in depth by Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;. During the Renaissance, consequentialist ideas are present in the work of political philosophy of Niccolò Machiavelli.

=== 18th century ===
Utilitarianism as a distinct ethical position only emerged in the 18th century, and although it is usually thought to have begun with Jeremy Bentham, there were earlier writers who presented theories that were strikingly similar.

==== Hutcheson ====
Francis Hutcheson first introduced a key utilitarian phrase in &quot;An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue&quot; (1725): when choosing the most moral action, the amount of virtue in a particular action is proportionate to the number of people it brings happiness to. In the same way, moral evil, or &quot;vice&quot;, is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer. The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness to the greatest numbers, and the worst is the one that causes the most misery. In the first three editions of the book, Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms &quot;to compute the Morality of any Actions.&quot; In doing so, he echoed the later-proposed hedonic calculus of Bentham.

==== John Gay ====
Some claim that John Gay developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics. In &quot;Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality&quot; (1731), Gay argues that:
This pursuit of happiness is given a theological basis:
==== Hume ====
In &quot;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals&quot; (1751), David Hume writes:

==== Paley ====

Gay&#x27;s theological utilitarianism was developed and popularized by William Paley. It has been claimed that Paley was not a very original thinker and that the philosophies in his treatise on ethics is &quot;an assemblage of ideas developed by others and is presented to be learned by students rather than debated by colleagues.&quot; Nevertheless, his book &quot;The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy&quot; (1785) was a required text at Cambridge and Smith (1954) says that Paley&#x27;s writings were &quot;once as well known in American colleges as were the readers and spellers of William McGuffey and Noah Webster in the elementary schools.&quot; Schneewind (1977) writes that &quot;utilitarianism first became widely known in England through the work of William Paley.&quot;

The now-forgotten significance of Paley can be judged from the title of Thomas Rawson Birks&#x27;s 1874 work &quot;Modern Utilitarianism or the Systems of Paley, Bentham and Mill Examined and Compared&quot;.

Apart from restating that happiness as an end is grounded in the nature of God, Paley also discusses the place of rules, writing:

==Classical utilitarianism==
===Jeremy Bentham===
Bentham&#x27;s book &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot; was printed in 1780 but not published until 1789. It is possible that Bentham decided to publish after he saw the success of Paley&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy&quot;. Though Bentham&#x27;s book was not an immediate success, his ideas were spread further when Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont translated edited selections from a variety of Bentham&#x27;s manuscripts into French. was published in 1802 and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as &quot;The Theory of Legislation&quot;, although by this time significant portions of Dumont&#x27;s work had already been retranslated and incorporated into Sir John Bowring&#x27;s edition of Bentham&#x27;s works, which was issued in parts between 1838 and 1843.

Perhaps aware that Francis Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they &quot;appear&#x27;d useless, and were disagreeable to some readers,&quot; Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method, for &quot;in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind, wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest, is perfectly conformable to.&quot;

Rosen (2003) warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear &quot;little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and J. S. Mill&quot; and can be more &quot;a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a straw man to be attacked and rejected.&quot; It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules. His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words &quot;Pleasures then, and the avoidance of pains, are the ends that the legislator has in view.&quot; In Chapter VII, Bentham says: &quot;The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding... In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness, in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious, will be the demand it creates for punishment.&quot;

==== Principle of utility ====
Bentham&#x27;s work opens with a statement of the principle of utility:

==== Hedonic calculus ====
In Chapter IV, Bentham proposes a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains, which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus. Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain, considered by itself, can be measured according to its intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness. In addition, it is necessary to consider &quot;the tendency of any act by which it is produced&quot; and, therefore, to take account of the act&#x27;s fecundity, or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity, or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind. Finally, it is necessary to consider the extent, or the number of people affected by the action.

==== Evils of the first and second order ====
The question then arises as to when, if at all, it might be legitimate to break the law. This is considered in &quot;The Theory of Legislation&quot;, where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second order. The former are more immediate consequences; the latter are consequences spread through the community causing &quot;alarm&quot; and &quot;danger&quot;.

It is true there are cases in which, if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man&#x27;s house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers?... It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.

===John Stuart Mill===

Mill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism. Mill&#x27;s book &quot;Utilitarianism&quot; first appeared as a series of three articles published in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1861 and was reprinted as a single book in 1863.

====Higher and lower pleasures====
Mill rejects a purely quantitative measurement of utility and says:
The word &quot;utility&quot; is used to mean general well-being or happiness, and Mill&#x27;s view is that utility is the consequence of a good action. Utility, within the context of utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. By social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill&#x27;s explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people truly desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.

Mill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility, but as the directive rule of moral human conduct. The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society. This view of pleasure was hedonistic, as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life. This concept was adopted by Bentham and can be seen in his works. According to Mill, good actions result in pleasure, and that there is no higher end than pleasure. Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good character. Better put, the justification of character, and whether an action is good or not, is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility. In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct. In the last chapter of Utilitarianism, Mill concludes that justice, as a classifying factor of our actions (being just or unjust) is one of the certain moral requirements, and when the requirements are all regarded collectively, they are viewed as greater according to this scale of &quot;social utility&quot; as Mill puts it.

He also notes that, contrary to what its critics might say, there is &quot;no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect ... a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation.&quot; However, he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages, i.e. &quot;greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, &amp;c.&quot; Instead, Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others.

The accusation that hedonism is a &quot;doctrine worthy only of swine&quot; has a long history. In &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (Book 1 Chapter 5), Aristotle says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts. The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God; the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence. Mill&#x27;s approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures.

Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast&#x27;s pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs. ... A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence. ... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question...

Mill argues that if people who are &quot;competently acquainted&quot; with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and &quot;would not resign it for any quantity of the other,&quot; then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these &quot;competent judges&quot; will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that &quot;many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher.&quot; Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for there is no other way of measuring &quot;the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations.&quot; &quot;It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect.&quot;

Mill also thinks that &quot;intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the amount of contentment or pleasure (the mental state) that they produce.&quot; Mill also says that people should pursue these grand ideals, because if they choose to have gratification from petty pleasures, &quot;some displeasure will eventually creep in. We will become bored and depressed.&quot; Mill claims that gratification from petty pleasures only gives short-term happiness and, subsequently, worsens the individual who may feel that his life lacks happiness, since the happiness is transient. Whereas, intellectual pursuits give long-term happiness because they provide the individual with constant opportunities throughout the years to improve his life, by benefiting from accruing knowledge. Mill views intellectual pursuits as &quot;capable of incorporating the &#x27;finer things&#x27; in life&quot; while petty pursuits do not achieve this goal. Mill is saying that intellectual pursuits give the individual the opportunity to escape the constant depression cycle since these pursuits allow them to achieve their ideals, while petty pleasures do not offer this. Although debate persists about the nature of Mill&#x27;s view of gratification, this suggests bifurcation in his position.

==== &#x27;Proving&#x27; the principle of utility ====
In Chapter Four of &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;, Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility:

It is usual to say that Mill is committing a number of fallacies:

* naturalistic fallacy: Mill is trying to deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; 
* equivocation fallacy: Mill moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and 
* the fallacy of composition: the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.

Such allegations began to emerge in Mill&#x27;s lifetime, shortly after the publication of &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;, and persisted for well over a century, though the tide has been turning in recent discussions. Nonetheless, a defence of Mill against all three charges, with a chapter devoted to each, can be found in Necip Fikri Alican&#x27;s &quot;Mill&#x27;s Principle of Utility: A Defense of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s Notorious Proof&quot; (1994). This is the first, and remains the only, book-length treatment of the subject matter. Yet the alleged fallacies in the proof continue to attract scholarly attention in journal articles and book chapters.

Hall (1949) and Popkin (1950) defend Mill against this accusation pointing out that he begins Chapter Four by asserting that &quot;questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term&quot; and that this is &quot;common to all first principles&quot;. Therefore, according to Hall and Popkin, Mill does not attempt to &quot;establish that what people do desire is desirable but merely attempts to make the principles acceptable.&quot; The type of &quot;proof&quot; Mill is offering &quot;consists only of some considerations which, Mill thought, might induce an honest and reasonable man to accept utilitarianism.&quot;

Having claimed that people do, in fact, desire happiness, Mill now has to show that it is the &quot;only&quot; thing they desire. Mill anticipates the objection that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a &quot;means&quot; to happiness, eventually, it becomes part of someone&#x27;s happiness and is then desired as an end in itself.

=== Henry Sidgwick ===

Sidgwick&#x27;s book &quot;The Methods of Ethics&quot; has been referred to as the peak or culmination of classical utilitarianism. His main goal in this book is to ground utilitarianism in the principles of &quot;common-sense morality&quot; and thereby dispense with the doubts of his predecessors that these two are at odds with each other. For Sidgwick, ethics is about which actions are objectively right. Our knowledge of right and wrong arises from common-sense morality, which lacks a coherent principle at its core. The task of philosophy in general and ethics in particular is not so much to create new knowledge but to systematize existing knowledge. Sidgwick tries to achieve this by formulating &quot;methods of ethics&quot;, which he defines as rational procedures &quot;for determining right conduct in any particular case&quot;. He identifies three methods: intuitionism, which involves various independently valid moral principles to determine what ought to be done, and two forms of &quot;hedonism&quot;, in which rightness only depends on the pleasure and pain following from the action. Hedonism is subdivided into &quot;egoistic hedonism&quot;, which only takes the agent&#x27;s own well-being into account, and &quot;universal hedonism&quot; or &quot;utilitarianism&quot;, which is concerned with everyone&#x27;s well-being.

Intuitionism holds that we have intuitive, i.e. non-inferential, knowledge of moral principles, which are self-evident to the knower. The criteria for this type of knowledge include that they are expressed in clear terms, that the different principles are mutually consistent with each other and that there is expert consensus on them. According to Sidgwick, commonsense moral principles fail to pass this test, but there are some more abstract principles that pass it, like that &quot;what is right for me must be right for all persons in precisely similar circumstances&quot; or that &quot;one should be equally concerned with all temporal parts of one&#x27;s life&quot;. The most general principles arrived at this way are all compatible with &quot;utilitarianism&quot;, which is why Sidgwick sees a harmony between &quot;intuitionism&quot; and &quot;utilitarianism&quot;. There are also less general intuitive principles, like the duty to keep one&#x27;s promises or to be just, but these principles are not universal and there are cases where different duties stand in conflict with each other. Sidgwick suggests that we resolve such conflicts in a utilitarian fashion by considering the consequences of the conflicting actions.

The harmony between intuitionism and utilitarianism is a partial success in Sidgwick&#x27;s overall project, but he sees full success impossible since egoism, which he considers as equally rational, cannot be reconciled with utilitarianism unless &quot;religious assumptions&quot; are introduced. Such assumptions, for example, the existence of a personal God who rewards and punishes the agent in the afterlife, could reconcile egoism and utilitarianism. But without them, we have to admit a &quot;dualism of practical reason&quot; that constitutes a &quot;fundamental contradiction&quot; in our moral consciousness.

== Developments in the 20th century ==

===Ideal utilitarianism===
The description of ideal utilitarianism was first used by Hastings Rashdall in &quot;The Theory of Good and Evil&quot; (1907), but it is more often associated with G. E. Moore. In &quot;Ethics&quot; (1912), Moore rejects a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argues that there is a range of values that might be maximized. Moore&#x27;s strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good. He says that such an assumption:
Moore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way, but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world. He adds that, if a person was to take the contrary view, then &quot;I think it is self-evident that he would be wrong.&quot;

=== Act and rule utilitarianism ===

In the mid-20th century, a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thought. It was already considered necessary to use rules to help choose the right action, because estimating the consequences every time seemed error-prone and unlikely to bring the best outcome. Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says:

However, rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms, particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping. Smart (1956) and McCloskey (1957) initially use the terms &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;restricted&quot; utilitarianism but eventually settled on the prefixes &quot;act&quot; and &quot;rule&quot; instead. Likewise, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism, and through this debate the theory we now call &quot;rule utilitarianism&quot; was created. In an introduction to an anthology of these articles, the editor was able to say: &quot;The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation, criticism, reply and reformulation; the record of this process well illustrates the co-operative development of a philosophical theory.&quot;

The essential difference is in what determines whether or not an action is the right action. &quot;Act utilitarianism&quot; maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility; &quot;rule utilitarianism&quot; maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.

In 1956, Urmson (1953) published an influential article arguing that Mill justified rules on utilitarian principles. From then on, articles have debated this interpretation of Mill. In all probability, it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed. A collection of Mill&#x27;s writing published in 1977 includes a letter that seems to tip the balance in favour of the notion that Mill is best classified as an &quot;act utilitarian&quot;. In the letter, Mill says:
Some school level textbooks and at least one British examination board make a further distinction between strong and weak rule utilitarianism. However, it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature. It has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism, because for any given rule, in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility, the rule can be refined by the addition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception. This process holds for all cases of exceptions, and so the &quot;rules&quot; have as many &quot;sub-rules&quot; as there are exceptional cases, which, in the end, makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility.

=== Two-level utilitarianism ===

In &quot;Principles&quot; (1973), R. M. Hare accepts that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims that this is a result of allowing the rules to be &quot;as specific and un-general as we please.&quot; He argues that one of the main reasons for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules that people need for moral education and character development and he proposes that &quot;a difference between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules, i.e., by increasing their generality.&quot; This distinction between a &quot;specific rule utilitarianism&quot; (which collapses into act utilitarianism) and &quot;general rule utilitarianism&quot; forms the basis of Hare&#x27;s &quot;two-level utilitarianism&quot;.

When we are &quot;playing God or the ideal observer&quot;, we use the specific form, and we will need to do this when we are deciding what general principles to teach and follow. When we are &quot;inculcating&quot; or in situations where the biases of our human nature are likely to prevent us doing the calculations properly, then we should use the more general rule utilitarianism.

Hare argues that in practice, most of the time, we should be following the general principles:

In &quot;Moral Thinking&quot; (1981), Hare illustrated the two extremes. The &quot;archangel&quot; is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do. In contrast, the &quot;prole&quot; is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and, of necessity, has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation. It is not that some people are archangels and others proles, but rather that &quot;we all share the characteristics of both to limited and varying degrees and at different times.&quot;

Hare does not specify when we should think more like an &quot;archangel&quot; and more like a &quot;prole&quot; as this will, in any case, vary from person to person. However, the critical moral thinking underpins and informs the more intuitive moral thinking. It is responsible for formulating and, if necessary, reformulating the general moral rules. We also switch to critical thinking when trying to deal with unusual situations or in cases where the intuitive moral rules give conflicting advice.

=== Preference utilitarianism ===

Preference utilitarianism entails promoting actions that fulfil the preferences of those beings involved. The concept of preference utilitarianism was first proposed in 1977 by John Harsanyi in &quot;Morality and the Theory of Rational Behaviour&quot;, however the concept is more commonly associated with R. M. Hare, Peter Singer, and Richard Brandt.

Harsanyi claims that his theory is indebted to:

* Adam Smith, who equated the moral point of view with that of an impartial but sympathetic observer;
* Immanuel Kant, who insisted on the criterion of universality, which may also be described as a criterion of reciprocity;
* the classical utilitarians who made maximizing social utility the basic criterion of morality; and 
* &quot;the modern theory of rational behaviour under risk and uncertainty, usually described as Bayesian decision theory.&quot;

Harsanyi rejects hedonistic utilitarianism as being dependent on an outdated psychology saying that it is far from obvious that everything we do is motivated by a desire to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because &quot;it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that people&#x27;s only purpose in life is to have &#x27;mental states of intrinsic worth&#x27;.&quot;

According to Harsanyi, &quot;preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy. By this I mean the principle that, in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual, the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences.&quot;

Harsanyi adds two caveats. Firstly, people sometimes have irrational preferences. To deal with this, Harsanyi distinguishes between &quot;manifest&quot; preferences and &quot;true&quot; preferences. The former are those &quot;manifested by his observed behaviour, including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs, or on careless logical analysis, or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice&quot;; whereas the latter are &quot;the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information, always reasoned with the greatest possible care, and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice.&quot; It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy.

The second caveat is that antisocial preferences, such as sadism, envy, and resentment, have to be excluded. Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community:
===Negative utilitarianism===

In &quot;The Open Society and its Enemies&quot; (1945), Karl Popper argues that the principle &quot;maximize pleasure&quot; should be replaced by &quot;minimize pain&quot;. He believes that &quot;it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people, since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism.&quot; He claims that:

The actual term &quot;negative utilitarianism&quot; itself was introduced by R. N. Smart as the title to his 1958 reply to Popper in which he argues that the principle would entail seeking the quickest and least painful method of killing the entirety of humanity.

In response to Smart&#x27;s argument, Simon Knutsson (2019) has argued that classical utilitarianism and similar consequentialist views are roughly equally likely to entail killing the entirety of humanity, as they would seem to imply that one should kill existing beings and replace them with happier beings if possible. Consequently, Knutsson argues:

Furthermore, Knutsson notes that one could argue that other forms of consequentialism, such as classical utilitarianism, in some cases have less plausible implications than negative utilitarianism, such as in scenarios where classical utilitarianism implies it would be right to kill everyone and replace them in a manner that creates more suffering, but also more well-being such that the sum, on the classical utilitarian calculus, is net positive. Negative utilitarianism, in contrast, would not allow such killing.

Some versions of negative utilitarianism include:

* Negative total utilitarianism: tolerates suffering that can be compensated within the same person.
* Negative preference utilitarianism: avoids the problem of moral killing with reference to existing preferences that such killing would violate, while it still demands a justification for the creation of new lives. A possible justification is the reduction of the average level of preference-frustration.
* Pessimistic representatives of negative utilitarianism, which can be found in the environment of Buddhism.
Some see negative utilitarianism as a branch within modern hedonistic utilitarianism, which assigns a higher weight to the avoidance of suffering than to the promotion of happiness. The moral weight of suffering can be increased by using a &quot;compassionate&quot; utilitarian metric, so that the result is the same as in prioritarianism.

===Motive utilitarianism===

Motive utilitarianism was first proposed by Robert Merrihew Adams in 1976. Whereas act utilitarianism requires us to choose our actions by calculating which action will maximize utility and rule utilitarianism requires us to implement rules that will, on the whole, maximize utility, &quot;motive utilitarianism&quot; &quot;has the utility calculus being used to select motives and dispositions according to their general felicific effects, and those motives and dispositions then dictate our choices of actions.&quot;

The arguments for moving to some form of motive utilitarianism at the personal level can be seen as mirroring the arguments for moving to some form of rule utilitarianism at the social level. Adams (1976) refers to Sidgwick&#x27;s observation that &quot;Happiness (general as well as individual) is likely to be better attained if the extent to which we set ourselves consciously to aim at it be carefully restricted.&quot; Trying to apply the utility calculation on each and every occasion is likely to lead to a sub-optimal outcome. It is argued that applying carefully selected rules at the social level and encouraging appropriate motives at the personal level are likely to lead to better overall outcomes; even though on some individual occasions it leads to the wrong action when assessed according to act utilitarian standards.

Adams concludes that &quot;right action, by act-utilitarian standards, and right motivation, by motive-utilitarian standards, are incompatible in some cases.&quot; The necessity of this conclusion is rejected by Fred Feldman who argues that &quot;the conflict in question results from an inadequate formulation of the utilitarian doctrines; motives play no essential role in it ... [and that] ... [p]recisely the same sort of conflict arises even when MU is left out of consideration and AU is applied by itself.&quot; Instead, Feldman proposes a variant of act utilitarianism that results in there being no conflict between it and motive utilitarianism.

== Criticisms and responses ==
Because utilitarianism is not a single theory, but rather a cluster of related theories that have been developed over two hundred years, criticisms can be made for different reasons and have different targets.

===Quantifying utility===
A common objection to utilitarianism is the inability to quantify, compare, or measure happiness or well-being. Rachael Briggs writes in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;:

Utility understood this way is a personal preference, in the absence of any objective measurement.

===Utility ignores justice===
As Rosen (2003) has pointed out, claiming that act utilitarians are not concerned about having rules is to set up a &quot;straw man&quot;. Similarly, R.M. Hare refers to &quot;the crude caricature of act utilitarianism which is the only version of it that many philosophers seem to be acquainted with.&quot; Given what Bentham says about second order evils, it would be a serious misrepresentation to say that he and similar act utilitarians would be prepared to punish an innocent person for the greater good. Nevertheless, whether they would agree or not, this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory.

==== &quot;Sheriff scenario&quot; ====

A classic version of this criticism was given by H. J. McCloskey in his 1957 &quot;sheriff scenario&quot;:
By &quot;extreme&quot; utilitarian, McCloskey is referring to what later came to be called act utilitarianism. He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule: &quot;do not punish an innocent person&quot;. Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities. In a later article, McCloskey says:
==== &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; ====

An older form of this argument was presented by Fyodor Dostoyevsky in his book &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, in which Ivan challenges his brother Alyosha to answer his question: Tell me straight out, I call on you—answer me: imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale, of giving them peace and rest at last, but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature, [one child], and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tears—would you agree to be the architect on such conditions? ... And can you admit the idea that the people for whom you are building would agree to accept their happiness on the unjustified blood of a tortured child, and having accepted it, to remain forever happy?This scenario was illustrated in more depth in 1973 by Ursula K. Le Guin in the celebrated short story &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.&quot;

=== Predicting consequences ===
Some argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the &quot;Three Mile Island effect&quot;. Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.

Russell Hardin (1990) rejects such arguments. He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is &quot;to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these&quot;) from our ability to correctly apply rational principles that, among other things, &quot;depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor&#x27;s mental equipment.&quot; The fact that the latter is limited and can change does not mean that the former has to be rejected. &quot;If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics. The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant, but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding.&quot;

From the beginning, utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the &quot;tendencies&quot; of actions to bring about consequences. G. E. Moore, writing in 1903, said:
===Demandingness objection===
Act utilitarianism not only requires everyone to do what they can to maximize utility, but to do so without any favouritism. Mill said, &quot;As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.&quot; Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. &quot;What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them.&quot; As Shelly Kagan says, &quot;Given the parameters of the actual world, there is no question that ... (maximally) ... promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity ... a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed.&quot;

Hooker (2002) describes two aspects to the problem: act utilitarianism requires &quot;huge&quot; sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only &quot;slightly&quot; increased. Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism, &quot;there is no such thing as morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty.&quot; Mill was quite clear about this, &quot;A sacrifice which does not increase, or tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted.&quot;

One response to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says:No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do, and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations.Others argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified. There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements. One approach is to drop the demand that utility be maximized. In &quot;Satisficing Consequentialism&quot;, Michael Slote argues for a form of utilitarianism where &quot;an act might qualify as morally right through having good enough consequences, even though better consequences could have been produced.&quot; One advantage of such a system is that it would be able to accommodate the notion of supererogatory actions.

Samuel Scheffler takes a different approach and amends the requirement that everyone be treated the same. In particular, Scheffler suggests that there is an &quot;agent-centered prerogative&quot; such that when the overall utility is being calculated it is permitted to count our own interests more heavily than the interests of others. Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that &quot;a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements&quot; and, secondly, that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that &quot;the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view.&quot;

Robert Goodin takes yet another approach and argues that the demandingness objection can be &quot;blunted&quot; by treating utilitarianism as a guide to public policy rather than one of individual morality. He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share.

Gandjour specifically considers market situations and analyses whether individuals who act in markets may produce a utilitarian optimum. He lists several demanding conditions that need to be satisfied: individuals need to display instrumental rationality, markets need to be perfectly competitive, and income and goods need to be redistributed.

Harsanyi argues that the objection overlooks the fact that &quot;people attach considerable utility to freedom from unduly burdensome moral obligations ... most people will prefer a society with a more relaxed moral code, and will feel that such a society will achieve a higher level of average utility—even if adoption of such a moral code should lead to some losses in economic and cultural accomplishments (so long as these losses remain within tolerable limits). This means that utilitarianism, if correctly interpreted, will yield a moral code with a standard of acceptable conduct very much below the level of highest moral perfection, leaving plenty of scope for supererogatory actions exceeding this minimum standard.&quot;

=== Aggregating utility ===
The objection that &quot;utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons&quot; came to prominence in 1971 with the publication of John Rawls&#x27; &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. The concept is also important in animal rights advocate Richard Ryder&#x27;s rejection of utilitarianism, in which he talks of the &quot;boundary of the individual&quot;, through which neither pain nor pleasure may pass.

However, a similar objection was noted in 1970 by Thomas Nagel, who claimed that consequentialism &quot;treats the desires, needs, satisfactions, and dissatisfactions of distinct persons as if they were the desires, etc., of a mass person;&quot; and even earlier by David Gauthier, who wrote that utilitarianism supposes that &quot;mankind is a super-person, whose greatest satisfaction is the objective of moral action. ... But this is absurd. Individuals have wants, not mankind; individuals seek satisfaction, not mankind. A person&#x27;s satisfaction is not part of any greater satisfaction.&quot; Thus, the aggregation of utility becomes futile as both pain and happiness are intrinsic to and inseparable from the consciousness in which they are felt, rendering impossible the task of adding up the various pleasures of multiple individuals.

A response to this criticism is to point out that whilst seeming to resolve some problems it introduces others. Intuitively, there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account. As Alastair Norcross has said:[S]uppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the building ... it is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number, precisely because it is a larger number. ... Can anyone who really considers the matter seriously honestly claim to believe that it is worse that one person die than that the entire sentient population of the universe be severely mutilated? Clearly not.It may be possible to uphold the distinction between persons whilst still aggregating utility, if it accepted that people can be influenced by empathy. This position is advocated by Iain King, who has suggested the evolutionary basis of empathy means humans can take into account the interests of other individuals, but only on a one-to-one basis, &quot;since we can only imagine ourselves in the mind of one other person at a time.&quot; King uses this insight to adapt utilitarianism, and it may help reconcile Bentham&#x27;s philosophy with deontology and virtue ethics.

Philosopher John Taurek also argued that the idea of adding happiness or pleasures across persons is quite unintelligible and that the numbers of persons involved in a situation are morally irrelevant. Taurek&#x27;s basic concern comes down to this: we cannot explain what it means to say that things would be five times worse if five people die than if one person dies. &quot;I cannot give a satisfactory account of the meaning of judgments of this kind,&quot; he wrote (p. 304). He argues that each person can only lose one person&#x27;s happiness or pleasures. There is not five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die: who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? &quot;Each person&#x27;s potential loss has the same significance to me, only as a loss to that person alone. because, by hypothesis, I have an equal concern for each person involved, I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss&quot; (p. 307). Derek Parfit (1978) and others have criticized Taurek&#x27;s line, and it continues to be discussed.

===Calculating utility is self-defeating===
An early criticism, which was addressed by Mill, is that if time is taken to calculate the best course of action it is likely that the opportunity to take the best course of action will already have passed. Mill responded that there had been ample time to calculate the likely effects:
More recently, Hardin has made the same point. &quot;It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously. Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense. Lord Devlin notes, &#x27;if the reasonable man &quot;worked to rule&quot; by perusing to the point of comprehension every form he was handed, the commercial and administrative life of the country would creep to a standstill.

It is such considerations that lead even act utilitarians to rely on &quot;rules of thumb&quot;, as Smart (1973) has called them.

===Special obligations criticism===

One of the oldest criticisms of utilitarianism is that it ignores our special obligations. For example, if we were given the choice between saving two random people or our mother, most would choose to save their mothers. According to utilitarianism, such a natural action is immoral. The first to respond to this was an early utilitarian and friend of Jeremy Bentham named William Godwin, who held in his work &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; that such personal needs should be disregarded in favour of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Applying the utilitarian principle &quot;that life ought to be preferred which will be most conducive to the general good&quot; to the choice of saving one of two people, either &quot;the illustrious Archbishop of Cambray&quot; or his chambermaid, he wrote: Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife, my mother or my benefactor. That would not alter the truth of the proposition. The life of [the Archbishop] would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid; and justice, pure, unadulterated justice, would still have preferred that which was most valuable.

===Criticisms of utilitarian value theory===

Utilitarianism&#x27;s assertion that well-being is the only thing with intrinsic moral value has been attacked by various critics. Thomas Carlyle derided &quot;Benthamee Utility, virtue by Profit and Loss; reducing this God&#x27;s-world to a dead brute Steam-engine, the infinite celestial Soul of Man to a kind of Hay-balance for weighing hay and thistles on, pleasures and pains on&quot;. Karl Marx, in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, criticises Bentham&#x27;s utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts:

With the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and future. The Christian religion, e.g., is &quot;useful,&quot; &quot;because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law.&quot; Artistic criticism is &quot;harmful,&quot; because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of Martin Tupper, etc. With such rubbish has the brave fellow, with his motto, &quot;nulla dies sine linea [no day without a line]&quot;, piled up mountains of books.

Pope John Paul II, following his personalist philosophy, argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons, just as much as things, the object of use. &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;, he wrote, &quot;is a civilization of production and of use, a civilization of things and not of persons, a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used.&quot;

===Duty-based criticisms===
W. D. Ross, speaking from the perspective of his deontological pluralism, acknowledges that there is a duty to promote the maximum of aggregate good, as utilitarianism demands. But, Ross contends, this is just one besides various other duties, like the duty to keep one&#x27;s promises or to make amends for wrongful acts, which are ignored by the simplistic and reductive utilitarian outlook.

Roger Scruton was a deontologist, and believed that utilitarianism did not give duty the place that it needed inside our ethical judgements. He asked us to consider the dilemma of Anna Karenina, who had to choose between her love of Vronsky and her duty towards her husband and her son. Scruton wrote, &quot;Suppose Anna were to reason that it is better to satisfy two healthy young people and frustrate one old one than to satisfy one old person and frustrate two young ones, by a factor of 2.5 to 1: ergo I am leaving. What would we think, then, of her moral seriousness?&quot;

== Additional considerations ==

===Average versus total happiness===

In &quot;The Methods of Ethics&quot;, Henry Sidgwick asked, &quot;Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum?&quot; Paley notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, &quot;the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions&quot; and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people. Consequently, &quot;the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever.&quot; A similar view was expressed by Smart, who argued that, all other things being equal, a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people.

Since Sidgwick raised the question it has been studied in detail and philosophers have argued that using either total or average happiness can lead to objectionable results.

According to Derek Parfit, using total happiness falls victim to the repugnant conclusion, whereby large numbers of people with very low but non-negative utility values can be seen as a better goal than a population of a less extreme size living in comfort. In other words, according to the theory, it is a moral good to breed more people on the world for as long as total happiness rises.

On the other hand, measuring the utility of a population based on the average utility of that population avoids Parfit&#x27;s repugnant conclusion but causes other problems. For example, bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act; aside from this, the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average, as this would raise the average happiness.

William Shaw suggests that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, &quot;utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children. However, if you have decided to have a child, then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can.&quot;

===Motives, intentions, and actions===
Utilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from intention and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, &quot;from every kind of motive, may proceed actions that are good, others that are bad, and others that are indifferent.&quot; Mill makes a similar point and explicitly says that &quot;motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent. He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble.&quot;

However, with intention the situation is more complex. In a footnote printed in the second edition of &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;, Mill says: &quot;the morality of the action depends entirely upon the intention—that is, upon what the agent wills to do.&quot; Elsewhere, he says, &quot;Intention, and motive, are two very different things. But it is the intention, that is, the foresight of consequences, which constitutes the moral rightness or wrongness of the act.&quot;

The correct interpretation of Mill&#x27;s footnote is a matter of some debate. The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why, since it is consequences that matter, intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not. One possibility &quot;involves supposing that the &#x27;morality&#x27; of the act is one thing, probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent, and its rightness or wrongness another.&quot; Jonathan Dancy rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent.

An interpretation given by Roger Crisp draws on a definition given by Mill in &quot;A System of Logic&quot;, where he says that an &quot;intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action.&quot; Accordingly, whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention. Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not.

A third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action. Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy, he recognizes that this might not have been Mill&#x27;s own view, for Mill &quot;would not even allow that &#x27;p &amp; q&#x27; expresses a complex proposition. He wrote in his &quot;System of Logic&quot; I iv. 3, of &#x27;Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive&#x27;, that &#x27;we might as well call a street a complex house, as these two propositions a complex proposition&#x27;.&quot;

Finally, whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action, this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness.

=== Other sentient beings ===
In &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot;, Bentham wrote &quot;the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?&quot; Mill&#x27;s distinction between higher and lower pleasures might suggest that he gave more status to humans. However, in his essay &quot;Whewell on Moral Philosophy&quot;, Mill defends Bentham&#x27;s position, calling it a &quot;noble anticipation&quot;, and writing: &quot;Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer &#x27;immoral&#x27;, let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned.&quot;

Henry Sidgwick also considers the implications of utilitarianism for nonhuman animals. He writes:&quot;We have next to consider who the &#x27;all&#x27; are, whose happiness is to be taken into account. Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle ... it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of any sentient being.&quot;Among contemporary utilitarian philosophers, Peter Singer is especially known for arguing that the well-being of all sentient beings ought to be given equal consideration. Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creature&#x27;s sentience, regardless of their species. He adds that humans tend to be speciesist (discriminatory against non-humans) in ethical matters, and argues that, in utilitarianism, speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals; all suffering ought to be reduced. Singer writes: &quot;The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case ... Most human beings are speciesists.&quot;

In John Stuart Mill&#x27;s essay &quot;On Nature&quot; he argues that the welfare of wild animals is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments. Tyler Cowen argues that, if individual animals are carriers of utility, then we should consider limiting the predatory activity of carnivores relative to their victims: &quot;At the very least, we should limit current subsidies to nature&#x27;s carnivores.&quot;

This view still might be contrasted with deep ecology, which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature, whether currently assumed to be sentient or not. According to utilitarianism, the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status, because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer. Singer writes:
The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.

Thus, the moral value of one-celled organisms, as well as some multi-cellular organisms, and natural entities like a river, is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings. Similarly, utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on biodiversity, although the benefits that biodiversity brings to sentient beings may mean that, in utilitarianism, biodiversity ought to be maintained in general.

==== Digital minds ====

Nick Bostrom and Carl Shulman consider that, as advancements in artificial intelligence continue, it will probably be possible to engineer digital minds that require less resources and have a much higher rate and intensity of subjective experience than humans. These &quot;super-beneficiaries&quot; could also be unaffected by hedonic adaptation. Nick Bostrom said that we should find &quot;paths that will enable digital minds and biological minds to coexist, in a mutually beneficial way where all of these different forms can flourish and thrive&quot;.

== Application to specific problems==
The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics, questions of justice, the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food, and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity. In the context of lying, some utilitarians support white lies.

=== World poverty ===
An article in the &quot;American Economic Journal&quot; has addressed the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one&#x27;s income to charity could help save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one&#x27;s income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer&#x27;s ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruism movement.

<text>The University of Pennsylvania (Penn or UPenn) is a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university&#x27;s founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. 

The university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. Among its graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor James Wilson participated in writing the first draft of the U.S. Constitution, and its medical school, which was the first medical school established in North America.

In 2023, Penn ranked third among U.S. universities in research expenditures, according to the National Science Foundation. Its endowment is , making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation as of 2024. The University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation&#x27;s first dual-level college football stadium and the nation&#x27;s longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation. The university&#x27;s athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I&#x27;s Ivy League conference.

Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty include eight Founding Fathers of the United States who signed the Declaration of Independence, seven who signed the United States Constitution, 24 members of the Continental Congress, three Presidents of the United States (including the 9th, 45th, 46th and 47th Presidents), 38 Nobel laureates, nine foreign heads of state, three United States Supreme Court justices, at least four Supreme Court justices of foreign nations, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, 36 living undergraduate billionaires (the largest number of any U.S. college or university), and five Medal of Honor recipients.

==History==

In 1740, a group of Philadelphians organized to erect a great preaching hall for George Whitefield, a traveling Anglican evangelist, which was designed and constructed by Edmund Woolley. It was the largest building in Philadelphia at the time, and thousands of people attended it to hear Whitefield preach.

In the fall of 1749, Benjamin Franklin, a Founding Father and polymath in Philadelphia, circulated a pamphlet, &quot;,&quot; his vision for what he called a &quot;Public Academy of Philadelphia&quot;.

On June 16, 1755, the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction. 

Penn identifies as the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by Princeton and Columbia since the College of Philadelphia was not chartered or commence classes until 1755 and the first board of trustees was not convened until 1749, arguably making it the sixth or fifth-oldest.

==Campus==

Much of the current architecture on Penn&#x27;s campus was designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Cope and Stewardson, whose owners were Philadelphia born and raised architects and Penn professors who also designed Princeton University and a large part of Washington University in St. Louis. They were known for having combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.

Penn&#x27;s main artery at center of Penn&#x27;s Campus Historic District is Locust Walk, a pedestrian only walkway first announced by Penn President, Harold Stassen in 1948. Work began in the summer of 1960, and was completed in 1972.

The present core campus covers over in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia&#x27;s University City section, and the older heart of the campus comprises the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. All of Penn&#x27;s schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn&#x27;s core campus borders Drexel University and is a few blocks from the University City campus of Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, which absorbed University of the Sciences in Philadelphia in a merger, and The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College.

Wistar Institute, a cancer research center, is also located on campus. In 2014, a new seven-story glass and steel building was completed next to the institute&#x27;s original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.

The Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.

In 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont&#x27;s Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, with help from architects Matthias Hollwich, Marc Kushner, and KSS Architects, Penn completed the design and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory named &quot;Pennovation Works&quot;, which houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a pitch bleacher, and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, known as South Bank, is a mixture of lightly refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development. Penn hopes that &quot;South Bank will provide a place for academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses in close proximity to each other to facilitate cross-pollination of their ideas, creativity, and innovation,&quot; according to a March 2017 university statement.

===Parks and arboreta===

In 2007, Penn acquired about between the campus and the Schuylkill River at the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby site then owned by the United States Postal Service. Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn&#x27;s Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.

In September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the , Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut to South Streets.

Penn maintains two arboreta. The first, the roughly Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania, encompasses the entire University City main campus. The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens and five urban parks, which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017. Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn&#x27;s comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn&#x27;s entire collection of trees. The 92-acre second arboretum Morris Arboretum is the official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and includes more than 13,000 labelled plants of 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia.
===New Bolton Center===

Penn also owns the New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its veterinary school. Located near Kennett Square, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.

===Libraries===

Penn library system has grown into a system of 14 libraries with 400 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than . The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million microform items and 1.11 million e-books. It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.

The university has 15 libraries. Van Pelt Library on the Penn campus is the university&#x27;s main library. The other 14 are:
*The Annenberg School for Communication library located on Walnut Street between 36th and 37th Streets
*The Archaeology and Anthropology Library located at the Penn Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology 
*The Biddle Law Library located on campus on the 3500 block of Sansom Street at the School of Law
*The Chemistry Library located on campus on 3300 block of Spruce Street in the Chemistry Building 
*The Dental Medicine Library on campus on the 4000 the block of Locust Street at the Dental School 
*The Fisher Fine Arts Library located on campus on the 3400 block of Woodland Avenue 
*The Holman Biotech Commons library located on campus on the 3500 block of Hamilton Walk adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion at the Medical School and the Nursing School 
*The Humanities and Social Sciences Library, including Weigle Information Commons, located on campus between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt Library
*The Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library located off campus at 420 Walnut Street near Independence Hall and Washington Square 
*The Lea Library, a collection of Catholic Church history, located on campus between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street on the 6th floor of the Van Pelt Library 
*The Lippincott Business Library located on campus between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street in the second floor of the Van Pelt Library
*The Math/Physics/Astronomy library located on campus on 3200 block of Walnut Streets adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of the David Rittenhouse Laboratory 
*The Rare Books and Manuscripts library and Yarnall Library of Theology located on campus between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in Van Pelt Library 
*The Veterinary Medicine Library located on the campus between 38th and 39th streets on Sansom Street at the Veterinary Medicine School with satellite library located off campus at New Bolton Center.

Penn also maintains books and records off campus at high density storage facility.

The Penn Design School&#x27;s Fine Arts Library was built to be Penn&#x27;s main library and the first with its own building. The main library at the time was designed by Frank Furness to be first library in nation to separate the low ceilings of the library stack, where the books were stored, from forty-foot-plus high ceilinged rooms, where the books were read and studied.

The Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn&#x27;s libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with St. Clement&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839–1907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library&#x27;s major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.

===Art installations===
The campus has more than 40 notable art installations, in part because of a 1959 Philadelphia ordinance requiring total budget for new construction or major renovation projects in which governmental resources are used to include 1% for art to be used to pay for installation of site-specific public art, in part because many alumni collected and donated art to Penn, and in part because of the presence of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design on the campus.

Alexander Archipenko&#x27;s sculpture of King Solomon was initially loaned to Penn in 1985 by parents of a Penn student and donated in 1995 to honor the inauguration of Judith Rodin as Penn president in 1994.

In 2020, Penn installed &quot;Brick House&quot;, a monumental work of art, created by Simone Leigh at the College Green gateway to Penn&#x27;s campus near the corner of 34th Street and Woodland Walk. This bronze sculpture, which is high and in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman&#x27;s head crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house. At the installation, Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that &quot;Ms. Leigh&#x27;s sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty—along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience—to a central crossroad of Penn&#x27;s campus.&quot;
The &quot;Covenant&quot;, known to the student body as &quot;Dueling Tampons&quot; or &quot;The Tampons,&quot; is a large red structure created by Alexander Liberman and located on Locust Walk as a gateway to the high-rise residences &quot;super block.&quot; It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel.

A white button, known as The Button and officially called the Split Button is a modern art sculpture designed by designed by Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg (who specialized in creating oversize sculptures of everyday objects). It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough for people to stand inside. Penn also has a replica of the &quot;Love&quot; sculpture, part of a series created by Robert Indiana. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998 overlooking College Green.
In 2019, the Association for Public Art loaned Penn two multi-ton sculptures. The works are &quot;Social Consciousness&quot;, created by Sir Jacob Epstein in 1954, and &quot;Atmosphere and Environment XII&quot;, created by Louise Nevelson in 1970. Until the loan, both works had been located at the West Entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the older since its creation and the Nevelson work since 1973. &quot;Social Consciousness&quot; was relocated to the walkway between Wharton&#x27;s Lippincott Library and Phi Phi chapter of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house, and &quot;Atmosphere and Environment XII&quot; is sited on Shoemaker Green between Franklin Field and Ringe Squash Courts.
In addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has several traditional statues, including a good number created by Penn&#x27;s first Director of Physical Education Department, R. Tait McKenzie. Among the notable sculptures is that of &quot;Young Ben Franklin&quot;, which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to Franklin Field. The sculpture is titled &quot;Benjamin Franklin in 1723&quot; and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War I era (1910–1914). 
Other sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost Edgar Fahs Smith.
Penn is presently reevaluating all of its public art and has formed a working group led by Penn Design dean Frederick Steiner, who was part of a similar effort at the University of Texas at Austin that led to the removal of statues of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials, and Penn&#x27;s Chief Diversity Officer, Joann Mitchell. Penn has begun the process of adding art and removing or relocating art. Penn removed from campus in 2020 the statue of the Reverend George Whitefield (who had inspired the 1740 establishment of a trust to establish a charity school, which trust Penn legally assumed in 1749) when research showed Whitefield owned fifty enslaved people and drafted and advocated for the key theological arguments in favor of slavery in Georgia and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.

===Penn Museum===

Since the founding of Penn Museum in 1887, it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide. The museum&#x27;s first project was an excavation of Nippur, a location in present-day Iraq.

Penn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America, which is about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, 12.9 tons, and made of solid red granite.

The sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, Egypt, where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri&#x27;s expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.

The museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and indigenous artifacts of the Americas. Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur.

Penn Museum&#x27;s excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. Features of the Beaux-Arts building include a rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus.

===Other Penn museums and galleries===

Penn maintains a website providing a detailed roadmap to small museums and galleries and over one hundred locations across campus where the public can access Penn&#x27;s over 8,000 artworks acquired over 250 years, which includes paintings, sculptures, photography, works on paper, and decorative arts. The largest of the art galleries is the Institute of Contemporary Art, one of the only kunsthalles in the country, which showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year. Since 1983, the Arthur Ross Gallery, located at the Fisher Fine Arts Library, has housed Penn&#x27;s art collection and is named for its benefactor, philanthropist Arthur Ross.

===Residences===
Every College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows. Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.
The College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House. Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called &quot;The Quad.&quot; The latest College House to be built is Guttman (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.

Penn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council, Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.
==Organization==
The College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the Fels Institute of Government, the master&#x27;s programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. Wharton School is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the School of Nursing and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS).

The current president is J. Larry Jameson (interim).
===Campus police===
The University of Pennsylvania Police Department (UPPD) is the largest, private police department in Pennsylvania, with 117 members. All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.

===Seal===
The official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation. The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.
The official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation. A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees &quot;desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation.&quot; In 1756, a public seal and motto for the college was engraved in silver.

The outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with &quot;Universitas Pennsylvaniensis,&quot; the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the trivium and a modified quadrivium, components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the university, &quot;Leges Sine Moribus Vanae.&quot;

==Academics==

Penn&#x27;s &quot;One University Policy&quot; allows students to enroll in classes in any of Penn&#x27;s twelve schools.

Penn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn&#x27;s &quot;One University&quot; policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.

=== Admissions ===

 SAT and ACT ranges are from the 25th to the 75th percentile.
Undergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by &quot;US News&quot; to be &quot;most selective.&quot; Admissions officials consider a student&#x27;s GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant&#x27;s high school class rank and letters of recommendation. Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.

For the class of 2026, entering in Fall 2022, the university received 54,588 applications. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Penn&#x27;s most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, veterinary), the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Wharton School.

===Coordinated dual-degree, accelerated, interdisciplinary programs===
Penn offers unique and specialized coordinated dual-degree (CDD) programs, which selectively award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools in addition to program-specific programs and senior capstone projects. Additionally, there are accelerated and interdisciplinary programs offered by the university. These undergraduate programs include:
* Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business
* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&amp;T)
* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM)
* Nursing and Health Care Management (NHCM)
* Roy and Diana Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)
* Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS)
* Singh Program in Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS)
* Digital Media Design (DMD)
* Computer and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence
* Accelerated 7-Year Bio-Dental Program
* Accelerated 6-Year Law and Medicine Program

Dual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, &quot;dual degree&quot; students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a BA and an MS in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn&#x27;s School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.

For graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.

The School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs. Penn SP2&#x27;s vision is: &quot;The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.&quot;

Originally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.

The School of Veterinary Medicine offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.

===Academic medical center and biomedical research complex===
In 2018, the university&#x27;s nursing school was ranked number one by Quacquarelli Symonds. That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn&#x27;s school of Veterinary Medicine sixth. In 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third-best medical school for research in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; 2020 ranking.

The University of Pennsylvania Health System, also known as UPHS, is a multi-hospital health system headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by Trustees of University of Pennsylvania. UPHS and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania together constitute Penn Medicine, a clinical and research entity of the University of Pennsylvania. UPHS hospitals include the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and Princeton Medical Center. Penn Medicine owns and operates the first hospital in the United States, the Pennsylvania Hospital. It is also home to America&#x27;s first surgical amphitheatre and its first medical library.

===International partnerships===
Students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions, which include the Singapore Management University, London School of Economics, University of Edinburgh, Chinese University of Hong Kong, University of Melbourne, Sciences Po, University of Queensland, University College London, King&#x27;s College London, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and ETH Zurich.

===Reputation and rankings===

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2024 rankings place Penn 6th of 394 national universities in the United States. The Princeton Review student survey ranked Penn in 2023 as 7th in their Dream Colleges list. Penn was ranked 4th of 444 in the United States by College Factual for 2024. In 2023, Penn was ranked as having the 7th happiest students in the United States (the highest in the Ivy League). Wall Street Journal reported in 2024 that Penn&#x27;s undergraduate alumni earned the 5th highest salaries (taking into account the cost of education and other factors), which was 2nd in Ivy League behind Princeton.

Among its professional schools, the school of education was ranked number one in 2021 and Wharton School was ranked number one in 2022 and 2024 and the communication, dentistry, medicine, nursing, law and veterinary schools rank in the top 5 nationally. Penn&#x27;s Law School was ranked number 4 in 2023 and Penn&#x27;s School of Design and Architecture, and its School of Social Policy and Practice are ranked in the top 10.

==Research==
Penn is classified as an &quot;R1&quot; doctoral university: &quot;Highest research activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RU/VH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to . Penn had research expenditures totaling over in 2023, raking third among U.S. universities in research and development spending, according to the National Science Foundation. In fiscal year 2019 Penn received in funding from the National Institutes of Health.

Penn&#x27;s research centers often span two or more disciplines. In the 2010–2011 academic year, five interdisciplinary research centers were created or substantially expanded; these include the Center for Health-care Financing, the Center for Global Women&#x27;s Health at the Nursing School, the Morris Arboretum&#x27;s Horticulture Center, the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton and the Translational Research Center at Penn Medicine. With these additions, Penn now counts 165 research centers hosting a research community of over 4,300 faculty and over 1,100 postdoctoral fellows, 5,500 academic support staff and graduate student trainees. To further assist the advancement of interdisciplinary research President Amy Gutmann established the &quot;Penn Integrates Knowledge&quot; title awarded to selected Penn professors &quot;whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge.&quot; These professors hold endowed professorships and joint appointments between Penn&#x27;s schools.

Penn is also among the most prolific producers of doctoral students. With 487 PhDs awarded in 2009, Penn ranks third in the Ivy League behind Columbia and Cornell; Harvard did not report data. It also has one of the highest numbers of post-doctoral appointees (933 in number for 2004–2007), ranking third in the Ivy League (behind Harvard and Yale) and tenth nationally.

In most disciplines Penn professors&#x27; productivity is among the highest in the nation and first in the fields of epidemiology, business, communication studies, comparative literature, languages, information science, criminal justice and criminology, social sciences and sociology. According to the National Research Council nearly three-quarters of Penn&#x27;s 41 assessed programs were placed in ranges including the top 10 rankings in their fields, with more than half of these in ranges including the top five rankings in these fields.

Penn&#x27;s research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the oldest continuously operating degree-granting program in chemical engineering, the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments.

In 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called &quot;The American Law Register,&quot; now the &quot;Penn Law Review&quot;, one of the most cited law journals in the world). Under the deanship of William Draper Lewis, the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.

The Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education. It established the first research center in a business school in 1921 and the first center for entrepreneurship in 1973 and it regularly introduced novel curricula for which &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; wrote, &quot;Wharton is on the crest of a wave of reinvention and change in management education.&quot; The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets&#x27;s method of measuring gross national product, the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the &quot;Wharton Model&quot; developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then-president Nixon&#x27;s health reform in the 1970s.

Several major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering. It was here also where the world&#x27;s first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language.

Penn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med; the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines were developed at Penn; the discovery of cancer&#x27;s link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers. More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation; spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting; Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet and limbs; and genetically engineered T cells used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Another contribution to medicine was made by Ralph L. Brinster (Penn faculty member since 1965) who developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.

Penn professors Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa invented a conductive polymer process that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper).

Penn professors Carl June and Michael C. Milone at Penn Medicine developed Kymriah, the first FDA-approved CAR T cell therapy for treating certain types of leukemia, approved in August 2017.

==Student life==
Of those accepted for admission in 2018, 48 percent were Asian, Hispanic, African-American or Native American. Fourteen percent of entering undergraduates in 2018 were international students. The composition of international first-year students in 2018 was: 46% from Asia; 15% from Africa and the Middle East; 16% from Europe; 14% from Canada and Mexico; 8% from the Caribbean, Central America and South America; 5% from Australia and the Pacific Islands. The acceptance rate for international students admission in 2018 was 493 out of 8,316 (6.7%). In 2018, 55% of all enrolled students were women.

In the last few decades, Jewish enrollment has been declining. about 28% of the students were Jewish. In early 2020, 1,750 Penn undergraduate students were Jewish, which would be approximately 17% of the some 10,000 undergrads for 2019–20.
Penn has been ranked as the number one LGBTQ+ friendly school in the country. Penn&#x27;s LGBTQ+ center is second oldest in the nation and oldest in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as it has been serving the LGBTQ+ community since 1979 by providing support and guidance through 25 groups (including Penn J-Bagel a Jewish LGBTQ+ group, the Lambda Alliance a general LGBTQ social organization, and oSTEM a group for LGBTQ people in STEM fields). Penn offers courses in Sexuality and Gender Studies which allows students to discover and learn queer theory, history of sexual norms, and other gender orientation related courses.

===Penn Face and behavioral health===
The university&#x27;s social pressure surrounding academic perfection, extreme competitiveness, and nonguaranteed readmission have created what is known as &quot;Penn Face&quot;: students put on a façade of confidence and happiness while enduring mental turmoil. Stanford University calls this phenomenon &quot;Duck Syndrome.&quot; In recent years, mental health has become an issue on campus with ten student suicides between the years of 2013 to 2016. The school responded by launching a task force. The most widely covered case of Penn Face has been Madison Holleran. In 2018, initiatives were enacted to ameliorate mental health problems, such as requiring sophomores to live on campus and the daily closing of Huntsman Hall at 2:00 a.m. The university&#x27;s suicide rate was the catalyst for a 2018 state bill, introduced by Governor Tom Wolf, to raise Pennsylvania&#x27;s standards for university suicide prevention. The university&#x27;s efforts to address mental health on campus came into the national spotlight again in September 2019 when the director of the university&#x27;s counseling services died by suicide six months after starting the position.

===Student organizations===

The Philomathean Society, founded in 1813, is the United States&#x27; oldest continuously existing collegiate literary society and continues to host lectures and intellectual events open to the public.

&quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; is an independent, student-run newspaper, which has been published daily since it was founded in 1885. The newspaper went unpublished from May 1943 to November 1945 due to World War II. In 1984, the university lost all editorial and financial control of &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; (also known as &quot;The DP&quot;) when the newspaper became its own corporation. &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; has won the Pacemaker Award administered by the Associated Collegiate Press multiple times, most recently in 2019. The &quot;DP&quot; also publishes a weekly arts and culture magazine called &quot;34th Street Magazine&quot;.

The Penn Debate Society (PDS), founded in 1984 as the Penn Parliamentary Debate Society, is Penn&#x27;s debate team, which competes regularly on the American Parliamentary Debate Association and the international British Parliamentary circuit.

The &quot;Penn History Review&quot; is a journal, published twice a year, through the Department of History, for undergraduate historical research, by and for undergraduates, and founded in 1991.

==== Penn Electric Racing ====
Penn Electric Racing is the university&#x27;s Formula SAE (FSAE) team, competing in the international electric vehicle (EV) competition. Colloquially known as &quot;PER,&quot; the team designs, manufactures, and races custom electric racecars against other collegiate teams. In 2015, PER built and raced their first racecar, REV1, at the Lincoln Nebraska FSAE competition, winning first place. The team repeated their success with their next two racecars: REV2 won second place in 2016, and REV3 won first place in 2017.

===Performing arts organizations===
Penn is home to numerous organizations that promote the arts, from dance to spoken word, jazz to stand-up comedy, theatre, a cappella and more. The Performing Arts Council (PAC) oversees 45 student organizations in these areas. The PAC has four subcommittees: A Cappella Council; Dance Arts Council; Singer, Musicians, and Comedians (SMAC); and Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e).

====Penn Glee Club====

The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club, founded in 1862, is tied for fourth oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Each year, the Penn Glee Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production with an eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, highlighting choral singing from all genders

The Glee Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate students.

The Penn Glee Club has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and over 40 nations and territories on five continents and has appeared on national television with such celebrities as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, and Ed McMahon. Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders.

====Penn Band====

The University of Pennsylvania Band has been a part of student life since 1897. The Penn Band presently mainly performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. commencement and convocation). It was the first college band to perform at Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and has performed with notable musicians, including John Philip Sousa, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the U.S. Marine Band (&quot;The President&#x27;s Own&quot;).

Penn Band has performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco (sister and aunt to number of alumni), alumnus and District Attorney and Mayor of Philadelphia, and Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, Vice President Al Gore, presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Polish dissident and president Lech Wałęsa.

====Penn&#x27;s a cappella community====
The A Cappella Council (ACK) is composed of 14 a cappella groups. Penn&#x27;s a cappella groups entertain audiences with repertoires including pop, rock, R&amp;B, jazz, Hindi, and Chinese songs.
ACK is also home to Off The Beat, which has received the most contemporary a cappella recording awards of any collegiate group in the United States and the most features on the &quot;Best of College A Cappella&quot; albums. Penn Masala, formed in 1996, is world&#x27;s oldest and premier South Asian a cappella group based in an American university, which has performed for Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki-moon, Farooq Abdullah, Imran Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, A.R. Rahman, Narendra Modi and Sunidhi Chauhan, had their a cappella version of Nazia Hassan&#x27;s Urdu classic &quot;Aap Jaisa Koi,&quot; (originally from the movie &quot;Qurbani&quot;) sung in the movie American Desi.

Penn alumni Elizabeth Banks (class of 1996) and Max Handelman (Banks&#x27; husband, class of 1995) invited Masala to appear in &quot;Pitch Perfect 2&quot;, as Banks reported that Penn&#x27;s a capella community inspired the film series starring or produced by Banks and Handleman.

====Comedy organizations====
Mask and Wig, a club founded in 1889, was (until fall of 2021) the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. In 2021 the club voted to become gender-inclusive, with auditions open to all undergraduates: male, female, and non-binary.

Bloomers comedy group, founded in 1978, is the .&quot;.. nation&#x27;s first collegiate all-women musical and sketch comedy troupe...&quot;
Bloomers was founded at Penn by Joan Harrison. In the mid teens, Bloomers revised its constitution to be open to .&quot;.. anyone who does not identify as a cisgender man...&quot; and now accepts all persons from under-represented gender identities who perform comedy. Bloomers performs sketches and elaborate shows almost every semester. The comedy troupe is named after bloomers, the once popular long, loose fitting undergarment, gathered at the ankle, worn under a short skirt (developed in the mid 19th century as a healthy comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses then worn by American women), which were in turn, named after Amelia Jenks Bloomer. Bloomers&#x27; most well-known performing alumna is Vanessa Bayer, formerly of Saturday Night Live and is SNL&#x27;s longest-serving female cast member.

===Religious and spiritual organizations===

The following religious and spiritual organizations have a significant on campus presence at Penn:

(A) Mainstream Protestantism:
Dating back to 1857, The Christian Association (a.k.a. The CA), is composed primarily of students from Mainline Protestant backgrounds. Historically, the CA ran several foreign missions including one in China and for decades ran a camp for socio-economically disadvantaged children from Philadelphia. At present the CA occupies part of the parsonage at Tabernacle United Church of Christ.

(B) Judaism:
Organized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century. Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International, which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia). In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn&#x27;s campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.

(C) Roman Catholicism:
The Penn Newman Catholic Center (the Newman Center), founded in 1893 (as the first Newman Center in the country) with the mission of supporting students, faculty, and staff in their religious endeavors. The organization brings prominent Christian figures to campus, including Rev. Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; J. Hagan, OSFS, who worked in the Newman Center and founded Haiti-based non-profit Hands Together; and James Martin SJ (Wharton School undergraduate class of 1982). Father Martin, an editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine &quot;America&quot;, and frequent commentator on the life and teachings of Jesus and Ignatian spirituality, is especially well known for his outreach to the LGBT community, which has drawn a strong backlash from parts of the Catholic Church, but has provided comfort to Penn students and other members of Roman Catholic community who wish to stay connected with their faith and identify as LGBQT.

(D) Hinduism and Jainism:
Penn funds (via the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly or similar undergraduate organization) a variety of official clubs focused on India including a number focused on students who are Hindu or Jain such as: (1) &#x27;Pan-Asian American Community House (PAACH)&#x27;, a center for students to celebrate South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, culture and religion, (2) &#x27;Rangoli—The South Asian Association at Penn&#x27; that educates and informs Penn students (mainly graduate and professional students) with ancestry or interest in South Asia whose goals include a desire to &quot;rekindle the spirit of community&quot; through events, and (3) &#x27;Penn Hindu &amp; Jain Association&#x27;, a student-run official club at Penn that has 80 to 110 student members and an extensive alumni network, dedicated to raise awareness of the Hindu and Jain faiths and foster further development of these communities in the greater Philadelphia area by providing a variety of services and hosting a number of events such as Holi Festival (which has been held annually at Penn since 1993) and &quot;...aims to be a home to anyone seeking to explore their spiritual, religious, or social interests.&quot;

(E) Islam:
In 1963, the Muslim Students&#x27; Association (MSA National) and Penn chapter of MSA National were founded to facilitate Muslim life among students on college campuses. Penn MSA was established to help Penn Muslims build faith and community by fostering a space under the guidance of Islamic principles and towards that goal Penn MSA supports mission of its related umbrella organization, Islamic Society of North America, to &quot;foster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.&quot; The Muslim Life Program at Penn also provides such support and helped cause Penn (in January 2017) to hire its first full-time Muslim chaplain, the co-president of the Association of Campus Muslim Chaplains, Sister Patricia Anton (whose background includes working with Muslim, interfaith, academic and peace-building institutions such as Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Relief). Chaplain Anton&#x27;s mandate includes supporting and guiding the Penn Muslim community to foster further development of such community by creating a welcoming environment that provides Penn Muslim community opportunities to intellectually and spiritually engage with Islam. Penn also has a residential house, the Muslim Life Residential Program, which provides a live/learn environment focused on the appreciation of Islamic culture, food, history, and practice, and shows its Penn student residents how Islam is deeply integrated in the culture of Philadelphia so they may appreciate how Islam influences daily life.

(F) Buddhism:
Penn has a Buddhist chaplain (as well as chaplains of other faiths) and funds the Penn Meditation and Buddhism Club, which (1) is dedicated to helping Penn students practice mindfulness and meditation and learning about Buddhism, (2) conducts weekly meetings that begin with a guided meditation and are followed by discussions of topic(s) relating to mindfulness and Buddhism, and (3) organizes other activities such as ramen nights and weekend meditation retreats to the local Won Buddhism center.

==Athletics==

Penn&#x27;s sports teams are nicknamed the Quakers, but the teams are often also referred to as The Red and Blue as reflected in the popular song sung after every athletic contest where the Penn Band or other musical groups are present. The athletes participate in the Ivy League and Division I (Division I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its &quot;grounds,&quot; and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).

The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of association football (i.e. soccer) and rugby rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).

===Baseball===
The University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s first baseball team was fielded in 1875. Penn has won four championships in the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League, a baseball-only conference that existed from 1930 to 1992, which consisted of the eight Ivy League schools and Army and Navy.

Since 1992, Penn baseball has claimed an Ivy League title, advancing to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship five times.

===Basketball===

Penn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1919–20 and 1920–21 seasons by the Helms Athletic Foundation and for the 1919–20 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League&#x27;s second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn&#x27;s team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph&#x27;s, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men&#x27;s team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&amp;M. Penn last made the NCAA tournament in 2018 where it lost to top seeded Kansas.

===Cricket===
The first University of Pennsylvania cricket team, reported to be the first cricket team in the United States composed exclusively of Americans, was organized in 1842.

On May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against Haverford College (the 3rd oldest intercollegiate athletic contest after Harvard Yale 1852 crew race and Amherst Williams 1859 Baseball game). After Penn moved west of the Schuylkill River in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs, Belmont Cricket Club, Merion Cricket Club, Germantown Cricket Club, or at Haverford College. Beginning in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.

In 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed the Intercollegiate Cricket Association, which Cornell University later joined. Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship, the &quot;de facto&quot; national championship, 23 times (18 solo, three shared with Haverford and Harvard, one shared with Haverford and Cornell, and one shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed from 1881 through 1924.

In the 1890s, Penn&#x27;s cricket team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles. Perhaps the university&#x27;s most famous cricket player was George Patterson (class of 1888), who still holds the North American batting record and who went on to play for the professional Philadelphia Cricket Team.

Following the World War I, cricket began to experience a serious decline, such that in 1924 Penn fielded its last team in the twentieth century. Starting in 2009, however, Penn once again fielded a cricket team, albeit club, that ended up being the first winner of a tournament for teams from the Ivies.

===Curling===
University of Pennsylvania Curling Club qualified for the 2023 National Championship at 6th place, the same ranking they qualified for the 2022 National Championship (where they finished in 2nd place), but in 2023 the team won the national championship by defeating arch rival Princeton University in the championship match (6 to 3). Penn Curling also won the National Championship in 2016 and is the only East Coast team to have won the Curling National Championship.

===Football===

Penn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.

During the 1890s, Penn&#x27;s coach and alumnus George Washington Woodruff introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass.

The achievements of two of Penn&#x27;s other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and John Outland, a Penn Med alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.

The Bednarik Award, named for Chuck Bednarik, a three-time All-American center and linebacker who starred on the 1947, is awarded annually to college football&#x27;s best defensive player. Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969.

Penn&#x27;s game against University of California, Berkeley on September 29, 1951, in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field, was first college football game to be broadcast in color.

===Ice hockey===

Penn&#x27;s first ice hockey team competed during the 1896–97 academic year, and joined the nascent Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) in 1898–99. On the first team in 1896–97 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner and Olympian George Orton (the &quot;first disabled person to compete in the Olympics&quot;). Penn fielded teams intermittently until 1965 when it formed a varsity squad that was terminated in 1977. Penn now fields a club team that plays in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II, is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and continues to play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia.

=== Olympic athletes ===
At least 43 Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold). Penn won more of its &quot;medals&quot; (which were actually cups, trophies, or plaques, as medals were not introduced until a later Olympics) at 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris than at any other Olympics.
In the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, 13 Penn present students or alumni participated in 5 sports (athletics [4], breaking [1], fencing [3], rowing [4], and swimming [1] for 7 countries (Australia [1], Bermuda [1], Canada [2], Egypt [1], Nigeria [1], Slovenia [1], and USA [6])

===Rowing===
Rowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the University Barge Club. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men&#x27;s teams and an open weight women&#x27;s team, all of which compete as part of the Eastern Sprints League. Ellis Ward was Penn&#x27;s first intercollegiate crew coach from 1879 through 1912. During the course of Ward&#x27;s coaching career at Penn his .&quot;.. Red and Blue crews won 65 races, in about 150 starts.&quot; Ward coached Penn&#x27;s 8-oared boat to the finals of the Grand Challenge Cup (the oldest and most prized trophy) at the Henley Royal Regatta (but in that final race was defeated by the champion Leander Club).

Penn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians. Members of Penn crew team, rowers Sidney Jellinek, Eddie Mitchell, and coxswain, John G. Kennedy, won the bronze medal for the United States at 1924 Olympics.

Joe Burk (class of 1935) was captain of Penn crew team, winner of the Henley Diamond Sculls twice, named recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award for nation&#x27;s best amateur athlete in 1939, and Penn coach from 1950 to 1969. The 1955 Men&#x27;s Heavyweight 8, coached by Joe Burk, became one of only four American university crews in history to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The outbreak of World War Two canceled the 1940 Olympics for which Burk was favored to win the gold medal.

Other Penn Olympic athletes and or Penn coaches of such athletes include:
(a) John Anthony Pescatore (who competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for the United States as stroke of the men&#x27;s coxed eight which earned a bronze medal and later competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games in the men&#x27;s coxless pair),
(b) Susan Francia (winner of gold medals as part of the women&#x27;s 8 oared boat at 2008 Olympics and 2012 Olympics),
(c) Regina Salmons (member of 2021 USA team), 
(d) Rusty Callow, 
(e) Harry Parker,
(f) Ted Nash, and
(g) John B. Kelly Jr., son of John B. Kelly Sr. (winner of three medals at 1920 Summer Olympics) and brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, was the second Penn Crew alumnus to win the James E. Sullivan Award for being nation&#x27;s best amateur athlete (in 1947), who was winner of a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics).

Penn men&#x27;s crew team won the National Collegiate Rowing Championship in 1991. A member of that team, Janusz Hooker (Wharton School class of 1992) won the bronze medal in Men&#x27;s Quadruple Sculls for Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Penn teams presently row out of College Boat Club, No. 11 Boathouse Row.

===Rugby===
The Penn men&#x27;s rugby football team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States. Penn first fielded a team in mid-1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and association football code rules relative to American football rules (as such American football rules had not yet been invented). Among its earliest games was a game against the College of New Jersey, which became Princeton in 1895, played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876, with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules. Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools. Among the prominent alumni to play in a 19th-century version of rugby in which rules then did not allow forward passes or center snaps was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Heisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to the present rules of American football. One of Heisman&#x27;s teammates (who was unanimously voted Captain in the fall after Heisman graduated) was Harry Arista Mackey, Penn Law class of 1893 (who subsequently served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1928 to 1932).
In 1906, Rugby per Rugby Union code was reintroduced to Penn (as Penn last played per Rugby Union Code in 1882 as Penn played rugby per a number of different rugby football rulebooks and codes from 1883 through 1890s) by Frank Villeneuve Nicholson (Frank Nicholson (rugby union)) University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine (class of 1910), who in 1904 had captained the Australian national rugby team in its match against England.

Penn played per rugby union code rules at least through 1912, contemporaneously with Penn playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, &quot;Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo that rugby per rugby union code was played.

The player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a master&#x27;s degree at Wharton.

Though Penn played rugby per rugby union rules from 1929 through 1934, there is no indication that Penn had a rugby team from 1935 through 1959 when Penn men&#x27;s rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry &quot;Joe&quot; Edwin Reagan III Penn&#x27;s College class of 1962 and Penn Law class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of USA Rugby and Oreste P. &quot;Rusty&quot; D&#x27;Arconte Penn&#x27;s College class of 1966 Thus, with D&#x27;Arconte&#x27;s hustle and Reagan&#x27;s charisma and organizational skills, a team, which had fielded a side of fifteen intermittently from 1912 through 1960, became permanent.

In spring of 1984, Penn women&#x27;s rugby, led by Social Chair Tamara Wayland (College class of 1985, who subsequently became the women&#x27;s representative to and vice president of USA Rugby South from 1996 to 1998); club president Marianne Seligson; and Penn Law student Gigi Sohn, began to compete. Penn women&#x27;s rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick, a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women&#x27;s rugby team at the University of Arizona and who was a four-year starter at University of Arizona men&#x27;s first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women&#x27;s player Kate Hallinan.

Penn&#x27;s men&#x27;s rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992. , the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers&#x27; rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for number of years had been played each June at Subaru Park in Philadelphia, and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural appearance in the tournament, the Penn men&#x27;s rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17–12 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14–12 win over the University of Texas.

As of 2020, Penn men&#x27;s rugby team is coached by Tiger Bax, a former professional rugby player hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, whose playing experience includes stints in the Super Rugby competition with the Stormers (15s) and Mighty Mohicans (7s), as well as with the Gallagher Premiership Rugby side, Saracens and whose coaching experience includes three successful years as coach at Valley Rugby Football Club in Hong Kong; and Tyler May, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who played rugby at Pennsylvania State University where he was a first XV player for three years.

Penn&#x27;s graduate business and law schools also fielded rugby teams. The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present. The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni Walter Joseph Jay Clayton, III Penn Law class of 1993, and chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017, until December 23, 2020, Raymond Hulser, former Chief of Public Integrity Section of United States Department of Justice (who also was hired by DOJ special counsel Jack Smith to investigate the mishandling by former President Donald J. Trump of certain top secret documents), and Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart who approved the search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of current U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.

Undergraduate Penn Rugby Alumni include (1) Conor Lamb (Penn College class of 2006 and Penn Law class of 2009), who played for undergraduate team, and, as of 2021, is a member of United States House of Representatives, elected originally to Pennsylvania&#x27;s 18th congressional district, since 2019 is a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 17th congressional district and (2) Argentina&#x27;s richest person, Marcos Galperin (Wharton Undergraduate Class of 1994), a premier player on the 1992 Ivy League Tournament championship team, who founded Mercado Libre, an online marketplace dedicated to e-commerce and online auction, which, as of 2016, is the most popular e-commerce site in South America by number of visitors.

===Facilities===
Franklin Field, with a present seating capacity of 52,593, is where the Quakers play football, lacrosse, sprint football and track and field (and formerly played baseball, field hockey, soccer, and rugby). It is the oldest stadium still operating for college football games, first stadium to sport two tiers, first stadium in the country to have a scoreboard, second stadium to have a radio broadcast of football, first stadium from which a commercially televised football game was broadcast, and first stadium from which college football game was broadcast in color. Franklin Field also played host to the Philadelphia Eagles from 1958 to 1970.

<text>The Ultramagnetic MCs is an American hip hop group based in the Bronx, New York City. Founded by Kool Keith, the group also includes Ced Gee, TR Love, and Moe Love. Tim Dog became an unofficial member in 1989. In 1990, DJ Jaycee was added as a road manager and backup DJ. A former member, Rooney Roon, was fired following an assault arrest. Beat-boxer Rahzel was aroadie for the group early in its career. The group&#x27;s work was associated with unorthodox sampling, polysyllabic rhymes, and bizarre lyrical imagery.

== History ==
The Ultramagnetic MCs formed in 1984. Their first single was &quot;To Give You Love&quot; (1985) on the Diamond International label. The group released &quot;Ego Trippin&#x27;&quot;, their first 12-inch single, on Next Plateau Records in 1986. It was the first hip hop song to feature the &quot;Synthetic Substitution&quot; drum break sample, composed by Melvin Bliss and one of the most sampled songs of all time. The group&#x27;s next single was &quot;Travelling at the Speed of Thought (Original)&quot;/&quot;M.C.&#x27;s Ultra (Part Two)&quot; followed by &quot;Funky&quot;/&quot;Mentally Mad&quot;, one of their most sought-after 12-inch singles. &quot;Travelling&quot; used extensive sampling from &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by the Kingsmen while &quot;Funky&quot; was based on a Joe Cocker piano sample later used as the basis for 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;California Love&quot;. The single was released in 1987, and led to the release of the group&#x27;s first album.

The Ultramagnetic MCs released a new school classic in 1988, &quot;Critical Beatdown&quot;, introducing many new sampling techniques. Many believe that without the group&#x27;s primary producer, Ced Gee, the golden era of sampling may have looked very different. Ced, while uncredited, also produced the majority of Boogie Down Productions&#x27; seminal &quot;Criminal Minded&quot;. These albums are among the first to use &quot;chopped&quot; samples, rearranged and edited to change context. Both albums also feature many James Brown samples, which became prominent in hip hop in ensuing years. KRS-One has been quoted as saying that he was close to joining Ultramagnetic MCs early on. Paul C. was also a major contributor to &quot;Critical Beatdown&quot;, producing &quot;Give The Drummer Some&quot;, and engineering most of the album. Paul C. also produced the Hip-House mix of &quot;Traveling At The Speed Of Thought&quot;, which was used as the group&#x27;s first music video, and was their sole release in 1989. The single&#x27;s b-side, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, became one of Ultramagnetic&#x27;s most popular songs and introduced new group affiliate Tim Dog. A variation of the &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; instrumental was used as the basis of Tim Dog&#x27;s debut single, the Ced Gee-produced &quot;Fuck Compton&quot;, which became a modest hit and is credited with helping to spark the East coast/West coast feud of the mid 1990s.

The group went on a hiatus for several years, breaking up temporarily in 1990. They returned on Mercury Records in 1992, with the album &quot;Funk Your Head Up&quot;. The album received a muted response, in part because many tracks had been given a commercial sheen, having been remixed by outside producers at the label&#x27;s insistence. Alternate mixes of this album&#x27;s songs along with unreleased tracks from the sessions have appeared on later compilations. The song &quot;Poppa Large&quot;, remixed by Da Beatminerz, became a hit and remains a staple of Kool Keith&#x27;s live show. The song&#x27;s video featured Keith in a straitjacket, his bald head encased in a birdcage.

In 1993, the group released the album &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, which featured guest production and vocals by Godfather Don, who produced solo Kool Keith sessions in 1992. Some of those tracks appear on &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, and also on &quot;Cenobites&quot;. The former was the last official album the Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s released until their 2007 reunion.

There were many semi-legitimate and compilation albums to follow, the most official of which was Next Plateau&#x27;s &quot;The B-Sides Companion&quot;, which featured a new song, some unreleased 1989 songs recorded for a second Next Plateau LP and most of the group&#x27;s classic singles, albeit in newly remixed form. Ced Gee and Moe Love both provided demos and unreleased songs spanning the group&#x27;s entire career to Tuff City for a series of four albums which were released without Kool Keith&#x27;s consent. A live album, &quot;Brooklyn To Brixton&quot;, was announced but abandoned.

As a reaction to Ced and Moe&#x27;s involvement in the Tuff City releases, Kool Keith and Tim Dog reunited on the album &quot;Big Time&quot;, released under the group name Ultra in 1997. Kool Keith went on to record many solo CDs, including several under aliases such as Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom. His abstract rhymes and syncopated, off-beat delivery influenced many rappers, including Pharoahe Monch from Organized Konfusion and Ghostface Killah of Wu-Tang Clan.

In 2001, Ultramagnetic MCs released a single, &quot;Make It Rain&quot; / &quot;Mix It Down&quot;. Two other songs, &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m Mad&quot; and &quot;Who Am I?&quot; were recorded at the same sessions, but remain officially unreleased. In 2004, the original versions of the Next Plateau singles were finally released on CD as bonus tracks on the remastered &quot;Critical Beatdown&quot;. In a 9 December 2005 interview on Houston&#x27;s &quot;Late Nite Snax&quot; radio show, Kool Keith confirmed rumours that the Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s had reformed and recorded a new album. Founding Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s member Ced Gee has set up Factshen Records. A new Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s LP, &quot;Back to the Future—The Bronx Kings Are Back&quot;, was scheduled to be released in 2006 but was later named &quot;The Best Kept Secret&quot; and released in January 2007. Although the album&#x27;s cover features the original line-up of Kool Keith, Ced Gee, Moe Love and TR Love, TR (along with Tim Dog) were absent. Instead, guest verses are provided by newcomers like Grafiq Malachi Sebek. However, Tim Dog and TR Love have each recently released songs featuring Ultramagnetic under their own names. The group also released a new song after the album&#x27;s release called &quot;We About Chix&quot;, the video can be seen on YouTube.

The group performed live at the ATP I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror festival curated by ATP &amp; Portishead in September 2011 in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

<text>The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world&#x27;s second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk, some Oxford academics fled northeast to Cambridge, where they established the University of Cambridge in 1209. The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as &quot;Oxbridge&quot;.

The University of Oxford is made up of 43 constituent colleges, consisting of 36 semi-autonomous colleges, four permanent private halls and three societies (colleges that are departments of the university, without their own royal charter), and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions. Each college is a self-governing institution within the university, controlling its own membership and having its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college. The university does not have a main campus, but its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.

Oxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world&#x27;s oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide. In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2024, the university had a total consolidated income of £3.05 billion, of which £778.9 million was from research grants and contracts.

Oxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 31 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world. 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals. Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.

== History ==


=== Founding ===

The University of Oxford&#x27;s foundation date is unknown. In the 14th century, the historian Ranulf Higden wrote that the university was founded in the 10th century by Alfred the Great, but this story is apocryphal. It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being. Scholar Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.

It grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris. The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a &quot;universitas&quot; or corporation in 1231. The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.

The students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two &#x27;nations&#x27;, representing the North (&quot;northerners&quot; or &quot;Boreales&quot;, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (&quot;southerners&quot; or &quot;Australes&quot;, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh). In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students&#x27; affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students. At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College, and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name. Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life; Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford, as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.

In 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.

=== Renaissance period ===

The new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies, and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.

With the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford&#x27;s reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.

In 1636, William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university&#x27;s statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to graduate as a Bachelor of Arts, and &quot;dissenters&quot; were only permitted to be promoted to Master of Arts in 1871. The university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause. 

Wadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren. Wren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Invisible College&quot;, held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college&#x27;s Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.

=== Modern period ===
==== Students ====
A major review of the university&#x27;s statutes, some over 500 years old, was conducted in 1827. Among the changes made at this time was the removal of the requirement that students swear an oath of enmity towards a certain Henry Symeonis, who had murdered an Oxford student in the 13th century.

Before reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, &quot;Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.&quot; He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: &quot;The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.&quot; Nevertheless, Walpole argued:
Out of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).

M. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.

All students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the &quot;natural science preliminary&quot; was recognised as a qualifying part of the first year examination.

At the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total. The records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed. Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, &#x27;In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918&#x27;. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.

==== Reforms ====
Two parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, a former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission&#x27;s report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.

The system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores. Schools of &quot;Natural Sciences&quot; and &quot;Law, and Modern History&quot; were added in 1853. By 1872, the last of these had split into &quot;Jurisprudence&quot; and &quot;Modern History&quot;. Theology became the sixth honour school. In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.

The mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. Administrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women&#x27;s colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges&#x27; theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university&#x27;s emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.

The University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921. The list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.

=== Women&#x27;s education ===
The university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level; for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the &quot;steamboat ladies&quot; to receive &quot;ad eundem&quot; degrees from the University of Dublin. In June 1878, the Association for the Education of Women (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot&#x27;s group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879. Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 at Somerville, 9 at Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker&#x27;s shop. There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne&#x27;s College.

These first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh&#x27;s (1886) and St Hilda&#x27;s (1893). All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne&#x27;s in 1979, and finishing with St Hilda&#x27;s, which began to accept male students in 2008. In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege; however, the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women&#x27;s examinations.

On 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees. In 1927 the university&#x27;s dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957. However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women&#x27;s colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women&#x27;s colleges were given full collegiate status.

In 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine&#x27;s became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women. The majority of men&#x27;s colleges accepted their first female students in 1979, with Christ Church following in 1980, and Oriel becoming the last men&#x27;s college to admit women in 1985. Most of Oxford&#x27;s graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony&#x27;s, which was founded as a men&#x27;s college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962. By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female; in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.

In June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford. That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.

The detective novel &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers&#x27; own Somerville College), and the issue of women&#x27;s education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson&#x27;s book &quot;Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education&quot; gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.

== Buildings and sites ==
=== Map ===

=== Main sites ===
The university is a &quot;city university&quot; in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development.

Iconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian.

In 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400 m × 25 m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre. The development has been likened to building a &quot;skyscraper beside Stonehenge&quot;.

=== Parks ===

The University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. There are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.

The Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on . It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a site south of the city that includes native woodland and of meadow. The Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.

==Organisation== 
Colleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).

=== Central governance ===

The university&#x27;s formal head is the chancellor, with Lord Hague of Richmond expected to be inaugurated in early 2025 although, as at most British universities, the chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The chancellor is elected by the members of convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and may hold office until death.

The vice-chancellor, currently Irene Tracey, is the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities.

Two university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university&#x27;s proceedings. The university&#x27;s professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university&#x27;s graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy.

The University of Oxford is a &quot;public university&quot; in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a &quot;private university&quot; in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.

=== Colleges ===


To be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities. Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.

The colleges are:
The permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:
* Blackfriars Hall
* Campion Hall
* Regent&#x27;s Park College
* Wycliffe Hall

The PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university. The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.

Teaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments.

=== Finances ===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of Oxford (excluding colleges) had a total group income of £3.054 billion (2022/23 – £2.829 billion) and total expenditure of £2.263 billion (2022/23 – £2.581 billion). Key sources of income included £551 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £504.2 million), £224.7 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £229.2 million), £778.9 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £789 million), £746.8 million from publishing services (2022/23 – £753 million) £197.2 million from investment income (2022/23 – £180.5 million) and £238 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £186.9 million).

At year end, Oxford (excluding colleges) had endowments of £1.912 billion (2023 – £1.678 billion) and total net assets of £6.388 billion (2023 – £5.385 billion). The colleges had further endowments of £6.796 billion (2023 – £6.388 billion) and total net assets of £8.738 billion (2023 – £8.176 billion). The combined endowment figure of £8.708 billion makes Oxford hold the largest-endowment of any university in the UK. The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.

The central University&#x27;s endowment, along with some of the colleges&#x27;, is managed by the university&#x27;s wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007. The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies. However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.

The university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled &quot;Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford&quot;. This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure; having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion. 

==== Funding criticisms ====
The university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710, and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902. In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal, and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019. The university has defended its decisions saying it &quot;takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration&quot;.

The university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015, £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020 and £1.6 million between 2020 and 2021.

The university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust &quot;to house the fortune he inherited&quot; from his father, Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.

=== Affiliations ===
Oxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities and is regarded to be part of the non-formal grouping of universities which make up the &quot;golden triangle&quot; in South East England. Internationally, it is a member of the Europaeum, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities.

== Academic profile ==
=== Admission ===

In common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October. The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.

To allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.
Oxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.

Most applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.

Undergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. In 2020 interviews were moved online, and they will remain online until at least 2027.

Undergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make &quot;open offers&quot; to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.

The university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools; for instance, Laura Spence&#x27;s rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate. In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools. However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects. The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%. Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.

In 2018 the university&#x27;s annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford&#x27;s colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years. Labour MP David Lammy said, &quot;This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.&quot; In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels. The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%). UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.

===Teaching and degrees=== 

Undergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week&#x27;s work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity. (These are officially known as &#x27;Full Term&#x27;: &#x27;Term&#x27; is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as &quot;first week&quot;, the last as &quot;eighth week&quot; and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example &quot;noughth week&quot; precedes term). Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities, and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).

=== Scholarships and financial support ===

There are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships. Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities. The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards. In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a &quot;massive open online course&quot; (MOOC) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network. The course available is called &#x27;From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development&#x27;.

Students successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; &quot;commoners&quot; (originally those who had to pay for their &quot;commons&quot;, or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term &quot;scholar&quot; in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were &quot;noblemen commoners&quot; and &quot;gentlemen commoners&quot;, but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. &quot;Closed&quot; scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Libraries ===
The university maintains the largest university library system in the UK, and, with over 11 million volumes housed on of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.

The buildings referred to as the university&#x27;s main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602, the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.

The Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together. It now comprises 28 libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library. Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System), and its public interface, SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.

A new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010, and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015. The renovation is designed to better showcase the library&#x27;s various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.

The Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004. Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the &quot;Electronic Enlightenment Project&quot;, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.

=== Museums ===
Oxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world. It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains &quot;The Messiah&quot;, a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.

The University Museum of Natural History holds the university&#x27;s zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university&#x27;s Science Area. Among its collection are the skeletons of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot;, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.

Adjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university&#x27;s archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.

The Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world&#x27;s oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building. It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate&#x27;s is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.

=== Publishing ===

The Oxford University Press is the world&#x27;s second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications. More than 6,000 new books are published annually, including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;Oxford World&#x27;s Classics&quot;, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, and the &quot;Concise Dictionary of National Biography&quot;).

=== Reputation and ranking ===

Due to its age and its social and academic status, the University of Oxford is considered to be one of Britain&#x27;s most prestigious or elite universities and to form, along with the University of Cambridge, a top two that stand above other UK universities in this regard.

Oxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world in the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;, as well as the Forbes&#x27;s World University Rankings. It held the number one position in the &quot;Times Good University Guide&quot; for eleven consecutive years, and the medical school has also maintained first place in the &quot;Clinical, Pre-Clinical &amp; Health&quot; table of the &quot;Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings&quot; for the past seven consecutive years. In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings. The &quot;THE&quot; has also recognised Oxford as one of the world&#x27;s &quot;six super brands&quot; on its &quot;World Reputation Rankings&quot;, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. The university is fourth worldwide on the &quot;US News&quot; ranking. Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in &quot;Financial Times&quot; &quot;Global MBA Ranking&quot;.

Oxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals. It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the &quot;Professional Ranking World Universities&quot;, and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK&#x27;s major companies.

In the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10. Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.

According to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics &amp; International Studies, and Psychology.

== Student life ==

=== Traditions ===

Academic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum. This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow. In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.

&#x27;Trashing&#x27; is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford&#x27;s Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken. Other traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. &quot;Balls&quot; are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. 

=== Clubs and societies ===

The Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. Party political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club. Most academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society.

There are two weekly student newspapers: the independent &quot;Cherwell&quot; and OUSU&#x27;s &quot;The Oxford Student&quot;. Other publications include the &quot;Isis&quot; magazine, the satirical &quot;Oxymoron&quot;, the graduate &quot;Oxonian Review&quot;, the &quot;Oxford Political Review&quot;, and the online only newspaper &quot;The Oxford Blue&quot;. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.

Sport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In particular, much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. In addition, there are higher standard university wide teams. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports.

Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.

Private members&#x27; clubs for students include Vincent&#x27;s Club (primarily for sportspeople) and The Gridiron Club. A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.

=== Student union and common rooms ===

The Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU, exists to represent students in the university&#x27;s decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford&#x27;s more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students.

The importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars).

== Notable alumni ==

Throughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.
More information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.

=== Politics ===
Thirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H. H. Asquith, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak, and Keir Starmer. Of all post-war prime ministers, only Gordon Brown and Keir Starmer took their undergraduate degree at a university other than Oxford (the universities of Edinburgh and Leeds respectively), while Winston Churchill, James Callaghan and John Major never attended a university.

Over 100 Oxford alumni were elected to the House of Commons in 2010. This includes former Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, and numerous members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet. Additionally, over 140 Oxonians sit in the House of Lords.
At least 30 other international leaders have been educated at Oxford. This number includes Harald V of Norway, Abdullah II of Jordan, William II of the Netherlands, five Prime Ministers of Australia (John Gorton, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull), six Prime Ministers of Pakistan (Liaquat Ali Khan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan), two Prime Ministers of Canada (Lester B. Pearson and John Turner), two Prime Ministers of India (Manmohan Singh and Indira Gandhi, though the latter did not finish her degree), S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike (Prime Minister of Ceylon), Eric Williams (Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago), Abhisit Vejjajiva (Prime Minister of Thailand), Norman Manley (Premier of Jamaica), Haitham bin Tariq Al Said (Sultan of Oman), and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (President of Peru). Bill Clinton is the first President of the United States to have attended Oxford; he attended as a Rhodes Scholar. Arthur Mutambara (Deputy Prime Minister of Zimbabwe), was a Rhodes Scholar in 1991. Seretse Khama, first president of Botswana, spent a year at Balliol College. Festus Mogae (former president of Botswana) was a student at University College. The Burmese democracy activist and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, was a student of St Hugh&#x27;s College. Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the current reigning Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) of Bhutan, was a member of Magdalen College. Several of Pakistan&#x27;s President&#x27;s and Foreign Ministers, including Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Wasim Sajjad, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Farooq Leghari studied at different colleges of the university. The world&#x27;s youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, completed a BA in philosophy, politics and economics.

=== Law ===
Oxford has produced a large number of distinguished jurists, judges and lawyers around the world. Lords Bingham and Denning, commonly recognised as two of the most influential English judges in the history of the common law, both studied at Oxford. Within the United Kingdom, five of the current justices of the Supreme Court are Oxford-educated: Robert Reed (President of the Supreme Court),Michael Briggs, Lord Sales, Lord Hamblen, Lord Burrows, and Lady Rose; retired Justices include David Neuberger (President of the Supreme Court 2012–2017), Jonathan Mance (Deputy President of the Supreme Court 2017–2018), Alan Rodger, Jonathan Sumption, Mark Saville, John Dyson, Simon Brown, and Nicholas Wilson. The twelve Lord Chancellors and nine Lord Chief Justices that have been educated at Oxford include Stanley Buckmaster, Thomas More, Thomas Wolsey, Gavin Simonds. The twenty-two Law Lords count amongst them Lennie Hoffmann, Kenneth Diplock, Richard Wilberforce, James Atkin, Nick Browne-Wilkinson, Robert Goff, Brian Hutton, Jonathan Mance, Alan Rodger, Mark Saville, Leslie Scarman, Johan Steyn; Master of the Rolls Wilfrid Greene; Lord Justices of Appeal include John Laws, Brian Leveson and John Mummery. The British Government&#x27;s Attorneys General have included Dominic Grieve, Nicholas Lyell, Patrick Mayhew, John Hobson, Reginald Manningham-Buller, Lionel Heald, Frank Soskice, David Maxwell Fyfe, Donald Somervell, William Jowitt; Directors of Public Prosecutions include Sir Thomas Hetherington QC, Dame Barbara Mills QC and Sir Keir Starmer KC.

In the United States, two of the nine incumbent Justices of the Supreme Court are Oxonians, namely Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch; retired Justices include John Marshall Harlan II, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and Byron White. Internationally, Oxonians Sir Humphrey Waldock served in the International Court of Justice; Akua Kuenyehia, sat in the International Criminal Court; Sir Nicolas Bratza and Paul Mahoney sat in the European Court of Human Rights; Kenneth Hayne, Dyson Heydon, as well as Patrick Keane sat in the High Court of Australia; both Kailas Nath Wanchoo, A. N. Ray served as Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of India; Cornelia Sorabji, Oxford&#x27;s first female law student, was India&#x27;s first female advocate; in Hong Kong, Aarif Barma, Thomas Au and Doreen Le Pichon currently serve in the Court of Appeal (Hong Kong), while Charles Ching and Henry Litton both served as Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong; Laurie Ackermann and Edwin Cameron served on South Africa&#x27;s Constitutional Court; six Puisne Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada and a chief justice of the now defunct Federal Court of Canada were also educated at Oxford.

The list of noted legal scholars includes H. L. A. Hart, Ronald Dworkin, Andrew Burrows, Sir Guenter Treitel, Jeremy Waldron, A. V. Dicey, William Blackstone, John Gardner, Robert A. Gorman, Timothy Endicott, Peter Birks, John Finnis, Andrew Ashworth, Joseph Raz, Paul Craig, Leslie Green, Tony Honoré, Neil MacCormick and Hugh Collins. Other distinguished practitioners who have attended Oxford include Lord Pannick KC, Geoffrey Robertson KC, Amal Clooney, Lord Faulks KC, and Dinah Rose KC.

=== Mathematics and sciences ===
Four Oxford mathematicians, Michael Atiyah, Daniel Quillen, Simon Donaldson and James Maynard, have won Fields Medals, often called the &quot;Nobel Prize for mathematics&quot;. Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, was educated at Oxford and is currently the Regius Professor and Royal Society Research Professor in Mathematics at Oxford. Marcus du Sautoy and Roger Penrose are both currently mathematics professors, and Jackie Stedall was a professor of the university. Stephen Wolfram, chief designer of Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha studied at the university, along with Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, Edgar F. Codd, inventor of the relational model of data, and Tony Hoare, programming languages pioneer and inventor of Quicksort.

The university is associated with eleven winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, six in physics and sixteen in medicine.

Scientists who performed research in Oxford include chemist Dorothy Hodgkin who received her Nobel Prize for &quot;determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances&quot;, Howard Florey who shared the 1945 Nobel prize &quot;for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases&quot;, and John B. Goodenough, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 &quot;for the development of lithium-ion batteries&quot;. Both Richard Dawkins and Frederick Soddy studied at the university and returned for research purposes. Robert Hooke, Edwin Hubble, and Stephen Hawking all studied in Oxford.

Robert Boyle, a founder of modern chemistry, never formally studied or held a post within the university, but resided within the city to be part of the scientific community and was awarded an honorary degree. Notable scientists who spent brief periods at Oxford include Albert Einstein developer of general theory of relativity and the concept of photons; and Erwin Schrödinger who formulated the Schrödinger equation and the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment. Structural engineer Roma Agrawal, responsible for London&#x27;s Shard, attributes her love of engineering to a summer placement during her undergraduate physics degree at Oxford.

=== Religion ===
Oxford has also produced at least 12 saints, 19 English cardinals, and 20 Archbishops of Canterbury, the most recent Archbishop being Rowan Williams, who studied at Wadham College and was later a Canon Professor at Christ Church. Duns Scotus&#x27; teaching is commemorated with a monument in the University Church of St. Mary. Religious reformer John Wycliffe was an Oxford scholar, for a time Master of Balliol College. John Colet, Christian humanist, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, and friend of Erasmus, studied at Magdalen College. Several of the Caroline Divines e.g. in particular William Laud as President of St. John&#x27;s and Chancellor of the university, and the Non-Jurors, e.g. Thomas Ken had close Oxford connections. The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, studied at Christ Church and was elected a fellow of Lincoln College. Britain&#x27;s first woman to be an ordained minister, Constance Coltman, studied at Somerville College. The Oxford Movement (1833–1846) was closely associated with the Oriel fellows John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. Other religious figures were Mirza Nasir Ahmad, the third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shoghi Effendi, one of the appointed leaders of the Baháʼí Faith, and Joseph Cordeiro, the first Pakistani Catholic cardinal.

=== Philosophy ===

Oxford&#x27;s philosophical tradition started in the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste and William of Ockham, commonly known for Occam&#x27;s razor, among those teaching at the university. Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter&#x27;s main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.

Oxford philosophers of the 20th century include Richard Swinburne, a leading philosopher in the tradition of substance dualism; Peter Hacker, philosopher of mind, language, anthropology, and he is also known for his critique of cognitive neuroscience; J. L. Austin, a leading proponent of ordinary-language philosophy; Gilbert Ryle, author of &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;; and Derek Parfit, who specialised in personal identity. Other commonly read modern philosophers to have studied at the university include A. J. Ayer, Elizabeth Anscombe, Paul Grice, Mary Midgley, Iris Murdoch, Thomas Nagel, Bernard Williams, Robert Nozick, Onora O&#x27;Neill, John Rawls, Michael Sandel, and Peter Singer. John Searle, presenter of the Chinese room thought experiment, studied and began his academic career at the university. Likewise, Philippa Foot, who mentioned the trolley problem, studied and taught at Somerville College.

=== Sport ===
Sir Roger Gilbert Bannister, who had been at Exeter College and Merton College, ran the first sub-four-minute mile in Oxford.

Some 150 Olympic medal-winners have academic connections with the university, including Sir Matthew Pinsent, quadruple gold-medallist rower.

Oxford students have also excelled in other sports.

=== Adventure and exploration ===

Three of the most well-known adventurers and explorers who attended Oxford are Walter Raleigh, one of the most notable figures of the Elizabethan era; T. E. Lawrence, whose life was the basis of the 1962 film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;; and Thomas Coryat. The latter, the author of &quot;Coryat&#x27;s Crudities hastily gobbled up in Five Months Travels in France, Italy, &amp;c&#x27;&quot; (1611) and court jester of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, is credited with introducing the table fork and umbrella to England and being the first Briton to do a Grand Tour of Europe.

Other notable figures include Gertrude Bell, an explorer, archaeologist, cartographer and spy who, along with T. E. Lawrence, helped establish the Hashemite dynasties in what is today Jordan and Iraq and played a major role in establishing and administering the modern state of Iraq;

==Oxford in literature and popular media==

The University of Oxford is the setting for numerous works of fiction. Oxford was mentioned in fiction as early as 1400 when Chaucer, in &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, referred to a &quot;Clerk [student] of Oxenford&quot;. Mortimer Proctor argues the first campus novel was &quot;The Adventures of Oxymel Classic, Esq; Once an Oxford Scholar&quot; (1768). It is filled with violence and debauchery, with obnoxious, foolish dons becoming easy prey for cunning students. Proctor argues that by 1900, &quot;novels about Oxford and Cambridge were so numerous that they clearly represent a striking literary phenomenon.&quot; By 1989, 533 novels based in Oxford had been identified and the number continues to rise.

Famous literary works range from &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; by Evelyn Waugh, which in 1981 was adapted as a television serial, to the trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; by Philip Pullman, which features an alternate-reality version of the university and was adapted for film in 2007 and as a BBC television series in 2019.

Other notable examples include:
* &quot;Zuleika Dobson&quot; (1911) by Max Beerbohm, a satire about undergraduate life.
* &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; (1935) by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself a graduate of Somerville College, a Lord Peter Wimsey mystery novel.
* The &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; detective novels (1975–1999) by Colin Dexter, adapted for television as &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; (1987–2000), the spin-off &quot;Lewis&quot; (2006–2015), and the prequel &quot;Endeavour&quot; (2012–2023).
* &quot;True Blue&quot; (1996), a film about the mutiny at the time of the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race of 1987.
* &quot;The History Boys&quot; (2004) by Alan Bennett, alumnus of Exeter College, a play about a group of grammar school boys in Sheffield in 1983 applying to read history at Oxford and Cambridge. It premiered at the National Theatre and was adapted for film in 2006.
* &quot;Posh&quot; (2010), a play by Laura Wade, and its film adaptation &quot;The Riot Club&quot; (2014), about a fictionalised equivalent of the Bullingdon Club.
* &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; (2014), a drama film based on the memoir of the same name written by Somerville alumna Vera Brittain.
* &quot;Middle England&quot; (2019), the prize-winning novel by Jonathan Coe, portrays a deeply divided Britain in the 2010s that is so frustrating that dissatisfied Oxford dons reject elite academia and take their talents elsewhere.
* &quot;Saltburn&quot; (2023), a film about an Oxford student, by Emerald Fennell, alumna of Greyfriars, Oxford.

Notable non-fiction works on Oxford include &quot;Oxford&quot; by Jan Morris.

Information specific to non EU/EEA students (applications, tuition fees and scholarships) can be found at Studyinsweden.se.

===Libraries===
Umeå University Library (a.k.a. &quot;UmUB&quot;) was established at the time of Umeå University&#x27;s foundation in 1965, but has origins in from &quot;the Scientific Library in Umeå&quot; established in 1950 at Umeå City Library. Its main building dates from 1968, but has since been extended and rebuilt, most recently in 2006. There are subsidiary libraries at the Norrland&#x27;s University Hospital and the Umeå Arts Campus.

===Research===
Umeå University has research departments and education in a broad range of academic disciplines, with more than thirty university departments conducting most teaching and research. Since the 1990s there are also several research centers, mostly local but some in partnership with other Swedish universities, such as the neighbouring Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and Luleå University of Technology.

The university is home to more than 2,000 researchers and teachers, many of them with international background. Important research areas include ageing and population studies, infections, and forest research.
* Ageing and population studies have access to the new and unique &quot;Linnaeus database&quot;, which covers the entire Swedish population between 1960 and 2009. It links information from four existing databases, enabling researchers to find new connections between health, lifestyle and aging. The &quot;Demographic Data Base&quot; also gives access to extensive databases with population statistics from old Swedish parish records, dating back to the 18th century, and from 2012 a &quot;Department of Biobank Research&quot;, providing data management for research in large biological sample collections collected since the 1990.
* The infection biology research focuses on microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, and their molecular infection mechanisms – microbial pathogenesis and virulence. &quot;Umeå Centre for Microbial Research (UCMR)&quot;, offer a qualified environment for the development of new strategies against infectious diseases. The centre also hosts &quot;The Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS)&quot;, which is the Swedish&#x27;s node in the &quot;Nordic EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine&quot;.
* The forest research includes plant and forest biotechnology within the &quot;Umeå Plant Science Centre (UPSC)&quot; – a collaborative effort between the &quot;Department of Plant Physiology&quot; at Umeå University and the &quot;Department of Forest Genetics and Plant Physiology&quot; at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), and one of the strongest research environments for basic plant research in Europe, known for its research relating to the genome of the Populus tree and the Norway Spruce. The mapping of the spruce genome, in collaboration with the Swedish &quot;SciLifeLab&quot;, was the first complete sequencing of a gymnosperm and notable because it is seven times the size of the human genome, with some 20 billion base pairs.

<text>The University of Bergen () is a public research university in Bergen, Norway. As of 2021, the university had over 4,000 employees and 19,000 students. It was established by an act of parliament in 1946 consolidating several scientific institutions that dated as far back as 1825. It is Norway&#x27;s second-oldest university, and is considered to be one of the nation’s four so-called &quot;established universities.&quot; It has faculties and programmes in all the academic fields typical of a classical university, as well as such degree programmes as medicine and law that, traditionally, only the “established universities” are authorized by law to offer. It is also one of Norway&#x27;s leading universities in many of the natural sciences, including marine research and climate research. It has consistently been ranked in the top 200 or top one percent of universities in the world, and as one of the best 10 or best 50 universities worldwide in some fields, such as earth and marine sciences. It is part of the Coimbra Group and of the U5 group of Norway&#x27;s oldest and highest-ranked universities.

== History ==
The university traces its roots to several earlier scientific and scholarly institutions founded in Bergen. Academic activity had taken place in Bergen since the founding of Bergen Cathedral School in 1153, the Seminarium Fredericianum in 1750 and the establishment of the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy in 1817. Academia and higher education would also be significantly advanced in the city with the establishment of Bergen Museum, later renamed &quot;University Museum of Bergen&quot;, in 1825. Founded by Wilhelm Frimann Christie and Jacob Neumann, the museum became a venue for both research and education specialized on natural science, and featured prominent researcher like Michael Sars, Daniel Cornelius Danielssen and Fridtjof Nansen.

Bergen would eventually become a city with several arenas for higher education and research with the Geophysical Institute being established in 1917, the Chr. Michelsen Institute in 1930, the Norwegian School of Economics in 1936 and finally the university in 1946. The University of Bergen was established by an act of parliament in 1946, as Norway&#x27;s second university.

== Organization ==
The University of Bergen has an elected rector. The current rector is Margareth Hagen, who was elected for a four-year term starting 1 August 2021 after serving as interim rector.

The university has 7 faculties, the newest being &quot;The Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design&quot; which was established in 2017. The University of Bergen Library and the University Museum of Bergen have a faculty-like status. Most of the university campus and administration is located in the Nygård neighbourhood, which has resulted in the campus area often being referred to as &quot;Nygårdshøyden&quot; or simply H&quot;øyden&quot;, meaning &quot;the hill&quot;.

== Academics ==
The University of Bergen has three strategic areas:
* Marine research

<text>The University of Oslo (; ) is a public research university located in Oslo, Norway. It is the oldest university in Norway and consistently considered the country&#x27;s leading university, one of the highest ranked universities in the Nordic countries and one of world&#x27;s hundred highest ranked universities. Originally named the Royal Frederick University, the university was established in 1811 as the de facto Norwegian continuation of Denmark-Norway&#x27;s common university, the University of Copenhagen, with which it shares many traditions. It was named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway, and received its current name in 1939. The university was commonly nicknamed &quot;The Royal Frederick&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;Det Kgl. Frederiks&quot;) before the name change, and informally also referred to simply as &quot;Universitetet&quot; (). 

The university was the only university in Norway until the University of Bergen was founded in 1946. It has approximately 27,700 students and employs around 6,000 people. Its faculties include (Lutheran) theology (with the Lutheran Church of Norway having been Norway&#x27;s state church since 1536), law, medicine, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, dentistry, and education. The university&#x27;s original neoclassical campus is located in the centre of Oslo; it is currently occupied by the Faculty of Law. Most of the university&#x27;s other faculties are located at the newer Blindern campus in the suburban West End. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area. The university also includes some formally independent, affiliated institutes such as the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO), NKVTS and the Frisch Centre. 

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university&#x27;s Atrium, from 1947 to 1989 and in 2020. Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the Atrium. Five researchers affiliated with the university have been Nobel laureates and three have been Turing Award winners.

==History==
===Early history===

In 1811, a decision was made to establish the first university in the Dano-Norwegian Union, after an agreement was reached with King Frederik VI, who had earlier believed that such an institution might encourage political separatist tendencies. In 1813, The Royal Frederik&#x27;s University was founded in Christiania (now Oslo), a small city at that time. Circumstances then changed dramatically one year into the commencement of the university, as Norway proclaimed independence. However, independence was somewhat restricted, as Norway was obliged to enter into a personal union with Sweden based on the outcome of the Swedish-Norwegian War of 1814. Norway retained its own constitution and independent state institutions, although royal power and foreign affairs were shared with Sweden. At a time when Norwegians feared political domination by the Swedes, the new university became a key institution that contributed to Norwegian political and cultural independence.

The main initial function of The Royal Frederick University was to educate a new class of upper-echelon civil servants, as well as parliamentary representatives and government ministers. The university also became the centre for a survey of the country—a survey of culture, language, history and folk traditions. The staff of the university strove to undertake a wide range of tasks necessary for developing a modern society. Throughout the 1800s, the university&#x27;s academic disciplines gradually became more specialised.

One of the major changes in the university came during the 1870s when a greater emphasis was placed upon research, the management of the university became more professional, academic subjects were reformed, and the forms of teaching evolved. Classical education came under increasing pressure.

When the union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, the university became important for producing highly educated experts in a society which placed increasing emphasis on ensuring that all its citizens enjoy a life of dignity and security. Education, health services and public administration were among those fields that recruited personnel from the university&#x27;s graduates.

===1900–1945===
Research changed qualitatively around the turn of the century as new methods, scientific theories and forms of practice changed the nature of research. It was decided that teachers should arrive at their posts as highly qualified academics and continue academic research alongside their role as teachers. Scientific research—whether to launch or test out new theories, to innovate or to pave the way for discoveries across a wide range of disciplines—became part of the increased expectations placed on the university. Developments in society created a need for more and more specialised and practical knowledge, not merely competence in theology or law, for example. The university strove to meet these expectations through increasing academic specialisation.

The position of rector was established by Parliament in 1905 following the Dissolution of the Union. Waldemar Christofer Brøgger was Professor of Geology and became the university&#x27;s first rector. Brøgger vacillated between a certain pessimism and a powerfully energetic attitude regarding how to procure finances for research and fulfill his more general funding objectives. With the establishment of the national research council after World War II, Brøgger&#x27;s vision was largely fulfilled; research received funding independent of teaching. This coincided with a massive rise in student enrollment during the 1960s, which again made it difficult to balance research with the demands for teaching. In the years leading up to 1940, research was more strongly linked with the growth of the nation, with progress and self-assertion; research was also seen to contribute to Norway&#x27;s commitment to international academic and cultural development.

During the period after World War I, research among Norwegian researchers resulted in two Nobel prizes. The Nobel prize in Economics was awarded to Ragnar Frisch. The Nobel prize in Chemistry was awarded to Odd Hassel. In the field of linguistics, several Norwegian researchers distinguished themselves internationally. Increased research activity during the first half of the 1900s was part of an international development that also included Norway. Student enrollment doubled between 1911 and 1940, and students were recruited from increasingly broad geographical, gender and social bases. The working class was still largely left behind, however.

During the German occupation, which lasted from 1940 to 1945, the university rector, Didrik Arup Seip, was imprisoned. The university was then placed under the management of Adolf Hoel, a NS (Norwegian Nazi Party) appointee. A number of students participated in the Norwegian resistance movement; after fire was set in the university auditorium, Reich Commissar Terboven ordered the university closed and the students arrested. A number of students and teachers were detained by the Germans nearly until the end of the war.

===1945–2000===
After WWII, public authorities made loans available to students whose families were unable to provide financial assistance; the State Educational Loan Fund for Young Students was established in 1947. As a result, the post-war years saw a record increase in student numbers. Many of these students had been unable to begin their studies or had seen their studies interrupted because of the war; they could now enroll. For the 1945 autumn semester, 5951 students registered at the university. This represented the highest student enrollment at UiO up to that time. In 1947, the number had risen to more than 6000 students. This represented a 50 per cent increase in the number of students compared to the number enrolled before the war.

In no prior period had one decade brought so many changes for the university as the 1960s. The decade represented an unparalleled period of growth. From 1960 to 1970, student enrollment tripled, rising from 5,600 to 16,800. This tremendous influx would have been enough in itself to transform the way the university was perceived, from both the inside and the outside. As it turned out, the changes were even more comprehensive. The university campus at Blindern was expanded, and the number of academic and administrative employees rose. The number of academic positions doubled, from fewer than 500 to around 1,200. The increase in the number of students and staff transformed traditional forms of work and organisation. The expansion of the Blindern complex allowed the accommodation of 7,000 students. The explosive rise in student numbers during the 1960s impacted the Blindern campus in particular. The faculties situated in central Oslo—Law and Medicine—experienced only a doubling in student enrollment during the 1960s, while the number of students in the humanities and social sciences tripled.

By 1968, revolutionary political ideas had taken root in earnest among university students. The &quot;Student Uprising&quot; became a turning point in the history of universities throughout the western world. Often, the outlook for students in the 1960s was bleak. More than ever before came from non-academic backgrounds and had few role models. The &quot;University of the Masses&quot; was unable to lift all its students to the &quot;lofty, elite positions&quot; enjoyed by prior generations of academics. Many students dissociated themselves, therefore, from the so-called &quot;establishment&quot; and from the way it functioned. Many were impatient and wanted to use their knowledge to change society. It was thought that academics should stand in solidarity with the underprivileged.

The most fundamental change in the student population was the increasing proportion of female students. Throughout the 1970s, the number of women increased until it made up the majority of students. At the same time, the university became a centre for the organised women&#x27;s liberation movement, which emerged in the 1970s.

Up until the millennium, the number of students enrolled at the university rose exponentially. In 1992, UiO implemented a restriction on admissions for all of its faculties for the first time. A large part of the explanation for the high student numbers was thought to be found in the poor job market. In 1996, there were 38,265 students enrolled at UiO. This level was approximately 75 per cent above the average during the 1970s and 1980s. The strong rise in student numbers during the 1990s was attributed partly to the poor labour market.

==Hierarchy==

The highest position at the university is Professor, i.e. &quot;full Professor.&quot; In Norway, the title &quot;Professor,&quot; which is protected by law, is only used for full professors. Before 1990, all professors were appointed for life to their chairs by the King-in-Council, i.e. by the King upon the advice of the Cabinet. The position below Professor was historically Docent (translated as Reader in a UK context and Professor in an American context). In 1985, all Docents became full professors. The most common positions below that are &quot;førsteamanuensis&quot; (translated as Associate Professor), and &quot;amanuensis&quot; or &quot;universitetslektor&quot; (translated as Lecturer or Assistant Professor). At the University of Oslo, almost all new permanent positions are announced at the Associate Professor level; an associate professor may apply for promotion to full professor if he or she holds the necessary competence.

Additionally, there are temporary, qualifying positions such as &quot;stipendiat&quot; (Research Fellow) and &quot;postdoktor&quot; (Postdoctoral Fellow).

A small number of employees with few or no teaching obligations hold the special research career pathway ranks &quot;researcher&quot;, &quot;senior researcher&quot; and &quot;research professor&quot;, which correspond to assistant professor, associate professor and professor, respectively.

Several other less common academic positions also exist. Historically, only professors had the right to vote and be represented in the governing bodies of the university. Originally, all professors were automatically members of the &quot;Collegium Academicum&quot;, the highest governing body of the university, but soon afterwards its membership was limited. Docents were granted the right to vote and be represented in 1939 and other academics and students in 1955. In 1975, the technical-administrative support staff was also granted the right to vote and be represented in certain bodies, as the last group. Formerly by law, and now by tradition, the highest positions, such as Rector or Dean, are only held by professors. They are elected by the academic community (academics and students) and by the technical-administrative support staff, but the votes of the academics carry significantly more weight.

==Faculties==
The university&#x27;s research structure consists of eight schools, or &quot;faculties.&quot; They are the Faculties of Dentistry, Educational Sciences, Humanities, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Medicine, Social Sciences and Theology.

The university&#x27;s old campus, strongly influenced by Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel&#x27;s neoclassical style, is located in the centre of Oslo near the National Theatre, the Royal Palace and the Parliament.

<text>Uppsala University (UU) () is a public research university in Uppsala, Sweden. Founded in 1477, it is the oldest university in Sweden and the Nordic countries still in operation.

Initially founded in the 15th century, the university rose to significance during the rise of Sweden as a great power at the end of the 16th century and was then given relative financial stability  with a large donation from King Gustavus Adolphus in the early 17th century. Uppsala also has an important historical place in Swedish national culture, and identity for the Swedish establishment: in historiography, religion, literature, politics, and music. Many aspects of Swedish academic culture in general, such as the white student cap, originated in Uppsala. It shares some peculiarities, such as the student nation system, with Lund University and the University of Helsinki.

Uppsala belongs to the Coimbra Group of European universities and to the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities. It has ranked among the world&#x27;s 100 best universities in several international rankings.

The university has nine faculties distributed over three disciplinary domains: Humanities and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology. , it had approximately 52,000 registered students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels and 2,200 PhD students.

Architecturally, Uppsala University has traditionally had a strong presence in Fjärdingen, the neighbourhood around the cathedral on the western side of the river Fyris. Despite some contemporary building developments further away from the centre, Uppsala&#x27;s historic centre continues to be dominated by the presence of the university.

==History==
===15th century: Origins===
As with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical centre. The archbishop of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century. Uppsala had also long been a hub for regional trade and had contained settlements dating back into the deep Middle Ages. As was also the case with most medieval universities, Uppsala had initially been chartered through a papal bull. Uppsala&#x27;s bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477 and established several provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university&#x27;s Chancellor and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members.

===16th century: Turbulent times===

The turbulent period of the reformation of King Gustavus Vasa resulted in a drop in the already relatively insignificant number of students in Uppsala, which was seen as a centre of Catholicism and potential disloyalty to the Crown. Swedish students generally travelled to one of the Protestant universities in Germany, especially Wittenberg. There is some evidence of academic studies in Uppsala during the 16th century; the Faculty of Theology is mentioned in a document from 1526, King Eric XIV appointed Laurentius Petri Gothus (later archbishop) rector of the university in 1566, and his successor and brother John III appointed several professors in the period 1569–1574. At the end of the century, the situation had changed, and Uppsala became a bastion of Lutheranism, which Duke Charles, the third of the sons of Gustavus Vasa to eventually become king (as Charles IX) used to consolidate his power and eventually oust his nephew Sigismund III Vasa from the throne. The Uppsala Synod in 1593 established Lutheran orthodoxy in Sweden, and Charles and the Council of state gave new privileges to the university on 1 August of the same year.

Theology still had precedence, but in the privileges of 1593, the importance of a university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized. Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence. A fourth chair was given to Ericus Jacobi Skinnerus, who was also appointed rector, but whose discipline was not mentioned in the charter. Of the professors, several were taken over from the Collegium regium Stockolmense in Stockholm, which had been functioning for a few years but closed in 1593. An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years. In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150. In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place. In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic Johannes Bureus designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the logotype.

===17th century: Expansion===
The medieval university had mainly been a theology school. The aspirations of the emergent new great power of Sweden demanded a different kind of learning. Sweden both grew through conquests and went through a complete overhaul of its administrative structure. It required a much larger class of civil servants and educators than before. Preparatory schools, gymnasiums, were also founded during this period in various cathedral towns, notably Västerås (the first one) in 1623. Besides Uppsala, new universities were founded in more distant parts of the Swedish Realm, the University of Dorpat (present-day Tartu) in Estonia (1632) and the Royal Academy of Turku in Finland (1640). After the Scanian provinces were taken from Denmark, Lund University was founded in 1666.

Instrumental in the reforms of the early 17th-century Swedish state was the long-dominant Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who had spent his own student days in German universities and who for the last years before his death was also chancellor of the university. King Gustavus Adolphus showed the university a keen interest and increased the professorial chairs from eight to thirteen in 1620, and again to seventeen in 1621. In 1624 the king donated &quot;for all eternity&quot; all his own inherited personal property in the provinces of Uppland and Västmanland, some 300 farms, mills and other sources of income. The king&#x27;s former private tutor, Johan Skytte, who was made chancellor of the university in 1622, donated the Skyttean chair in Eloquence and Government which still exists. The university received a stable structure with its constitution of 1626. The head of the university was to be the chancellor, and his deputy was the &quot;pro-chancellor&quot; (always the archbishop &quot;ex officio&quot;). The immediate rule was the responsibility of the , to which belonged all the professors of the university, and the rector magnificus, who was elected for a semester at the time; the latter position circulated among the professors, each of whom sometimes held it several times.

During the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and perhaps even earlier), the university was located in the old chapter house parallel to the south side of the cathedral, later renamed the &quot;Academia Carolina&quot;. In 1622–1625 a new university building was built east of the cathedral, the so-called &quot;Gustavianum&quot;, named after the reigning king. In the 1630s, the total number of students was about one thousand.

Queen Christina was generous to the university, gave scholarships to Swedish students to study abroad and recruited foreign scholars to Uppsala chairs, among them several from the University of Strasbourg, notably, the philologist Johannes Schefferus (professor Skytteanus), whose little library and museum building at &quot;St Eriks torg&quot; now belongs to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala. The Queen, who would eventually declare her abdication in the great hall of Uppsala Castle, visited the university on many occasions; in 1652 she was present at an anatomical demonstration arranged at the castle for the young physician Olaus Rudbeck. Rudbeck, one of several sons of Johannes Rudbeckius, a former Uppsala professor who became Bishop of Västerås, was sent for a year to the progressive Leiden University in the Netherlands. Returning in 1654, he received an assistantship in Medicine 1655 and had already gone to work on a program for improving aspects of the university. He planted the first botanical garden, the one which would eventually be tended by Carl Linnaeus and is kept today as a museum of 18th-century botany under the name &quot;Linnéträdgården&quot; (&quot;the Linnaean Garden&quot;). With the patronage of the university chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, Rudbeck was made full professor in 1660, was elected rector for two terms, despite his youth, and started a revision of the work of the other professors and a building spree with himself as an architect. His most significant remaining architectural work is the anatomical theatre, which was added to Gustavianum in the 1660s and crowned with the characteristic cupola for which the building is today known.

A gifted scientist, architect and engineer, Rudbeck was the dominant personality of the university in the late 17th century who laid some of the groundwork for Linnaeus and others, but he is perhaps more known today for the pseudohistorical speculations of his &quot;Atlantica&quot;, which consumed much of his later life. When large parts of Uppsala burned down in 1702, Gustavianum, which contained the university library and its many valuable manuscripts, escaped the fire; local lore has it that the ageing Rudbeck stood on the roof directing the work of fighting the fire.

===18th century: Enlightenment and mercantilism===
The early part of the 18th century was still characterized by the combination of Lutheran orthodoxy and classical philology of the previous century, but eventually, a larger emphasis on sciences and practically useful knowledge developed. The innovative mathematician and physicist Samuel Klingenstierna (1698–1765) was made a professor in 1728, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius in 1729, and Carl Linnaeus was made professor of medicine with botany in 1741. The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the &quot;Hats&quot; and the &quot;Caps,&quot; with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge. The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (&quot;Œconomia publica&quot;) in 1741 and called Anders Berch as its first incumbent. This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in the Martin Luther University of Halle and European University Viadrina in 1727). In 1759, following a donation, another chair in the economy was established, the Borgströmian professorship in &quot;practical economy,&quot; which meant the practical application of the natural sciences for economic purposes (it eventually developed into a chair for physiological botany).

There were very radical attempts at reforms which were never implemented, but important changes took place. University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose &quot;philosophiæ magister&quot;-degree being the only one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there was no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to). A few professional degrees for various purposes were introduced in 1749–1750, but the radical suggestion of binding students to a single program of study adapted to a particular profession was never implemented. The reforms of this era have been compared to those of the 1960s and 1970s (Sten Lindroth).

Although it took some time after the fire of 1702, Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala Castle were both eventually restored, both by Carl Hårleman, perhaps the most important Swedish architect of the era. He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus&#x27; botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university.

Another magnificent royal donation was that of the large baroque garden of the castle, given by Gustav III to the university when it was obvious that the old botanical garden was insufficient. A large new conservatory was built by the architect Louis Jean Desprez. Additional grounds adjacent to the baroque garden have since been added. The old garden of Rudbeck and Linnaeus was largely left to decay but was reconstructed in the years between 1918 and 1923 according to the specifications of Linnaeus in his work &quot;Hortus Upsaliensis&quot; from 1745.
===Women at the university===
The issue of women&#x27;s right to study at universities was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svensén, a member of the farmers&#x27; estate. The reception was mixed, with the most negative views coming from the clergy. In the following years, the issue continued to be debated at the universities. In 1870, it was decided to let women take the secondary school examination (&quot;studentexamen&quot;) that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. A common view was that female sensitivity and compassion would make women capable of working as physicians, but their right to work was still restricted to private practice. Women&#x27;s rights to higher education were extended in 1873 when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women.

The first female student in Sweden was Betty Pettersson (1838–1885), who had already worked as a private tutor for several years when she took &quot;studentexamen&quot; in 1871. With a royal dispensation, she was allowed to enter university in Uppsala in 1872, the year before studies at the Philosophical faculty would actually be made generally available to women. She studied modern European languages and was the first woman in Sweden to complete an academic degree when she finished a film. kand. in 1875. She became the first woman to be employed as a teacher in a public school for boys. The first woman in Sweden to complete a doctoral degree was Ellen Fries (1855–1900), who entered Uppsala university in 1877 and became a PhD in history in 1883. Other female students of this period include Lydia Wahlström (1869–1954) who later became a noted educator, activist and writer on women&#x27;s emancipation and suffrage. Defending a dissertation in history in 1900, she became the second woman to finish a doctorate at a Swedish university. In 1892, she founded the Uppsala Women&#x27;s Student Association, which set up spex performances and other things enjoyed by male students but from which the women were excluded at the time. The members of the Association were the first woman to wear student caps in public, an important sign of their status. Elsa Eschelsson (1861–1911) was the first Swedish woman to finish a law degree and the first to become a &quot;docent,&quot; but was not permitted to even hold the position of acting professor despite being formally qualified for this in everything but her sex. After years of conflicts with the professor of civil law A. O. Winroth, who wrote the paper on &quot;Om tjenstehjonsförhållandet&quot; and with the university board, she died in 1911 from an overdose of sleeping powder.

According to the constitution of 1809, only &quot;native Swedish men&quot; could be appointed to higher civil servant positions, including professorships. This was changed in 1925, and the first woman to hold a professorial chair at Uppsala University was Gerd Enequist, appointed professor of human geography in 1949.

Hildegard Björck who studied at the university became the first Swedish woman to receive an academic degree.

==Administration and organisation==
===Central administration===
The governing board of the university is the , with representatives of the faculties as well as members representing the students and non-academic employees (three professors and three students), and ten university outsiders appointed by the Swedish government. All these members in the consistory have the right to vote.

The unions active at the university also have three representatives in the consistory; these members have the right to speak but not any right to vote.

Since the last reorganization in 1999, the university has had a separate body called the &quot;academic senate&quot;, which is a wider, but mostly advisory group representing teaching staff/researchers and students. The executive head of the university is the &quot;rector magnificus&quot;, whose deputy is the &quot;prorector&quot;. There are (also since 1999) three vice rectors, each heading one of the three &quot;disciplinary domains&quot; (Arts and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology) into which the nine faculties are divided. Each faculty has a faculty board and is headed by a dean (&quot;dekanus&quot;). The position of dean is held part-time by a professor of the faculty.

===Faculties===
Through the division of faculties and the addition of a previously independent school of Pharmacy as a new faculty, the traditional four-faculty organization of European universities has evolved into the present nine faculties. The disciplinary domains and their faculties are as depicted below.

====Disciplinary Domain of Arts and Social Sciences====
* 
* 
* (&quot;Juridiska fakulteten&quot;) is the oldest law faculty in the Nordic countries and existed prior to the university&#x27;s founding in 1477. The activities of the faculty include a wide range of research areas and specializations. This Faculty has one department: the Department of Law.
* (formerly the Department of Education, and was raised to the status of a faculty in its own right in 2002)

====Disciplinary Domain of Medicine and Pharmacy====
* Faculty of Medicine
* , originally an independent &quot;royal institute&quot; in Stockholm, which was moved to Uppsala and incorporated with the university between 1968 and 1972.

====Disciplinary Domain of Science and Technology====
* : The engineering programs have since 1982 been marketed as the &quot;Uppsala School of Engineering&quot; (&quot;Uppsala Tekniska Högskola&quot;). This has however never been a separate institution. Still, only a unit within the Faculty of Science and Technology and the use of the term has been phased out after the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was renamed the Faculty of Sciences and Technology in the 1990s.

====Other====
Uppsala University also hosts the Forum for South Asia Studies, a collaborative academic effort by its six faculties: Theology, Law, History and Philosophy, Social Sciences, Languages, and Educational Sciences. The Forum aims to facilitate and promote research and education related to the South Asian countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives and Afghanistan, on the national and international level, with Ferdinando Sardella, Faculty of Theology, serving as the Forum&#x27;s director.

===University Library===
The university library holds about 5.25 million volumes of books and periodicals (131,293 shelf meters), 61,959 manuscripts, 7,133 music prints, and 345,734 maps and other graphic documents. The holdings of the collection of manuscripts and music include, among other things, the Gothic Bible manuscript Codex Argenteus.
The most widely recognized building of the university library is Carolina Rediviva, the &quot;revived Carolina,&quot; thus named in reference to &quot;Academia Carolina&quot; (see illustration), which held the university library from the earliest times until 1691, when it was moved to the upper floor of Gustavianum, where it miraculously survived the great city fire of 1702. In the mid-18th century, there were plans to move it back to Academia Carolina or a new building in the same spot. The building was demolished in 1778 to make place for a new library, but this was never built and the area next to the cathedral where it stood is today a lawn. The present Carolina Rediviva was built in a different place and completed in 1841.

The present university library system comprises 19 branches, including the one in the Carolina building.

===Uppsala University Hospital===

The Uppsala Academic Hospital or &quot;Akademiska sjukhuset&quot;, which functions as a teaching hospital for the Faculty of Medicine and the Nursing School, is run by the Uppsala County Council in cooperation with the university. , the hospital had 7,719 employees and 1,079 places for patients.

The university hospital is actually older than the university, as it goes back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, and much later merged with the university clinic. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place but was moved out of the town in 1811.

The first clinic with the specific intention to facilitate the practical education of medical students was the &quot;Nosocomium Academicum&quot;, founded in 1708 and located at the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget beside the cathedral (see illustration above). The building (the former residence of the president of the Royal Chancellery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna) today houses the Faculty of Law.

The present &quot;Akademiska sjukhuset&quot; was founded in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below Uppsala Castle to the southeast. From this building, which is still in use, the present hospital complex has grown.

===The Svedberg Laboratory===

The Svedberg Laboratory (named after Theodor Svedberg) is a university facility that contains the &quot;Gustaf Werner cyclotron&quot;, which is used for research as well as for proton therapy for the treatment of cancer with close cooperation with the oncology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital. Such an accelerator and its gantries costs between $60 million and $100 million, and makes Uppsala University Hospital one of the approximately 40 centres in the world to provide such cancer treatment.

== Lecture Series ==

=== At the Department of Philosophy ===

==== Hägerström Lectures ====
The Hägerström Lectures are a yearly series of talks by prominent philosophers hosted by the Department of Philosophy at Uppsala University. 

The initiative for the Hägerström Lectures was taken by Stig Kanger, Chair Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at Uppsala University, from 1968 until his death in 1988. The idea was to invite a distinguished philosopher for a week to give a series of five open lectures unified by a common theme, and provide an opportunity for teachers and students at the Department of Philosophy in Uppsala to meet the guest for informal discussions. The series was inaugurated in 1971 and named in honor of the former Chair in Practical Philosophy (1911-1933), Axel Hägerström, the founding father of the Uppsala School of ethics and the jurisprudential movement known as Scandinavian Legal Realism. The Hägerström Lectures were held annually until 2009, biannually between 2009 and 2022, and have been held annually again since 2022. From 2017 onward, the number of lectures each year has been reduced from five to three. 
The first Hägerström Lecturer was Konrad Marc-Wogau, Kanger’s predecessor as Chair in Theoretical Philosophy at Uppsala University (1946-1968). The list of speakers since then includes several of the most eminent and influential philosophers of the last half century in a broad range of areas of specialization, including Julia Annas, Alonzo Church, Donald Davidson, Peter Geach, Ian Hacking, Christine Korsgaard, Saul Kripke, John McDowell, Martha Nussbaum, Hilary Putnam, Judith Jarvis Thomson, Willard Van Orman Quine, Wlodek Rabinowicz, Amartya Sen, Patrick Suppes, Kendall Walton, Timothy Williamson and Georg Henrik von Wright.

==Student life==

===Nations and student union===

Up until June 2010, students at Uppsala University were obliged to become members of one of the nations, corporations of students traditionally according to the province of origin (not strictly upheld now, for practical reasons). The system of dividing students into nations according to origin can ultimately be traced back to the nations at the medieval University of Paris and other early medieval universities, but the Uppsala nations appear only about 1630–1640, most likely under influence of the &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; which existed at some of the German universities visited by Swedish students. In Sweden, nations exist only in Uppsala and Lund. The nations were originally seen as subversive organisations promoting less virtuous aspects of student life, but in 1663 the made membership in a nation legal, each nation being placed under the inspectorship of a professor.

The current thirteen nations all have a history stretching back to the early-to-mid 17th century, but some of them are the result of mergers of older, smaller nations that took place in the early 19th century to facilitate the financing of building projects.

The nations at Uppsala University are:
Since the 1960s there is a fourteenth nation, the &quot;Skånelandens nation&quot; (referring to the Scanian lands) which has no membership fee and exists as a legal device to get around the compulsory membership for students who prefer not to become affiliated with the traditional nations. However, this nation was made redundant in 2010, when membership in a nation ceased to be mandatory.

The Uppsala Student Union was founded in 1849 as a corporation representing all students, irrespective of nation. The pharmaceutical institute became integrated in Uppsala university during 1968 and formed the Faculty of Pharmacy at Uppsala University, and the pharmaceutical educations moved to Uppsala university during 1972. At the same time, the Pharmaceutical Student Union (Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students) became a Student Union at Uppsala University. The students at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from compulsory membership in the nations, but most pharmacy students belonged to one. However, they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Student Union, an organisation having the same role as the nations and Uppsala Student union at the rest of the university.

The compulsory membership in a student union was abolished on 1 July 2010; however, the unions will still be representing organisations in the university boards and committees. The status as a student union will be decided upon by the university board for periods of three years at a time. On 20 February 2013, the university board decided that there will be four student unions at the university from July 2013 – June 2016: the Uppsala Student Union (for students at the faculties of Art, Social Sciences, Languages, Theology, Law, Educational Sciences and Medicine), the Pharmaceutical Student Union (for students at the Faculty of Pharmacy), the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (at the Faculty of Science and Technology), and Rindi (the union for students at Campus Gotland). In February 2016, two additional associations were given the status as student unions: Uppsala Business &amp; Economics Students Association (for students of economics) and Uppsala Law Student Associations (for students of law). Thus, there are now six student unions at Uppsala university.

===Music===

The University&#x27;s Royal Academic Orchestra was founded in 1627. Its main purpose is to play at academic ceremonies but holds concerts on other occasions as well. Its leader has the title of &quot;director musices&quot;. The position has been held by composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfvén and Lars-Erik Larsson. Affiliated with the university are three choirs, the mixed Uppsala University Choir (&quot;Allmänna Sången&quot;), founded in 1830, the male choir Orphei Drängar, founded in 1853, and the Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala, founded in 1957. A number of other choirs and orchestras are affiliated with the nations.

An important name in the recent history of the choirs is Eric Ericson, who was the conductor of both Orphei Drängar and the Chamber Choir. In honour of Ericson, the FöreningsSparbanken endowed the Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing, and the Uppsala University Choral Centre was inaugurated in 2000. The centre arranges courses in choral directing. Uppsala universitets Körcentrum

===Housing crisis===
Like many cities, there is a shortage of housing in Uppsala, a problem which has existed for many years. Both native Swedes and foreign students are finding it difficult to find accommodation when first enrolling on the university. This problem is however not as bad as it was with several major housing construction projects having been completed after 2010.

There has never been a custom in Sweden for the universities to arrange housing for students, in fact, universities are by law not allowed to own housing. Students are expected to set their own living accommodations on the private market. To make it easier for students to find moderately priced housing, special student rooms and student apartments have been built by the student nations and student unions. However, the student housing is insufficient to accommodate all students. About 40,000 students are eligible to live in the 11,000 available rooms and apartments. Because of the low rent in these apartments and the general lack of housing in Uppsala the student apartments are highly attractive and many try to hold on to the contracts as long as possible even after graduating.

===Housing===
Some of the most popular housing accommodations for students are Flogsta, Kantorsgatan, Studentstaden, Studentvägen, Klostergatan, Rackarbergsgatan and many more.

Flogsta is one of the international students&#x27; biggest and most popular housing choices.

==Athletics==
Sports play a very small role in the life of the university, compared to British and especially U.S. universities, but have existed in various forms since the early 17th century. Uppsala University is more noted for its musical and choral traditions. Both have partial roots in the 17th-century institution of extracurricular exercises for students from the nobility.

===The ===

To ease the recruitment of students from the nobility, the university started in the 1630s to offer training in a number of or &quot;exercises&quot; (Swedish: ) deemed necessary for the well-rounded education of a young nobleman: riding, fencing, dance, drawing and modern languages such as French and Italian. The initiative came from Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who saw the value in a well-educated class of civil servants and the danger to his own class if its members would fall behind in academic education compared to those students who came from the lower estates. An &quot;exercise yard,&quot; built for the riding and fencing exercises, was demolished in the late 19th century to give place to the new University Hall. Modern languages were made part of the regular academic curriculum in the 19th century. The surviving &quot;exercises&quot; include:
*&quot;Fencing&quot; – Arranged in collaboration with &quot;Upsala Fäktning&quot;, a private fencing club. 
*&quot;Gymnastics and sports&quot; – Located at the Art Nouveau University Gymnastics Hall, colloquially known as &quot;Svettis&quot; (from the Swedish word for sweat)
*&quot;Riding&quot; – Arranged by the equestrian department of the University, which has its own stables. Leaders of the activities are the Academy Stable Master and the &quot;Inspector Equitandi&quot;
*&quot;Music&quot; – Leader of the musical activities is the &quot;director musices&quot;, who is the conductor of the Royal Academic Orchestra; the current Director Musices is Professor Stefan Karpe
*&quot;Drawing&quot; – The university appoints an established artist as Drawing Master; free weekly croquis and other lessons are offered in the southern tower of Uppsala Castle

===Other sports===
Besides the , other sports have had a presence in Uppsala student life. The Upsala Simsällskap, &quot;Uppsala Swimming Society,&quot; which is the oldest swimming club in the world, was founded in 1796 by the mathematician Jöns Svanberg. It had no formal connection to the university, but all its earliest members came from academic life. Svanberg even arranged a mock graduation ceremony, a &quot;simpromotion&quot;, in a parody of the university ceremonies, where those who had graduated from its swimming training were awarded &quot;degrees&quot; of master (&quot;magister&quot;) and bachelor (&quot;kandidat&quot;). These degrees stuck, and Swedish swimming schools still use these degrees for different levels of swimming skills.

An attempt was made in the 1870s to introduce academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholms Nation acquired a rowing boat in 1877, soon followed by the Göteborgs nation, and for a number of years rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24–23 in Uppsala&#x27;s favour.

==Notable people==


Uppsala University is associated with 8 Nobel Prize laureates, and numerous royalty, academics and public figures.

As the dominant academic institution in Sweden for several centuries, Uppsala University has educated a large proportion of Swedish politicians and civil servants ever since its first period of expansion in the early part of the 17th century. These range from Chancellor of the Realm (&quot;rikskansler&quot;) Johan Oxenstierna (1611–1657) and Lord Chief Justice (&quot;riksdrots&quot;) Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622–1686) to the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting (1860–1925). Other alumni are Dag Hammarskjöld (1905–1961), United Nations Secretary General who was (posthumously) awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and the Swedish diplomat Hans Blix (born 1928), who was Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 1981–1997, of the UNMOVIC 2000–2003, and previously Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs 1978–1979. Hammarskjöld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated in 2003.

Most Swedish clergymen, including most bishops and archbishops, have been educated at the university, including, in more recent times, Nathan Söderblom (1866–1931), Professor of the History of Religions in the Faculty of Theology, later Archbishop of Uppsala, and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930 for his work as leader of the ecumenical movement.

The university became prominent in the sciences in the 18th century with names such as the physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), the father of biological and mineralogical taxonomy, and his numerous important pupils, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), inventor of the Celsius scale the predecessor of the Celsius scale, and the chemist Torbern Bergman (1735–1784). Another scientist from this era is Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), better remembered today as a religious mystic. The university played an important role in the Swedish agricultural revolution of the 18th century; Jacob Faggot, the initiator of the reforms, studied at Uppsala. Several of the elements were discovered by Uppsala scientists during this period or later. Jöns Jakob Berzelius, one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm. Uppsala scientists of the 19th century include the physicist Anders Jonas Ångström (1814–1874). During the 20th century, several Nobel laureates in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university.

Many well-known Swedish writers have studied in Uppsala: Georg Stiernhielm (1598–1672) is often called the father of Swedish poetry. The poet and song composer Carl Michael Bellman (1740–1795), without doubt, the best-loved and best-remembered Swedish 18th-century poet, matriculated but left the university after less than a year. The writer, historian and composer Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783–1847), professor of history, and the poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (1790–1855), professor of poetry, were principal figures of early 19th-century Swedish romanticism. The less than happy experiences of the Uppsala student life of novelist and playwright August Strindberg (1849–1912), resulted in his &quot;Från Fjärdingen och Svartbäcken&quot; (1877), a collection of short stories set in Uppsala (&quot;From Fjärdingen and Svartbäcken,&quot; the title refers to two districts in Uppsala). Other Uppsala alumni are the poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864–1931), who refused the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1918 but received it posthumously in 1931, the novelist and playwright Pär Lagerkvist (1891–1974), Nobel laureate in 1951, and the poet and novelist Karin Boye (1900–1941), for whom one branch of the university library has been named. The Communist leader Ture Nerman (1886–1969) wrote a novel called &quot;Olympen&quot;, based on his experience as a student in Uppsala.

==International cooperation==
Uppsala University has signed student exchange agreements with about 400 universities across all parts of the world. It takes part in the Erasmus programme and the Nordplus programme. It also benefits from its membership in the Coimbra Group of universities.

In May 2010 Uppsala joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen&#x27;s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), and University of Western Australia (Australia).

==In fiction and popular culture==
Along with Lund, Uppsala is the historic and traditional centre of Swedish academic life, making it a popular object of reference in Swedish literature, art, and film. Specifically, Uppsala University has appeared notably in &quot;Män som hatar kvinnor&quot; or &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; by Stieg Larsson.

The Norwegian pop singer Kirsti Sparboe dedicated one of her biggest successes to Uppsala University, publishing in 1969 the song &quot;Ein Student aus Uppsala&quot;. The song, originally written in German, lasted 14 weeks in the German charts.

Uppsala University appears as a research centre in the strategy game &quot;&quot;.

Uppsala University appears in the novel &quot;S.&quot; by Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams. The fictional author V. M. Straka of &quot;Ship of Theseus&quot; sends Mr. Grahn a confidential letter on Uppsala Universitet letterhead and stamps his signature with &quot;Straka Uppsala Arkiv&quot; (included as an insert to the book).

<doc id="31802" wikidata="Q7894104" url="?curid=31802" title="Universal access to education">
<text>Universal access to education is the ability of all people to have equal opportunity in education, regardless of their social class, race, gender, sexuality, ethnic background or physical and mental disabilities. The term is used both in college admission for the middle and lower classes, and in assistive technology for the disabled. Some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict meritocracy, causes lower academic standards. In order to facilitate the access of education to all, countries have right to education.

Universal access to education encourages a variety of pedagogical approaches to accomplish the dissemination of knowledge across the diversity of social, cultural, economic, national and biological backgrounds. Initially developed with the theme of equal opportunity access and inclusion of students with learning or physical and mental disabilities, the themes governing universal access to education have now expanded across all forms of ability and diversity. However, as the definition of diversity is within itself a broad amalgamation, teachers exercising universal access will continually face challenges and incorporate adjustments in their lesson plan to foster themes of equal opportunity of education.

As universal access continues to be incorporated into the U.S. education system, professors and instructors at the college level are required (in some instances by law) to rethink methods of facilitating universal access in their classrooms. Universal access to college education may involve the provision of a variety of different assessment methods of learning and retention. For example, in order to determine how much of the material was learned, a professor may enlist multiple methods of assessment. Methods of assessment may include a comprehensive exam, unit exams, portfolios, research papers, literature reviews, an oral exam or homework assignments. Providing a variety of ways to assess the extent of learning and retention will help identify the gaps in universal access and may also elucidate the ways to improve universal access.

As part of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Universal Education for All (EFA) children were adopted according to the United Nations in 1989. The limitation of education existed for students living with disabilities despite international declarations.

== Non-discrimination and equality in education ==

Human rights are internationally recognized as universal rights, therefore meaning it applies to everyone equally and without discrimination. However, a significant number of individuals miss out on education due to discrimination preventing access to education.

Discrimination occurs most prominently in terms of accessing education. For example, girls can face gender-based barriers such as child marriage, pregnancy, and gender-based violence which often prevent them from going to school or contribute to them dropping-out of school. People with disabilities often face literal accessibility issues, such as a lack of ramps or insufficient school transportation, making it more difficult to get to school. Migrants often face administrative barriers that prevent them from enrolling, effectively barring them from education systems. 

Girls are dropped out of school to assist their families with domestic labour. Due to limited resources, sons are sent to school rather than girls.. Uniforms, tuition fees, textbooks, teacher salaries and school maintenance are part of hindrances to education. Poverty is a significant barrier accessing education. In sub-Saharan Africa, children from the richest 20% of households reach ninth grade at eleven times the rate of those from the poorest 40% of households.

However, discrimination also occurs within education systems when certain groups receiving an inferior quality of education compared with others, for instance, the quality of education in urban schools tends to be higher than that found in rural areas. 

Discrimination also happens after education where different groups of people are less likely to draw the same benefits from their schooling. For example, educated boys tend to leave school with higher wage potential than equally educated girls.

Non-discrimination and equality provisions found in international human rights law (IHRL) exist to ensure that the principle that international human rights are universal is applied in practice. Non-discrimination and equality are not abstract concepts under international human rights law (IHRL). They are elaborated human rights that have been developed over decades to address the discrimination that people face daily. Particularly education where the rights to non-discrimination and equality have been applied to the right to education across numerous human rights treaties, including one dedicated to the issue, known as UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education. 

Despite the strength of non-discrimination and equality law, eliminating discrimination and inequalities is a challenge that individual states and the international community face. This was acknowledged in 2015 when the international community vowed to ‘leave no one behind’. 

International and regional human rights treaties apply the rights to non-discrimination and equality to the right to education of specific marginalised groups. Marginalized groups are those who have suffered prolonged and historical discrimination, usually, but not exclusively, on the basis of identity (gender, for example), characteristics (ethnicity, race), or circumstance (refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons). Marginalized groups are very likely to be subject to multiple, compound, or intersectional forms of discrimination.

Examples of marginalised groups include:

* girls and women 
* national, ethnic, and linguistic minorities 
* people with disabilities 
* indigenous people 

* migrants
* refugees
* asylum-seekers
* stateless persons
* internally displaced persons (IDPs)
*persons in detention / persons deprived of liberty
* people living in poverty
* people living in rural areas
* people affected by HIV
* people affected by albinism
* LGBTQI
* older people and others
*pregnant girls and adolescent mothers
*people living in countries or areas affected by armed conflict

== Access to education in racial minorities ==
In the context of post-secondary education, there exists a lack of access to education that disproportionately affects minority students. The number of students who pursue higher education heavily relies on the number of students that graduate from high school. Since the late 1970s, the rate in which young adults between the ages of 25 and 29 years old have graduated from high school and received a diploma or the equivalent has stagnated between 85 and 88 percent. In terms of race, there is a statistical gap between minority groups’ rates of graduation and white students’ rates of graduation. In 2006, the rate of high school graduation was 93 percent, for Black students was 86 percent, and for Hispanic students was 63 percent.

Although minority college attendance has increased throughout the years, the disparity has remained. In terms of completing high school, in 2010, white (47 percent) and Asian (66 percent) students were more likely to have graduated from high school. In comparison, only 39 percent of Pacific Islanders, 37 percent of Black students, 31 percent of Hispanics, and 28 percent of Native Americans completed high school. This transfers over to the numbers of students in minority groups who have enrolled in college, even though these students have great aspirations to attend college. When examining enrollment numbers, Black (23 percent) and Hispanic (19 percent) students enrolled into and attended 2-year and 4-year universities at lower rates, compared to white (45 percent), Asian (53 percent), and multiracial (37 percent) students. However, Black and Hispanic students are more likely to enroll into 2-year universities.

=== Causes of disparities ===
The disparity in access to higher education is primarily due to a difference in college readiness these students experience. College readiness refers to how prepared for higher education students are. Although there are several ways to define it, college readiness involves measuring four aspects of student performance: basic skills, knowledge of certain content areas, grade point averages (GPA), and college knowledge, also referred to as social capital. Basic skills include being able to read, write and think analytically about situations; content areas that students should have knowledge of include English and mathematics. Both aspects are crucial to college readiness because of their real-world application, and if a student is not proficient in these two areas, they are less likely to even pursue university. However, for many minority students they do not meet the basic requirements for colleges and universities.

In terms of GPA and college knowledge, racial disparities exist. Regarding GPA, the gap in school performance between minority and white students is significant. This gap can influence minority students’ aspirations towards attending college, which affects minority enrollment rates. In terms of college knowledge, many minority students do not have access to social capital because of the lack of resources catered to them to ensure their success. There also is a lack of knowledge among minority students about what resources are available, especially because many of them are first-generation students.

=== Work towards better access ===
Although racial disparities in college readiness exist, there are several ways to counteract them. One way involves the way that students’ communities support them. Their counselors, teachers, and parents must work with them to ensure that their school records, academic records, and such are accurately conveyed to colleges and universities. Other crucial factors that would contribute to higher rates of minority enrollment include encouraging students through policies and rewards for focusing on information pertaining to college, providing schools with the necessary resources, and cultivating the classroom environment to be encouraging of students’ skills so that they are better prepared for college. Organizations like the National Association for College Admission Counseling should also be more aware of this issue as well as do more to bring more attention to these disparities. Changes also must occur on an institution level for minority students to better succeed.

Programs like the ones developed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County work towards eliminating disparities in higher education access in minority students. Their programs mostly focus on minorities having better access and getting more involved in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. One program, the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, aids students by addressing the social capital aspect college readiness. This program connects students to financial resources as well as academic and social support, and they also receive research opportunities and connect with on-campus staff members. Other programs like the ACTiVATE program and the Partnerships for Innovation Program have stemmed from the Meyerhoff Scholars Program. These have pushed minority students towards success in accessing and completing post-secondary education, especially in STEM fields. Other programs across the country have also aided minority students in succeeding in higher education.

== Access to education by law ==

In 2009 the House of Indian Parliament and the President of India both signed and approved a bill that would grant free law mandated education for children ages six to fourteen. It was considered a major step towards universal education for all. Muchkund Dubey author of the article “The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 : The Story of Missed Opportunity&quot; discusses and highlights the issues of access, quality of education, financial implication, and discrimination.

In the United States, Brown vs. Board of Education was a landmark decision because it found and declared that, “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal”. This began the process of desegregation in many schools that had not desegregated yet. The significance of Brown vs. Board was the universal right of all students to attend educational institutions equally rather than using racial segregation to separate students. Jonathan Kozol, author of The Shame of the Nation, talks about how “physical conditions in these newly integrated schools were generally more cheerful…state of mind among the teachers and the children [was] more high-spirited” in the aftermath of desegregation.

== Universal access ==

Universal Access to education is defined as having equal opportunities to take part in any educational system. However, some individuals, groups, or ethnic groups face barriers to equal access. The United States is credited with the current idea of universal access as a concern for handicapped persons. Two international agencies (World Health Organization and World Bank) estimated that around one billion people all over the world have various types of disabilities. Between 93 and 150 million of them are children. Plan International revealed that these kids are less likely to attend school, and if enrolled, they are often separated from their peers. The Global Partnership for Education said approximately 90 percent of children with disabilities from low and middle income nations are out of school. Historically, these students have been excluded from the ordinary education system and referred to special learning schools.

Despite all improvements made, education up to this day is inaccessible to millions of schoolchildren globally. Over 72 million children of primary education age are out of school, and around 759 million adults are uneducated. They do not have the resources for developing the situation of themselves, their families, and their countries. Poverty leads to lack of education. In almost all countries (developing and developed), children face barriers to education as a result of inequalities that emanate from health, gender, and cultural identity like religion, language, and ethnic origin. Factors associated with poverty include unemployment, illiteracy among parents, and ailments increase the possibility of non-schooling and dropout rates. Universal primary education is widely known as a major issue for many nations. The majority of these developing states do not possess the financial resources needed to build schools, provide books and other materials, and recruit, train, and pay teachers. The Sub-Saharan African region is the most affected region in the world as roughly 32 million African children are still uneducated. This is followed by Central and East Asia as well as the Pacific with over 27 million children uneducated. However, observers noted that universal access to education remains an attainable goal by 2030.

<doc id="31803" wikidata="Q332342" url="?curid=31803" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">
<text>Trinity College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. Founded in 1546 by King Henry VIII, Trinity is one of the largest Cambridge colleges, with the largest financial endowment of any college at Oxford or Cambridge. Trinity has some of the most distinctive architecture in Cambridge with its Great Court said to be the largest enclosed courtyard in Europe. Academically, Trinity performs exceptionally as measured by the Tompkins Table (the annual unofficial league table of Cambridge colleges), coming top from 2011 to 2017, and regaining the position in 2024. 

Members of Trinity have been awarded 34 Nobel Prizes out of the 121 received by members of the University of Cambridge (more than any other Oxford or Cambridge college). Members of the college have received four Fields Medals, one Turing Award and one Abel Prize. Trinity alumni include Francis Bacon, six British prime ministers (the highest number of any Cambridge college), physicists Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr, mathematicians Srinivasa Ramanujan and Charles Babbage, poets Lord Byron and Lord Tennyson, English jurist Edward Coke, writers Vladimir Nabokov and A. A. Milne, historians Lord Macaulay and G. M. Trevelyan, and philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell (who the college expelled before reaccepting). Two members of the British royal family have studied at Trinity and been awarded degrees: Prince William of Gloucester and Edinburgh, who gained an MA in 1790, and King Charles III, who was awarded a lower second class BA in 1970.

Trinity&#x27;s many college societies include the Trinity Mathematical Society, the oldest mathematical university society in the United Kingdom, and the First and Third Trinity Boat Club, its rowing club, which gives its name to the May ball. Along with Christ&#x27;s, Jesus, King&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s colleges, it has provided several well-known members of the Cambridge Apostles, an intellectual secret society. In 1848, Trinity hosted the meeting at which Cambridge undergraduates representing fee-paying private schools codified the early rules of Association football, known as the Cambridge Rules. Trinity&#x27;s sister college is Christ Church, Oxford. Trinity has been linked with Westminster School since the school&#x27;s re-foundation in 1560, and its Master is an &quot;ex officio&quot; governor of the school.

==History==
===Foundation===
The college was founded by Henry VIII in 1546, from the merger of two existing colleges: Michaelhouse (founded by Hervey de Stanton in 1324), and King&#x27;s Hall (established by Edward II in 1317 and refounded by Edward III in 1337). At the time, Henry had been seizing (Catholic) church lands from abbeys and monasteries. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge, being both religious institutions and quite rich, expected to be next in line. The King duly passed an Act of Parliament that allowed him to suppress (and confiscate the property of) any college he wished. The universities used their contacts to plead with his sixth wife, Catherine Parr. The Queen persuaded her husband not to close them down, but to create a new college. The king did not want to use royal funds, so he instead combined two colleges (King&#x27;s Hall and Michaelhouse) and seven hostels to form Trinity.

===Nevile&#x27;s expansion===
The monastic lands granted by Henry VIII were not on their own sufficient to ensure Trinity&#x27;s eventual rise. In terms of architecture and royal association, it was not until the Mastership of Thomas Nevile (1593–1615) that Trinity assumed both its spaciousness and its association with the governing class that distinguished it since the Civil War. In its infancy Trinity had owed a great deal to its neighbouring college of St John&#x27;s: in the words of Roger Ascham, Trinity was a &quot;colonia deducta&quot;.

Most of Trinity&#x27;s major buildings date from the 16th and 17th centuries. Thomas Nevile, who became Master of Trinity in 1593, rebuilt and redesigned much of the college. This work included the enlargement and completion of Great Court and the construction of Nevile&#x27;s Court between Great Court and the river Cam. Nevile&#x27;s Court was completed in the late 17th century with the Wren Library, designed by Christopher Wren. Nevile&#x27;s building campaign drove the college into debt from which it surfaced only in the 1640s, and the Mastership of Richard Bentley adversely affected applications and finances. Bentley himself was notorious for the construction of a hugely expensive staircase in the Master&#x27;s Lodge and for his repeated refusals to step down despite pleas from the Fellows. Besides, despite not being a sister college of Trinity College in Dublin, as is the case with Saint John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, it is believed that the Irish institution takes its name from this college, which was the &quot;alma mater&quot; of its first provost, Adam Loftus and, likewise, from the Oxford college of the same name.

===Modern day===
In the 20th century, Trinity College, St John&#x27;s College and King&#x27;s College were for decades the main recruiting grounds for the Cambridge Apostles, an elite, intellectual secret society. In 2011, the John Templeton Foundation awarded Trinity College&#x27;s Master, the astrophysicist Martin Rees, its controversial million-pound Templeton Prize, for &quot;affirming life&#x27;s spiritual dimension&quot;. Trinity is the richest Oxbridge college with a landholding alone worth £800 million. For comparison, the second richest college in Cambridge (St. John&#x27;s) has estimated assets of around £780 million, and the richest college in Oxford (Magdelen) has about £940 million.
In 2005, Trinity&#x27;s annual rental income from its properties was reported to be in excess of £20 million. The college owns:
* 3400 acres (14 km2) housing facilities at the Port of Felixstowe, Britain&#x27;s busiest container port.
* the Cambridge Science Park.
* the O2 Arena in London (formerly the Millennium Dome).

In 2018, Trinity revealed that it had investments totalling £9.1 million in companies involved in oil and gas production, exploration and refinement. These included holdings of £1.2 million in Royal Dutch Shell, £1.7 million in Exxon Mobil and £1 million in Chevron. In 2019, Trinity confirmed its plan to withdraw from the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the main pre-1992 UK University pension provider. In response, more than 500 Cambridge academics signed an open letter undertaking to &quot;refuse to supervise Trinity students or to engage in other discretionary work in support of Trinity&#x27;s teaching and research activities&quot;. On 17 February 2020, protestors from the campaign group Extinction Rebellion dug up the front lawn of Trinity College to protest against the College&#x27;s investments in fossil fuels and its negotiations to sell off a farm in Suffolk that was to be turned into a lorry park.

===Legends===
Lord Byron purportedly kept a pet bear whilst living in the college. Trinity is also often cited as the inventor of an English version of crème brûlée, known as &quot;Trinity burnt cream&quot;.

===Trinity in Camberwell===
Trinity College has a long-standing relationship with the Parish of St George&#x27;s, Camberwell, in South London. Students from the College have helped to run holiday schemes for children from the parish since 1966. The relationship was formalised in 1979 with the establishment of Trinity in Camberwell as a registered charity.

==Buildings and grounds==
===Great Gate===
The Great Gate is the main entrance to the college, leading to the Great Court. A statue of the college founder, Henry VIII, stands in a niche above the doorway. In 1983, Trinity College undergraduate Lance Anisfeld, then Vice-President of CURLS (Cambridge Union Raving Loony Society), replaced the chair leg with a bicycle pump. Once discovered the following day, the college removed the pump and replaced it with another chair leg. The original chair leg was auctioned off by TV Presenter Chris Serle at a Cambridge Union Society charity raffle in 1985. In 2023, the college replaced the chair leg with a sceptre to mark the 75th birthday of Charles III, an alumnus of the college. In 1704, the University&#x27;s first astronomical observatory was built on top of the gatehouse. Beneath the founder&#x27;s statue are the coats of arms of Edward III, the founder of King&#x27;s Hall, and those of his five sons who survived to maturity, as well as William of Hatfield, whose shield is blank as he died as an infant, before being granted arms.

===Great Court===

Great Court (built 1599–1608) was the brainchild of Thomas Nevile, who demolished several existing buildings on this site, including almost the entirety of the former college of Michaelhouse. The sole remaining building of Michaelhouse was replaced by the then current Kitchens (designed by James Essex) in 1770–1775. The Master&#x27;s Lodge is the official residence of the Sovereign when in Cambridge. King&#x27;s Hostel (built 1377–1416) is located to the north of Great Court, behind the clock tower. This is, along with the King&#x27;s Gate, the sole remaining building from King&#x27;s Hall. Bishop&#x27;s Hostel (built 1671) is a detached building to the southwest of Great Court, and named after John Hacket, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. Additional buildings were built in 1878 by Arthur Blomfield.

===Nevile&#x27;s Court===

Nevile&#x27;s Court (built 1614) is located between Great Court and the river, this court was created by a bequest by the college&#x27;s master, Thomas Nevile, originally two-thirds of its current length and without the Wren Library. The court was extended and the appearance of the upper floor remodelled slightly in 1758 by James Essex. Cloisters run around the court, providing sheltered walkways from the rear of Great Hall to the college library and reading room as well as the Wren Library and New Court.
The Wren Library (built 1676–1695, Christopher Wren) is located at the west end of Nevile&#x27;s Court, the Wren is one of Cambridge&#x27;s most famous and well-endowed libraries. Among its notable possessions are two of Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folios, a 14th-century manuscript of The Vision of Piers Plowman, letters written by Sir Isaac Newton, and the Eadwine Psalter. Below the building are the pleasant Wren Library Cloisters, where students may enjoy a fine view of the Great Hall in front of them, and the river and Backs directly behind.

===New Court===
New Court (or &quot;King&#x27;s Court&quot;; built 1825, William Wilkins) is located to the south of Nevile&#x27;s Court, and built in Tudor-Gothic style; this court is notable for the large tree in the centre. A myth is sometimes circulated that this was the tree from which the apple dropped onto Isaac Newton; in fact, Newton was at home in Woolsthorpe when he deduced his theory of gravity – and the tree is a horse chestnut tree. For many years it was the custom for students to place a bicycle high in branches of the tree of New Court. Usually invisible except in winter, when the leaves had fallen, such bicycles tended to remain for several years before being removed by the authorities. The students then inserted another bicycle.

===Other courts===

Whewell&#x27;s Court (1860–1868, Anthony Salvin) is located across the street from Great Court, and was entirely paid for by William Whewell, the Master of the college from 1841 until his death in 1866. The north range was later remodelled by W.D. Caroe. Angel Court (built 1957–1959, H. C. Husband) is located between Great Court and Trinity Street, and is used along with the Wolfson Building for accommodating first year students.

The Wolfson Building (built 1968–1972, Architects&#x27; Co-Partnership) is located to the south of Whewell&#x27;s Court, on top of a podium above shops, this building resembles a brick-clad ziggurat, and is used exclusively for first-year accommodation. Having been renovated during the academic year 2005–06, many rooms are now en-suite. Blue Boar Court (built 1989, MJP Architects) is located to the south of the Wolfson Building, on top of podium a floor up from ground level, and including the upper floors of several surrounding Georgian buildings on Trinity Street, Green Street and Sidney Street. Burrell&#x27;s Field (built 1995, MJP Architects) is located on a site to the west of the main College buildings, opposite the Cambridge University Library.

===Chapel===
Trinity College Chapel dates from the mid 16th century and is Grade I listed. There are a number of memorials to former Fellows of Trinity within the Chapel, including statues, brasses, and two memorials to graduates and Fellows who died during the World Wars. Among the most notable of these is a statue of Isaac Newton by Roubiliac, described by Sir Francis Chantrey as &quot;the noblest, I think, of all our English statues.&quot; The Chapel is a performance space for the College Choir which comprises around thirty Choral Scholars and two Organ Scholars, all of whom are ordinarily students at the University.

===Grounds===
The Fellows&#x27; Garden is located on the west side of Queen&#x27;s Road, opposite the drive that leads to the Backs. The Fellows&#x27; Bowling Green is located north of Great Court, between King&#x27;s Hostel and the river. It is the site for many of the tutors&#x27; garden parties in the summer months, while the Master&#x27;s Garden is located behind the Master&#x27;s Lodge. The Old Fields are located on the western side of Grange Road, next to Burrell&#x27;s Field. It currently houses the college&#x27;s gym, changing rooms, squash courts, badminton courts, rugby, hockey and football pitches along with tennis and netball courts.

===Trinity Bridge===
Trinity Bridge is a stone built triple-arched road bridge across the River Cam. It was built of Portland stone in 1765 to the designs of James Essex to replace an earlier bridge built in 1651 and is a Grade I listed building.

==Academic profile==
Over the last twenty years, the college has always come at least eighth in the Tompkins Table, which ranks the twenty-nine undergraduate Cambridge colleges according to the academic performance of their undergraduates, and for the last six occasions it has been in first place. Its average position in the Tompkins Table over that period has been between second and third, higher than any other. In 2016, 45% of Trinity undergraduates achieved First Class Honours, twelve percentage points ahead of second place Pembroke – a record among Cambridge colleges.

===Admissions===

Trinity&#x27;s history, academic performance and alumni have made it one of the most prestigious constituent colleges of the University, making admission extremely competitive. About 50% of Trinity&#x27;s undergraduates attended independent schools. In 2006 it accepted a smaller proportion of students from state schools (39%) than any other Cambridge college, and on a rolling three-year average it has admitted a smaller proportion of state school pupils (42%) than any other college at either Cambridge or Oxford. According to the &quot;Good Schools Guide&quot;, about 7% of British school-age students attend private schools, although this figure refers to students in all school years – a higher proportion attend private schools in their final two years before university. Trinity states that it disregards what type of school its applicants attend, and accepts students solely on the basis of their academic prospects. Trinity admitted its first female graduate student in 1976, its first female undergraduate in 1978 and elected its first female fellow (Marian Hobson) in 1977.

===Scholarships and prizes===

The Scholars, together with the Master and Fellows, make up the Foundation of the College. In order of seniority:

* Research Scholars receive funding for graduate studies. Typically, one must graduate in the top ten percent of one&#x27;s class and continue for graduate study at Trinity. They are given first preference in the assignment of college rooms and number approximately 25.
* The Senior Scholars usually consist of those who attain a degree with First Class honours or higher in any year after the first of an undergraduate tripos. The college pays them a stipend of £250 a year and allows them to choose rooms directly following the research scholars. There are around 40 senior scholars at any one time.
* The Junior Scholars usually consist of those who attained a First in their first year. Their stipend is £175 a year. They are given preference in the room ballot over 2nd years who are not scholars.

These scholarships are tenable for the academic year following that in which the result was achieved. If a scholarship is awarded but the student does not continue at Trinity then only a quarter of the stipend is given. However, all students who achieve a First are awarded an additional £240 prize upon announcement of the results.

Many final year undergraduates who achieve first-class honours in their final exams are offered full financial support, through a scheme known as Internal Graduate Studentships, to read for a master&#x27;s degree at Cambridge. Other support is available for PhD degrees. The College also offers a number of other bursaries and studentships open to external applicants. The right to walk on the grass in the college courts is exclusive to Fellows of the college and their guests. Scholars do, however, have the right to walk on the Scholars&#x27; Lawn, but only in full academic dress.

==Traditions==

===Great Court Run===
The Great Court Run requires a circuit of the 400-yard perimeter of Great Court, in the 43 seconds of the clock striking 12. The time varies according to humidity. Students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the day of the Matriculation Dinner. It is a difficult challenge: one needs to be a fine sprinter to achieve it, but it is not necessary to be of Olympic standard, despite assertions made in the press.

It is widely believed that Sebastian Coe successfully completed the run when he beat Steve Cram in a charity race in October 1988. Coe&#x27;s time on 29 October 1988 was reported by Norris McWhirter to have been 45.52 seconds, but it was actually 46.0 seconds, while Cram&#x27;s was 46.3 seconds. The clock on that day took 44.4 seconds and the video film confirms that Coe was some 12 metres short of the finish line when the final stroke occurred. The television commentators were wrong to speculate that the dying sounds of the bell could be included in the striking time, thereby allowing Coe&#x27;s run to be claimed as successful. One reason Olympic runners Cram and Coe found the challenge difficult is that they started at the middle of one side of the court, having to negotiate four right-angle turns. In the days when students started at a corner, only three turns were needed. In addition, Cram and Coe ran entirely on the flagstones, while until 2017 students have typically cut corners to run on the cobbles.

The Great Court Run was portrayed in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; about the British Olympic runners of 1924. The run was filmed at Eton College in Berkshire, not in Great Court. Until the mid-1990s, the run was traditionally attempted by first-year students at midnight following their matriculation dinner. Following a number of accidents to undergraduates running on slippery cobbles, the college now organises a more formal Great Court Run, at 12 noon on the day of the matriculation dinner: while some contestants compete seriously, many others run in fancy dress and there are prizes for the fastest man and woman in each category.

===Open-air concerts===

One Sunday each June, the College Choir perform a short concert immediately after the clock strikes noon. Known as &quot;Singing from the Towers&quot;, half of the choir sings from the top of the Great Gate, while the other half sings from the top of the Clock Tower approximately 60 metres away, giving a strong antiphonal effect. Midway through the concert, the Cambridge University Brass Ensemble performs from the top of the Queen&#x27;s Tower.

Later that same day, the College Choir gives a second open-air concert, known as &quot;Singing on the River&quot;, where they perform madrigals and arrangements of popular songs from a raft of punts lit with lanterns or fairy lights on the river. For the finale, John Wilbye&#x27;s madrigal &quot;Draw on, sweet night&quot;, the raft is unmoored and punted downstream to give a fade out effect. As a tradition, however, this latter concert dates back only to the mid-1980s, when the College Choir first acquired female members. In the years immediately before this, an annual concert on the river was given by the University Madrigal Society.

===Mallard===

Another tradition relates to an artificial duck known as the Mallard, which should reside in the rafters of the Great Hall. Students occasionally moved the duck from one rafter to another without permission from the college. This is considered difficult; access to the Hall outside meal-times is prohibited and the rafters are dangerously high, so it was not attempted for several years. During the Easter term of 2006, the Mallard was knocked off its rafter by one of the pigeons which enter the Hall through the pinnacle windows. It was reinstated by students in 2016, and is only visible from the far end of the hall.

===College rivalry===
The college remains a great rival of St John&#x27;s which is its main competitor in sports and academia. This has given rise to a number of anecdotes and myths. It is often cited as the reason that the older courts of Trinity generally have no J staircases, despite including other letters in alphabetical order. A far more likely reason is that the Latin alphabet did not have the letter J—the older courts of St John&#x27;s College also lack J staircases. There are also two small muzzle-loading cannons on the bowling green pointing in the direction of John&#x27;s, though this orientation may be coincidental. Another story sometimes told is that the reason that the clock in Trinity Great Court strikes each hour twice is that the fellows of St John&#x27;s once complained about the noise it made.

===College Grace===
Each evening before dinner, grace is recited by the senior fellow presiding, as follows:

If both of the two high tables are in use then the following antiphonal formula is prefixed to the main grace:

Following the meal, the simple formula is pronounced.

===Punt names===

Befitting the term &quot;trinity&quot;, Trinity College punts are named after people or things related to the number three, such as &quot;Bronze&quot; (award for third place), &quot;Codon&quot; (which has three nucleotides) and &quot;Wise Monkey&quot;. In 2023, the launch of the punt &quot;Charles&quot; marked the coronation of alumnus Charles III.

===Minor traditions===
Trinity College undergraduate gowns are readily distinguished from the black gowns favoured by most other Cambridge colleges. They are instead dark blue with black facings. They are expected to be worn to formal events such as formal halls and also when an undergraduate sees the Dean of the College in a formal capacity. Trinity students, along with those of King&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s, are the first to be presented to the Congregation of the Regent House at graduation.

===Notable fellows and alumni===
The Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge contains the graves of 27 Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge most of whom are also commemorated in Trinity College Chapel with brass plaques. Charles III, King of the United Kingdom, attended from 1967 to 1970. Marian Hobson was the first woman to become a Fellow of the college, having been elected in 1977, and her portrait now hangs in the college hall along with those of other notable members of the college. Other notable female Fellows include Anne Barton, Marilyn Strathern, Catherine Barnard, Lynn Gladden and Rebecca Fitzgerald.

===Nobel Prize winners===

This list includes winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, which is not one of the five Nobel Prizes established by Alfred Nobel&#x27;s will in 1895.
===Fields Medallists===
Four members or alumni of Trinity College have been awarded the Fields Medal.
===Turing Award winners===
===British prime ministers===

Other Trinity politicians include Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, courtier of Elizabeth I; William Waddington, Prime Minister of France; Erskine Hamilton Childers, fourth President of Ireland; Jawaharlal Nehru, the first and longest serving Prime Minister of India; Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister of India; Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore; Samir Rifai, Prime Minister of Jordan; Richard Blumenthal, incumbent senior US Senator from Connecticut; and William Whitelaw, Home Secretary and subsequently Deputy Prime Minister.

===Masters===


The head of Trinity College is called the Master. The role is a Crown appointment, formally made by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. Nowadays, the fellows of the college propose a new master for the appointment, but the decision is formally that of the Crown. The first Master, John Redman, was appointed in 1546. Six masters subsequent to Rab Butler had been fellows of the college prior to becoming master (honorary fellow in the case of Martin Rees), the last of these being Sir Gregory Winter, appointed on 2 October 2012. He was succeeded by Dame Sally Davies, the first female Master of Trinity College, on 8 October 2019.

<text>The University of Cambridge is composed of 31 colleges in addition to the academic departments and administration of the central university. 

Until the mid-19th century, both Cambridge and Oxford comprised a group of colleges with a small central university administration, rather than universities in the common sense. Cambridge&#x27;s colleges are communities of students, academics and staff – an environment in which generations and academic disciplines are able to mix, with both students and fellows experiencing &quot;the breadth and excellence of a top University at an intimate level&quot;.

Cambridge colleges provide most of the accommodation for &quot;undergraduates&quot; and &quot;postgraduates&quot; at the university. At the undergraduate level they have responsibility for admitting students to the university, providing pastoral support, and organising elements of their tuition, though lectures and examinations are organised by the faculties and departments of the central university. All degrees are awarded by the university itself, not the colleges, and all students study for the same course regardless of which college they attend. For postgraduate students, research is conducted centrally in the faculties, departments and other university-affiliated research centres, though the colleges provide a central social and intellectual hub for students.

Colleges provide a range of facilities and services to their members in addition to accommodation, including: catering, library facilities, extracurricular societies, and sporting teams. Much of sporting life at Cambridge is centred around college teams and inter-collegiate competition in Cuppers. Student activity is typically organised through separate common rooms for undergraduate and postgraduate students. Another important element of collegiate life is formal hall, which range in frequency from weekly to every night of the week during Full Term.

Colleges also provide funding, accommodation, or both, for some of the academic posts in the university, with the majority of Cambridge academics being a fellow of a college in addition to their faculty/departmental role. Fellows may therefore hold college positions in addition to their academic posts at the university: these include roles such as Tutor (responsible for pastoral support), Director of Studies (responsible for academic oversight of students taking a particular subject), Dean (responsible for discipline among college members), Senior Tutor (responsible for the college&#x27;s overall academic provision), or Head of college (&#x27;Head of House&#x27;).

Colleges are self-governed charities in their own right, with their own endowments and possessions.

==&quot;Old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; colleges==
The University of Cambridge has 31 colleges, founded between the 13th and 20th centuries. No colleges were founded between 1596 (Sidney Sussex College) and 1800 (Downing College), which allows the colleges to be distinguished into two groups according to foundation date:
* the 16 &quot;old&quot; colleges, founded between 1284 and 1596, and
* the 15 &quot;new&quot; colleges, founded between 1800 and 1977.

The oldest college is Peterhouse, founded in 1284, and the newest is Robinson, founded in 1977. Homerton, which was first founded in the eighteenth century as a dissenting academy (and later teacher training college), attained full college status in 2010.

Six of the &quot;new&quot; colleges (Churchill, Fitzwilliam, Girton, Lucy Cavendish, Murray Edwards and St Edmund&#x27;s) are located on Castle Hill and are thus sometimes referred to as &quot;hill colleges&quot;.

==Restrictions on entry==
All 16 of the &quot;old&quot; colleges and 8 of the 15 &quot;new&quot; ones admit both male and female students as both undergraduates and postgraduates, without any age restrictions. Seven colleges restrict entry by sex, or by age of undergraduates, or admit only postgraduates:

* King&#x27;s originally admitted only boys from Eton College until 1865.
* Murray Edwards and Newnham admit only women. Lucy Cavendish admitted only women until 2021;
* Lucy Cavendish admitted only mature students (i.e., aged 21 or older until 2020) and postgraduates until 2021;
* Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates;
* Hughes Hall, St Edmund&#x27;s and Wolfson admit only mature students and postgraduates.

No colleges are all-male, although most originally were. Darwin, founded in 1964, was the first mixed college, while in 1972 Churchill, Clare and King&#x27;s colleges were the first previously all-male colleges to admit women, whilst King&#x27;s formerly accepted students from only Eton College. The last all-male college to become mixed was Magdalene, in 1988. In 1973 Hughes Hall became the first all-female college to admit men, and Girton first admitted men in 1979.

Newnham also places restrictions on the admission of staff members, allowing only women to become fellows of the college. Murray Edwards does not place this restriction on fellows.

== Architectural influence ==
The Cambridge and Oxford colleges have served as an architectural inspiration for Collegiate Gothic architecture, used by a number of American universities including Princeton University, Cornell University, University of Chicago, and Washington University in St. Louis since the late nineteenth century.

== List of colleges ==


There are also several theological colleges in the city of Cambridge (for example Ridley Hall, Wesley House, Westcott House and Westminster College) that are affiliated with the university through the Cambridge Theological Federation. These colleges, while not officially part of the University of Cambridge, operate programmes that are either validated by or are taught on behalf either of the university or of Anglia Ruskin or Durham Universities.

==Heads of colleges==

Most colleges are led by a Master, even when the Master is female. However, there are some exceptions, listed below. Girton College has always had a Mistress, even though male candidates have been able to run for the office since 1976.

* Mistress: Girton College
* President: Clare Hall, Hughes Hall, Lucy Cavendish College, Murray Edwards College, Queens&#x27; College, Wolfson College
* Principal: Homerton College, Newnham College
* Provost: King&#x27;s College
* Warden: Robinson College

Also see List of current heads of University of Cambridge colleges.

==Former colleges==

The above list does not include several former colleges that no longer exist. These include:
*Ayerst Hostel, founded in 1884 by William Ayerst but closed in 1896. Buildings used by St Edmund&#x27;s House from 1896 and later St Edmund&#x27;s College in 1996.
*Buckingham College, founded in 1428 as a Benedictine hall, refounded as Magdalene in 1542.
*Bull College, an unofficial college for US GIs returning from World War II, existing in Michaelmas 1945 and Lent 1946.
*Cavendish College, founded in 1873, an attempt to allow poorer students to sit the Tripos examinations, whose buildings were bought by Homerton in 1895.
*&quot;Clare Hall&quot; was the name of Clare College between 1338 and 1856. Clare College founded a new college named Clare Hall in 1966.
*Gonville Hall, founded in 1348, and re-founded in 1557 as Gonville and Caius College.
*God&#x27;s House, founded in 1437, and re-founded in 1505 as Christ&#x27;s College.
*King&#x27;s Hall, founded in 1317, and combined with Michaelhouse to form Trinity College in 1546.
*Michaelhouse, founded in 1324, and combined with King&#x27;s Hall to form Trinity College in 1546.
*New Hall, founded in 1954, and re-founded in 2008 as Murray Edwards College
*Physwick Hostel — a predecessor of Gonville and Caius College
*University College, founded in 1965, and re-founded in 1972 as Wolfson College
*University Hall, founded in 1326, refounded as Clare Hall in 1338, renamed as Clare College in 1856.

<text>Christ&#x27;s College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. The college includes the Master, the Fellows of the College, and about 450 undergraduate and 250 graduate students. The college was founded by William Byngham in 1437 as God&#x27;s House. In 1505, the college was granted a new royal charter, was given a substantial endowment by Lady Margaret Beaufort, and changed its name to Christ&#x27;s College, becoming the twelfth of the Cambridge colleges to be founded in its current form. Alumni of the college include some of Cambridge University&#x27;s most famous members, including Charles Darwin and John Milton.

The Master is Lord McDonald of Salford.

==History==

Christ&#x27;s College was founded by William Byngham in 1437 as God&#x27;s House, on land which was soon after sold to enable the enlargement of King&#x27;s College. Byngham obtained the first royal licence for God&#x27;s House in July 1439. The college was founded to provide for the lack of grammar-school masters in England at the time, and the college has been described as &quot;the first secondary-school training college on record&quot;. The original site of Godshouse was surrendered in 1443 to King&#x27;s College, and currently about three-quarters of King&#x27;s College Chapel stands on the original site of God&#x27;s House.

After the original royal licence of 1439, three more licences, two in 1442 and one in 1446, were granted before in 1448 God&#x27;s House received the charter upon which the college was in fact founded. In this charter, King Henry VI was named as the founder, and in the same year the college moved to its current site.

In 1505, the college was endowed by Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII, and was given the name Christ&#x27;s College, perhaps at the suggestion of her confessor, the Bishop John Fisher. The expansion in the population of the college in the 17th century led to the building, in the 1640s, of the Fellows&#x27; Building in what is now Second Court.
==Buildings==
The original 15th/16th-century college buildings now form part of First Court, including the chapel, Master&#x27;s Lodge and Great Gate tower. The gate itself is disproportionate: the bottom has been cut off to accommodate a rise in street level, which can be seen in the steps leading &quot;down&quot; to the foot of L staircase in the gate tower. The college hall, originally built at the start of the 16th century, was restored in 1875–1879 by George Gilbert Scott the younger. The lawn of First Court is famously round, and a wisteria sprawls up the front of the Master&#x27;s lodge.

Second Court is fully built up on only three sides, one of which is formed by the 1640s Fellows&#x27; Building. The fourth side backs onto the Master&#x27;s garden.

The Stevenson Building in Third Court was designed by J. J. Stevenson in the 1880s and was extended in 1905 as part of the College&#x27;s Quadcentenary. In 1947 Professor Albert Richardson designed a new cupola for the Stevenson building, and a second building, the neo-Georgian Chancellor&#x27;s Building (W staircase, now known as The Blyth Building), completed in 1950. Third Court&#x27;s Memorial Building (Y staircase), a twin of the Chancellor&#x27;s building, also by Richardson, was completed in 1953 at a cost of £80,000. Third Court is also noted for its display of irises in May and June, a gift to the college in 1946.

The controversial tiered concrete New Court (often dubbed &quot;the Typewriter&quot;) was designed in the Modernist style by Sir Denys Lasdun in 1966–70, and was described as &quot;superb&quot; in Lasdun&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Guardian&quot;. Design critic Hugh Pearman comments &quot;Lasdun had big trouble relating to the street at the overhanging rear&quot;. It appears distinctively in aerial photographs, forming part of the northern boundary of the college.

An assortment of neighbouring buildings have been absorbed into the college, of which the most notable is the Todd Building, previously Cambridge&#x27;s County Hall.

Through an arch in the Fellows&#x27; Building is the Fellows&#x27; Garden. It includes two mulberry trees, of which the older was planted in 1608, the same year as Milton&#x27;s birth. Both trees have toppled sideways, the younger tree in the Great Storm of 1987, and are now earthed up round the trunks, but continue to fruit every year.

===Swimming pool===

Christ&#x27;s College is one of only five colleges in Oxford or Cambridge to have its own swimming pool. It is fed by water from Hobson&#x27;s Conduit. Recently refurbished, it is now known as the &#x27;Malcolm Bowie Bathing Pool&#x27;, and is thought to be the oldest outdoor swimming pool in the UK, dating from the mid 17th century. The other four swimming pools within colleges belong to Girton College (indoor pool), Corpus Christi College (outdoor pool), Emmanuel College (outdoor pool) and Clare Hall (indoor pool).

==Academic profile==

With a reputation even within Cambridge for the highest academic standards, Christ&#x27;s came first in the Tompkins Table&#x27;s twentieth anniversary aggregate table, and between 2001 and 2007, it had a mean position of third. Academic excellence continues at Christ&#x27;s, with 91% of students in 2013 gaining a first class degree or an upper second (II.i). This is significantly higher than the University average of 70%.

Christ&#x27;s is noted for educating two of Cambridge&#x27;s most famous alumni, the poet John Milton and the naturalist Charles Darwin, who, during the celebrations for the 800th anniversary of the University, were both placed at the foreground as two of the four most iconic individuals in the University&#x27;s history. The college has also educated Nobel Laureates including Martin Evans, James Meade, Alexander Todd and Duncan Haldane. It is the University&#x27;s 6th largest producer of Nobel Prize winners.

Some of the college&#x27;s other famous alumni include former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, theologian William Paley, historian Simon Schama, South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, Lord Mountbatten, medical doctor, scientist, and diplomat Davidson Nicol, and comedians John Oliver, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Andy Parsons.

==Student life==
The Junior Combination Room (JCR), represents the undergraduate students. It organises social and welfare events, and negotiates on the students&#x27; behalf on important issues. The JCR has a standing committee and a common room for all the students. The JCR&#x27;s counterpart, the Middle Combination Room (MCR) represents the graduate students of the College, and has its own bar. The MCR organises regular Graduate Halls. A Garden Party is held by both the JCR and the MCR every June in the Fellows&#x27; Garden. The Senior Combination Room (SCR) is composed solely of fellows of the College and holds two feasts each year.

The Acting Chaplain of the college is Michael Dormandy.

Other societies in Christ&#x27;s include:
* The Marguerites Club, one of the oldest surviving College societies, reformed in 1899 by Gilbert Jessop the then captain of CUCC. It is believed to have originally formed some ten years earlier, but was soon disbanded. Originally the society was confined to captains and secretaries or those with colours in three sports. The club continues to exist to recognise sporting excellence within the college. The name originated from the club&#x27;s original blazer, which was navy blue in colour with the Foundress&#x27;s &#x27;rebus&#x27; or badge, signifying her name, embroidered on the pocket.
* Christ&#x27;s College Boat Club, the oldest college sports club still active, having been founded in 1830. Like many other Cambridge Colleges, Christ&#x27;s has its own boathouse on the banks of the Cam.
* Christ&#x27;s College Rugby Football Club, founded in 1875 by Alfred Cort Haddon, who is considered the father of modern anthropology. In the 1960 Varsity Match, eight of the starting Cambridge team were students at Christ&#x27;s and all of the side&#x27;s points were scored by Christ&#x27;s players. The CCRFC is nicknamed &quot;The Brown Rings&quot; after the brown and white hoops featured on the match kit.
* Christ&#x27;s College Association Football Club, which prides itself on having won the inter-collegiate Cuppers competition more times than any other.
* Christ&#x27;s Films, which uses the theatre to screen new films weekly
* Christ&#x27;s Amateur Dramatic Society
* Christ&#x27;s College Medical Society
* Christ&#x27;s Politics Society
* Christ&#x27;s College Music Society, founded 1710.
* Christ&#x27;s College Chapel Choir

===May ball===

Christ&#x27;s, like most other Cambridge Colleges, also hosts a biennial May Ball in the time after undergraduate examinations which is by students commonly known as May Week. A separate society called &quot;Christ&#x27;s College May Ball Committee&quot; is set up every two years to organise and direct this event. The 2010 May Ball, named &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot;, was held on 15 June 2010 and featured a 1920s Parisian theme, Two Door Cinema Club headlined the entertainment. The May Ball in June 2012 featured a Rio de Janeiro carnival theme. Other previous themes include Le Reve in 2002, Silhouette in 2004, Elysium in 2006 and &#x27;The Jasmine Ball&#x27; in 2008. The May Ball on Tuesday 17 June 2014 was hailed as one of the best May Balls of the year. It was themed &quot;The Emerald City&quot;. The May Ball in 2016 was themed as Biophilia. In 2018 the theme was A Night&#x27;s Tale. While the 2020 Ball was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the May Ball returned in 2022, themed as Mythos. The 2024 May Ball was themed after the William Shakespeare play, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Grace==

The College Grace is normally said before any dinner held in the Formal Hall of the College. Though the student body rises for the recitation of the Grace, Christ&#x27;s is one of the only Colleges in Cambridge where the students do not rise when the Fellows enter and leave the Dining Hall. This is said to be the result of a historical conflict between the Students and Fellows at Christ&#x27;s, who were on opposite sides during the English Civil War. The words of the Grace are as follows:

==Notable people==

<text>Peterhouse is the oldest constituent college of the University of Cambridge in England, founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely. Peterhouse has around 300 undergraduate and 175 graduate students, and 54 fellows.

Peterhouse alumni are notably eminent within the natural sciences, including scientists Lord Kelvin, Henry Cavendish, Charles Babbage, James Clerk Maxwell, James Dewar, Frank Whittle, and five Nobel prize winners in science: Sir John Kendrew, Sir Aaron Klug, Archer Martin, Max Perutz, and Michael Levitt. Peterhouse alumni also include the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift, Lord Chancellors, Lord Chief Justices, important poets such as Thomas Gray, the first British Fields Medallist Klaus Roth, Oscar-winning film director Sam Mendes and comedian David Mitchell. British Prime Minister Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, and Elijah Mudenda, second prime minister of Zambia, also studied at the college.

Peterhouse is one of the wealthiest colleges in Cambridge, with assets exceeding £350 million. It is currently third in terms of net assets per student. Members of Peterhouse are encouraged to attend communal dinners, known as &quot;Hall&quot;. Hall takes place in two sittings, with the second known as &quot;Formal Hall&quot;, which consists of a three-course candlelit meal and which must be attended wearing suits and gowns. At Formal Hall, the students rise as the fellows proceed in, a gong is rung, and two Latin graces are read. Peterhouse also hosts a biennial white-tie ball as part of May Week celebrations.

In recent years, Peterhouse has been ranked as one of the highest achieving colleges in Cambridge, although academic performance tends to vary year to year due to its small population. In the past five years, it has sat in the top ten of the 29 colleges within the Tompkins Table. Peterhouse sat at fourth in 2018 and 2019.

== History ==

===Foundation===
The foundation of Peterhouse dates to 1280, when letters patent from Edward I dated Burgh, Suffolk, 24 December 1280 allowed Hugh de Balsham, to keep a number of scholars in the Hospital of St John, where they were to live according to the rules of the scholars of Merton. After disagreement between the scholars and the Brethren of the Hospital, both requested a separation. As a result, in 1284 Balsham transferred the scholars to the present site with the purchase of two houses just outside the then Trumpington Gate to accommodate a Master and fourteen &quot;worthy but impoverished Fellows&quot;. The Church of St Peter without Trumpington Gate was to be used by the scholars. Bishop Hugo de Balsham died in 1286, bequeathing 300 marks that were used to buy further land to the south of St Peter&#x27;s Church, on which the college&#x27;s Hall was built.

The earliest surviving set of statutes for the college was given to it by the then Bishop of Ely, Simon Montacute, in 1344. Although based on those of Merton College, these statutes clearly display the lack of resources then available to the college. They were used in 1345 to defeat an attempt by Edward III to appoint a candidate of his own as scholar. In 1354–55, William Moschett set up a trust that resulted in nearly of land at Fen Ditton being transferred to the College by 1391–92. The College&#x27;s relative poverty was relieved in 1401 when it acquired the advowson and rectory of Hinton through the efforts of Bishop John Fordham and John Newton. During the reign of Elizabeth I, the college also acquired the area formerly known as Volney&#x27;s Croft, which today is the area of St Peter&#x27;s Terrace, the William Stone Building and the Scholars&#x27; Garden.

===16th century onwards===
In 1553, Andrew Perne was appointed Master. His religious views were pragmatic enough to be favoured by both Mary I, who gave him the Deanery of Ely, and Elizabeth I. A contemporary joke was that the letters on the weathervane of St Peter&#x27;s Church could represent &quot;Andrew Perne, Papist&quot; or &quot;Andrew Perne, Protestant&quot; according to which way the wind was blowing. Having previously been close to the reformist Regius Chair of Divinity, Martin Bucer, later as vice-chancellor of the university Perne would have Bucer&#x27;s bones exhumed and burnt in Market Square. John Foxe in his &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot; singled this out as &quot;shameful railing&quot;. There is a hole burnt in the middle of the relevant page in Perne&#x27;s own copy of Foxe. Perne died in 1589, leaving a legacy to the college that funded a number of fellowships and scholarships, as well bequeathing an extensive collection of books. This collection and rare volumes since added to it is now known as the Perne Library.
Between 1626 and 1634, the Master was Matthew Wren. Wren had previously accompanied Charles I on his journey to Spain to attempt to negotiate the Spanish Match. Wren was a firm supporter of Archbishop William Laud, and under Wren the college became known as a centre of Arminianism. This continued under the Mastership of John Cosin, who succeeded Wren in 1634. Under Cosin significant changes were made to the college&#x27;s Chapel to bring it into line with Laud&#x27;s idea of the &quot;beauty of holiness&quot;. On 13 March 1643, in the early stages of the English Civil War, Cosin was expelled from his position by a Parliamentary ordinance from the Earl of Manchester. The Earl stated that he was deposed &quot;for his opposing the proceedings of Parliament, and other scandalous acts in the University&quot;. On 21 December of the same year, statues and decorations in the Chapel were pulled down by a committee led by the Puritan zealot William Dowsing.

The college was the first in the University to have electric lighting installed, when Lord Kelvin provided it for the Hall and Combination Room to celebrate the College&#x27;s six-hundredth anniversary in 1883–1884. It was the second building in the country to get electric lighting, after the Palace of Westminster.

The college developed a strong reputation for the teaching of history from the time of Harold Temperley, and during World War II its fellowship simultaneously included four professors in the university&#x27;s faculty for that subject – Herbert Butterfield, David Knowles, Michael Postan and Denis Brogan.

===Modern day===
In the 1980s Peterhouse acquired an association with Conservative politics. Maurice Cowling and Roger Scruton were both influential fellows of the College and are sometimes described as key figures in the so-called &quot;Peterhouse right&quot; – an intellectual movement linked to philosophical conservativism. While often associated with Thatcherite politics (notably, the Conservative politicians Michael Portillo and Michael Howard both studied at Peterhouse), the extent to which Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s economic liberalism was admired within the movement was limited. During this period, which coincided with the mastership of Hugh Trevor-Roper, the college endured a period of significant conflict among the fellowship, particularly between Trevor-Roper and Cowling.

Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at his urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as:Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco&#x27;s death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (&quot;a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations&quot;), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination. In a review of Adam Sisman&#x27;s 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the &quot;Economist&quot; wrote that picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was &quot;startling&quot;, stating the college had become under Cowling&#x27;s influence a sort of right-wing &quot;lunatic asylum&quot;, who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper&#x27;s reforms. In 1987 Trevor-Roper retired complaining of &quot;seven wasted years.&quot;

Peterhouse may have been one of the sources of inspiration for Tom Sharpe&#x27;s &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;.

In the 21st century Peterhouse has established a more modern and welcoming reputation.

== Buildings and grounds ==
Peterhouse has its main site situated on Trumpington Street, to the south of Cambridge&#x27;s town centre. The main portion of the college is just to the north of the Fitzwilliam Museum, and its grounds run behind the museum. The buildings date from a wide variety of times, and have been much altered over the years. The college is reputed to have been at least partially destroyed by fire in 1420. The entrance of the college has shifted through its lifetime as well, with the change being principally the result of the demolition of the row of houses that originally lined Trumpington Street on the east side of the college. In 1574, a map shows the entrance being on the south side of a single main court. The modern entrance is to the east, straight onto Trumpington Street.

===First Court===
The area closest to Trumpington Street is referred to as First Court. It is bounded to the north by the Burrough&#x27;s Building (added in the 18th century), to the east by the street, to the south by the Porters&#x27; lodge and to the west by the chapel. Above the Porters&#x27; lodge is the Perne Library, named in honour of Andrew Perne, a former Master, and originally built in 1590 to house the collection that he donated to the college. It was extended towards the road in 1633 and features interior woodwork that was added in 1641–48 by William Ashley, who was also responsible for similar woodwork in the chapel. Electric lighting was added to the library in 1937. The area above the Perne Library was used as the Ward Library (the college&#x27;s general purpose library) from 1952 to 1984, but that has now been moved to its own building in the north-west corner of the college site.

====Burrough&#x27;s Building====
The Burrough&#x27;s Building is situated at the front of the college, parallel to the Chapel. It is named after its architect, Sir James Burrough, the Master of Caius, and was built in 1736. It is one of several Cambridge neo-Palladian buildings designed by Burrough. Others include the remodelling of the Hall and Old Court at Trinity Hall and the chapel at Clare College. The building is occupied by fellows and college offices.
===Old Court===

Old Court lies beyond the Chapel cloisters. To the south of the court is the dining hall, the only College building that survives from the 13th century. Between 1866 and 1870, the hall was restored by the architect George Gilbert Scott, Jr. Under Scott, the timber roof was repaired and two old parlours merged to form a new Combination Room. The stained glass windows were also replaced with Pre-Raphaelite pieces by William Morris, Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones. The fireplace (originally built in 1618) was restored with tiles by Morris, including depictions of St Peter and Hugo de Balsham. The hall was extensively renovated in 2006-7.

The north and west sides of Old Court were added in the 15th century, and classicised in the 18th century. The chapel makes up the fourth, east side to the court. Rooms in Old Court are occupied by a mixture of fellows and undergraduates. The north side of the court also house Peterhouse&#x27;s MCR (Middle Combination Room).

====Chapel====
Viewed from the main entrance to Peterhouse on Trumpington Street, the altar end of the Chapel is the most immediately visible building. The Chapel was built in 1628 when the Master of the time Matthew Wren (Christopher Wren&#x27;s uncle) demolished the college&#x27;s original hostels. Previously the college had employed the adjacent Church of St Mary the Less as its chapel. The Chapel was consecrated on 17 March 1632 by Francis White, Bishop of Ely. The building&#x27;s style reflects the contemporary religious trend towards Arminianism. The Laudian Gothic style of the Chapel mixes Renaissance details but incorporated them into a traditional Gothic building. The Chapel&#x27;s Renaissance architecture contains a Pietà altarpiece and a striking ceiling of golden suns. Its placement in the centre of one side of a court, between open colonnades is unusual, being copied for a single other college (Emmanuel) by Christopher Wren. The original stained glass was destroyed by Parliamentarians in 1643, with only the east window&#x27;s crucifixion scene (based on Rubens&#x27;s &quot;Le Coup de Lance&quot;) surviving. The current side windows are by Max Ainmiller, and were added in 1855. The cloisters on each side of the Chapel date from the 17th century. Their design was classicised in 1709, while an ornamental porch was removed in 1755. The Peterhouse Partbooks, music manuscripts from the early years of the Chapel, survive, and are one of the most important collections of Tudor and Jacobean church music. The Chapel Choir, one of the smallest in Cambridge, has recently attracted wider interest for its regular performances of this material, some of which has not been heard since the 16th century. The Organ in the Chapel was installed in 1765 John Snetzler. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Organ was expanded and renovated by Hill &amp; Son (1893-94) and Noel Mander (1963). In 2023, the Organ underwent a substantial restoration and renovation project by Flentrop and Klais. This restoration uniquely provides two mechanical-action consoles: one &#x27;historic&#x27; console intended to recreate the experience of playing Snetzler&#x27;s original instrument; the other a contemporary console, to allow for the performance of a wider range of repertoire. 

The first person buried in the Chapel was Samuel Horne, a fellow of the college. Horne was probably chaplain.

===Gisborne Court===
Gisborne Court is accessible through an archway leading from the west side of Old Court. It was built in 1825-6. Its cost was met with part of a benefaction of 1817 from the Rev. Francis Gisborne, a former fellow. The court is built in white brick with stone dressings in a simple Gothic revival style from the designs of William McIntosh Brookes. Only three sides to the court were built, with the fourth side being a screen wall. The wall was demolished in 1939, leaving only its footing. Rooms in Gisborne Court are mainly occupied by undergraduates. Many previously housed distinguished alumni, including Lord Kelvin in I staircase.

====Whittle Building====
The Whittle Building, named after Petrean Frank Whittle, opened on the western side of Gisborne Court in early 2015. Designed in neo-gothic style by John Simpson Architects, it contains en-suite undergraduate accommodation, the student bar and common room, a function room and a gym. Its design recalls that of the original screen-wall that once stood in its place. In 2015 the building was shortlisted for the Carbuncle Cup, given annually by the magazine &quot;Building Design&quot; to &quot;the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months&quot;.

===Fen Court===
Beyond Gisborne Court is Fen Court, a 20th-century building partially on stilts. Fen Court was built between 1939 and 1941 from designs by H. C. Hughes and his partner Peter Bicknell. It was amongst the earliest buildings in Cambridge designed in the style of the Modern Movement pioneered by Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus. The carved panel by Anthony Foster over the entrance doorway evokes the mood in Britain as the building was completed. It bears the inscription DE PROFUNDIS CLAMAVI MCMXL — &quot;out of the depths have I cried out 1940&quot;. These are the first words of Psalm 130, one of the Penitential Psalms. Alongside the inscription is a depiction of St Peter being saved from the sea.

An adjacent bath-house, known as the Birdwood Building, used to make up the western side of Gisborne Court. This was also designed by Hughes and Bicknell, and was built between 1932 and 1934. It was demolished in 2013 to make way for the new Whittle Building.

====Ward Library====
The north-west corner of the main site is occupied by former Victorian warehouses containing the Ward Library, as well as a theatre and function room. The building it is housed in was originally the University&#x27;s Museum of Classical Archaeology and was designed by Basil Champneys in 1883. It was adapted to its modern purpose by Robert Potter in 1982 and opened in its current form as a library two years later. In recent years, the final gallery of the old museum building has been converted into a reading room, named the Gunn Gallery, after Chan Gunn.

====Gardens====
While officially being named the Grove, the grounds to the south of Gisborne Court have been known as the Deer Park since deer were brought there in the 19th century. During that period it achieved fame as the smallest deer park in England. After the First World War the deer sickened and passed their illness onto stock that had been imported from the Duke of Portland&#x27;s estate at Welbeck Abbey in an attempt to improve the situation. There are no longer any deer.

The remainder of the college&#x27;s gardens divide into areas known as the Fellows&#x27; Garden, just to the south of Old Court, and the Scholars&#x27; Garden, at the south end of the site, surrounding the William Stone Building.

====William Stone Building====

The William Stone Building stands in the Scholars&#x27; Garden and was funded by a £100,000 bequest from William Stone (1857–1958), a former scholar of the college. Erected in 1963-4, to a design by Sir Leslie Martin and Sir Colin St John Wilson, it is an eight-storey brick tower housing eight fellows and 24 undergraduates. It has been refurbished, converting the rooms to en-suite.

===Trumpington Street===
The college also occupies a number of buildings on Trumpington Street.

====Master&#x27;s Lodge====
The Master&#x27;s Lodge is situated across Trumpington Street from the College, and was bequeathed to the College in 1727 by a fellow, Charles Beaumont, son of the 30th Master of the college, Joseph Beaumont. It is built in red brick in the Queen Anne style.

====The Hostel====
The Hostel is situated next to the Master&#x27;s Lodge. It was built in a neo-Georgian style in 1926 from designs by Thomas Henry Lyon. The Hostel was intended to be part of a larger complex but only one wing was built. It currently houses undergraduates and some fellows. During World War II the London School of Economics was housed in The Hostel and nearby buildings, at the invitation of the Master and Fellows.

====Cosin Court====
Behind the Hostel lies Cosin Court, which provides accommodation for fellows and mature, postgraduate, and married students. The court is named for John Cosin (1594–1672) who was successively Master of Peterhouse, Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University and Prince-Bishop of Durham.

====St Peter&#x27;s Terrace====
This row of Georgian townhouses houses first-year undergraduates, fellows, and some graduate students in basement flats. It is directly in front of the William Stone Building.

== Arms ==
The College has, during its history, used five different coats of arms. The one currently in use has two legitimate blazons. The first form is the original grant by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux King of Arms, in 1575:

: &quot;Or four pallets Gules within a border of the last charged with eight ducal coronets of the first.&quot;

The College did, however, habitually use a version with three pallets, and this was allowed at the Herald&#x27;s Visitation of Cambridgeshire in 1684. The latter version (with three pallets) was officially adopted by the Governing Body in 1935. The construction of the arms is that of the founder, Hugo de Balsham, surrounded by the crowns of the See of Ely.

== Grace ==
Peterhouse and Jesus College are the only two colleges to have two separate halves to their grace, the first being a standard grace, and the second a quotation of 1 John 4:16.

== People associated with Peterhouse ==
Members of Peterhouse — as masters, fellows (including honorary fellows) or students — are known as &quot;Petreans.&quot;

=== Nobel laureates ===
Peterhouse has five Nobel laureates associated with it, either as former students or fellows.

<text>U, or u, is the twenty-first letter and the fifth vowel letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet and the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is &quot;u&quot; (pronounced ), plural &quot;ues&quot;.

==Name==
In English, the name of the letter is the &quot;long U&quot; sound, pronounced . In most other languages, its name matches the letter&#x27;s pronunciation in open syllables.
==History==
U derives from the Semitic waw, as does F, and later, Y, W, and V. Its oldest ancestor goes back to Egyptian hieroglyphs, and is probably from a hieroglyph of a mace or fowl, representing the sound or the sound . This was borrowed to Phoenician, where it represented the sound , and seldom the vowel .

In Greek, two letters were adapted from the Phoenician waw. The letter was adapted, but split in two, with Digamma or wau being adapted to represent , and the second one being Upsilon , which was originally adapted to represent , later fronted, becoming .

In Latin, a stemless variant shape of the upsilon was borrowed in early times as U, taking the form of modern-day Veither directly from the Western Greek alphabet or from the Etruscan alphabet as an intermediaryto represent the same sound, as well as the consonantal , &quot;num&quot;originally spelled &quot;&quot;was pronounced and &quot;via&quot; was pronounced . From the 1st century AD on, depending on Vulgar Latin dialect, consonantal developed into (kept in Spanish), then later to .

During the late Middle Ages, two minuscule forms developed, which were both used for or the vowel . The pointed form was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas &#x27;valour&#x27; and &#x27;excuse&#x27; appeared as in modern printing, &#x27;have&#x27; and &#x27;upon&#x27; were printed &#x27;haue&#x27; and &#x27;vpon&#x27;, respectively. The first recorded use of and as distinct letters is in a Gothic alphabet from 1386, where preceded . Printers eschewed capital in favor of into the 17th century and the distinction between the two letters was not fully accepted by the French Academy until 1762. The rounded variant became the modern-day version of U and its former pointed form became V.

==Use in writing systems==

===English===
In English, the letter has four main pronunciations. There are &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; pronunciations. Short , found originally in closed syllables, most commonly represents (as in &#x27;duck&#x27;), though it retains its old pronunciation after labial consonants in some words (as in &#x27;put&#x27;) and occasionally elsewhere (as in &#x27;sugar&#x27;). Long , found originally in words of French origin (the descendant of Old English long was respelled as ), most commonly represents (as in &#x27;mule&#x27;), reducing to after (as in &#x27;rule&#x27;), (as in &#x27;June&#x27;) and sometimes (or optionally) after (as in &#x27;lute&#x27;), and after additional consonants in American English (a do–dew merger). (After , have assimilated to in some words.)

The letter is used in the digraphs , (various pronunciations, but usually ), and with the value of long in , , and in a few words (as in &#x27;fruit&#x27;). It often has the sound before a vowel in the sequences (as in &#x27;quick&#x27;), (as in &#x27;anguish&#x27;), and (as in &#x27;suave&#x27;), though it is silent in final (as in &#x27;unique&#x27;) and in many words with (as in &#x27;guard&#x27;).

Additionally, the letter is used in text messaging, the Internet, and other written slang to denote &#x27;you&#x27;, by virtue of both being pronounced .

Certain varieties of the English language (i.e. British English, Canadian English, etc.) use the letter U in words such as &quot;colour&quot;, &quot;labour&quot;, &quot;valour&quot;, etc. In American English, the letter is not used, and the words mentioned are spelled as &quot;color&quot; and so on.

It is the thirteenth most frequently used letter in the English language, with a frequency of about 2.8% in words.

===Other languages===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, represents the close back rounded vowel or a similar vowel.
* In French orthography the letter represents the close front rounded vowel ; is represented by .
* In Dutch and Afrikaans, it represents either , or a near-close near-front rounded vowel ; likewise, the phoneme is represented by .
* In Welsh orthography the letter can represent a long close front unrounded vowel or short near-close near-front unrounded vowel in Southern dialects. In Northern dialects, the corresponding long and short vowels are a long close central unrounded vowel and a short lowered close central unrounded vowel , respectively. and are represented by .

===Other systems===

* It is used for &quot;micro-&quot; in metric measurements as a replacement for the Greek letter μ (mu), of which it is a graphic approximation when that Greek letter is not available, as in &quot;codice_1&quot; for μm (micrometer).
* Some universities, such as the University of Miami and the University of Utah, are locally known as &quot;The U&quot;.
* &#x27;U&#x27; (or sometimes RU) is a standard height unit of measure in rack units, with each U equal to .

<text>User Friendly was a webcomic written by J. D. Frazer, also known by his pen name Illiad. Starting in 1997, the strip was one of the earliest webcomics to make its creator a living. The comic is set in a fictional internet service provider and draws humor from dealing with clueless users and geeky subjects. The comic ran seven days a week until 2009, when updates became sporadic, and since 2010 it had been in re-runs only. The webcomic was shut down in late February 2022, after an announcement from Frazer.

== Premise ==
&quot;User Friendly&quot; is set inside a fictional ISP, Columbia Internet. According to reviewer Eric Burns, the strip is set in a world where &quot;[u]sers were dumbasses who asked about cupholders that slid out of their computers, marketing executives were perverse and stupid and deserved humiliation, bosses were clueless and often naively cruel, and I.T. workers were somewhat shortsighted and misguided, but the last bastion of human reason... Every time we see Greg working, it&#x27;s to deal with yet another annoying, self-important clueless user who hasn&#x27;t gotten his brain around the digital world&quot;. Although mostly gag-a-day, the comic often had ongoing running arcs and occasionally continuing character through-lines.

=== Cast ===


==== A.J. Garrett ====
A.J., Illiad&#x27;s alter ego, represents &quot;the creative guy&quot; in the strip, maintaining and designing websites. As a web designer, he&#x27;s uncomfortably crammed in that tiny crevice between the techies and the marketing people. This means he&#x27;s not disliked by anyone, but they all look at him funny from time to time. A.J. is shy and sensitive, loves most computer games and nifty art, and has a big-brother relationship with the Dust Puppy. A.J. is terrified of grues and attempts to avoid them. He was released from the company on two separate occasions but returned shortly thereafter.

In the strip as of September 16, 2005, he and Miranda (another character) are dating. They also have previously dated, but split up over a misunderstanding.

==== The Chief ====
The Chief is Columbia Internet&#x27;s CEO. He is the leader of the techies and salespeople.

Illiad based the character on a former boss, saying, &quot;The Chief is based on my business mentor. He was the vice president that I reported to back in the day. The Chief, like my mentor, is tall (!) and thin and sports a bushy ring around a bald crown, plus a very thick moustache.&quot; The Chief bears a superficial resemblance to the Pointy-Haired Boss of &quot;Dilbert&quot; fame. However, Illiad says that The Chief was not inspired by the &quot;Dilbert&quot; character. His personality is very different from the PHB, as well: he manages in the laissez-faire style, as opposed to the Marketing-based, micro-managing stance of the PHB. He has encouraged the office to standardise on Linux (much to Stef&#x27;s chagrin).

==== Dust Puppy ====
Born in a server from a combination of dust, lint, and quantum events, the Dust Puppy looks similar to a ball of dust and lint, with eyes, feet and an occasional big toothy smile. He was briefly absent from the strip after accidentally being blown with compressed air while sleeping inside a dusty server.

Although the Dust Puppy is very innocent and unworldly, he plays a superb game of Quake. He also created an artificial intelligence named Erwin, with whom he has been known to do occasional song performances (or filks).

Dust Puppy is liked by most of the other characters, with the exceptions of Stef and the Dust Puppy&#x27;s evil nemesis, the Crud Puppy.

First appearance December 3, 1997.

==== Crud Puppy ====
Crud Puppy (Lord Ignatius Crud) is the evil twin, born from the crud in Stef&#x27;s keyboard; he is the nemesis of the Dust Puppy and sometimes takes the role of &quot;bad guy&quot; in the series. Examples include being the attorney/legal advisor of both Microsoft and then AOL or controlling a &quot;Thing&quot; suit in the Antarctic. He is most often seen in later strips in an Armani suit, usually sitting at the local bar with Cthulhu. The Crud Puppy first appeared in the strip on February 24, 1998.

==== Erwin ====
Erwin first appeared in the January 25, 1998 strip. Erwin is a highly advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) created overnight during experimentation in artificial intelligence by the Dust Puppy, who was feeling kind of bored. Erwin is written in COBOL because Dust Puppy &quot;lost a bet&quot;. Erwin passes the Turing test with flying colours, and has a dry sense of humour. He is an expert on any subject that is covered on the World Wide Web, such as Elvis sightings and alien conspiracies. Erwin is rather self-centered, and he is fond of mischievous pranks.

Originally, Erwin occupied the classic &quot;monitor and keyboard&quot; type computer with an x86 computer architecture, but was later given such residences as an iMac, a Palm III, a Coleco Adam on Mir, a Furby, a nuclear weapon guidance system, an SGI O2, a Hewlett-Packard Calculator (with reverse Polish notation, which meant that Erwin talked like Yoda for weeks afterward), a Lego Mindstorms construction, a Tamagotchi, a Segway, an IBM PC 5150, a &quot;Timber Wolf&quot;-class BattleMech, and an Internet-equipped toilet (with Dust Puppy being the toilet brush), as a punishment for insulting Hastur.

==== Greg Flemming ====
Greg is in charge of Technical Support in the strip. In other words, he&#x27;s the guy that customers whine to when something goes wrong, which drives him nuts. He blows off steam by playing visceral games and doing bad things to the salespeople. He&#x27;s not a bad sort, but his grip on his sanity hovers somewhere between weak and non-existent, and he once worked for Microsoft Quality Assurance .

==== Mike Floyd ====
Mike is the System Administrator of the strip and is responsible for the smooth running of the network at the office. He&#x27;s bright but prone to fits of anxiety. His worst nightmare is being locked in a room with a sweaty Windows 95 programmer and no hacking weapons in sight. He loves hot ramen straight out of a styrofoam cup.

==== Miranda Cornielle ====
Miranda is a trained systems technologist, an experienced UNIX sysadmin, and very, very female. Her technical abilities unnerve the other techs, but her obvious physical charms compel them to stare at her, except for Pitr, who is convinced she is evil. Although she has few character flaws, she does express sadistic tendencies, especially towards marketers and lusers. Miranda finds Dust Puppy adorable.

She and A.J. are dating as of September 16, 2005, although she was previously frustrated by his inability to express himself and his love for her. This comes after years of missed opportunities and misunderstandings, such as when A.J. poured his feelings into an email and Miranda mistook it for the ILOVEYOU email worm and deleted it unread.

==== Pitr Dubovich ====
Pitr is the administrator of the Columbia Internet server and a self-proclaimed Linux guru. He suddenly began to speak with a fake Slavic accent as part of his program to &quot;Become an Evil Genius.&quot; He has almost succeeded in taking over the planet several times. His sworn enemy is Sid, who seems to outdo him at every turn. Pitr&#x27;s achievements include: making the world&#x27;s (second) strongest coffee, merging Coca-Cola, Pepsi into Pitr-Cola and making Columbia Internet millions with a nuclear weapon purchased from Russia, and the infamous Vigor text editor. He briefly worked for Google, nearly succeeding in world domination, but was released from there and returned to Columbia Internet. Despite his vast efforts to become the ultimate evil character, his lack of illheartedness prevents him from reaching such achievement.

==== Sid Dabster ====
Sid is the oldest of the geeks and very knowledgeable. His advanced age gives him the upper hand against Pitr, whom he has outdone on several occasions, including in a coffee-brewing competition and in a round of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; that he hacked in his own favor. Unlike Pitr, he has no ambitions for world domination per se, but he is a friend of Hastur and Cthulhu (based on the H. P. Lovecraft Mythos characters). He was hired in September 2000 and he had formerly worked for Hewlett-Packard, with ten years&#x27; experience It is his habit, unlike the other techs, to dress to a somewhat professional degree; when he first came to work, Smiling Man, the head accountant, expressed shock at the fact that Sid was wearing his usual blue business suit. He is also a fan of old technology, having grown up in the age of TECO, PDP-6es, the original VT100, FORTRAN, IBM 3270 and the IBM 5150; one could, except for the decent taste in clothing, categorise him as a Real Programmer. He was once a cannabis smoker, as contrasted with the rest of the technological staff, who prefer caffeine (Greg in the form of cola, Miranda in the form of espresso). This had the unfortunate effect of causing lung cancer and he was treated by an oncologist. He has since recovered from the cancer and was told he has another 20 years or so to live.

==== Pearl Dabster ====
Sid Dabster&#x27;s beautiful daughter. The character appeared for the first time in the strip of Aug. 30, 2001. Pearl is often seen getting the better of the boys. She is the antagonist of Miranda, and occasionally the object of Pitr&#x27;s affections, much to the chagrin of Sid. Some people (both in strip and in the real world) wrongly assume that the character was named after the scripting language PERL. While this may be the true intention of the author, in the script timeline, is shown to be an error based on wordplay.

==== Smiling Man ====
The Smiling Man is the company comptroller. He is in charge of accounts, finances, and expenditures. He smiles all day for no reason. This in itself is enough to terrify most normal human beings (even via phone). However, the Dust Puppy, the &quot;Evilphish&quot;, a delirious Stef, and a consultant in a purple suit have managed to get him to stop smiling first. His favourite wallpaper is a large, complex, and utterly meaningless spreadsheet.

==== Stef Murky ====
Stef is the strip&#x27;s Corporate Sales Manager. He runs most of the marketing efforts within the firm, often selling things before they exist. He is a stereotypical marketer, with an enormous ego and a condescending attitude toward the techies; they detest him and frequently retaliate with pranks. He sucks at &quot;Quake&quot;, even once managing to die at the startup screen in &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;; in addition, he manages to die by falling into lava in any game that contains it, including games where it is normally impossible to step in said lava. Although he admires Microsoft and frequently defends their marketing tactics, infuriating the techies, he has a real problem with Microsoft salesmen, probably because they make much more money than he does. His attitude towards women is decidedly chauvinist; he lusts after Miranda who will not have anything to do with him. Stef is definitely , as demonstrated on January 14, 2005.

== Production ==
In a 2008 article, reviewer Eric Burns said that as best he could tell, Frazer had produced strips seven days a week, without missing an update for, at that time, almost 11 years. Frazer would draw several days&#x27; worth of comics in advance, but the Sunday comic – based on current events and in color – was always drawn for immediate release and did not relate to the regular storyline.

The website for &quot;User Friendly&quot; included other features such as Link of the Day and Iambe Intimate &amp; Interactive, a weekly editorial written under the pseudonym &quot;Iambe&quot;.

In late 1999, &quot;User Friendly&quot; and &quot;Sluggy Freelance&quot; swapped a character (A.J. and Torg).

The strip and Loki Software teamed up for player skin and custom level contest for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; in 2000. A Flash cartoon based on the series was also produced.

=== Author ===
J. D. Frazer was born in 1969. He began his career in law enforcement and served as a corrections officer, hoping eventually to join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but he changed his mind, leaving law enforcement to pursue more creative endeavours. He worked as a game designer, production manager, art director, project manager, Web services manager, writer, creative director, and cartoonist. he lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

=== Creation ===
Frazer started writing &quot;User Friendly&quot; in 1997. According to Frazer, he started cartooning at age 12. He had tried to get into cartooning through syndicates with a strip called &quot;Dust Puppies&quot;, but it was rejected by six syndicates. Later, while working at an ISP, he drew some cartoons which his co-workers enjoyed. He then drew a month&#x27;s worth of cartoons and posted them online. After that, he quit his job and then worked on the comic.

=== Success ===
Writer Xavier Xerxes said that in the very early days of webcomics, Frazer was probably one of the bigger success stories and was one of the first to make a living from a webcomic. Eric Burns attributed initial success of the comic to the makeup of the early internet, saying, &quot;In 1997, a disproportionate number of internet users... were in the I.T. Industry. When &quot;User Friendly&quot; began gathering momentum, there wasn&#x27;t just little to nothing like it on the web -- it appealed and spoke to a much larger percentage of the internet reading audience than mainstream society would support outside of that filter... in the waning years of the 20th Century, it was a safe bet that if someone had an internet connection in the first place, they&#x27;d find &quot;User Friendly&quot; funny.&quot;

On April Fools&#x27; Day 1999, the site appeared to be shut down permanently after a third party sued. In future years, the April 1st cartoon referenced back to the disruption that was caused.

In a 2001 interview, Frazer said that he was not handling fame well, and pretended not to be famous in order to keep his life normal. He said that his income came from sponsorship, advertising, and sales of printed collections. These compilations have been published by O&#x27;Reilly Media.

Since 2000, &quot;User Friendly&quot; had been published in a variety of newspapers, including The National Post in Canada and the Linux Journal magazine.

=== Ideas ===
In a 2001 interview, Frazer estimated that about 40% of strip ideas came from reader submissions, and occasionally he would get submissions that he would use &quot;unmodified&quot;. He also said that he educated himself on the operating system BSD in order to make informed jokes about it.

In 2009, Frazer was found to be copying punchlines found in the MetaFilter community. After one poster found a comment on MetaFilter that was similar to a &quot;User Friendly&quot; comic, users searched and found several other examples. Initially, Frazer posted on MetaFilter saying &quot;I get a flurry of submissions and one-liners every week, and I haven&#x27;t checked many of them at all, because I rarely had to in the past&quot; but later admitted that he had taken quotes directly from the site. On his website, Frazer said, &quot;I offered no attribution or asked for permission [for these punchlines], over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve infringed on the expression of ideas of some (who I think are) clever people. Plagiarized. My hypocrisy seems to know no bounds, as an infamous gunman was once heard saying. I sincerely apologize to my readers and to the original authors. I offer no excuses and accept full blame and responsibility. As a result, I&#x27;ll be modifying the cartoons in question. No, it won&#x27;t happen again. Yes, I&#x27;ve immersed myself in mild acid.&quot;

While published books still contain at least one cartoon with a punchline taken from MetaFilter, Frazer has removed these cartoons from the website, or updated them to quote and credit the source of the punchlines, and fans searched through the archives to ensure that none of the other punchlines have been plagiarized.

=== Suspension ===
The strip went on hiatus from June 1, 2009 to August 2009 for personal reasons. In this period, previous strips were re-posted.

A second hiatus lasted from December 1, 2009 until August 1, 2010, again for personal reasons. New cartoons, supplied by the community as part of a competition, started to appear as of August 2, 2010.

From November 1, 2010 through November 21, 2010, Illiad published a special &quot;Remembrance Day story arc&quot;, and stated that it is &quot;vague and at this point random&quot; what will happen to the strip afterwards, that &quot;going daily again is highly unlikely&quot;, but that &quot;there are still many stories that I want to tell through UF, over time&quot;. Since then, previous comics have been re-posted on a daily basis.

After the de facto stop of publishing new content, three one-off comics commemoration special occasions were published:
* 19/03-2011: The Fukushima nuclear disaster
* 09/10-2011: The death of Steve Jobs
* 01/01-2012: The death of Dennis Ritchie

On 24 February 2022, Illiad announced that the website would be shut down soon, &quot;at the end of this month. If not, it won&#x27;t be much later than that.&quot;

At approximately midnight PST on the evening of 28 February 2022, the website was shut down.

== Reviews ==
&quot;User Friendly&quot; has received mixed reviews over the years.

In a 2008 review, Eric Burns of Websnark called it a &quot;damned good comic strip&quot;, but felt it had several problems. Burns felt that the strip had not evolved in several years, saying &quot;his strip is exactly the same today as it was in 1998... the same characters, the same humor, the same punchlines, the same punching bags as before.&quot; Burns said that characters learn no lessons, and that &quot;[i]f Frazer uses copy and paste to put his characters in, he&#x27;s been using the same clip art for the entire 21st century.&quot; Burns also criticised the stereotypical depiction of idiotic computer users as outdated. But fundamentally, Burns found the strip funny, saying anyone who had worked IT would likely find it funny, and even those who had not will find something in it amusing. Burns felt that some criticism of &quot;User Friendly&quot; came from seeing it as general webcomic, rather than one targeted at a specific audience of old-school IT geeks, and he considered that the targeted approach was a good business model.

Writer T Campbell declared JD Frazer&#x27;s work as &quot;ow[ing] a heavy debt to [Scott] Adams, but his &#x27;nerdcore&#x27; was a purer sort: the jokes were often for nerds ONLY-- NO NON-TECHIES ALLOWD.&quot; He continued &quot;He wasn&#x27;t the first webtoonist to target his audience so precisely, but he was the first to do it on a daily schedule, and that kind of single-minded dedication is something most techies could appreciate. User Friendly set the tone for nerdcore strips to follow.&quot; Time magazine called &quot;User Friendly&quot; &quot;a strip in the wry, verbal vein of Doonesbury...the humor is a combination of pop culture references and inside jokes straight outta the IT department.&quot; The strip was among the most notable of a wave of similar strips, including &quot;Help Desk&quot; by Christopher B. Wright, &quot;General Protection Fault&quot; by Jeffrey T. Darlington, &quot;The PC Weenies&quot; by Krishna Sadasivam, &quot;Geek &amp; Poke&quot; by Oliver Widder, &quot;Working Daze&quot; by John Zakour, and &quot;The Joy of Tech&quot; by Liza Schmalcel and Bruce Evans.

Comic writer and artist Joe Zabel said that User Friendly &quot;may be one of the earliest webcomics manifestation of the use of templates... renderings of the characters that are cut and pasted directly into the comic strip... I think the main significance of User Friendly is that in 1997 it was really, really crude in every respect. Horrible artwork, terrible storyline, zilch characterization, and extremely dull, obvious jokes. And yet it was a smash hit! I think this demonstrates that the public will embrace just about anything if it&#x27;s free and the circumstances are right. And it indicates that new internet users of the time were really hungry, downright starving, for entertainment... his current work [speaking in 2005] is comparatively slick and professional. But I suspect that his early work had enormous influence, because it encouraged thousands of people with few skills and little talent to jump into the webcomics field.&quot; Zabel also credited User Friendly&#x27;s success in part to its &quot;series mascot&quot;, Dust Puppy, saying that &quot;the popular gag-a-day cartoons almost always have some kind of mascot.&quot;

The webcomic Penny Arcade produced a strip in 1999 just to criticise Frazer, saying &quot;people will pass up steak once a week for crap every day.&quot; They also criticized the commercialism of the enterprise. By contrast, CNET included it on 2007 a list of &quot;sidesplitting tech comics&quot;, Mashable included it in a 2009 list of the 20 best webcomics and Polygon listed it as one of the most influential webcomics of all time in 2018. It has also been noted by FromDev, Brainz, RiskOptics, DondeQ2, and Pingdom. CBR.com concluded the comic had aged poorly in a 2023 rundown.

Lawrence I. Charters appreciated the nature of the titles used for the published books. Francis Glassborow cited the specificity of the humour, which also lead Retro Activity to find the strip &quot;difficult to recommend&quot; along with the limited art style. Mike Kaltschnee also mentioned the weakness of the art, but was impressed at Illiad maintaining publication of a strip every day. &quot;Webcomics: The Influence and Continuation of the Comix Revolution&quot; described how the strip represented the counter-cultural aspects of the open-source software movement. Dustin Puryear observed how the strip represents the conflicts between the computer literate and newer less informed users. Christine Moellenberndt wrote about the online community spawned around the comic strip.

In 2007, &quot;User Friendly&quot; was part of an exhibit at The Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art called &quot;Infinite Canvas: The Art of Webcomics&quot;.
