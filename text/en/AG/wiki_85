<text>A vocoder (, a portmanteau of &quot;vo&quot;ice and en&quot;coder&quot;) is a category of speech coding that analyzes and synthesizes the human voice signal for audio data compression, multiplexing, voice encryption or voice transformation.

The vocoder was invented in 1938 by Homer Dudley at Bell Labs as a means of synthesizing human speech. This work was developed into the channel vocoder which was used as a voice codec for telecommunications for speech coding to conserve bandwidth in transmission.

By encrypting the control signals, voice transmission can be secured against interception. Its primary use in this fashion is for secure radio communication. The advantage of this method of encryption is that none of the original signal is sent, only envelopes of the bandpass filters. The receiving unit needs to be set up in the same filter configuration to re-synthesize a version of the original signal spectrum.

The vocoder has also been used extensively as an electronic musical instrument. The decoder portion of the vocoder, called a voder, can be used independently for speech synthesis.

==Theory==
The human voice consists of sounds generated by the periodic opening and closing of the glottis by the vocal cords, which produces an acoustic waveform with many harmonics. This initial sound is then filtered by movements in the nose, mouth and throat (a complicated resonant piping system known as the vocal tract) to produce fluctuations in harmonic content (formants) in a controlled way, creating the wide variety of sounds used in speech. There is another set of sounds, known as the unvoiced and plosive sounds, which are created or modified by a variety of sound generating disruptions of airflow occurring in the vocal tract.

The vocoder analyzes speech by measuring how its spectral energy distribution characteristics fluctuate across time. This analysis results in a set of temporally parallel envelope signals, each representing the individual frequency band amplitudes of the user&#x27;s speech. Put another way, the voice signal is divided into a number of frequency bands (the larger this number, the more accurate the analysis) and the level of signal present at each frequency band, occurring simultaneously, measured by an envelope follower, represents the spectral energy distribution across time. This set of envelope amplitude signals is called the &quot;modulator&quot;. 
To recreate speech, the vocoder reverses the analysis process, variably filtering an initial broadband noise (referred to alternately as the &quot;source&quot; or &quot;carrier&quot;), by passing it through a set of band-pass filters, whose individual envelope amplitude levels are controlled, in real time, by the set of analyzed envelope amplitude signals from the modulator.

The digital encoding process involves a periodic analysis of each of the modulator&#x27;s multiband set of filter envelope amplitudes. This analysis results in a set of digital pulse code modulation stream readings. Then the pulse code modulation stream outputs of each band are transmitted to a decoder. The decoder applies the pulse code modulations as control signals to corresponding amplifiers of the output filter channels.

Information about the fundamental frequency of the initial voice signal (as distinct from its spectral characteristic) is discarded; it was not important to preserve this for the vocoder&#x27;s original use as an encryption aid. It is this dehumanizing aspect of the vocoding process that has made it useful in creating special voice effects in popular music and audio entertainment.

Instead of a point-by-point recreation of the waveform, the vocoder process sends only the parameters of the vocal model over the communication link. Since the parameters change slowly compared to the original speech waveform, the bandwidth required to transmit speech can be reduced. This allows more speech channels to utilize a given communication channel, such as a radio channel or a submarine cable.

Analog vocoders typically analyze an incoming signal by splitting the signal into multiple tuned frequency bands or ranges. To reconstruct the signal, a carrier signal is sent through a series of these tuned band-pass filters. In the example of a typical robot voice the carrier is noise or a sawtooth waveform. There are usually between 8 and 20 bands.

The amplitude of the modulator for each of the individual analysis bands generates a voltage that is used to control amplifiers for each of the corresponding carrier bands. The result is that frequency components of the modulating signal are mapped onto the carrier signal as discrete amplitude changes in each of the frequency bands.

Often there is an unvoiced band or sibilance channel. This is for frequencies that are outside the analysis bands for typical speech but are still important in speech. Examples are words that start with the letters &quot;s&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;ch&quot; or any other sibilant sound. Using this band produces recognizable speech, although somewhat mechanical sounding. Vocoders often include a second system for generating unvoiced sounds, using a noise generator instead of the fundamental frequency. This is mixed with the carrier output to increase clarity.

In the channel vocoder algorithm, among the two components of an analytic signal, considering only the amplitude component and simply ignoring the phase component tends to result in an unclear voice; on methods for rectifying this, see phase vocoder.

==History==

The development of a vocoder was started in 1928 by Bell Labs engineer Homer Dudley, who was granted patents for it on March 21, 1939, and Nov 16, 1937.

To demonstrate the speech synthesis ability of its decoder section, the voder (voice operating demonstrator) was introduced to the public at the AT&amp;T building at the 1939–1940 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The voder consisted of an electronic oscillator a sound source of pitched tone and noise generator for hiss, a 10-band resonator filters with variable-gain amplifiers as a vocal tract, and the manual controllers including a set of pressure-sensitive keys for filter control, and a foot pedal for pitch control of tone. The filters controlled by keys convert the tone and the hiss into vowels, consonants, and inflections. This was a complex machine to operate, but a skilled operator could produce recognizable speech.

Dudley&#x27;s vocoder was used in the SIGSALY system, which was built by Bell Labs engineers in 1943. SIGSALY was used for encrypted voice communications during World War II. The KO-6 voice coder was released in 1949 in limited quantities; it was a close approximation to the SIGSALY at . In 1953, KY-9 THESEUS voice coder used solid-state logic to reduce the weight to from SIGSALY&#x27;s , and in 1961 the HY-2 voice coder, a 16-channel system, weighed and was the last implementation of a channel vocoder in a secure speech system.

Later work in this field has since used digital speech coding. The most widely used speech coding technique is linear predictive coding (LPC). Another speech coding technique, adaptive differential pulse-code modulation (ADPCM), was developed by P. Cummiskey, Nikil S. Jayant and James L. Flanagan at Bell Labs in 1973.

==Applications==
* Terminal equipment for systems based on digital mobile radio (DMR).
* Digital voice scrambling and encryption
* Cochlear implants: noise and tone vocoding is used to simulate the effects of cochlear implants.
* Musical and other artistic effects

==Modern implementations==
Even with the need to record several frequencies, and additional unvoiced sounds, the compression of vocoder systems is impressive. Standard speech-recording systems capture frequencies from about 500 to 3,400 Hz, where most of the frequencies used in speech lie, typically using a sampling rate of 8 kHz (slightly greater than the Nyquist rate). The sampling resolution is typically 8 or more bits per sample resolution, for a data rate in the range of , but a good vocoder can provide a reasonably good simulation of voice with as little as of data.

&quot;Toll quality&quot; voice coders, such as ITU G.729, are used in many telephone networks. G.729 in particular has a final data rate of with superb voice quality. G.723 achieves slightly worse quality at data rates of 5.3 and . Many voice vocoder systems use lower data rates, but below voice quality begins to drop rapidly.

Several vocoder systems are used in NSA encryption systems:
* LPC-10, FIPS Pub 137, , which uses linear predictive coding
* Code-excited linear prediction (CELP), 2400 and , Federal Standard 1016, used in STU-III
* Continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD), , used in wide band encryptors such as the KY-57.
* Mixed-excitation linear prediction (MELP), MIL STD 3005, , used in the Future Narrowband Digital Terminal FNBDT, NSA&#x27;s 21st century secure telephone.
* Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM), former ITU-T G.721, used in STE secure telephone

Modern vocoders that are used in communication equipment and in voice storage devices today are based on the following algorithms:
* Algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP 4.7–24 kbit/s)
* Mixed-excitation linear prediction (MELPe 2400, 1200 and )
* Multi-band excitation (AMBE  – )
* Sinusoidal-Pulsed Representation (SPR  – )
* Robust Advanced Low-complexity Waveform Interpolation (RALCWI 2050, 2400 and )
* Tri-Wave Excited Linear Prediction (TWELP 300–9600 bit/s)
* Noise Robust Vocoder (NRV 300 and )

Vocoders are also currently used in psychophysics, linguistics, computational neuroscience and cochlear implant research.

===Linear prediction-based===
Since the late 1970s, most non-musical vocoders have been implemented using linear prediction, whereby the target signal&#x27;s spectral envelope (formant) is estimated by an all-pole IIR filter. In linear prediction coding, the all-pole filter replaces the bandpass filter bank of its predecessor and is used at the encoder to &quot;whiten&quot; the signal (i.e., flatten the spectrum) and again at the decoder to re-apply the spectral shape of the target speech signal.

One advantage of this type of filtering is that the location of the linear predictor&#x27;s spectral peaks is entirely determined by the target signal, and can be as precise as allowed by the time period to be filtered. This is in contrast with vocoders realized using fixed-width filter banks, where the location of spectral peaks is constrained by the available fixed frequency bands. LP filtering also has disadvantages in that signals with a large number of constituent frequencies may exceed the number of frequencies that can be represented by the linear prediction filter. This restriction is the primary reason that LP coding is almost always used in tandem with other methods in high-compression voice coders.

===Waveform-interpolative===
Waveform-interpolative (WI) vocoder was developed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories around 1995 by W.B. Kleijn, and subsequently, a low- complexity version was developed by AT&amp;T for the DoD secure vocoder competition. Notable enhancements to the WI coder were made at the University of California, Santa Barbara. AT&amp;T holds the core patents related to WI and other institutes hold additional patents.

==Artistic effects==
===Uses in music===
For musical applications, a source of musical sounds is used as the carrier, instead of extracting the fundamental frequency. For instance, one could use the sound of a synthesizer as the input to the filter bank, a technique that became popular in the 1970s.

====History====
Werner Meyer-Eppler, a German scientist with a special interest in electronic voice synthesis, published a thesis in 1948 on electronic music and speech synthesis from the viewpoint of sound synthesis. Later he was instrumental in the founding of the Studio for Electronic Music of WDR in Cologne, in 1951.
One of the first attempts to use a vocoder in creating music was the &quot;Siemens Synthesizer&quot; at the Siemens Studio for Electronic Music, developed between 1956 and 1959.

In 1968, Robert Moog developed one of the first solid-state musical vocoders for the electronic music studio of the University at Buffalo.

In 1968, Bruce Haack built a prototype vocoder, named &quot;Farad&quot; after Michael Faraday. It was first featured on &quot;The Electronic Record For Children&quot; released in 1969 and then on his rock album &quot;The Electric Lucifer&quot; released in 1970.

Vocoder effects have been used by musicians in both electronic music and as a special effect along with more traditional instruments. In 1969, Sly and the Family Stone used it in &quot;Sex Machine&quot;, a song on the album &quot;Stand!&quot;. Other artists who have made vocoders an essential part of their music, overall or during an extended phase. Examples include the German synthpop group Kraftwerk, the Japanese new wave group Polysics, Stevie Wonder (&quot;Send One Your Love&quot;, &quot;A Seed&#x27;s a Star&quot;) and jazz/fusion keyboardist Herbie Hancock during his late 1970s period. In 1982 Neil Young used a Sennheiser Vocoder VSM201 on six of the nine tracks on &quot;Trans&quot;. The chorus and bridge of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;. features a vocoder (&quot;Pretty young thing/You make me sing&quot;), courtesy of session musician Michael Boddicker.

Among the most consistent users of the vocoder in emulating the human voice are Daft Punk, who have used this instrument from their first album &quot;Homework&quot; (1997) to their latest work &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; (2013) and consider the convergence of technological and human voice &quot;the identity of their musical project&quot;. For instance, the lyrics of &quot;Around the World&quot; (1997) are integrally vocoder-processed, &quot;Get Lucky&quot; (2013) features a mix of natural and processed human voices, and &quot;Instant Crush&quot; (2013) features Julian Casablancas singing into a vocoder.

===Voice effects in other arts===
Robot voices became a recurring element in popular music during the 20th century. Apart from vocoders, several other methods of producing variations on this effect include: the Sonovox, Talk box, Auto-Tune, linear prediction vocoders, speech synthesis, ring modulation and comb filter.
Vocoders are used in television production, filmmaking and games, usually for robots or talking computers. The robot voices of the Cylons in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; were created with an EMS Vocoder 2000. The 1980 version of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme, as arranged and recorded by Peter Howell, has a section of the main melody generated by a Roland SVC-350 vocoder. A similar Roland VP-330 vocoder was used to create the voice of Soundwave, a character from the &quot;Transformers&quot; series.

<text>Vlaardingen () is a large town and municipality in South Holland in the Netherlands. It is located on the north bank of the Nieuwe Maas river at the confluence with the Oude Maas. The municipality administers an area of , of which is land, with residents in .

==Geography==
The town is divided into a northern part (locally known as the &quot;Holy&quot;) and a southern part by the A20 motorway. On the east the town is separated from Schiedam by the A4 motorway. Other places nearby are the small town Maassluis to the west, the village Schipluiden and the city Delft to the north, the town Schiedam and city Rotterdam to the east and the town of Spijkenisse in the south-west, on the other side of the river Nieuwe Maas. The A20 connects Rotterdam to the village Hook of Holland. The Beneluxtunnel (the tunnel that runs under the Nieuwe Waterweg) connects the A20 to the A15.

The centre of the town is on the west side of the old harbour, which was originally a stream (&#x27;De Vlaarding&#x27;) from the peat lands north and east of the town, running to the Meuse estuary.

==History==
The area around Vlaardingen was already settled by about 2900 to 2600 BC. In 1990, a skeleton dated around 1300 BC was dug up in the edge of Vlaardingen. Some human nuclear DNA was identified, the oldest found anywhere in the Netherlands. In Roman times a stronghold or vicus named &quot;Flenio&quot; may have been on the site of modern Vlaardingen. Between roughly 250 AD and 700 AD the region seems to have been uninhabited, like much of the west of the Netherlands. In 726 or 727 the area is again mentioned as &quot;In Pagio Marsum&quot;, where a small church was established, around which Vlaardingen formed. The church is mentioned on a list of churches Willibrord, the &quot;Apostle to the Frisians&quot;, inhered to the Abbey of Echternach.

In 1018, Vlaardingen was a stronghold of Dirk III, who levied an illegal toll on ships on the Meuse river. An army sent by German Emperor Henry II to stop this practice was defeated by Dirk III in the (First) Battle of Vlaardingen. In 1047, his successor Dirk IV repelled another such attack (Second Battle of Vlaardingen). The first of these battles was commemorated in 2018 by a historical reenactment

A flood disaster of December 21, 1163 (Saint Thomas Flood), ended the growth of Vlaardingen. The Counts of Holland moved away and its development stagnated.

In 1273, Vlaardingen was granted town privileges by Floris V, Count of Holland. Older town privileges are possible, but not provable.

In 1574, during the Eighty Years War of Dutch independence, a group of Watergeuzen burnt down Vlaardingen as commanded by William of Orange to prevent the Spanish from capturing the town. Vlaardingen later became a shipbuilding area and a significant harbour for the herring fishing industry. The fishing boats (originally &quot;haringbuizen&quot;, later also &quot;sloepen&quot; and &quot;loggers&quot;) ceased to use Vlaardingen in the years after World War II.

In 1855, the former municipality of Zouteveen was merged into the municipality Vlaardingerambacht which in turn was merged with Vlaardingen in 1941 during the German occupation of the Netherlands.

Because of industrialization in and close to Vlaardingen, the town suffered from heavy air pollution and, sometimes, pathogenic smog during the 1970s. One day, a high school had to be closed because of the smog. Many environmental groups arose in and around Vlaardingen as it was seen as one of the most polluted cities of the country.
Vlaardingen consists of eight districts/neighbourhoods:
#Vlaardingen Centrum
#Westwijk
#Vettenoordse polder (includes industry)
#Vlaardingen Oost
#Ambacht/Babberspolder
#Holy Zuid
#Holy Noord
#Broekpolder

==Economy==
A Unilever research centre is located in Vlaardingen (located next to the former Sunlight factory, later called Lever Faberge Sourcing Unit Vlaardingen). There are still some ship repair business(es) in Eastern Vlaardingen beside the Nieuwe Maas River. The was for many years the largest privately owned artificial harbour in the world. The last major herring factory, Warmelo &amp; Van Der Drift, left Vlaardingen in the middle of 2012 to relocate to Katwijk aan Zee. There are still some ferry terminals (DFDS Seaways, sailing to Felixstowe and Immingham and P&amp;O Ferries sailing to Hull).

==Attractions==
===Monuments===

Historical buildings in the town include the &quot;Grote Kerk&quot; (Big Church), the &quot;Waag&quot; (Weighing Bridge) next to the church and the old town hall (used for weddings), all on the &quot;Markt&quot;, the former marketplace, the &quot;Visbank&quot; (Fish Auction) at the harbour and the &quot;Oude Lijnbaan&quot; (Old Ropewalk, where ropes were made). The &quot;Grote Kerk&quot; was probably established between 1156 and 1164 and has been expanded, damaged and rebuilt. To the north of the old harbour is the old Aeolus windmill, which operates and sells ground cereals. The harbour is a marina and open-air museum with old ships. At the harbour is the &quot;&quot; (before: &quot; Visserijmuseum&quot; and the &quot;Visserij en Vlaardings Museum&quot;), a museum dedicated to commercial sea fishing and lore. A war memorial to the crew of a Wellington bomber from No. 142 Squadron RAF killed when it was shot down over Vlaardingen in March 1942 has been erected in &quot;Wijkpark Holy-Noord&quot; in June 2012.

On &quot;Emaus Cemetery&quot; in Vlaardinger Ambacht six members of the resistance group &quot;Geuzen&quot; are buried. They were executed in March 1941. Nine adjacent headstones are symbolic for nine other members of the &quot;Geuzen&quot; who were also executed and buried elsewhere.

===Events===
The &quot;Vlaardings Loggerfestival&quot; (&quot;Logger&quot; is a traditional ship used for herring fishery, the customary English name is &quot;lugger&quot;) is held on the first Saturday of June. The festival used to be called &quot;Haring en Bierfeest&quot; (translation: herring and beer festival), but in 2003 the mayor decided to rename it. In 2015, the name &quot;Haring en Bierfeest&quot; reappeared again.

Since 1987, the &quot;Geuzenpenning&quot; is an award that is yearly bestowed by a local foundation in cooperation with the town&#x27;s municipality to human rights activists from all over the world.

<text>Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto (; ; born Wilfried Fritz Pareto; 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian polymath, whose areas of interest included sociology, civil engineering, economics, political science, and philosophy. He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals&#x27; choices, and was one of the minds behind the Lausanne School of economics. He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term &quot;elite&quot; in social analysis. He has been described as &quot;one of the last Renaissance scholars. Trained in physics and mathematics, he became a polymath whose genius radiated into nearly all other major fields of knowledge.&quot;

He introduced the concept of Pareto efficiency and helped develop the field of microeconomics. He was also the first to claim that income follows a Pareto distribution, which is a power law probability distribution. The Pareto principle was named after him, and it was built on his observations that 80% of the wealth in Italy belonged to about 20% of the population. He also contributed to the fields of mathematics and sociology.

== Biography ==
Pareto was born of an exiled noble Genoese family on 15 July 1848 in Paris, the centre of the popular revolutions of that year. His father, Raffaele Pareto (1812–1882), was an Italian civil engineer and Ligurian marquis who had left Italy much as Giuseppe Mazzini and other Italian nationalists had. His mother, Marie Metenier, was a French woman. Enthusiastic about the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, his parents named him Wilfried Fritz, which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family&#x27;s move back to Italy in 1858.

In his childhood, Pareto lived in a middle-class environment, receiving a high standard of education, attending the newly created &quot;Istituto Tecnico Leardi&quot; where Ferdinando Pio Rosellini was his mathematics professor. In 1869, he earned a doctorate in engineering from what is now the Polytechnic University of Turin, then known as the Technical School for Engineers, with a dissertation entitled &quot;The Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium in Solid Bodies&quot;. His later interest in equilibrium analysis in economics and sociology can be traced back to this dissertation. Pareto was among the contributors to the Rome-based magazine &quot;La Ronda&quot; between 1919 and 1922.

=== From civil engineer to classical liberal economist ===
For some years after graduation, Pareto worked as a civil engineer, first for the state-owned Italian Railway Company and later in private industry. He was manager of the Iron Works of San Giovanni Valdarno and later general manager of Italian Iron Works. He did not begin serious work in economics until his mid-forties. He started his career as a fiery advocate of classical liberalism, besetting the most ardent British liberals with his attacks on any form of government intervention in the free market. In 1886, he became a lecturer on economics and management at the University of Florence. His stay in Florence was marked by political activity, much of it fueled by his own frustrations with government regulators. In 1889, after the death of his parents, Pareto changed his lifestyle, quitting his job and marrying a Russian woman, Alessandrina Bakunina.

=== Economics and sociology ===
In 1893, Pareto succeeded Léon Walras to the chair of Political Economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland where he remained for the rest of his life. He published there in 1896–1897 a textbook containing the Pareto distribution of how wealth is distributed, which he believed was a constant &quot;through any human society, in any age, or country&quot;. In 1906, he made the famous observation that twenty per cent of the population owned eighty per cent of the property in Italy, later generalised by Joseph M. Juran into the Pareto principle, also termed the 80–20 rule. Pareto maintained cordial personal relationships with individual socialists but always thought their economic ideas were severely flawed. He later became suspicious of their motives and denounced socialist leaders as an &quot;aristocracy of brigands&quot; who threatened to despoil the country and criticized the government of the Italian statesman Giovanni Giolitti for not taking a tougher stance against worker strikes. Growing unrest among labour in the Kingdom of Italy led him to the anti-socialist and anti-democratic camp. His attitude towards Italian fascism in his last years is a matter of controversy.

Pareto&#x27;s relationship with scientific sociology in the age of the foundation is grafted in a paradigmatic way at the moment in which he, starting from the political economy, criticizes positivism as a totalizing and metaphysical system devoid of a rigorous logical-experimental method. In this sense we can read the fate of the Paretian production within a history of the social sciences that continues to show its peculiarity and interest for its contributions in the 21st century. The story of Pareto is also part of the multidisciplinary research of a scientific model that privileges sociology as a critique of cumulative models of knowledge as well as a discipline tending to the affirmation of relational models of science.

=== Personal life ===
In 1889, Pareto married Alessandrina Bakunina, a Russian woman. She left him in 1902 for a young servant. Twenty years later in 1923, he married Jeanne Regis, a French woman, just before his death in Geneva, Switzerland, on 19 August 1923.

== Sociology ==
Pareto&#x27;s later years were spent in collecting the material for his best-known work, &quot;Trattato di sociologia generale&quot; (1916) (&quot;The Mind and Society&quot;, published in 1935). His final work was &quot;Compendio di sociologia generale&quot; (1920). In his &quot;Trattato di Sociologia Generale&quot; (1916, rev. French trans. 1917), published in English by Harcourt, Brace, in a four-volume edition edited by Arthur Livingston under the title &quot;The Mind and Society&quot; (1935), Pareto developed the notion of the circulation of elites, the first social cycle theory in sociology. He is famous for saying &quot;history is a graveyard of aristocracies&quot;.

Pareto might have turned to sociology for an understanding of why his mathematical economic theories did not always predict actions of individuals in practice, in the belief that unforeseen or uncontrollable social factors intervened. His sociology holds that much social action is nonlogical and that much personal action is designed to give spurious logicality to non-rational actions. We are driven, he taught, by certain &quot;residues&quot; and by &quot;derivations&quot; from these residues. The more important of these have to do with conservatism and risk-taking, and human history is the story of the alternate dominance of these sentiments in the ruling elite, which comes into power strong in conservatism but gradually changes over to the philosophy of the &quot;foxes&quot; or speculators. A catastrophe results, with a return to conservatism; the &quot;lion&quot; mentality follows. This cycle might be broken by the use of force, says Pareto, but the elite becomes weak and humanitarian and shrinks from violence.

Among those who introduced Pareto&#x27;s sociology to the United States were George C. Homans and Lawrence Joseph Henderson at Harvard, and Paretian ideas gained considerable influence, especially on Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons, who developed a systems approach to society and economics that argues the &quot;status quo&quot; is usually functional. The American historian Bernard DeVoto played an important role in introducing Pareto&#x27;s ideas to these Cambridge intellectuals and other Americans in the 1930s. Wallace Stegner, in his biography of DeVoto, recounts these developments and says this about the often misunderstood distinction between &quot;residues&quot; and &quot;derivations&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Basic to Pareto&#x27;s method is the analysis of society through its non-rational &#x27;residues,&#x27; which are persistent and unquestioned social habits, beliefs, and assumptions, and its &#x27;derivations,&#x27; which are the explanations, justifications, and rationalizations we make of them. One of the commonest errors of social thinkers is to assume rationality and logic in social attitudes and structures; another is to confuse residues and derivations.&quot;

== Fascism and power distribution ==
Renato Cirillo wrote that Pareto had frequently been considered a predecessor of fascism as a result of his support for the movement when it began. Cirillo disagreed with this interpretation, suggesting that Pareto was critical of fascism in his private letters. Pareto argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, the key question was how actively the rulers ruled. For this reason, he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed Benito Mussolini&#x27;s rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the perceived pure economic forces.

As a young student, Mussolini had attended some of Pareto&#x27;s lectures at the University of Lausanne in 1904. It has been argued that Mussolini&#x27;s move away from socialism towards a form of elitism may be attributed to Pareto&#x27;s ideas. Franz Borkenau, a biographer, argued that Mussolini followed Pareto&#x27;s policy ideas during the beginning of his tenure as prime minister. Karl Popper dubbed Pareto the &quot;theoretician of totalitarianism&quot;; according to Cirillo, there is no evidence in Popper&#x27;s published work that he read Pareto in any detail before repeating what was then a common but dubious judgement in anti-fascist circles.

== Economic concepts ==
=== Pareto theory of maximum economics ===
Pareto turned his interest to economic matters, and he became an advocate of free trade, finding himself in conflict with the Italian government. His writings reflected the ideas of Léon Walras that economics is essentially a mathematical and natural science. He tried to sketch economics in analogy to mechanics, explicitly linking pure (and applied) economics to pure (and applied) mechanics, presenting a concordance table relating the two sciences. Pareto was a leader of the &quot;Lausanne School&quot; and represents the second generation of the Neoclassical Revolution. His &quot;tastes-and-obstacles&quot; approach to general equilibrium theory was resurrected during the great &quot;Paretian Revival&quot; of the 1930s and has influenced theoretical economics since. In his &quot;Manual of Political Economy&quot; (1906) the focus is on equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of &quot;objectives and constraints&quot;. He used the indifference curve of Edgeworth (1881) extensively, for the theory of the consumer and, another great novelty, in his theory of the producer. He gave the first presentation of the trade-off box now known as the &quot;Edgeworth-Bowley&quot; box.

Pareto was the first to realize that cardinal utility could be dispensed with, and economic equilibrium thought of in terms of ordinal utility, that is, it was not necessary to know how much a person valued this or that, only that he preferred X of this to Y of that. Utility was a preference-ordering. With this, Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics but he also attacked the alliance of economics and utilitarian philosophy, which calls for the greatest good for the greatest number; Pareto said &quot;good&quot; cannot be measured. He replaced it with the notion of Pareto-optimality, the idea that a system is enjoying maximum economic satisfaction when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. Pareto optimality is widely used in welfare economics and game theory. A standard theorem is that a perfectly competitive market creates distributions of wealth that are Pareto optimal.

=== Concepts ===
Some economic concepts still in use in the 21st century are based on Pareto’s work. The Pareto chart is a special type of histogram, used to view the causes of a problem in order of severity from largest to smallest. It is a statistical tool that graphically demonstrates the Pareto principle or the 80–20 rule. The Pareto principle concerns the distribution of income, while the Pareto distribution is a probability distribution used, among other things, as a mathematical realization of Pareto&#x27;s law, and Ophelimity is a measure of purely economic satisfaction. The Pareto index is a measure of the inequality of income distribution. Pareto argued that in all countries and times the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth. He argued that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern:formula_1 where N is the number of people with wealth higher than x, and A and m are constants. Over the years, Pareto&#x27;s law proved remarkably close to observed data, with economists typically finding it plausible according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. The Pareto efficiency is generally not very discriminating while the concept of potential Pareto-efficiency, also known as Kaldor-Hicks efficiency, is more discriminating and is widely used in economics. A common criticism outside of economics is that it relies on subjective preferences. According to &quot;Oxford Reference&quot;, the Pareto principle can be controversial in welfare economics since its assumptions are empirically questionable, may embody value-judgements, and tend to favour the &quot;status quo&quot;. As a result of its silence on the initial distribution of resources, most sociologists are also critical of Paretian welfare economics.

<text>Voice analysis is the study of speech sounds for purposes other than linguistic content, such as in speech recognition. Such studies include mostly medical analysis of the voice (phoniatrics), but also speaker identification. More controversially, some believe that the truthfulness or emotional state of speakers can be determined using voice stress analysis or layered voice analysis.

==Analysis methods==
Voice problems that require voice analysis most commonly originate from the vocal folds or the laryngeal musculature that controls them, since the folds are subject to collision forces with each vibratory cycle and to drying from the air being forced through the small gap between them, and the laryngeal musculature is intensely active during speech or singing and is subject to tiring. However, dynamic analysis of the vocal folds and their movement is physically difficult. The location of the vocal folds effectively prohibits direct, invasive measurement of movement. Less invasive imaging methods such as x-rays or ultrasounds do not work because the vocal cords are surrounded by cartilage, which distorts image quality. Movements in the vocal cords are rapid, fundamental frequencies are usually between 80 and 300 Hz, thus preventing usage of ordinary video. Stroboscopic, and high-speed videos provide an option, but to see the vocal folds a fiberoptic probe leading to the camera must be positioned in the throat, which makes speaking difficult. In addition, placing objects in the pharynx usually triggers a gag reflex that stops voicing and closes the larynx. In addition, stroboscopic imaging is only useful when the vocal fold vibratory pattern is closely periodic.

The most important indirect methods are currently inverse filtering of either microphone or oral airflow recordings and electroglottography (EGG). In inverse filtering, the speech sound (the radiated acoustic pressure waveform, as obtained from a microphone) or the oral airflow waveform from a circumferentially vented (CV) mask is recorded outside the mouth and then filtered by a mathematical method to remove the effects of the vocal tract. This method estimates the glottal input of voice production by recording output and using a computational model to invert the effects of the vocal tract. The other kind of noninvasive indirect indication of vocal fold motion is the electroglottography, in which electrodes placed on either side of the subject&#x27;s throat at the level of the vocal folds record the changes in the conductivity of the throat according to how large a portion of the vocal folds are touching each other. It thus yields one-dimensional information of the contact area. Neither inverse filtering nor EGG are sufficient to completely describe the complex 3-dimensional pattern of vocal fold movement, but can provide useful indirect evidence of that movement.

Another way to conduct voice analysis is to look at voice characteristics. Some characteristics of voice are phonation, pitch, loudness, and rate. These characteristics can be used to evaluate a person&#x27;s voice and can aid in the voice analysis process. Phonation is typically tested by looking at different types of data collected from a person such as words with long vowels, words with many phonemes, or just typical speech. A person&#x27;s pitch can be evaluated by making the person produce the highest and lowest sounds they can, as well as sounds in between. A keyboard can be used to aid in this process. Loudness is valuable to look at because for certain people, loudness affects the way they produce certain sounds. Some people need to speak louder for certain phonemes in comparison to others just so they can produce them. This can be tested by asking the person to use the same amount of loudness while singing a scale. Rate is also important because it looks at how fast or slow a person speaks.

==Use in medicine==
A medical study of the voice can be, for instance, analysis of the voice of patients who have had a polyp removed from their vocal cords through an operation. Computerized methods can be used to assess such issues in an objective manner. An experienced voice therapist can quite reliably evaluate the voice, but this requires extensive training and is still subjective.

Another active research topic in medical voice analysis is vocal loading evaluation. The vocal cords of a person who speaks for an extended time suffer from tiring—that is, the process of speaking exerts a load on the vocal cords and tires the tissue. Among professional voice users (e.g., teachers, sales people) this tiring can cause voice failures and sick leaves. Voice analysis has been studied as an objective means to evaluate such problems.

Voice analysis was an important factor in the study of vocal cord paralysis. It effects different functions of the vocal cords, from speech to breathing and voice analysis is used to study the effectiveness of Thyroplasty (medialization thyroplasty) improvements on the vocal cords after the surgery. Traditional voice recording is used in pre-operation to record the voices of chosen patients to be compared with the post-operation usage, along with more complex recordings using an electroglottograpy, photoglottography, and videokymography. Medical professionals have the ability to read and understand the results from the complex recordings, but knowledge from a voice professional is needed within these experiments for accurate results. Voice experts were an important to tie the physical examination of the vocal cords to the neurological examination to ensure the success of the surgery because of their trained ear. Perceptual evaluation of voice is heavily reliant on voice quality, a factor assessed preferably by voice specialists (speech therapists). A professional voice analyzer has a trained ear and can block out excess variants that can be deceptive from the results.

==Use in forensics==

Voice analysis is used in a branch of forensic science called audio forensics. These analyses are generally performed on evidence for the purposes of evaluating the authenticity of the audio in question, enhancing features of the audio that may be hidden beneath distracting background noise, interpreting the audio from the perspective of a forensic expert, or in some cases for the purposes of speaker identification.

An expert will employ a variety of techniques in their analysis. The minimum of procedures are &quot;critical listening, waveform analysis, and spectral analysis&quot;. Critical listening involves a thorough breakdown of both foreground and background sounds through repetitive listening. Waveform analysis visualizes the audio for the examiner to see any irregularities that may occur. Spectral analysis visualizes the frequency of the audio for an examiner to pick out features of interest.

One case in which audio played a larger role is the Trayvon Martin case, where a recording of a call made to the police was analyzed to determine if background screams came from George Zimmerman or from Martin.

=== Forensic Voice ===
Experts in forensic voice analyze recordings by examining transmitted and stored speech, enhancing it and decoding it for criminal investigations, court trials, and federal agencies.

To utilize audio recordings in court, a forensic phonetician must authenticate the recording to detect tampering, enhance the audio, and interpret the speech. Their first job is to ensure that the speech in the recording being used is comprehensible. Oftentimes, samples have poor sound quality due to environmental factors such as wind or movement. Other times the sound degradation is due to technological issues within the recording device. Any investigative work on speaker identification cannot be done until the recording is of proper quality. Different solutions for poor comprehensibility are done using computer programs that allow the user to filter and eliminate noise. Computer software is also able to convert the speech to spectra and waveforms, which is useful for the forensic phonetician. However, any work done on the recording should be done after a copy of the original recording is made.

A main part of the forensic phonetician&#x27;s job is speaker identification. The interpretation process might include piecing together a timeline, transcribing the dialog, and identifying unknown or unintelligible sounds in the audio recording. In court, the expert ultimately serves to explain the facts surrounding the audio evidence, providing an explanation of relevant acoustical and physical principles to explain what is evidenced by the recording. Reports are made to include detailed information, if there is a section of the recording that is not comprehensible or is inaudible, an explanation of what was happening (in the recording), and a description of what is missing from the recording.

=== Speaker Identification ===
Voice analysis has a role in speaker identification. This is when the identity of a speaker is unknown, and has to be identify from an array of other voices or suspects when pertaining to a crime investigation or court trial.  Proper identification of speaker and voices particularly for criminal cases depend on a list of factors, like familiarity, exposure, delay, tone of voice, voice disguising, and accents. Familiarity with a speaker increases the chances of properly identifying a voice, and distinguishing it. The amount of exposure to a voice also aids in correctly identifying a voice, even if it is an unfamiliar one. A hearer that listen to a longer utterance or was exposed to a voice more often is better at recognizing a voice, than someone who perhaps was only able to hear one word. A delay between the time of hearing a voice and the time of identifying the speaker also decreases the prospect of identifying the correct speaker. The tone of voice affects the ability to identify the right speaker. If the tone does not match that of the speaker at the time of comparison, it will prove to be more difficult to analyse. Disguise of the voice, for example when a speaker is whispering, will also hinder the ability to accurately match and identify the speaker. In some cases, individuals who speak the same language as the speaker whose voice is being analysed will have an easier time identifying them because of the accent and stress of the voice. Speaker identification is additionally complicated by distortions from the technical method of recording and speaker based issues, such as emotional states or alternative motives causing a discrepancy between their voice and that of a recording. The methods of speaker identification in forensics include the use of earwitnesses who are used to identify voices they have heard, the aural-perceptual approach conducted by a specialist regarding the suprasegmentals of an individual&#x27;s speech, and computer-based approaches.

<text>VSEn (&quot;Virtual Storage Extended&quot;) is an operating system for IBM mainframe computers, the latest one in the DOS/360 lineage, which originated in 1965. It is less common than z/OS and is mostly used on smaller machines.

DOS/VSE was introduced in 1979 as a successor to DOS/VS; in turn, DOS/VSE was succeeded by VSE/SP version 1 in 1983, and VSE/SP version 2 in 1985. In the late 1980s, there was a widespread perception among VSE customers that IBM was planning to discontinue VSE and migrate its customers to MVS instead, although IBM relented and agreed to continue to produce new versions of VSE. In February 2005, IBM announced z/VSE as successor to VSE/ESA 2.7, which was named to reflect the new System z branding for IBM&#x27;s mainframe product line. In June 2021, 21st Century Software Inc announced that it had licensed the z/VSE source code from IBM with the intention of developing new versions of the operating system. As part of this transfer, z/VSE was renamed to VSEn.

==Overview==
DOS/360 originally used 24-bit addressing. As the underlying hardware evolved, VSE/ESA acquired 31-bit addressing capability.

IBM released z/VSE Version 4, which requires 64-bit z/Architecture hardware and can use 64-bit real mode addressing, in 2007. With z/VSE 5.1 (available since 2011) z/VSE introduced 64-bit virtual addressing and memory objects (chunks of virtual storage), that are allocated above 2 GB.

==User interfaces==
===Job Control Language (JCL)===
A Job Control Language (JCL) that continues in the positional-parameter orientation of earlier DOS systems is VSEn&#x27;s batch processing primary user interface. There is also another, special interface for system console operators.

===Beyond batch===
VSEn, like z/OS systems, had traditionally provided 3270 terminal user interfaces. However, most VSEn installations have at least begun to add Web browser access to VSEn applications. VSEn&#x27;s TCP/IP is a separately priced option for historic reasons, and is available in two different versions from two vendors. Both vendors provide a full function TCP/IP stack with applications, such as telnet and FTP. One TCP/IP stack provides IPv4 communication only, the other IPv4 and IPv6 communication. In addition to the commercially available TCP/IP stacks for VSEn, IBM also provides the Linux Fastpath method which uses IUCV socket or Hipersockets connections to communicate with a Linux guest, also running on the mainframe.

Using this method the VSEn system is able to fully exploit the native Linux TCP/IP stack.

IBM recommends that z/VSE customers run Linux on IBM Z alongside, on the same physical system, to provide another 64-bit application environment that can access and extend z/VSE applications and data via Hipersockets using a wide variety of middleware. CICS, one of the most popular enterprise transaction processing systems, is extremely popular among VSEn users and now implements recent innovations such as Web services. Db2 is also available and popular.

==Device support==
VSEn can use ECKD, FBA and SCSI devices. Fibre Channel access to SCSI storage devices was initially available on z/VSE 3.1 on a limited basis (including on IBM&#x27;s Enterprise Storage Server (ESS), IBM System Storage DS8000, DS6000 series), but the limitations disappeared with 4.2 (thus including IBM Storwize V7000, V5000, V3700 and V9000).

<doc id="32683" wikidata="Q386850" url="?curid=32683" title="Villanelle">
<text>A villanelle, also known as villanesque, is a nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third lines of the first tercet repeated alternately at the end of each subsequent stanza until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral.

The form started as a simple ballad-like song with no fixed form; this fixed quality would only come much later, from the poem &quot;Villanelle (J&#x27;ay perdu ma Tourterelle)&quot; (1606) by Jean Passerat. From this point, its evolution into the &quot;fixed form&quot; used in the present day is debated. Despite its French origins, the majority of villanelles have been written in English, a trend which began in the late nineteenth century. The villanelle has been noted as a form that frequently treats the subject of obsessions, and one which appeals to outsiders; its defining feature of repetition prevents it from having a conventional tone.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;villanelle&quot; derives from the Italian &quot;villanella&quot;, referring to a rustic song or dance, and which comes from &quot;villano&quot;, meaning peasant or villein. &quot;Villano&quot; derives from the Medieval Latin , meaning a &quot;farmhand&quot;. The etymology of the word relates to the fact that the form&#x27;s initial distinguishing feature was the pastoral subject.

== History ==
The villanelle originated as a simple ballad-like song—in imitation of peasant songs of an oral tradition—with no fixed poetic form. These poems were often of a rustic or pastoral subject matter and contained refrains. Prior to the nineteenth century, the term would have simply meant &quot;country song&quot;, with no particular form implied—a meaning it retains in the vocabulary of early music. According to Julie Kane, the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a &quot;choral dance song&quot; wherein a vocal soloist—frequently female—semi-improvised the &quot;unique&quot; lyrics of each stanza, while a ring of dancers—all female, or male and female mixed—chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as they danced around her in a circle.&quot;

The fixed-form villanelle, containing the nineteen-line dual-refrain, derives from Jean Passerat&#x27;s poem &quot;Villanelle (J&#x27;ay perdu ma Tourterelle)&quot;, published in 1606. The &quot;New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics&quot; (1993) suggests that this became the standard &quot;villanelle&quot; when prosodists such as César-Pierre Richelet based their definitions of the form on that poem. This conclusion is refuted by Kane, however, who argues that it was instead Pierre-Charles Berthelin&#x27;s additions to Richelet&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire de rimes&quot; that first fixed the form, followed a century later by the poet Théodore de Banville; his creation of a parody to Passerat&#x27;s &quot;J&#x27;ay perdu ...&quot; would lead Wilhelm Ténint and others to think that the villanelle was an antique form.

Despite its classification and origin as a French poetic form, by far the majority of villanelles have been written in English. Subsequent to the publication of Théodore de Banville&#x27;s treatise on prosody &quot;Petit traité de poésie française&quot; (1872), the form became popularised in England through Edmund Gosse and Austin Dobson. Gosse, Dobson, Oscar Wilde, Andrew Lang, and John Payne were among the first English practitioners—theirs and other works were published in Gleeson White&#x27;s &quot;Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles, &amp;c. Selected&quot; (1887), which contained 32 English-language villanelles composed by 19 poets.

Most modernists disdained the villanelle, which became associated with the overwrought formal aestheticism of the 1890s, i.e., the decadent movement in England. In his 1914 novel &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, James Joyce includes a villanelle written by his protagonist Stephen Dedalus. William Empson revived the villanelle more seriously in the 1930s, and his contemporaries and friends W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas also picked up the form. Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot; is perhaps the most renowned villanelle of all. Theodore Roethke and Sylvia Plath wrote villanelles in the 1950s and 1960s, and Elizabeth Bishop wrote a particularly famous and influential villanelle, &quot;One Art,&quot; in 1976. The villanelle reached an unprecedented level of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of the New Formalism. Since then, many contemporary poets have written villanelles, and they have often varied the form in innovative ways; in their anthology of villanelles (&quot;Villanelles&quot;), Annie Finch and Marie-Elizabeth Mali devote a section entitled &quot;Variations on the Villanelle&quot; to such innovations.

== Form ==
The villanelle consists of five stanzas of three lines (tercets) followed by a single stanza of four lines (a quatrain) for a total of nineteen lines. It is structured by two repeating rhymes and two refrains: the first line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the second and fourth stanzas, and the third line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the third and fifth stanzas. The rhyme-and-refrain pattern of the villanelle is:


Here, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; lines rhyme, and A1 and A2 indicate two different refrains which are repeated exactly. It can be schematized as .

The villanelle has no established meter, although most 19th-century villanelles used trimeter or tetrameter and most 20th-century villanelles used pentameter. Slight alteration of the refrain line is permissible.

== Effect ==
With reference to the form&#x27;s repetition of lines, Philip K. Jason suggests that the &quot;villanelle is often used, and properly used, to deal with one or another degree of obsession&quot; citing Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;Mad Girl&#x27;s Love Song&quot; amongst other examples. He notes the possibility for the form to evoke, through the relationship between the repeated lines, a feeling of dislocation and a &quot;paradigm for schizophrenia&quot;. This repetition of lines has been considered to prevent villanelles from possessing a &quot;conventional tone&quot; and that instead they are closer in form to a song or lyric poetry. Stephen Fry opines that the villanelle &quot;is a form that seems to appeal to outsiders, or those who might have cause to consider themselves as such&quot;, having a &quot;playful artifice&quot; which suits &quot;rueful, ironic reiteration of pain or fatalism&quot;. (In spite of this, the villanelle has also often been used for light verse, as for instance Louis Untermeyer&#x27;s &quot;Lugubrious Villanelle of Platitudes&quot;.)

On the relationship between form and content, Anne Ridler notes in an introduction to her own poem &quot;Villanelle for the Middle of the Way&quot; a point made by T. S. Eliot, that &quot;to use very strict form is a help, because you concentrate on the technical difficulties of mastering the form, and allow the content of the poem a more unconscious and freer release&quot;. In an introduction to his own take on the form, entitled &quot;Missing Dates&quot;, William Empson suggests that while the villanelle is a &quot;very rigid form&quot;, nonetheless W. H. Auden—in his long poem &quot;The Sea and the Mirror&quot;—had &quot;made it sound absolutely natural like the innocent girl talking&quot;.

== Poem ==

&lt;poem&gt;Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Børge Rosenbaum (; 3 January 1909 – 23 December 2000), known professionally as Victor Borge ( ), was a Danish and American actor, comedian, and pianist who achieved great popularity in radio and television in both North America and Europe. His blend of music and comedy earned him the nicknames &quot;The Clown Prince of Denmark,&quot; &quot;The Unmelancholy Dane,&quot; and &quot;The Great Dane.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Victor Borge was born Børge Rosenbaum on 3 January 1909 in Copenhagen, Denmark, into an Ashkenazi Jewish family. His parents, Bernhard and Frederikke (née Lichtinger) Rosenbaum, were both musicians: his father a violist in the Royal Danish Orchestra, and his mother a pianist. Borge began piano lessons at the age of two, and it was soon apparent that he was a prodigy. He gave his first piano recital when he was eight years old, and in 1918 was awarded a full scholarship at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, studying under Olivo Krause. Later on, he was taught by Victor Schiøler, Liszt&#x27;s student Frederic Lamond, and Busoni&#x27;s pupil Egon Petri.

Borge played his first major concert in 1926 at the Danish Odd Fellow Palæet (&quot;The Odd Fellow&#x27;s Lodge building&quot;) concert hall. After a few years as a classical concert pianist, he started his now-famous stand-up act with the signature blend of piano music and jokes. He married the American Elsie Chilton in 1933, the same year he debuted with his revue acts. Borge started touring extensively in Europe, where he began telling anti-Nazi jokes.

When the German armed forces occupied Denmark on 9 April 1940, during World War II, Borge was playing a concert in neutral Sweden and decided to go to Finland. He traveled to America on the United States Army transport , the last neutral ship to make it out of Petsamo, Finland, and arrived 28 August 1940, with only $20 (about $ today), with $3 going to the customs fee. Disguised as a sailor, Borge returned to Denmark once during the occupation to visit his dying mother.

===Move to America===
Even though Borge did not speak a word of English upon arrival, he quickly managed to adapt his jokes to the American audience, learning English by watching movies. He took the name of Victor Borge and, in 1941, he started on Rudy Vallee&#x27;s radio show. He was hired soon after by Bing Crosby for his &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; programme.

Borge quickly rose to fame, winning Best New Radio Performer of the Year in 1942 and earning favorable reviews for his performances at New York City&#x27;s Roxy Theater and Capitol Theatre in 1943. Soon after the award, he was offered film roles with stars such as Frank Sinatra (in &quot;Higher and Higher&quot;). While hosting &quot;The Victor Borge Show&quot; on NBC beginning in 1946, he developed many of his trademarks, including repeatedly announcing his intent to play a piece but getting &quot;distracted&quot; by something or other, making comments about the audience, or discussing the usefulness of Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Minute Waltz&quot; as an egg timer. He would also start out with some well-known classical piece like Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and suddenly move into a pop or jazz tune, such as Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot; or &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;.

===Style===
One of Borge&#x27;s other famous routines was &quot;Phonetic Punctuation,&quot; in which he read a passage from a book and added exaggerated sound effects to stand for most of the main punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, and exclamation marks. Another is his &quot;Inflationary Language&quot;, in which he added one to every number or homophone of a number in the words he spoke. For example: &quot;once upon a time&quot; becomes &quot;twice upon a time&quot;, &quot;wonderful&quot; becomes &quot;twoderful&quot;, &quot;forehead&quot; becomes &quot;fivehead&quot;, &quot;anyone for tennis&quot; becomes &quot;anytwo five elevennis&quot;, &quot;I ate a tenderloin with my fork, and so on and so forth&quot; becomes &quot;I nined an elevenderloin with my fivek, and so on and so fifth&quot;.
Borge used physical and visual elements in his live and televised performances. He would play a strange-sounding piano tune from sheet music, looking increasingly confused; turning the sheet upside down or sideways, he would then play the actual tune, flashing a joyful smile of accomplishment to the audience (he had, at first, been literally playing the tune upside down or sideways). 

When his energetic playing of another song would cause him to fall off the piano bench, he would open the seat lid, take out the two ends of an automotive seat belt, and buckle himself onto the bench, &quot;for safety&quot;. Conducting an orchestra, he might stop and order a violinist who had played a sour note to get off the stage, then resume the performance and have the other members of the section move up to fill the empty seat while they were still playing: from off stage would come the sound of a gunshot.

His musical sidekick in the 1960s, Leonid Hambro, was also a well-known concert pianist. In 1968, classical pianist Şahan Arzruni joined him as his straight man, performing together on one piano a version of Liszt&#x27;s Second Hungarian Rhapsody, considered a musical-comedic classic. Borge performed a version of the routine with Rowlf the Dog on Season 4 of The Muppet Show.

He also enjoyed interacting with the audience. Seeing an interested person in the front row, he would ask them, &quot;Do you like good music?&quot; or &quot;Do you care for piano music?&quot; After an affirmative answer, Borge would take a piece of sheet music from his piano and say, &quot;Here is some&quot;, and hand it over. After the audience&#x27;s laughter died down, he would say, &quot;That&#x27;ll be $1.95&quot; (or whatever the current price might be). He would then ask whether the audience member could read music; if the member said yes, he would ask a higher price. If he got no response from the audience after a joke, he would often add &quot;… when this ovation has died down, of course.&quot; The delayed punchline to handing the person the sheet music would come when he would reach the end of a number and begin playing the penultimate notes over and over, with a puzzled look. He would then go back to the person in the audience, retrieve the sheet music, tear off a piece of it, stick it on the piano, and play the last couple of notes from it.

Making fun of modern theater, he would sometimes begin a performance by asking if there were any children in the audience. There always were, of course. He would sternly order them out, then say, &quot;We do have some children in here; that means I can&#x27;t do the second half in the nude. I&#x27;ll wear the tie (pause). The long one (pause). The very long one, yes.&quot;

In his stage shows in later years, he would include a segment with opera singer Marylyn Mulvey. She would try to sing an aria, and he would react and interrupt, with such antics as falling off the bench in &quot;surprise&quot; when she hit a high note. He would also remind her repeatedly not to rest her hand on the piano, telling her that if she got used to it, &quot;and one day a piano was not there – &quot;Fffftttt!&quot;&quot; After the routine, the spotlight would rest on Mulvey, and she would sing a serious number with Borge accompanying in the background.

===Later career===

Borge appeared on &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; hosted by Ed Sullivan several times during 1948. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States the same year. He started the &quot;Comedy in Music &quot; show at John Golden Theatre in New York City on 2 October 1953. &quot;Comedy in Music&quot; became the longest running one-man show in the history of theater with 849 performances when it closed on 21 January 1956, a feat which placed it in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

Continuing his success with tours and shows, Borge played with and conducted orchestras including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and London Philharmonic. He appeared with the Cleveland Opera Company in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; in 1979 and at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House Covent Garden in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1986. Always modest, he felt honored when he was invited to conduct the Royal Danish Orchestra at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1992. 

His later television appearances included his &quot;Phonetic Punctuation&quot; routine on &quot;The Electric Company&quot; in a filmed sketch. He would also use this sketch on &quot;The Electric Company&quot;&#x27;s subsequent LP record, during its &quot;Punctuation&quot; song. In addition, he appeared several times on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and he was a guest star during the fourth season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

Victor Borge continued to tour until his last days, performing up to 60 times per year when he was 90 years old. His microphone of choice since circa 1982 was the Shure SM59.

===Other endeavors===
Borge made several appearances on the TV show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, both as a celebrity panelist and as a contestant with the occupation &quot;poultry farmer&quot;. (The latter was not a comedy routine: as a business venture, Borge raised and popularized Rock Cornish game hens, starting in the 1950s.)

Borge helped start several trust funds, including the Thanks to Scandinavia Fund, which was started in dedication to those who helped the Jews escape the German persecution during the war.

Aside from his musical work, Borge wrote three books: &quot;My Favorite Intermissions&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Comedies in Music&quot; (both with Robert Sherman), and the autobiography &quot;Smilet er den korteste afstand&quot; (&quot;The Smile is the Shortest Distance&quot;) with Niels-Jørgen Kaiser.

In 1979 Borge founded the American Piano Awards (then called the Beethoven Foundation) with Julius Bloom and Anthony P. Habig. American Piano Awards now produces two major biennial piano competitions: the Classical Fellowship Awards and the Jazz Fellowship Awards.

==Family==

He married his first wife, Elsie Chilton, in 1933. After divorcing Elsie, he married Sarabel Sanna Scraper in 1953, and they stayed married until her death at the age of 83 in September 2000.

Borge had five children (who occasionally performed with him): Ronald Borge and Janet Crowle (adopted) with Elsie Chilton, and Sanna Feirstein, Victor Bernhard (Vebe) Jr., and Frederikke (Rikke) Borge with Sarabel.

==Death==

On 23 December 2000, Borge died in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 91, after 75 years of entertaining. He died peacefully in his sleep a day after returning from a concert in Denmark. &quot;It was just his time to go,&quot; Frederikke Borge said. &quot;He&#x27;s been missing my mother terribly.&quot; (His wife had died only three months earlier.) Barely a week earlier he had recorded what would be his final televised interview with Danish television, later aired on New Year&#x27;s Eve. In a poetic coincidence, when asked where he would be spending his Christmas and New Year&#x27;s, Borge responded &quot;somewhere completely different&quot;.

In accordance with Borge&#x27;s wishes, his connection to both the United States and Denmark was marked by having part of his ashes interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, with a replica of the iconic Danish statue &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; sitting on a large rock at the grave site, and the other part in Western Jewish Cemetery (&quot;Mosaisk Vestre Begravelsesplads&quot;), in Copenhagen.

==Awards and honors==
Borge received an honorary degree from Trinity College Connecticut in 1997. Over the years, he was also awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from Butler University in 1970, Dana College in 1976 and the University of Connecticut in 1983. In addition, he was awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Luther College in 1985.

When the Royal Danish Orchestra celebrated its 550th anniversary in 1998, Borge was appointed an honorary member — at that time one of only ten in the orchestra&#x27;s history.

Victor Borge received numerous awards and honors during the course of his career. Borge received Kennedy Center Honors in 1999. He was decorated with badges of chivalric orders by the five Nordic countries, receiving the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark), Order of Vasa (Sweden), in 1973 the Knight First Class of the Order of St. Olav (Norway), Order of the White Rose of Finland, and the Order of the Falcon (Iceland). In 1986, he was a recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of his contributions to the improvement of American society.

==Legacy==
Victor Borge Hall, located in Scandinavia House in New York City, was named in Borge&#x27;s honor in 2000, as was Victor Borges Plads (&quot;Victor Borge Square&quot;) in Copenhagen in 2002. In 2009, a statue celebrating Borge&#x27;s centennial was erected on the square.

Asteroid (5634) Victorborge is named in his honor.

From 23 January to 9 May 2009, the life of Borge was celebrated by The American-Scandinavian Foundation with &quot;Victor Borge: A Centennial Celebration.&quot;

===Film and television===
On 14 March 2009, a television special about his life, &quot;100 Years of Music and Laughter&quot;, aired on PBS.

On 7 February 2017, it was reported that, according to a press release by the Danish production company M&amp;M Productions, both a television series and cinematic film about the life of Borge were foreseen to be filmed in 2018.

<doc id="32688" wikidata="Q1571008" url="?curid=32688" title="Vulvodynia">
<text>Vulvodynia is a chronic pain condition that affects the vulvar area and occurs without an identifiable cause. Symptoms typically include a feeling of burning or irritation. It has been established by the ISSVD that for the diagnosis to be made symptoms must last at least three months.
The causes of vulvodynia are not fully understood, but there are many sub-types of vulvodynia with different causes, including an excess of nerve fibers, hormonal imbalances, inflammation, and muscular dysfunction. Some factors influencing the disease may include genetics, immunology, and possibly diet. Diagnosis is by ruling out other possible causes. This may or may not include a biopsy of the area.
Treatment may involve a number of different measures; however, as vulvodynia has many sub-types, none is universally effective, and the evidence to support their effectiveness is often poor. Some of these measures include medications, pelvic floor physical therapy, surgery, and counselling. Vulvodynia is estimated to affect up to 10-28% of women.

==Signs and symptoms==
Pain is the most notable symptom of vulvodynia, and can be characterized as a burning, stinging, irritation or sharp pain that occurs in the vulva and entrance to the vagina. It may be constant, intermittent or happen only when the vulva is touched, but vulvodynia usually has a long duration.

Symptoms may occur in one place (&quot;localized&quot;) or the entire vulvar area (&quot;generalized&quot;). It can occur during or after sexual activity, when tampons are inserted, or when prolonged pressure is applied to the vulva, such as during sitting, bike riding, or horseback riding. The pain can be provoked by touch (&quot;provoked&quot;) or constant (&quot;unprovoked&quot;). Some cases of vulvodynia are idiopathic where no specific cause can be determined.

===Vestibulodynia===
Vestibulodynia, formerly known as vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS), or simply vulvar vestibulitis, refers to pain localized to the vestibular region. It tends to be associated with a highly localized &quot;burning&quot; or &quot;cutting&quot; type of pain.

Vestibulodynia is the most common subtype of vulvodynia that affects premenopausal women – the syndrome has been cited as affecting about 10%–15% of women seeking gynecological care.

===Clitorodynia===

The pain of vulvodynia may extend into the clitoris; this is referred to as clitorodynia. Clitorodynia may be sometimes caused by clitoris adhesions, a condition where the hood of the clitoris becomes stuck to the clitoris itself. Symptoms may include pain, hypersenstivity, hyposensitivity, difficulty with arousal, muted or absent orgasm. Clitoral adhesions are common among female patients with lichen sclerosus, but also occur among the general population. The prevalence of clitoral adhesions is unknown. Clitorodynia has been neglected in medical research and under-recognized in clincical practice.

==Causes==
Vulvodynia has many different sub-types and causes. The disease is highly idiopathic. Identifying the cause is important to determine the appropriate treatment.

Pain confined to the vulval vestibule, known as vestibulodynia, has at least three known sub-types: neuroproliferation, hormonally-mediation, and inflammation. Neuroproliferation can be present from birth or acquired later in life. This type of vestibulodynia is known as neuroproliferative vestibulodynia. Hormonally-mediated vestibulodynia can be caused by hormonal medications like oral birth control. Inflammatory vestibulodynia can develop as part of an immune response.

Other possible causes include Sjögren syndrome, the symptoms of which include chronic vaginal dryness. Others include genetic predisposition to inflammation, allergy or other sensitivity (for example: oxalates in the urine), an autoimmune disorder similar to lupus erythematosus or to eczema or to lichen sclerosus, infection (e.g., yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, HPV, HSV), injury, and neuropathy—including an increased number of nerve endings in the vaginal area. Some cases seem to be negative outcomes of genital surgery, such as a labioplasty. Initiation of hormonal contraceptives that contain low- dose estrogen before the age of 16 could predispose women to vulvar vestibulitis syndrome. A significantly lower pain threshold, especially in the posterior vestibulum, has also been associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives in women without vulvar vestibulitis syndrome. Pelvic floor dysfunction may be the underlying cause of some women&#x27;s pain.

Many co-morbidities are commonly associated with vulvodynia, including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, pelvic floor dysfunction, endometriosis, depression and anxiety disorders.

==Diagnosis==
The condition is one of exclusion and other vulvovaginal problems should be ruled out. The diagnosis is based on the typical complaints of the patient, essentially normal physical findings, and the absence of identifiable causes per the differential diagnosis. Cotton swab testing is used to differentiate between generalized and localized pain and delineate the areas of pain and categorize their severity. Patients often will describe the touch of a cotton ball as extremely painful, like the scraping of a knife. A diagram of pain locations may be helpful in assessing the pain over time. The vagina should be examined, and tests, including wet mount, vaginal pH, fungal culture, and Gram stain, should be performed as indicated. Fungal culture may identify resistant strains.

Surveys have estimated that only about half of the women who meet the criteria for vulvodynia will seek medical help. Many will see several doctors before a correct diagnosis is made. Less than 2% of the people who seek help obtain a diagnosis. Many gynecologists are not familiar with this family of conditions. Affected women are also often hesitant to seek treatment for chronic vulvar pain, especially since many women begin experiencing symptoms around the same time they become sexually active. Moreover, the absence of any visible symptoms means that before being successfully diagnosed many patients have been told that the pain is &quot;in their head&quot;. The misattribution of women&#x27;s vulvo-vaginal pain to a psychological origin rather than a medical one is traceable back to the influence of Freudian psychoanalysis.

===Differential diagnosis===
# Infections: urinary tract infection, candidiasis, herpes, HPV, vaginitis
# Dermetological diseases: lichen sclerosus, lichen planus
# Neoplasm: Paget&#x27;s disease, vulvar carcinoma
# Neurologic disorder: neuralgia secondary to herpes virus, spinal nerve injury, pudendal nerve entrapment

In recent years, diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of the various sub-types of and causes of vulvar pain have been developed and refined. The International Society for the Study of Women&#x27;s Sexual Health (ISSWSH) supports this diagnostic algorithm.

==Treatment==
There are a number of possible treatments with none being uniformly effective. Treatments include:

===Medications===
A number of medications have been used to treat vulvodynia. Evidence to support their use, however, is often poor. These include creams and ointments containing lidocaine, estrogen or tricyclic antidepressants. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants in pill form are sometimes tried but have been poorly studied. Injectable medications included steroids and botulinum toxin have been tried with limited success.

===Physical therapy===
Many patients who have vulvodynia also have high-tone pelvic floor, meaning that their pelvic floor muscles are too tight. This may contribute to their pain in the area. Pelvic floor physical therapy may help treat the pelvic floor dysfunction and help the patient gain greater control over their pelvic floor muscles.

===Surgery===
Vestibulectomy is a surgery to remove the vulval vestibule, and it may be recommended for certain patients. It has been suggested as a first-line treatment for neuroproliferative vestibulodynia. It has successful long-term outcomes, but is often only offered after conservative measures have failed.

===Lifestyle===
A number of lifestyle changes are often recommended such as using cotton underwear, not using substances that may irritate the area, and using lubricant during sex. The use of alternative medicine has not been sufficiently studied to make recommendations.

===Counseling===
Gynaecologist-led educational seminars delivered in a group format have a significant positive impact on psychological symptoms and sexual functioning in women who have provoked (caused by a stimulus such as touch or sexual activity) vestibulodynia (pain localized in the vulvar vestibule).

==Epidemiology==
The percentage of women affected is not entirely clear, but estimates range between 10-28%. Many other conditions that are not truly vulvodynia (diagnosis is made by ruling out other causes of vulvar pain) could be confused with it. Vulvar pain is a quite frequent complaint in women&#x27;s health clinics.

==Patient communities==

Given the difficulty of getting diagnosed and treated for vulvodynia, patients have formed communities to help each other access healthcare and to advocate for better recognition of the disease.

Founded in 1994, the National Vulvodynia Association (NVA) is a non-profit that helps connect patients to each other and to medical providers who can help them. They maintain a healthcare provider referral list and have geographically-organized patient support groups. The NVA secured the first funding for vulvodynia research in the 1990s, and it continues to provide seed grants for research on vulvodynia.

Tight Lipped is a second, younger community of vulvodynia patients. Founded in 2019, Tight Lipped started as a story-telling podcast focused on ending the stigma and mystery surrounding vulvovaginal pain. It has evolved into a grassroots, patient-led organization devoted to changing how chronic vulvovaginal pain conditions like vulvodynia are understood by the medical community and by society.

There are several online communities of patients on sites like Facebook and Reddit. Because medical knowledge is so hard to access, patients resort to other patients&#x27; knowledge to get help.

<text>Victor Meldrew is a fictional character in the BBC One sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, created by David Renwick and portrayed by Richard Wilson. The character epitomised the archetypal grumpy old man. Meldrew is a foil for the bothersome aspects of children, cars, animals, power cuts and next-door neighbours.

The character was created specifically for Wilson, with whom Renwick had worked on the series &quot;Hot Metal&quot;, though Wilson initially turned the part down as at 53, he felt he was too young to play the 60-year-old Meldrew. Renwick considered Les Dawson for the part before Wilson changed his mind.

Victor is the only character to appear in every episode of the show.

== Character ==
In the first episode, Meldrew, aged 60, is forced into early retirement from his job as a security guard when the office where he worked installs an automatic security system (which he describes as &quot;being replaced by a box&quot;). The series follows Meldrew as he tries to fill his new-found leisure with odd jobs and unusual idiosyncrasies, or to get a new job. However, he regularly finds himself mistreated, misunderstood or simply the victim of bad luck, and consequently leads to his complaining heartily.

Meldrew is famous for his catchphrase, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it!!&quot; (copied exactly from Trevor Baxter playing Professor Litefoot in the final episode of The Talons of Weng-Chiang). Other frequently used expressions of exasperation are &quot;Unbe-lieeeve-able!&quot;, &quot;What in the name of &quot;bloody hell&quot;?!&quot; and &quot;In the name of sanity!&quot; Victor is something of a hypochondriac, keeping a medical dictionary with him to look up every ailment he believes has befallen him (Margaret describes it as &quot;browsing through to see what he can die of next&quot;).

The series was so successful that in the United Kingdom, &quot;Victor Meldrew&quot; has become a byword for a bitter and complaining elderly man. However, both Renwick and Wilson himself have disagreed that Victor is an example of this stereotype and he is shown to be more of a tragicomedy character, not bitter and grumpy by nature, but driven to it due to his habit of attracting trouble. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name &quot;Victor&quot; is ironic, since he almost always ends up as the loser.

In the final episode, &quot;Things Aren&#x27;t Simple Any More&quot;, Meldrew is killed by a hit-and-run driver. This eliminated any realistic possibility of a seventh series. Passers-by left bouquets of flowers in homage at the filming location, a railway bridge in Shawford, a small village in Hampshire.

==Reception==

Phil Wickham of the University of Exeter observed that &quot;the whole point of the series is that Meldrew is the only sane voice in a mad world&quot;.

Jonathan Bignell in his book &quot;Media Semiotics&quot; observes that the reason people laugh at Victor Meldrew is not simply that his behaviour is excessive, but that it contrasts with how all the other characters in the TV series are behaving.

Meldrew&#x27;s name is associated with aggression or grumpiness; the journal &quot;Age and Ageing&quot; notes that &quot;Viewers of Victor Meldrew (&quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;) would not be surprised that hostility contributes to mortality in grumpy old men.&quot; Similarly, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; uses Richard Wilson&#x27;s Meldrew to refer to people who enjoy &quot;a good moan&quot;, while Jenny Turner in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; can observe that &quot;the timing and rhythm (of Geoff Dyer&#x27;s &quot;Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi&quot;) have the flippancy of stand-up comedy. The voice has Eeyore in it, and Morrissey and Victor Meldrew, and could only be English and from that postwar, post-punk generation&quot;.

The BBC recalls first that &quot;the role of Victor Meldrew transformed Scottish TV-actor Richard Wilson into a household name and award-winning comedy performer.&quot; In addition, &quot;So popular was his character that &#x27;Victor Meldrew&#x27; has endured as a cultural reference for any grumpy old man.&quot; And finally and more loosely, &quot;many viewers identified with his rages at the irritants of modern life: litter, junk mail, traffic, rudeness, streetlamps and car mechanics and to some, Victor Meldrew was a champion of the people, albeit a very grumpy one.&quot;

Meldrew&#x27;s persona is so powerful that Richard Wilson is perceived as &quot;99 per cent Meldrew&quot; by at least one critic, and when taking on a serious role as Malvolio in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, another critic felt that Wilson&#x27;s &quot;performance was overly influenced by his desire to &#x27;shed the Victor Meldrew stereotype&#x27;&quot;.

In the modern series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, after the debut of the Twelfth Doctor, as portrayed by Peter Capaldi, Alison Graham of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; compared Capaldi&#x27;s Doctor to Meldrew, as both were &quot;abrasive, acerbic and [have] no truck with modern life&quot;.

The third series of the Channel 4 comedy &quot;Father Ted&quot; features Wilson playing a fictional version of himself, and the Meldrew character&#x27;s catchphrase is repeated several times during one episode.

<text>Vratislaus (or Wratislaus) I (; – 13 February 921), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 915 until his death in 921.

==Life==
He was a son of Duke Bořivoj I of Bohemia by his wife Ludmila and the younger brother of Duke Spytihněv I. Around 906, he married Drahomíra, a Hevellian princess, to establish close ties with the Polabian Slavs. Vratislaus had at least two sons, Wenceslaus and Boleslaus, both of whom succeeded him as Bohemian dukes. Some historians believe that Střezislava, the wife of the Bohemian nobleman Slavník, founder of the Slavník dynasty, was also the daughter of Vratislaus.

Upon the death of his elder brother Spytihněv in 915, Vratislaus became duke at a time when the Bohemian lands around Prague Castle had already distanced themselves from the political and cultural sphere of Great Moravia and fallen under the influence of East Francia, especially during the rule of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria. The contemporary &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; report that the Bavarian forces had attacked Prince Mojmír II of Moravia in alliance with the Bohemians already in the year 900. On the other hand, Duke Vratislaus offered the Hungarian invaders free passage and supported their campaign against the Saxon duke Henry the Fowler in the year 915.

Vratislaus is credited with the establishment of St. George&#x27;s Basilica at Prague Castle and also with the foundation of the Silesian city of Wrocław (Breslau), whose Latin name &quot;Vratislavia&quot; denotes his initiative. He died in battle against the Hungarians, possibly in 919, although 921 is more often conjectured.

<doc id="32692" wikidata="Q372614" url="?curid=32692" title="Víðarr">
<text>In Norse mythology, Víðarr (Old Norse: , possibly &quot;wide ruler&quot;, sometimes anglicized as Vidar , Vithar, Vidarr, and Vitharr) is a god among the Æsir associated with vengeance. Víðarr is described as the son of Odin and the jötunn Gríðr and is foretold to avenge his father&#x27;s death by killing the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök, a conflict he is described as surviving. Víðarr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and is interpreted as depicted with Fenrir on the Gosforth Cross. A number of theories surround the figure, including theories around potential ritual silence and a Proto-Indo-European basis.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Víðarr is mentioned in the poems &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Vafthrúdnismál&quot;, &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, and &quot;Lokasenna&quot;.

In stanzas 54 and 55 of the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, a völva tells Odin that his son Víðarr will avenge Odin&#x27;s death at Ragnarök by stabbing Fenrir in the heart:
:Then comes Sigfather&#x27;s | mighty son,
:Vithar, to fight | with the foaming wolf;
:In the giant&#x27;s son | does he thrust his sword
:Full to the heart: | his father is avenged.

In stanzas 51 and 53 of &quot;Vafthrúdnismál&quot;, Vafþrúðnir states that Víðarr and his brother Váli will both live in the &quot;temples of the gods&quot; after Surtr&#x27;s fire has ceded and that Víðarr will avenge the death of his father, Odin, by sundering the cold jaws of Fenrir in battle:
In stanza 17 of &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, during Odin&#x27;s visions of various dwelling places of the gods, he describes Víðarr&#x27;s (anglicized as &quot;Vidar&quot;) residence:
:Brushwood grows and high grass
:widely in Vidar&#x27;s land
:and there the son proclaims on his horse&#x27;s back
:that he&#x27;s keen to avenge his father.

According to &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, Loki rebukes the gods at the start of the poem for not properly welcoming him to the feast at Ægir&#x27;s hall. In stanza 10, Odin finally relents to the rules of hospitality, urging Víðarr to stand and pour a drink for the quarrelsome guest. Víðarr follows his orders. Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Víðarr is referenced in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.
Víðarr is referenced in the book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; in chapters 29, 51, and 53. In chapter 29, Víðarr is introduced by the enthroned figure of High as &quot;the silent god&quot; with a thick shoe, that he is nearly as strong as the god Thor, and that the gods rely on him in times of immense difficulties.

In chapter 51, High foretells that, during Ragnarök, the wolf Fenrir will devour Odin, and Víðarr will avenge him by stepping down with one foot on the lower jaw of the monster, grabbing his upper jaw in one hand and tearing his mouth apart, killing him. Víðarr&#x27;s &quot;thick shoe&quot; is described as consisting of all the extra leather pieces that people have cut from their own shoes at the toe and heel, collected by the god throughout all time. Therefore, anyone who is concerned enough to give assistance to the gods should throw these pieces away. According to some mythologists, he owed this peculiar footgear to his mother Grid, who, knowing that he would be called upon to fight against fire on the last day, designed it as a protection against the fiery element, as her iron gauntlet had shielded Thor in his encounter with Geirrod.

In chapter 54, following Ragnarök and the rebirth of the world, it is told that Víðarr along with his brother Váli will have survived both the swelling of the sea and the fiery conflagration unleashed by Surtr, completely unharmed, and shall thereafter dwell on the field Iðavöllr, &quot;where the city of Asgard had previously been&quot;.

According to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Víðarr was one of the twelve presiding male gods seated in their thrones at a banquet for the visiting Ægir. At a point in dialogue between the skaldic god Bragi and Ægir, Snorri himself begins speaking of the myths in euhemeristic terms and states that the historical equivalent of Víðarr was the Trojan hero Aeneas who survived the Trojan War and went on to achieve &quot;great deeds&quot;.

Later in the book, various kennings are given for Víðarr, including again the &quot;silent As&quot;, &quot;possessor of the iron shoe&quot;, &quot;enemy and slayer of Fenrisulf&quot;, &quot;the gods&#x27; avenging As&quot;, &quot;father&#x27;s homestead-inhabiting As&quot;, &quot;son of Odin&quot;, and &quot;brother of the Æsir&quot;. In the tale of the god Thor&#x27;s visit to the hall of the jötunn Geirröd, Gríðr is stated as the mother of &quot;Víðarr the Silent&quot; who assists Thor in his journey. In chapter 33, after returning from Asgard and feasting with the gods, Ægir invites the gods to come to his hall in three months. Fourteen gods make the trip to attend the feast, including Víðarr. In chapter 75, Víðarr&#x27;s name appears twice in a list of Æsir.

==Archaeological record==

The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross, located in Cumbria, England, has been described as depicting a combination of scenes from the Christian Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, one of whose feet is thrust into the beast&#x27;s forked tongue and on its lower jaw, while a hand is placed against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir. The depiction has also been theorized as a metaphor for Jesus&#x27; defeat of Satan.

==Theories==

Theories have been proposed that Víðarr&#x27;s silence may derive from a ritual silence or other abstentions which often accompany acts of vengeance, as for example in &quot;Völuspá&quot; and &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot; when Váli, conceived for the sole purpose of avenging Baldr&#x27;s death, abstains from washing his hands and combing his hair &quot;until he brought Baldr&#x27;s adversary to the funeral pyre&quot;. Parallels have been drawn between chapter 31 of Tacitus&#x27; 1st century CE work &quot;Germania&quot; where Tacitus describes that members of the Chatti, a Germanic tribe, may not shave or groom before having first slain an enemy.

===Dumézil===
Georges Dumézil theorized that Víðarr represents a cosmic figure from an archetype derived from the Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of his foot on the wolf&#x27;s lower jaw and his hand on the wolf&#x27;s upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.

Dumézil thus conceives of Víðarr as a spatial god. Dumézil substantiates his claim with the text of the &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, in which Víðarr, trying to mediate the dispute with Loki, urges the other Aesir to &quot;grant Loki his space&quot; at the feasting table. Dumézil argues that this play on Víðarr&#x27;s spatiality would have been understood by an audience familiar with the god, an interpretation further warranted by his reading of the Lokasenna as being in significant part a book of puns and word plays about the different Aesir.

Dumézil also suggests that Víðarr&#x27;s spatiality is seen in the Vishnu of the Vedic traditions, both etymologically (the &quot;Vi&quot;- root) and mythologically, citing the story of Bali and Vishnu. In this legend, Vishnu (in the form of Vamana) tricks the malevolent king Bali, who has secured dominion over the whole Earth, by making Bali promise to grant Vamana all the land he can cover in three paces. Vamana turns himself into a giant and strides across all of heaven and Earth, taking Bali&#x27;s head and granting him immortality in lieu of taking the last pace.

Dumézil theorizes that these myths of Fenrir vs. Víðarr and Bali vs. Vishnu may have a common origin in an Indo-European god of spatiality, similar but distinct from the hypothetical framing or entry / exit god that spawned Janus and Heimdallr.

<doc id="32693" wikidata="Q36244" url="?curid=32693" title="Vowel">
<text>A vowel is a speech sound pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract, forming the nucleus of a syllable. Vowels are one of the two principal classes of speech sounds, the other being the consonant. Vowels vary in quality, in loudness and also in quantity (length). They are usually voiced and are closely involved in prosodic variation such as tone, intonation and stress.

The word &quot;vowel&quot; comes from the Latin word , meaning &quot;vocal&quot; (i.e. relating to the voice). 
In English, the word &quot;vowel&quot; is commonly used to refer both to vowel sounds and to the written symbols that represent them (, , , , , and sometimes and ).

==Definition==
There are two complementary definitions of vowel, one phonetic and the other phonological.
*In the phonetic definition, a vowel is a sound, such as the English &quot;ah&quot; or &quot;oh&quot; , produced with an open vocal tract; it is median (the air escapes along the middle of the tongue), oral (at least some of the airflow must escape through the mouth), frictionless and continuant. There is no significant build-up of air pressure at any point above the glottis. This contrasts with consonants, such as the English &quot;sh&quot; , which have a constriction or closure at some point along the vocal tract. 
*In the phonological definition, a vowel is defined as syllabic, the sound that forms the peak of a syllable. A phonetically equivalent but non-syllabic sound is a semivowel. In oral languages, phonetic vowels normally form the peak (nucleus) of many or all syllables, whereas consonants form the onset and (in languages that have them) coda. Some languages allow other sounds to form the nucleus of a syllable, such as the syllabic (i.e., vocalic) &quot;l&quot; in the English word &quot;table&quot; (when not considered to have a weak vowel sound: ) or the syllabic &quot;r&quot; in the Serbo-Croatian word &quot;vrt&quot; &quot;garden&quot;.

The phonetic definition of &quot;vowel&quot; (i.e. a sound produced with no constriction in the vocal tract) does not always match the phonological definition (i.e. a sound that forms the peak of a syllable). The approximants and illustrate this: both are without much of a constriction in the vocal tract (so phonetically they seem to be vowel-like), but they occur at the onset of syllables (e.g. in &quot;yet&quot; and &quot;wet&quot;) which suggests that phonologically they are consonants. A similar debate arises over whether a word like &quot;bird&quot; in a rhotic dialect has an r-colored vowel or a syllabic consonant . The American linguist Kenneth Pike (1943) suggested the terms &quot;vocoid&quot; for a phonetic vowel and &quot;vowel&quot; for a phonological vowel, so using this terminology, and are classified as vocoids but not vowels. However, Maddieson and Emmory (1985) demonstrated from a range of languages that semivowels are produced with a narrower constriction of the vocal tract than vowels, and so may be considered consonants on that basis. Nonetheless, the phonetic and phonemic definitions would still conflict for the syllabic /l/ in &quot;table&quot; or the syllabic nasals in &quot;button&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot;.

==Articulation== 
The traditional view of vowel production, reflected for example in the terminology and presentation of the International Phonetic Alphabet, is one of articulatory features that determine a vowel&#x27;s &quot;quality&quot; as distinguishing it from other vowels. Daniel Jones developed the cardinal vowel system to describe vowels in terms of the features of tongue &quot;height&quot; (vertical dimension), tongue &quot;backness&quot; (horizontal dimension) and &quot;roundedness&quot; (lip articulation). These three parameters are indicated in the schematic quadrilateral IPA vowel diagram on the right. There are additional features of vowel quality, such as the velum position (nasality), type of vocal fold vibration (phonation), and tongue root position.

This conception of vowel articulation has been known to be inaccurate since 1928. Peter Ladefoged has said that &quot;early phoneticians... thought they were describing the highest point of the tongue, but they were not. They were actually describing formant frequencies.&quot; (See below.) The IPA &quot;Handbook&quot; concedes that &quot;the vowel quadrilateral must be regarded as an abstraction and not a direct mapping of tongue position.&quot;

Nonetheless, the concept that vowel qualities are determined primarily by tongue position and lip rounding continues to be used in pedagogy, as it provides an intuitive explanation of how vowels are distinguished.

===Height===
Theoretically, vowel height refers to the vertical position of either the tongue or the jaw (depending on the model) relative to either the roof of the mouth or the aperture of the jaw. In practice, however, it refers to the first formant (lowest resonance of the voice), abbreviated F1, which is associated with the height of the tongue. There are two terms commonly applied to refer to two degrees of vowel height: in close vowels, also known as high vowels, such as and , the first formant is consistent with the tongue being positioned close to the palate, high in the mouth, whereas in open vowels, also known as low vowels, such as , F1 is consistent with the jaw being open and the tongue being positioned low in the mouth. Height is defined by the inverse of the F1 value: the higher the frequency of the first formant, the lower (more open) the vowel. In John Esling&#x27;s usage, where fronted vowels are distinguished in height by the position of the jaw rather than the tongue, only the terms &#x27;open&#x27; and &#x27;close&#x27; are used, as &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; refer to the position of the tongue.

The International Phonetic Alphabet has letters for six degrees of vowel height for full vowels (plus the reduced mid vowel ), but it is extremely unusual for a language to distinguish this many degrees without other attributes. The IPA letters distinguish (sorted according to height, with the top-most one being the highest and the bottom-most being the lowest):

* close ( high): i y ɨ ʉ ɯ u
* near-close ( near-high): ɪ ʏ ʊ
* close-mid ( high-mid): e ø ɘ ɵ ɤ o
* mid: (the reduced vowel )
* open-mid ( low-mid): ɛ œ ɜ ɞ ʌ ɔ
* near-open ( near-low): æ (plus the reduced vowel )
* open ( low): a ɶ ɑ ɒ

The letters are defined as close-mid but are commonly used for true mid vowels. If more precision is required, true mid vowels may be written with a lowering or raising diacritic: or .

The Kensiu language, spoken in Malaysia and Thailand, is highly unusual in contrasting true mid vowels with both close-mid and open-mid vowels, without any additional parameters such as length, roundness or ATR. The front vowels, , along with open , make a six-way height distinction; this holds even for the nasal vowels. A few varieties of German have been reported to have five contrastive vowel heights that are independent of length or other parameters. For example, the Bavarian dialect of Amstetten has thirteen long vowels, which have been analyzed as four vowel heights (close, close-mid, mid, open-mid) each among the front unrounded, front rounded, and back rounded vowels, along with an open vowel for a fifth height: . Apart from the aforementioned Kensiu language, no other language is known to contrast more than four degrees of vowel height.

The parameter of vowel height appears to be the primary cross-linguistic feature of vowels in that all spoken languages that have been researched till now use height as a contrastive feature. No other parameter, even backness or rounding (see below), is used in all languages. Some languages have vertical vowel systems in which at least at a phonemic level, only height is used to distinguish vowels.

=== Backness ===

Vowel backness is named for the position of the tongue during the articulation of a vowel relative to the back of the mouth. As with vowel height, however, it is &quot;defined&quot; by a formant of the voice, in this case the second, F2, not by the position of the tongue. In front vowels, such as , the frequency of F2 is relatively high, which generally corresponds to a position of the tongue forward in the mouth, whereas in back vowels, such as , F2 is low, consistent with the tongue being positioned towards the back of the mouth.

The International Phonetic Alphabet defines five degrees of vowel backness (sorted according to backness, with the top-most one being the front-most back and the bottom-most being the back-most):
* front
* near-front
* central
* near-back
* back

To them may be added front-central and back-central, corresponding to the vertical lines separating central from front and back vowel spaces in several IPA diagrams. However, &quot;front-central&quot; and &quot;back-central&quot; may also be used as terms synonymous with &quot;near-front&quot; and &quot;near-back&quot;. No language is known to contrast more than three degrees of backness nor is there a language that contrasts front with near-front vowels nor back with near-back ones.

Although some English dialects have vowels at five degrees of backness, there is no known language that distinguishes five degrees of backness without additional differences in height or rounding.

=== Roundedness ===

Roundedness is named after the rounding of the lips in some vowels. Because lip rounding is easily visible, vowels may be commonly identified as rounded based on the articulation of the lips. Acoustically, rounded vowels are identified chiefly by a decrease in F2, although F1 is also slightly decreased.

In most languages, roundedness is a reinforcing feature of mid to high back vowels rather than a distinctive feature. Usually, the higher a back vowel, the more intense is the rounding. However, in some languages, roundedness is independent from backness, such as French and German (with front rounded vowels), most Uralic languages (Estonian has a rounding contrast for and front vowels), Turkic languages (with a rounding distinction for front vowels and ), and Vietnamese with back unrounded vowels.

Nonetheless, even in those languages there is usually some phonetic correlation between rounding and backness: front rounded vowels tend to be more front-central than front, and back unrounded vowels tend to be more back-central than back. Thus, the placement of unrounded vowels to the left of rounded vowels on the IPA vowel chart is reflective of their position in formant space.

Different kinds of labialization are possible. In mid to high rounded back vowels the lips are generally protruded (&quot;pursed&quot;) outward, a phenomenon known as &quot;endolabial rounding&quot; because the insides of the lips are visible, whereas in mid to high rounded front vowels the lips are generally &quot;compressed&quot; with the margins of the lips pulled in and drawn towards each other, a phenomenon known as &quot;exolabial rounding.&quot; However, not all languages follow that pattern. Japanese , for example, is an exolabial (compressed) back vowel, and sounds quite different from an English endolabial . Swedish and Norwegian are the only two known languages in which the feature is contrastive; they have both exo- and endo-labial close front vowels and close central vowels, respectively. In many phonetic treatments, both are considered types of rounding, but some phoneticians do not believe that these are subsets of a single phenomenon and posit instead three independent features of &quot;rounded&quot; (endolabial), &quot;compressed&quot; (exolabial), and unrounded. The lip position of unrounded vowels may also be classified separately as &quot;spread&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; (neither rounded nor spread). Others distinguish compressed rounded vowels, in which the corners of the mouth are drawn together, from compressed unrounded vowels, in which the lips are compressed but the corners remain apart as in spread vowels.

===Front, raised and retracted===

The conception of the tongue moving in two directions, high–low and front–back, is not supported by articulatory evidence and does not clarify how articulation affects vowel quality. Vowels may instead be characterized by the three directions of movement of the tongue from its neutral position: front (forward), raised (upward and back), and retracted (downward and back). Front vowels ( and, to a lesser extent , etc.), can be secondarily qualified as close or open, as in the traditional conception, but this refers to jaw rather than tongue position. In addition, rather than there being a unitary category of back vowels, the regrouping posits raised vowels, where the body of the tongue approaches the velum (], etc.), and retracted vowels, where the root of the tongue approaches the pharynx (, etc.):
* front
* raised
* retracted

Membership in these categories is scalar, with the mid-central vowels being marginal to any category.

=== Nasalization ===

Nasalization occurs when air escapes through the nose. Vowels are often nasalised under the influence of neighbouring nasal consonants, as in English &quot;hand&quot; . &quot;Nasalised vowels&quot;, however, should not be confused with &quot;nasal vowels&quot;. The latter refers to vowels that are distinct from their oral counterparts, as in French vs. .

In nasal vowels, the velum is lowered, and some air travels through the nasal cavity as well as the mouth. An oral vowel is a vowel in which all air escapes through the mouth. Polish and Portuguese also contrast nasal and oral vowels.

=== Phonation ===

Voicing describes whether the vocal cords are vibrating during the articulation of a vowel. Most languages have only voiced vowels, but several Native American languages, such as Cheyenne and Totonac, have both voiced and devoiced vowels in complementary distribution. Vowels are devoiced in whispered speech. In Japanese and in Quebec French, vowels that are between voiceless consonants are often devoiced. Keres is disputed to have phonemic voiceless vowels but no language is confirmed to have them phonemically.

Modal voice, creaky voice, and breathy voice (murmured vowels) are phonation types that are used contrastively in some languages. Often, they co-occur with tone or stress distinctions; in the Mon language, vowels pronounced in the high tone are also produced with creaky voice. In such cases, it can be unclear whether it is the tone, the voicing type, or the pairing of the two that is being used for phonemic contrast. The combination of phonetic cues (phonation, tone, stress) is known as &quot;register&quot; or &quot;register complex&quot;.

=== Tenseness ===

Tenseness is used to describe the opposition of &quot;tense vowels&quot; vs. &quot;lax vowels&quot;. This opposition has traditionally been thought to be a result of greater muscular tension, though phonetic experiments have repeatedly failed to show this.

Unlike the other features of vowel quality, tenseness is only applicable to the few languages that have this opposition (mainly Germanic languages, e.g. English), whereas the vowels of the other languages (e.g. Spanish) cannot be described with respect to tenseness in any meaningful way.

One may distinguish the English tense vs. lax vowels roughly, with its spelling. Tense vowels usually occur in words with the final silent, as in &quot;mate&quot;. Lax vowels occur in words without the silent , such as &quot;mat&quot;. In American English, lax vowels do not appear in stressed open syllables.

In traditional grammar, &quot;long vowels&quot; vs. &quot;short vowels&quot; are more commonly used, compared to &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;lax&quot;. The two sets of terms are used interchangeably by some because the features are concomitant in some varieties of English. In most Germanic languages, lax vowels can only occur in closed syllables. Therefore, they are also known as &quot;checked vowels&quot;, whereas the tense vowels are called &quot;free vowels&quot; since they can occur in any kind of syllable.

=== Tongue root position ===

Advanced tongue root (ATR) is a feature common across much of Africa, the Pacific Northwest, and scattered other languages such as Modern Mongolian. The contrast between advanced and retracted tongue root resembles the tense-lax contrast acoustically, but they are articulated differently. Those vowels involve noticeable tension in the vocal tract.

=== Secondary narrowings in the vocal tract ===

Pharyngealized vowels occur in some languages like Sedang and the Tungusic languages. Pharyngealisation is similar in articulation to retracted tongue root but is acoustically distinct.

A stronger degree of pharyngealisation occurs in the Northeast Caucasian languages and the Khoisan languages. They might be called epiglottalized since the primary constriction is at the tip of the epiglottis.

The greatest degree of pharyngealisation is found in the strident vowels of the Khoisan languages, where the larynx is raised, and the pharynx constricted, so that either the epiglottis or the arytenoid cartilages vibrate instead of the vocal cords.

The terms &quot;pharyngealized&quot;, &quot;epiglottalized&quot;, &quot;strident&quot;, and &quot;sphincteric&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably.

==== Rhotic vowels ====

Rhotic vowels are the &quot;R-colored vowels&quot; of American English and a few other languages.

=== Reduced vowels ===

Some languages, such as English and Russian, have what are called &#x27;reduced&#x27;, &#x27;weak&#x27; or &#x27;obscure&#x27; vowels in some unstressed positions. These do not correspond one-to-one with the vowel sounds that occur in stressed position (so-called &#x27;full&#x27; vowels), and they tend to be mid-centralized in comparison, as well as having reduced rounding or spreading. The IPA has long provided two letters for obscure vowels, mid and lower , neither of which are defined for rounding. Dialects of English may have up to four phonemic reduced vowels: , , and higher unrounded and rounded . (The non-IPA letters and may be used for the latter to avoid confusion with the clearly defined values of IPA letters like and , which are also seen, since the IPA only provides for two reduced vowels.)

== Acoustics ==


The acoustics of vowels are fairly well understood. The different vowel qualities are realized in acoustic analyses of vowels by the relative values of the formants, acoustic resonances of the vocal tract which show up as dark bands on a spectrogram. The vocal tract acts as a resonant cavity, and the position of the jaw, lips, and tongue affect the parameters of the resonant cavity, resulting in different formant values. The acoustics of vowels can be visualized using spectrograms, which display the acoustic energy at each frequency, and how this changes with time.

The first formant, abbreviated &quot;F1&quot;, corresponds to vowel openness (vowel height). Open vowels have high F1 frequencies, while close vowels have low F1 frequencies, as can be seen in the accompanying spectrogram: The and have similar low first formants, whereas has a higher formant.

The second formant, F2, corresponds to vowel frontness. Back vowels have low F2 frequencies, while front vowels have high F2 frequencies. This is very clear in the spectrogram, where the front vowel has a much higher F2 frequency than the other two vowels. However, in open vowels, the high F1 frequency forces a rise in the F2 frequency as well, so an alternative measure of frontness is the &quot;difference&quot; between the first and second formants. For this reason, some people prefer to plot as F1 vs. F2 – F1. (This dimension is usually called &#x27;backness&#x27; rather than &#x27;frontness&#x27;, but the term &#x27;backness&#x27; can be counterintuitive when discussing formants.)

In the third edition of his textbook, Peter Ladefoged recommended using plots of F1 against F2 – F1 to represent vowel quality. However, in the fourth edition, he changed to adopt a simple plot of F1 against F2, and this simple plot of F1 against F2 was maintained for the fifth (and final) edition of the book. Katrina Hayward compares the two types of plots and concludes that plotting of F1 against F2 – F1 &quot;is not very satisfactory because of its effect on the placing of the central vowels&quot;, so she also recommends use of a simple plot of F1 against F2. In fact, this kind of plot of F1 against F2 has been used by analysts to show the quality of the vowels in a wide range of languages, including RP, the Queen&#x27;s English, American English, Singapore English, Brunei English, North Frisian, Turkish Kabardian, and various indigenous Australian languages.

R-colored vowels are characterized by lowered F3 values.

Rounding is generally realized by a decrease of F2 that tends to reinforce vowel backness. One effect of this is that back vowels are most commonly rounded while front vowels are most commonly unrounded; another is that rounded vowels tend to plot to the right of unrounded vowels in vowel charts. That is, there is a reason for plotting vowel pairs the way they are.

== Prosody and intonation ==

In addition to variation in vowel quality as described above, vowels vary as a result of differences in prosody. The most important prosodic variables are pitch (fundamental frequency), loudness (intensity) and length (duration). However, the features of prosody are usually considered to apply not to the vowel itself, but to the syllable in which the vowel occurs. In other words, the &quot;domain&quot; of prosody is the syllable, not the segment (vowel or consonant). We can list briefly the effect of prosody on the vowel component of a syllable.

* Pitch: in the case of a syllable such as &#x27;cat&#x27;, the only voiced portion of the syllable is the vowel, so the vowel carries the pitch information. This may relate to the syllable in which it occurs, or to a larger stretch of speech to which an intonation contour belongs. In a word such as &#x27;man&#x27;, all the segments in the syllable are sonorant and all will participate in any pitch variation.
* Loudness: this variable has been traditionally associated with linguistic stress, though other factors are usually involved in this. Lehiste (ibid) argues that stress, or loudness, could not be associated with a single segment in a syllable independently of the rest of the syllable (p. 147). This means that vowel loudness is a concomitant of the loudness of the syllable in which it occurs.
* Length: it is important to distinguish two aspects of vowel length. One is the phonological difference in length exhibited by some languages. Japanese, Finnish, Hungarian, Arabic and Latin have a two-way phonemic contrast between short and long vowels. The Mixe language has a three-way contrast among short, half-long, and long vowels. The other type of length variation in vowels is non-distinctive, and is the result of prosodic variation in speech: vowels tend to be lengthened when in a stressed syllable, or when utterance rate is slow.

== Monophthongs, diphthongs, triphthongs ==

A vowel sound whose quality does not change throughout the vowel is called a monophthong. Monophthongs are sometimes called &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;stable&quot; vowels. A vowel sound that glides from one quality to another is called a diphthong, and a vowel sound that glides successively through three qualities is a triphthong.

All languages have monophthongs and many languages have diphthongs, but triphthongs or vowel sounds with even more target qualities are relatively rare cross-linguistically. English has all three types: the vowel sound in &quot;hit&quot; is a monophthong , the vowel sound in &quot;boy&quot; is in most dialects a diphthong , and the vowel sounds of &quot;flower&quot;, , form a triphthong or disyllable, depending on the dialect.

In phonology, diphthongs and triphthongs are distinguished from sequences of monophthongs by whether the vowel sound may be analyzed into distinct phonemes. For example, the vowel sounds in a two-syllable pronunciation of the word &quot;flower&quot; () phonetically form a disyllabic triphthong but are phonologically a sequence of a diphthong (represented by the letters ) and a monophthong (represented by the letters ). Some linguists use the terms &quot;diphthong&quot; and &quot;triphthong&quot; only in this phonemic sense.

== Written vowels ==

The name &quot;vowel&quot; is often used for the symbols that represent vowel sounds in a language&#x27;s writing system, particularly if the language uses an alphabet. In writing systems based on the Latin alphabet, the letters , , , , , , and sometimes others can all be used to represent vowels. However, not all of these letters represent the vowels in all languages that use this writing, or even consistently within one language. Some of them, especially and , are also used to represent approximant consonants. Moreover, a vowel might be represented by a letter usually reserved for consonants, or a combination of letters, particularly where one letter represents several sounds at once, or vice versa; examples from English include in &quot;thigh&quot; and in &quot;x-ray&quot;. In addition, extensions of the Latin alphabet have such independent vowel letters as , , , , , and .

The phonetic values vary considerably by language, and some languages use and for the consonant , e.g., initial in Italian or Romanian and initial in English. In the original Latin alphabet, there was no written distinction between and , and the letter represented the approximant and the vowels and . In Modern Welsh, represents these same sounds. There is not necessarily a direct one-to-one correspondence between the vowel sounds of a language and the vowel letters. Many languages that use a form of the Latin alphabet have more vowel sounds than can be represented by the standard set of five vowel letters. In English spelling, the five letters and can represent a variety of vowel sounds, while the letter frequently represents vowels (as in e.g., &quot;gym&quot;, &quot;happy&quot;, or the diphthongs in &quot;cry&quot;, &quot;thyme&quot;); is used in representing some diphthongs (as in &quot;cow&quot;) and to represent a monophthong in the borrowed words &quot; and &quot; (sometimes &quot;cruth&quot;).

Other languages cope with the limitation in the number of Latin vowel letters in similar ways. Many languages make extensive use of combinations of letters to represent various sounds. Other languages use vowel letters with modifications, such as in Swedish, or add diacritical marks, like umlauts, to vowels to represent the variety of possible vowel sounds. Some languages have also constructed additional vowel letters by modifying the standard Latin vowels in other ways, such as or that are found in some of the Scandinavian languages. The International Phonetic Alphabet has a set of 28 symbols representing the range of essential vowel qualities, and a further set of diacritics to denote variations from the basic vowel.

The writing systems used for some languages, such as the Hebrew alphabet and the Arabic alphabet, do not ordinarily mark all the vowels, since they are frequently unnecessary in identifying a word. Technically, these are called abjads rather than alphabets. Although it is possible to construct English sentences that can be understood without written vowels (&quot;cn y rd ths?&quot;), single words in English lacking written vowels can be indistinguishable; consider &quot;dd&quot;, which could be any of &quot;dad, dada, dado, dead, deed, did, died, diode, dodo, dud, dude, odd, add&quot;, and &quot;aided&quot;. (Abjads generally express some word-internal vowels and all word-initial and word-final vowels, whereby the ambiguity will be much reduced.) The Masoretes devised a vowel notation system for Hebrew Jewish scripture that is still widely used, as well as the trope symbols used for its cantillation; both are part of oral tradition and still the basis for many bible translations—Jewish and Christian.

===Shifts===
The differences in pronunciation of vowel letters between English and its related languages can be accounted for by the Great Vowel Shift. After printing was introduced to England, and therefore after spelling was more or less standardized, a series of dramatic changes in the pronunciation of the vowel phonemes occurred, and continued into recent centuries, but were not reflected in the spelling system. This has led to numerous inconsistencies in the spelling of English vowel sounds and the pronunciation of English vowel letters (and to the mispronunciation of foreign words and names by speakers of English).

== Systems ==
The importance of vowels in distinguishing one word from another varies from language to language. Nearly all languages have at least three phonemic vowels, usually as in Classical Arabic, some dialects of Banjarese and Inuktitut, though Adyghe and many Sepik languages have a vertical vowel system of . Very few languages have fewer, though some Arrernte, Circassian, and Ndu languages have been argued to have just two, and , with being epenthetic.

It is not straightforward to say which language has the most vowels, since that depends on how they are counted. For example, long vowels, nasal vowels, and various phonations may or may not be counted separately; indeed, it may sometimes be unclear if phonation belongs to the vowels or the consonants of a language. If such things are ignored and only vowels with dedicated IPA letters (&#x27;vowel qualities&#x27;) are considered, then very few languages have more than ten. The Germanic languages have some of the largest inventories: Standard Danish has 11 to 13 short vowels (), while the Amstetten dialect of Bavarian has been reported to have thirteen long vowels: . The situation can be quite disparate within a same family language: Spanish and French are two closely related Romance languages but Spanish has only five pure vowel qualities, , while classical French has eleven: and four nasal vowels . The Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia also have some large inventories, such as the eleven vowels of Vietnamese: . Wu dialects have the largest inventories of Chinese; the Jinhui dialect of Wu has also been reported to have eleven vowels: ten basic vowels, , plus restricted ; this does not count the seven nasal vowels.

One of the most common vowels is ; it is nearly universal for a language to have at least one open vowel, though most dialects of English have an and a —and often an , all open vowels—but no central . Some Tagalog and Cebuano speakers have rather than , and Dhangu Yolngu is described as having , without any peripheral vowels. is also extremely common, though Tehuelche has just the vowels with no close vowels. The third vowel of the Arabic-type three-vowel system, , is considerably less common. A large fraction of the languages of North America happen to have a four-vowel system without : ; Nahuatl and Navajo are examples.

In most languages, vowels serve mainly to distinguish separate lexemes, rather than different inflectional forms of the same lexeme as they commonly do in the Semitic languages. For example, while English &quot;man&quot; becomes &quot;men&quot; in the plural, &quot;moon&quot; is a completely different word.

===Words without vowels===
In rhotic dialects of English, as in Canada and the United States, there are many words such as &quot;bird, learn, girl, church, worst, worm, myrrh&quot; that some phoneticians analyze as having no vowels, only a syllabic consonant . However, others analyze these words instead as having a rhotic vowel, . The difference may be partially one of dialect.

There are a few such words that are disyllabic, like &quot;, curtain,&quot; and &quot;turtle:&quot; , and (or , , and ), and even a few that are trisyllabic, at least in some accents, such as &quot;purpler&quot; , &quot;hurdler&quot; , &quot;gurgler&quot; , and &quot;certainer&quot; .

The word &quot;and&quot; frequently contracts to a simple nasal &quot;’n,&quot; as in &quot;lock &#x27;n key&quot; . Words such as &quot;will, have,&quot; and &quot;is&quot; regularly contract to &quot;’ll&quot; , &quot;’ve&quot; , and &quot;&#x27;s&quot; . However, none of them are pronounced alone without vowels, so they are not phonological words. Onomatopoeic words that can be pronounced alone, and that have no vowels or ars, include &quot;hmm, pst!, shh!, tsk!,&quot; and &quot;zzz&quot;. As in other languages, onomatopoeiae stand outside the normal phonotactics of English.

There are other languages that form lexical words without vowel sounds. In Serbo-Croatian, for example, the consonants and (the difference is not written) can act as a syllable nucleus and carry rising or falling tone; examples include the tongue-twister and geographic names such as . In Czech and Slovak, either or can stand in for vowels: &quot;wolf&quot;, &quot;neck&quot;. A particularly long word without vowels is , meaning &quot;quarter-handful&quot;, with two syllables (one for each R), or , a verb form meaning &quot;you flipped (sth) down&quot; (eg a marble). Whole sentences (usually tongue-twisters) can be made from such words, such as , meaning &quot;stick a finger through your neck&quot; (), and , which means &quot;A morel full of spots wetted from fogs&quot;. (Here has two syllables based on L; and the preposition consists of a single consonant. Only prepositions do this in Czech, and they normally link phonetically to the following word, so not really behave as vowelless words.) In Russian, there are also prepositions that consist of a single consonant letter, like , , and . However, these forms are actually contractions of , , and respectively, and these forms are still used in modern Russian before words with certain consonant clusters for ease of pronunciation.

In Kazakh and certain other Turkic languages, words without vowel sounds may occur due to reduction of weak vowels. A common example is the Kazakh word for one: , pronounced . Among careful speakers, however, the original vowel may be preserved, and the vowels are always preserved in the orthography.

In Southern varieties of Chinese, such as Cantonese and Minnan, some monosyllabic words are made of exclusively nasals, such as Cantonese &quot;no&quot; and &quot;five&quot;. Minnan also has words consisting of a consonant followed by a syllabic nasal, such as &quot;pn̄g&quot; &quot;cooked rice&quot;.

So far, all of these syllabic consonants, at least in the lexical words, have been sonorants, such as , , , and , which have a voiced quality similar to vowels. (They can carry tone, for example.) However, there are languages with lexical words that not only contain no vowels, but contain no sonorants at all, like (non-lexical) &quot;shh!&quot; in English. These include some Berber languages and some languages of the American Pacific Northwest, such as Nuxalk. An example from the latter is &quot;seal fat&quot; (pronounced , as spelled), and a longer one is &quot;&quot; (pronounced ) &quot;he had had in his possession a bunchberry plant&quot;. (Follow the Nuxalk link for other examples.) Berber examples include &quot;you took it off&quot; and &quot;you gave it&quot;. Some words may contain one or two consonants only: &quot;be&quot;, &quot;feed on&quot;. (In Mandarin Chinese, words and syllables such as and are sometimes described as being syllabic fricatives and affricates phonemically, and , but these do have a voiced segment that carries the tone.) In the Japonic language Miyako, there are words with no voiced sounds, such as &#x27;dust&#x27;, &#x27;breast/milk&#x27;, &#x27;day&#x27;, &#x27;a comb&#x27;, &#x27;to make&#x27;, &#x27;to build&#x27;, &#x27;month&#x27;, &#x27;to cut&#x27;, &#x27;to pull&#x27;.

Some analyses of Wandala is reported to have no phonemic vowels.

===Words consisting of only vowels===
It is not uncommon for short grammatical words to consist of only vowels, such as &quot;a&quot; and &quot;I&quot; in English. Lexical words are somewhat rarer in English and are generally restricted to a single syllable: &quot;eye, awe, owe&quot;, and in non-rhotic accents &quot;air, ore, err&quot;. Vowel-only words of more than one syllable are generally foreign loans, such as &quot;ai&quot; (two syllables: ) for the maned sloth, or proper names, such as &quot;Iowa&quot; (in some accents: ).

However, vowel sequences in hiatus are more freely allowed in some other languages, most famously perhaps in Bantu and Polynesian languages, but also in Japanese and Finnic languages. In such languages there tends to be a larger variety of vowel-only words. In Swahili (Bantu), for example, there is &quot;&quot; &#x27;to survey&#x27; and &quot;&quot; &#x27;to purify&#x27; (both three syllables); in Japanese, &quot;&quot; 青い &#x27;blue/green&#x27; and &quot;&quot; 追々 &#x27;gradually&#x27; (three and four morae); and in Finnish, &#x27;intention&#x27; and &#x27;open!&#x27; (both two syllables), although some dialects pronounce them as and . In Urdu, āye/aaie or āyn &#x27;come&#x27; is used. Hawaiian, and the Polynesian languages generally, have unusually large numbers of such words, such as (a small green fish), which is three syllables: . Most long words involve reduplication, which is quite productive in Polynesian: &#x27;grooves&#x27;, &#x27;breath&#x27;, &#x27;tough&#x27; (all four syllables), &#x27;crying&#x27; (five syllables, from &#x27;to weep&#x27;), or &#x27;false mullet&#x27; (sp. fish, three or five syllables).

<text>A V6 engine is a six-cylinder piston engine where the cylinders and cylinder blocks share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration.

The first V6 engines were designed and produced independently by Marmon Motor Car Company, Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik and Delahaye. Engines built after World War II include the Lancia V6 engine in 1950 for the Lancia Aurelia, and the Buick V6 engine in 1962 for the Buick Special. The V6 layout has become the most common layout for six-cylinder automotive engines.

== Design ==
Due to their short length, V6 engines are often used as the larger engine option for vehicles which are otherwise produced with inline-four engines, especially in transverse engine vehicles. A downside for luxury cars is that V6 engines produce more vibrations than straight-six engines. Some sports cars like the Porsche 911 use flat-six engines instead of V6 engines, due to their near perfect primary engine balance and lower centre of gravity (which improves the handling).

The displacement of modern V6 engines is typically between , though larger and smaller examples have been produced, such as the Mazda V6 used in the 1991–1998 Mazda MX-3, or the Mitsubishi V6 engine used in the 1992–1998 Mirage/Lancer, while the largest gasoline V6 built was the GMC V6 used in the 1962 GMC C/K series 6500.

=== Balance and smoothness ===
All V6 engines with even firing spacing—regardless of the V-angle between the cylinder banks—are subject to a primary imbalance caused by each bank consisting of an inline-three engine, due to the odd number of cylinders in each bank. Straight-six engines and flat-six engines do not experience this imbalance. To reduce the vibrations caused by this imbalance, most V6 engines use a harmonic damper on the crankshaft and/or a counter-rotating balance shaft.

Six-cylinder designs have less pulsation in the power delivery than four-cylinder engines, due to the overlap in the power strokes of the six-cylinder engine. In a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine, only one piston is on a power stroke at any given time. Each piston comes to a complete stop and reverses direction before the next one starts its power stroke, which results in a gap between power strokes, especially at lower engine speeds (RPM). In a six-cylinder engine with an even firing interval, the next piston starts its power stroke 60° before the previous one finishes, which results in smoother delivery of power to the flywheel.

Comparing engines on a dynamometer, a V6 engine shows instantaneous torque peaks of 154% above mean torque and valleys of 139% below mean torque, with a small amount of negative torque (engine torque reversals) between power strokes. In the case of a four-cylinder engine, the peaks are approximately 270% above mean torque and 210% below mean torque, with 100% negative torque being delivered between strokes. However, a V6 with uneven firing intervals of 90° and 150° shows large torque variations of 185% above and 172% below mean torque.

=== Cylinder bank angles ===
==== 10 to 15 degrees ====

Since 1991, Volkswagen has produced narrow angle &quot;VR6&quot; engines with V-angles of 10.5 and 15 degrees shared by both banks of cylinders, in a design similar to the 1922-1976 Lancia V4 engine. These engines use a single cylinder head so are technically a straight engine with the name &quot;VR6&quot; coming from the combination of German words “Verkürzt” and “Reihenmotor” meaning “shortened inline engine”. The VR6 engines were used in transverse engine front-wheel drive cars which were originally designed for inline-four engines. Due to the minimal extra length and width of the VR6 engine, it could be fitted to the engine compartments relatively easily, in order to provide a displacement increase of 50 percent.

Since there is no room in the V between the cylinder banks for an intake system, all the intakes are on one side of the engine, and all the exhausts are on the other side. It uses a firing order of 1-5-3-6-2-4 (which is the firing order used by most straight-six engines), rather than the common V6 firing order of 1-2-3-4-5-6 or 1-6-5-4-3-2.
==== 60 degrees ====

A V-angle of 60 degrees is the optimal configuration for V6 engines regarding engine balance. When individual crank pins are used for each cylinder (i.e. using a six-throw crankshaft), an even firing interval of 120 degrees can be used. This firing interval is a multiple of the 60 degree V-angle, therefore the combustion forces can be balanced through use of the appropriate firing order.

The inline-three engine that forms each cylinder bank, however, produces unbalanced rotating and reciprocal forces. These forces remain unbalanced in all V6 engines, often leading to the use of a balance shaft to reduce the vibration.

The 1950 Lancia V6 engine was pioneering in its use of a six-throw crankshaft in order to reduce vibration. More recent designs often use a three-throw crankshaft with &#x27;flying arms&#x27; between the crankpins to allow an even firing interval of 120 degrees to be achieved. A pair of counterweights on the crankshaft can then be used to almost perfectly cancel out the primary forces and reduce the secondary vibrations to acceptable levels. The engine mounts can be designed to absorb these remaining vibrations.

A 60 degree V-angle results in a narrower engine overall than V6 engines with larger V-angles. This angle often results in the overall engine size being a cube shape, making the engine easier to fit either longitudinally or transversely in the engine compartment.

==== 90 degrees ====
Many manufacturers, particularly American ones, built V6 engines with a V-angle of 90 degrees based on their existing 90-degree V8 engines. Such configurations were easy to design by removing two cylinders and replacing the V8 engine&#x27;s four-throw crankshaft with a three-throw crankshaft. This reduced design costs, allowed the new V6 to share components with the V8 engine, and sometimes allowed manufacturers to build the V6 and V8 engines on the same production line.

The downsides of a 90 degree design are a wider engine which is more vibration-prone than a 60 degree V6. The initial 90 degree V6 engines (such as the Buick Fireball V6 engine) had three shared crankpins arranged at 120 degrees from each other, due to their origins from the V8 engines. This resulted in an uneven firing order, with half of the cylinders using a firing interval of 90 degrees and other half using an interval of 150 degrees. The uneven firing intervals resulted in rough-running engines with &quot;unpleasant&quot; vibrations at low engine speeds.

Several modern 90 degree V6 engines reduce the vibrations using split crankpins offset by 30 degrees between piston pairs, which creates an even firing interval of 120 degrees for all cylinders. For example, the 1977 Buick 231 &quot;even-fire&quot; V6 engine was an upgraded version of the Buick Fireball engine with a split-pin crankshaft to reduce vibration by achieving an even firing order. Such a &#x27;split&#x27; crankpin is weaker than a straight one, but modern metallurgical techniques can produce a crankshaft that is adequately strong.

A balance shaft and/or crankshaft counterweights can be used to reduce vibrations in 90 degree V6 engines.

==== 120 degrees ====
At first glance, 120 degrees might seem to be the optimal V-angle for a V6 engine, since pairs of pistons in alternate banks can share crank pins in a three-throw crankshaft and the combustion forces are balanced by the firing interval being equal to the angle between the cylinder banks. A 120 degree configuration, unlike the 60 degree or 90 degree configurations, would not require crankshafts with flying arms, split crankpins, or seven main bearings to be even-firing. However, the primary imbalance caused by odd number of cylinders in each bank still remains in a 120 degree V6 engine. This differs from the perfect balance achieved by a 90 degree V8 engine with a commonly used crossplane crankshaft, because the inline-four engine in each bank of the V8 engine does not have this primary imbalance.

A 120 degree design also results in a large width for the engine, being only slightly narrower than a flat-six engine (which does not have the balance problems of the V6 engine). Therefore, the flat-six engine has been used in various automobiles, whereas use of the 120 degree V6 engine has been limited to a few truck and racing car engines, with the exception of McLaren Automotive&#x27;s M630 V6 engine, which uses a 120 degree bank angle with a single balance shaft to eliminate all primary couples. The McLaren M630 engine also takes advantage of the wide angle by placing the turbochargers inside the vee, commonly referred to as a &#x27;hot vee&#x27; configuration. The Ferrari 296 GTB is the first Ferrari road car to sport a V6 turbo with a vee angle of 120 degrees between the cylinder banks.

==== Other angles ====
Other angle V6 engines are possible but can suffer from severe vibration problems unless very carefully designed. Notable V-angles include:
* 45 degrees — EMD 567 and EMD 645 locomotive, marine and stationary Diesel engines. These engines were based on V8 and V16 engines which also used a V-angle of 45 degrees.
* 54 degrees — 1994-2004 General Motors 54-degree automotive engine. A slightly smaller than usual V-angle was used to reduce the width of the engine, allowing it to be used in small transverse-engine front-wheel drive cars.
* 65 degrees — 1956-1975 Ferrari Dino automobile engine. The V-angle was increased from the then-common 60 degree angle to allow larger carburetors to be used (for potentially higher power in race tuning). Crankpins with an offset of 55 degrees within every pair of cylinders were used to achieve the even firing interval of a 60 degree V6 engine. The 2009–present Nissan-Renault V9X automobile engine also used a 65 degree bank angle, to allow a turbocharger to fit between the cylinder banks.
* 72 degrees — Mercedes-Benz OM642 BlueTEC diesel engine. This engine uses crank pins offset by 48 degrees, to achieve an even firing interval.
* 75 degrees — 1992-2004 Isuzu V engine used in the Isuzu Rodeo and Isuzu Trooper. These engines were produced in both SOHC and DOHC versions. A 75 degree V6 engine is also used by the 2016–2022 Honda NSX. 
* 80 degrees — 1988 &quot;Honda RA168-E&quot; engine used in the McLaren MP4/4 Formula One racing car.

== Use in automobiles ==

In 1906, a few years after 4 cylinder engines and V8 engines had come into existence, the first known V6 engine was built. This V6 engine was a single prototype automotive engine built by Marmon Motor Car Company in the United States. The engine did not reach production. Similarly, a single prototype engine was produced by Buick in 1918.

In 1910 Delahaye produced the first 30° 3.2-litre V6 which was installed in the 1911 Delahaye Type 44 automobile.

The Lancia V6 engine was introduced in the 1950 Lancia Aurelia. Lancia had been producing V4 engines for approximately 30 years, and one of the key goals was to reduce the vibrations compared with the V4 engine. The V6 engine used a 60 degree V-angle and six crankpins, resulting in an evenly-spaced firing order to reduce vibrations.

Other manufacturers took note and soon other V6 engines were designed. In 1959, the GMC V6 engine was introduced in the form of a 60-degree petrol engine used in pickup trucks and carryalls. The Buick V6 engine was introduced in 1962 and was based on the all-alloy Buick 215 V8, which shared its 90° bank angle, but unlike the Buick V8, used all-cast iron construction. Initially an uneven-firing engine, Buick later redesigned the crankshaft to a &quot;split-pin&quot; configuration to create an &quot;even-firing&quot; version. After it became the 3800 V6 in 1990, the engine gained a reputation as a reliable, powerful, fuel-efficient workhorse that became a mainstay of GM&#x27;s FWD mid-size and full-size cars. It was discontinued in 2008. Over 25 million units had been built, making it one of the most-produced engines in history, and it was on Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines of the 20th century list.

Ford introduced its European road car engines in 1965 with the German division&#x27;s Cologne V6, and the Ford Essex V6 engine, introduced by Ford&#x27;s United Kingdom division in 1966; both engines used a 60-degree V-angle. The 1967 Dino 206 GT was Ferrari&#x27;s first V6 road car, which had a 65-degree V-angle.

The 1979-2005 Alfa Romeo V6 engine was introduced in the Alfa Romeo Alfa 6 luxury sedan and later used in many other Alfa Romeo models. This engine used a 60 degree V-angle, an all-aluminium construction and two valves per cylinder. A turbocharged version was introduced in 1991 and a four valve per cylinder version was introduced in 1997. Also in 1970, the Citroën SM grand tourer was introduced, powered by a 90-degree V6 built by Maserati. The Chevrolet 90° V6 engine was introduced in 1978 and produced for 36 years.

The first mass-produced Japanese V6 engine was the Nissan VG engine, a 60-degree design which was produced from 1983 to 2004. The Honda C engine was introduced in 1985, followed by the Mitsubishi 6G7 engine and the Mazda J engine in 1986, the Toyota VZ engine in 1988, and the Isuzu V engine in 1992. Hyundai introduced the first South Korean Hyundai Sigma engine based on technology shared from the Mitsubishi unit in 1995.

German car manufacturers were relatively slow to adopt V6 engines, because engineers believed that they lacked the smoothness of an inline-6 engine. Eventually, the first German V6 engine was a 2.8 liter 90° V6 that was launched in the 1990 Audi 100, and the narrow-angle VR6, which was introduced across Volkswagen&#x27;s mid-size and sports car lineup in the 1990s. In 1998, Mercedes-Benz introduced the M112, its first V6 engine, while BMW has continued to use inline-6 engines. Mercedes-Benz discontinued its V6 engines in 2017, and has since returned to making inline-6 engines.

The first independently designed British V6 engine was the Rover KV6 engine, which replaced the Honda C engine that was previously used in the Rover 800. Jaguar used the Ford-based AJ-V6 engine until 2011 in their smaller cars, but also shared a V6 version of the 90° AJ-V8 engine with Land Rover for use in the XE, XF, XJ, F-Type and the F-Pace. Land Rover used it in the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, Range Rover Velar, and the Discovery 4.

The 90° V6 engine was discontinued in 2020, and Jaguar Land Rover replaced it with the new Ingenium engine, which has an inline-6 variant for JLR&#x27;s bigger cars and SUVs.

By the mid-1990s, the V6 layout was the most common configuration for six-cylinder automotive engines, with V6 engines having replaced most of the straight-six engines. Today, it is being progressively replaced across the car industry by turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, which can produce similar power, but in a smaller package that produces cleaner emissions, has better fuel economy, and are less expensive to produce.

=== Motor racing ===
The Lancia Aurelia (the first series production car with a V6 engine) was also successful in motor racing. Four of the &quot;Aurelia B20 Coupes&quot; were entered in the 1951 Mille Miglia with the best placed cars finishing second and fourth. A tuned version of the Lancia V6 engine producing was used in the Lancia D24. The D24 competed in sports car racing and won the 1953 Carrera Panamericana with Juan Manuel Fangio at the wheel.

The initial version of the Ferrari Dino engine was a racing engine used in Formula Two racing in the 1957 season. It had a V-angle of 65 degrees and dual overhead camshafts. The Dino V6 underwent several evolutions, including a version used in the 1958 Ferrari 246 Formula One racing car. A few years later, the 1961-1964 Ferrari 156 Formula One car used a new V6 engine with a V-angle of 120 degrees and a displacement of . This engine was shorter and lighter than the Ferrari Dino engine, and the simplicity and low center of gravity of the engine was an advantage in racing. It won a large number of races between and . However, Ferrari&#x27;s founder had a personal dislike of the 120 degree layout, preferring a 65 degree layout, and after that time it was replaced by other engines. The Dino engine was also used in the Lancia Stratos, which was a highly successful rally car that won the World Rally Championship in 1974, 1975 and 1976.

A notable racing use of the Alfa Romeo V6 engine was the Alfa Romeo 155 V6 TI, designed for the 1993 DTM season and equipped with a engine making a peak power of at 11,900 rpm.

The &quot;Renault-Gordini CH1&quot; was a 90 degree V6 engine with an iron block. It was introduced in the 1973 &quot;Alpine -Renault A440&quot; sportscar racing car. This engine won the European 2 L prototype championship in 1974 and several European Formula Two Championships. A turbocharged version was used in the Renault Alpine A442, which won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1978.

A turbocharged version of the &quot;Renault-Gordini CH1&quot; engine was introduced in the 1977 Renault RS01 Formula One car. Renault struggled with reliability issues in 1977 and 1978; however, the 1979 season saw some good results at a few races. In 1981, the Ferrari 126C Formula One car used a turbocharged V6 engine. Ferrari won the Formula One constructors&#x27; championship with turbocharged V6 engines in 1982 and 1983. Initial versions used a 120 degree V-angle, before switching to a 90 degree V-angle for the 1987 Ferrari F1/87 racing car. Other successful turbocharged V6 Formula One cars in the era of 1982-1988 were the McLaren MP4/2, McLaren MP4/3, McLaren MP4/4, Williams FW10, Williams FW11, Williams FW12, Lotus 95T, Lotus 97T, Lotus 98T, Lotus 99T and Lotus 100T.

The Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo and Nissan NPT-90 competed in the IMSA sports car prototype category from 1985 to 1994 and used a turbocharged V6 engine loosely based on the Nissan VG30ET production car engine. The Nissan 300ZX used a similar engine to compete in the 1996-1997 All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (now known as the &#x27;Super GT&#x27; championship).

Downsizing to V6 engines in open-wheeler racing became more common:

* the IndyCar Series switched to turbocharged V6 engines in 2012.
* the GP3 Series switched to naturally aspirated V6 engines in 2013.
* the Formula One World Championship switched to turbocharged hybrid V6 engines in 2014.
* the FIA Formula 2 Championship (formerly known as the GP2 Series) switched to turbocharged V6 engines in 2018.
* the FIA Formula 3 Championship (created from the merger of the GP3 Series and the FIA Formula 3 European Championship) began using naturally aspirated V6 engines from 2019.

== Use in marine vessels and railway engines==
V6 engines are popular powerplants in medium to large outboard motors.

The first V6 engine to reach production was built from 1908 to 1913 by the Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik in Germany. These V6 engines were used as the generator for gasoline-electric railway engines.

== Use in motorcycles ==
The Laverda V6 was a racing motorcycle which was unveiled at the 1977 Milan show. It entered the 1978 Bol d&#x27;Or 24 hour endurance race, however it retired with mechanical issues after approximately 8 hours.

Horex has produced road motorcycles with VR6 engines since 2012.

<text>The Vehmic courts, Vehmgericht, holy vehme, or simply Vehm, also spelt Feme, Vehmegericht, Fehmgericht, are names given to a tribunal system of Westphalia in Germany active during the Late Middle Ages, based on a fraternal organisation of lay judges called &quot;free judges&quot; ( or ). The original seat of the courts was in Dortmund. Proceedings were sometimes secret, leading to the alternative titles of &quot;secret courts&quot; (), &quot;silent courts&quot; (), or &quot;forbidden courts&quot; (). After the execution of a death sentence, the corpse could be hanged on a tree to advertise the fact and deter others.
The peak of activity of these courts was during the 14th to 15th centuries, with lesser activity attested for the 13th and 16th centuries, and scattered evidence establishing their continued existence during the 17th and 18th centuries. They were finally abolished by order of Jérôme Bonaparte, king of Westphalia, in 1811.

The Vehmic courts were the regional courts of Westphalia which, in turn, were based on the county courts of Franconia. They received their jurisdiction from the Holy Roman Emperor, from whom they also received the capacity to pronounce capital punishment () which they exercised in his name. Everywhere else the power of life and death, originally reserved to the Emperor alone, had been usurped by the territorial nobles; only in Westphalia, called &quot;the Red Earth&quot; because here the imperial &quot;Blutbann&quot; (jurisdiction over life and death) was still valid, were capital sentences passed and executed by the Vehmic courts in the Emperor&#x27;s name alone.

==Etymology==
The term&#x27;s origin is uncertain, but seems to enter Middle High German from Middle Low German. The word &quot;vëme&quot; first appears in the Middle High German literature of the 13th century as a noun with the meaning of &quot;punishment&quot;. A document dated to 1251 has the reference &quot;illud occultum judicium, quod vulgariter vehma seu vridinch appellari consuevit.&quot; (&quot;It is hidden justice, that by common fashion is habitually referred to as &quot;vehma&quot; or &quot;vridinch&quot;.&quot;)
The general meaning of &quot;punishment&quot; is unrelated to the special courts of Westphalia which were thus originally just named &quot;courts of punishment&quot;. But as the word entered the Southern German dialects via Saxony and Westphalia, the word&#x27;s meaning in Early Modern German became attached to the activities of these courts specifically.

Jacob Grimm thought that the word is identical in origin to a homophonous word for the raising of pigs on forest pastures (Hutewald), just as the more familiar German &quot;Zucht&quot; can mean both breeding and discipline. Grimm considers the spelling with &quot;h&quot; unetymological in spite of its early occurrence in some 13th century documents, and hypothesizes a &quot;lost root&quot; &quot;&quot;fëmen&quot;, connecting with Old Norse &quot;fimr&quot; and conjecturing a Gothic &quot;fiman, fam, fêmun?&quot;&quot;.

During 18th to 19th century Romanticism, there were various misguided attempts to explain the obscure term, or to elevate it to the status of a remnant of pagan antiquity, scoffed at by Grimm&#x27;s entry in his &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot;. An etymology suggested by James Skene in 1824 derives the word from &quot;Baumgericht&quot; (Lit. &quot;Tree law&quot;), supposedly the remnant of a pagan &quot;forest law&quot; of the Wild hunt and pagan secret societies.

==Origin==
The Westphalian Vehmic courts developed from the High Medieval &quot;free courts&quot; (&quot;Freigerichte&quot;), which had jurisdiction within a &quot;free county&quot; (). As a result of the 14th century imperial reform of the Holy Roman Empire (Golden Bull of 1356), the Landgraviates lost much of their power, and the &quot;Freigerichte&quot; disappeared, with the exception of Westphalia, where they retained their authority and transformed into the Vehmic court.

The seat of the Vehmic court () was at first Dortmund, in a square between two linden trees, one of which was known as the &quot;Femelinde&quot;. With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century, the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437.

==Membership and procedure==
The sessions were often held in secret, whence the names of &quot;secret court&quot; (), &quot;silent court&quot; (), etc. Attendance of secret sessions was forbidden to the uninitiated, on pain of death, which led to the designation &quot;forbidden courts&quot; (). A chairman () presided over the court, and lay judges () passed judgment. The court also constituted a Holy Order.

Any free man &quot;of pure bred German stock&quot; and of good character could become a judge. The new candidate was given secret information and identification symbols. The &quot;knowing one&quot; () had to keep his knowledge secret, even from his closest family (&quot;vor Weib und Kind, vor Sand und Wind&quot;). Lay judges had to give formal warnings to known troublemakers, issue warrants, and take part in executions.

The organization of the &quot;Fehme&quot; was elaborate. The centre of each jurisdiction was referred to as a &quot;free seat&quot; (), and its head or chairman () was often a secular or spiritual prince, or sometimes a civic community leader. The archbishop of Cologne sat at the top of the hierarchy, &quot;supreme over all&quot; (). The actual president of the court was the &quot;free count&quot; (), chosen for life by the &quot;Stuhlherr&quot; from among the &quot;Freischöffen&quot;, who formed the great body of the initiated. Of these the lowest rank were the &quot;Fronboten&quot; or &quot;Freifronen&quot;, charged with the maintenance of order in the courts and the duty of carrying out the commands of the &quot;Freigraf&quot;. The immense development of the &quot;Fehme&quot; is explained by the privileges of the &quot;Freischöffen&quot;; for they were subject to no jurisdiction but those of the Westphalian courts: whether as accused or accuser they had access to the secret sessions, and they shared in the discussions of the general chapter as to the policy of the society. At their initiation these swore to support the &quot;Fehme&quot; with all their powers, to guard its secrets, and to bring before its tribunal anything within its competence that they might discover. They were then initiated into the secret signs by which members recognized each other, and were presented with a rope and with a knife on which were engraved the mystic letters S.S.G.G., supposed to mean &quot;Stein, Strick, Gras, grün&quot; (stone, rope, grass, green).

The &quot;Freistuhl&quot; was the place of session, and was usually a hillock, or some other well-known and accessible spot. The &quot;Freigraf&quot; and the &quot;Schöffen&quot; (judges) occupied the bench, before which a table, with a sword and rope upon it, was placed. The court was held by day and, unless the session was declared secret, all freemen, whether initiated or not, were admitted. The accusation was in the old German form; but only a &quot;Freischöffe&quot; could act as accuser. If the offence came under the competence of the court, meaning it was punishable by death, a summons to the accused was issued under the seal of the &quot;Freigraf&quot;. This was not usually served on him personally, but was nailed to his door, or to some convenient place where he was certain to pass. Six weeks and three days&#x27; grace were allowed, according to the old Saxon law, and the summons was thrice repeated. If the accused appeared, the accuser stated the case, and the investigation proceeded by the examination of witnesses as in an ordinary court of law. The judgment was put into execution on the spot if that was possible.

The secret court, from whose procedure the whole institution has acquired its evil reputation, was closed to all but the initiated, although these were so numerous as to secure quasi-publicity; any one not a member on being discovered was instantly put to death, and the members present were bound under the same penalty not to disclose what took place. Crimes of a serious nature, and especially those that were deemed unfit for ordinary judicial investigation, such as heresy and witchcraft, fell within its jurisdiction, as also did appeals by persons condemned in the open courts, and likewise the cases before those tribunals in which the accused had not appeared. The accused, if a member, could clear himself by his own oath, unless he had revealed the secrets of the &quot;Fehme&quot;. If he were one of the uninitiated it was necessary for him to bring forward witnesses to his innocence from among the initiated, whose number varied according to the number on the side of the accuser, but twenty-one in favour of innocence necessarily secured an acquittal. The only punishment which the secret court could inflict was death. If the accused appeared, the sentence was carried into execution at once; if he did not appear, it was quickly made known to the whole body, and the &quot;Freischöffe&quot; who was the first to meet the condemned was bound to put him to death. This was usually done by hanging, the nearest tree serving for gallows. A knife with the mystic letters was left beside the corpse to show that the deed was not a murder.

It has been claimed that, in some cases, the condemned would be set free, given several hours&#x27; head start and then hunted down and put to death. So fearsome was the reputation of the &quot;Fehme&quot; and its reach that many thus released committed suicide rather than prolonging the inevitable. This practice could have been a holdover from the ancient Germanic legal concept of outlawry (&quot;Acht&quot;).

Legend and romance have combined to exaggerate the sinister reputation of the Fehmic courts; but modern historical research has largely discounted this, proving that they never employed torture, that their sittings were only sometimes secret, and that their meeting-places were always well known.

==The spread of the Vehmic courts==
The system, though ancient, came into wider use only after the division of the duchy of Saxony after the fall of Henry the Lion, when the archbishop of Cologne Engelbert II of Berg, (also duke of Westphalia from 1180) placed himself at the head of the Fehme as representative of the emperor. The organization then spread rapidly. Every free man born in lawful wedlock and not excommunicated nor an outlaw was eligible for membership.

Princes and nobles were initiated; and in 1429 even the Emperor Sigismund himself became &quot;a true and proper of the Holy Roman Empire.&quot; There is a manuscript in the Town Hall of the Westphalian town of Soest which consists of an original Vehmic Court Regulation document, along with illustrations.

By the middle of the 14th century these (Latin ), sworn associates of the Fehme, were scattered in thousands throughout the length and breadth of Germany, known to each other by secret signs and pass-words, and all of them pledged to serve the summons of the secret courts and to execute their judgment.

==Decline and dissolution of the Courts==
That an organization of this character should have outlived its usefulness and ushered in corruption and other intolerable abuses was inevitable; from the mid-fifteenth century protests were raised against the enormities of the court.

With the growing power of the territorial sovereigns and the gradual improvement of the ordinary process of justice, the functions of the Fehmic courts were superseded. By the action of the Emperor Maximilian and of other German princes they were, in the 16th century, once more restricted to Westphalia, and here, too, they were brought under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, and finally confined to mere police duties. With these functions, however, but with the old forms long since robbed of their impressiveness, they survived into the 19th century. They were finally abolished by order of Jérôme Bonaparte, king of Westphalia, in 1811. The last Freigraf died in 1835.

==Modern use of the term==
Following the abandonment of the Vehmic courts, the term acquired a connotation of mob rule and lynching. In Modern German, the spelling of &quot;Feme&quot; is most common. Other variant forms are: Fehme, Feime, Veme. The verb &quot;verfemen&quot; is in current use and means &quot;to ostracise&quot;, i.e. by public opinion rather than formal legal proceeding. A noun derived from this is &quot;Verfemter&quot; &quot;outlaw, ostracised person&quot;.

In an 1856 lecture, Karl Marx used the Vehmic courts as a metaphor to describe his predictions of the working-class revolution that would sweep Europe.

Within the politically heated turmoil of the early German Weimar Republic after World War I, the media frequently used the term &quot;Fememord&quot; to refer to right-wing political homicides, e.g. the murder of Jewish politicians such as Kurt Eisner (1919) or Walther Rathenau (1922) and other politicians including Matthias Erzberger (1921) by right-wing groups such as Organisation Consul. In 1926, the 27th &quot;Reichstag&quot; commission officially differentiated the contemporarily common &quot;Fememorde&quot; from political assassination in that assassination was by definition exerted upon open political opponents, whereas a &quot;Fememord&quot; was a form of lethal vengeance committed upon former or current members of an organization that they had become a traitor to. This definition is also found in the common pseudo-archaic, alliterating right-wing phrase, &quot;Verräter verfallen der Feme!&quot; (&quot;Traitors shall be ostracized!&quot;, i. e. killed), as it was often quoted throughout the 1920s in mass media reports regarding violent acts of vengeance among the German Right.

==The Vehmic courts in fiction==
Vehmic courts play a key role in the novel &quot;Anne of Geierstein or, The Maiden of the Mist&quot; by Sir Walter Scott in which Archibald von Hagenbach, the Duke of Burgundy&#x27;s governor at Brisach (Switzerland), is condemned and executed by the Vehmgericht. Scott drew his inspiration from Goethe&#x27;s play &quot;Goetz von Berlichingen&quot; which he had translated, incorrectly. Hector Berlioz&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Les francs-juges&quot;, was inspired by Scott&#x27;s presentation of the Vehmic Courts. Though the work was never staged the overture survives as a concert piece. In the very first concert of Berlioz&#x27;s work, on 26 May 1828, the overture was performed along with the Opus 1 &quot;Waverley&quot; overture, a further indication of Berlioz&#x27;s debt to Scott&#x27;s fiction. The &quot;Les francs-juges&quot; overture later became the signature tune for &quot;Face to Face&quot;, the early series of British television interviews presented by John Freeman.

In William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; &quot;Was Rebecca guilty or not?&quot; the Vehmgericht of the servants&#x27; hall had pronounced against her.

A character in the Dorothy L. Sayers novel &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; appears at a fancy-dress party as a member of the Vehmgericht, which allows him to wear a hooded costume to disguise his identity. People in Femgericht costumes also appear in Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s 1926 novella &quot;Dream Story&quot;.

In &quot;Fritz Lang&quot;&#x27;s &quot;M&quot;, the local criminals of an unnamed city (probably Berlin) capture a child murderer and hold a vigilante court.

In &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;, the Vehmic courts are mentioned as being connected to Nazi Werwolf commandos as well as the Illuminati.

In &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, a Sherlock Holmes novel by Arthur Conan Doyle, a newspaper article mentions the Vehmgericht, stating that the features of a recent death are similar to the organization&#x27;s killings.

The Vehmgericht also appear as antagonists in &quot;The Strong Arm&quot;, an 1899 novel set in the Holy Roman Empire by British-Canadian author Robert Barr.

Geoff Taylor&#x27;s 1966 novel, &quot;Court of Honor&quot;, features the Fehme being revived by a German officer and Martin Bormann in the dying days of the Third Reich.

Season 3, episode 12 of &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, titled &quot;The Vehm&quot; is based on a group of vigilantes using medieval torture methods to kill paedophiles and money launderers.

Jack Mayer&#x27;s 2015 historical fiction, &quot;Before the Court of Heaven&quot;, depicts the Fehme, and &#x27;Fehme justice&#x27; as part of the extreme right-wing conspiracy to bring down Germany&#x27;s Weimar democracy.

<text>Violette Reine Elizabeth Szabo, GC (née Bushell; 26 June 1921 – February 1945) was a British-French Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent during the Second World War and a posthumous recipient of the George Cross. On her second mission into occupied France, Szabo was captured by the German army, interrogated, tortured, and deported to Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany, where she was executed.

==Early life==
Violette Bushell was born on 26 June 1921 in Paris, France, of parents Charles George Bushell and Reine Blanche Leroy, as the second child of five and the only daughter. Szabo&#x27;s father, son of a publican from Hampstead Norreys, was serving as a British Army driver in France during the First World War when he met her mother, a dressmaker originally from Pont-Remy, Somme. After the war the couple lived in London, where Charles worked as a taxi-driver, car salesman and shopkeeper.

During the early 1930s, as a result of the Great Depression, Bushell and her youngest brother, Dickie, lived with their maternal aunt in Picardy, northern France. The family was reunited in South London when Violette was 11 years old. She was an active and lively girl, enjoying gymnastics, long-distance bicycling and ice-skating with four brothers and several male cousins. Bushell was regarded as a tomboy, especially after being taught to shoot by her father; her shooting was reputedly very accurate.

While Bushell had temporarily lost the ability to speak English in Picardy, she quickly relearned the language while attending school in Brixton. There she was reportedly popular and regarded as exotic, owing to her ability to speak another language. Her home life was loving, though she often clashed with her strict father and once ran away to France after an argument. The family, except her monolingual father, would often converse in French.

At the age of 14, Bushell went to work for a French corsetière in South Kensington and later worked at retailer Woolworths in Oxford Street. At the outbreak of the Second World War, she was working at Le Bon Marché, a Brixton department store.

==Second World War==

In early 1940, Bushell joined the Women&#x27;s Land Army and was sent to carry out strawberry picking in Fareham, Hampshire, but she soon returned to London to work in an armaments factory in Acton. She met Étienne Szabo, a decorated non-commissioned officer in the French Foreign Legion of Hungarian descent, at the Bastille Day parade in London in 1940, where Bushell had been sent by her mother, accompanied by her friend Winnie Wilson, to bring home a homesick French soldier for dinner. They married at Aldershot Register Office in Manor Park on 21 August 1940 after a 42-day romance; Violette was 19, Étienne was 31. They enjoyed a week&#x27;s honeymoon before Étienne set off from Liverpool to fight in the abortive Free French attack on Dakar, Senegal. From there, he went to South Africa before seeing action, again against the Vichy French, in the successful Anglo-Free French campaigns in Eritrea and Syria in 1941. He returned to the UK for a brief leave later in the year.

After her marriage, Szabo became a switchboard operator for the General Post Office in central London, working throughout the Blitz. Bored by the job, she enlisted in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) on 11 September 1941. She was posted to Leicester for initial training before being sent to one of the first mixed anti-aircraft batteries of the 7th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Training Regiment, Royal Artillery in Oswestry, Shropshire for specialised instruction as a predictor and then to the 481st Heavy (Mixed) Anti-Aircraft Battery. After further training in Anglesey, Gunner Szabo and her unit were posted to Frodsham, Cheshire, near Warrington, from December 1941 to February 1942. Szabo found within weeks that she was pregnant, so she left the ATS to return to London for the birth.

Szabo took a flat in Notting Hill, which was to be her home until she left for her second mission to France in June 1944. On 8 June 1942, she gave birth to Tania Damaris Desiree Szabo at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital while Étienne was stationed at Bir Hakeim in North Africa. The following day, he took part in a valiant defence against the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;, escaping with his battalion from the assault of the 15th Panzer Division on 10 June.

Szabo sent her baby to childminders while she worked at the South Morden aircraft factory, where her father was stationed. During this period, she was informed of her husband&#x27;s death in action. Étienne had died on 24 October 1942 from chest wounds received while leading his men in a diversionary attack on Qaret el Himeimat, at the beginning of the Second Battle of El Alamein; he had never seen his daughter. It was Étienne&#x27;s death that made Szabo accept an offer to train as a field agent in the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) as her best way of fighting the enemy that killed her husband.

==Special Operations Executive==
It is unclear how or why Szabo was recruited by F-Section, as her surviving official file is thin, but her fluency in French and her previous service in the ATS probably brought her to the attention of SOE. She would have been invited to an interview regarding war work with E. Potter, the alias of Selwyn Jepson, a detective novelist and the F-Section recruiter. Szabo was given security clearance on 1 July 1943 and selected for training as a field agent on 10 July. She was commissioned as a section leader in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, a civilian service often used by SOE as a cover for female agents.

After an assessment for fluency in French and a series of interviews, Szabo was sent from 7–27 August to STS 4, a training school at Winterfold House, and after a moderately favourable report, to Special Training School 24 of Group A at Arisaig in the Scottish Highlands in September and October. Szabo received intensive instruction in fieldcraft, night and daylight navigation, weapons and demolition. Again her reports were mixed, but she passed the course and moved on to Group B.

Szabo was sent to the SOE &quot;finishing school&quot; at Beaulieu, Hampshire, where she learnt escape and evasion, uniform recognition, communications and cryptography, and had further training in weaponry. The final stage in training was parachute jumping, which was taught at Ringway Airport near Manchester. On her first attempt, Szabo badly sprained her ankle and was sent home for recuperation, spending some time in Bournemouth (it was this ankle that was to fail her later in France). She was able to take the parachuting course again and passed with a second class in February 1944. On 24 January 1944, Szabo made her will, witnessed by Vera Atkins and Major R. A. Bourne Paterson of SOE, naming her mother, Reine, as executrix and her daughter Tania as sole beneficiary.

In 2012 Max Hastings wrote that Szabo was &quot;adored by the men and women of SOE both for her courage and endless infectious Cockney laughter&quot;, while Leo Marks remembered her as &quot;A dark-haired slip of mischief...She had a Cockney accent which added to her impishness&quot;. Assessments by her trainers were mixed: &quot;she lacks ruse, stability and the finesse which is required and...she is too easily influenced...[but] she set an example to the whole party by her cheerfulness and eagerness to please&quot;.

===First mission===
Due to the ankle injury, Szabo&#x27;s first deployment was delayed, but it was during her second course at Ringway that she first met Philippe Liewer (d. c. 1948). While in London, she also socialised with Bob Maloubier, so SOE decided she would work as a courier for Liewer&#x27;s Salesman circuit. However, the mission was postponed when F Section received a signal from Harry Peulevé&#x27;s (codename Jean) Author circuit warning that several members of the Rouen-Dieppe group had been arrested, including Claude Malraux (codename Cicero; brother of novelist Andre Malraux) and radio operator Isidore Newman. This extra time meant Szabo could be sent for a refresher course in wireless operation in London, and it was then that Leo Marks, SOE&#x27;s cryptographer, seeing her struggle with her original French nursery rhyme, gave Szabo his own composition, &quot;The Life That I Have&quot; as her code poem.

On the night of 5/6 April 1944, Szabo and Liewer were flown from RAF Tempsford in Bedfordshire in a Westland Lysander aircraft and landed in German-occupied France, near the village of Azay-le-Rideau in the heart of the Loire Valley. Her cover was that she was a commercial secretary named Corinne Reine Leroy (the latter two names being her mother&#x27;s first and maiden names), who was born on 26 June 1921 (her real birthdate) in Bailleul, and who was a resident of Le Havre, which gave her reason to travel to the Restricted Zone of German occupation on the coast.

Under the code name &quot;Louise&quot;, which happened to be her nickname (she was also nicknamed &quot;La P&#x27;tite Anglaise&quot;, as she stood only 5&#x27;3&quot; tall), she and SOE colleague Philippe Liewer (under the name &quot;Major Charles Staunton&quot;), organiser of the Salesman circuit, tried to assess the damage made by the German arrests, with Szabo travelling to Rouen, where Liewer could not go as a wanted man (both he and Maloubier were on wanted posters with their codenames), and to Dieppe to gather intelligence and carry out reconnaissance. It soon became clear that the circuit, which originally involved over 120 members (80 in Rouen and 40 on the coast) had been exposed beyond repair. Szabo returned to Paris to brief Liewer, and in the two days, before they were due to depart, she bought a dress for Tania, three frocks and a yellow sweater for herself, and perfume for her mother and herself. While the destruction of Salesman was a heavy blow to SOE, her reports on the local factories producing war materials for the Germans were important in establishing Allied bombing targets.
She returned to England by Lysander, piloted by Bob Large, DFC, of the RAF, on 30 April 1944, landing after a stressful flight in which the plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire over Chateaudun, and Szabo was thrown about the body of the plane. Large had turned off the intercom when attacked and did not turn it back on for the rest of the flight, so when the plane landed heavily due to a burst tyre, and he went to get Szabo out, she (thinking they had been shot down and not having seen her blond pilot) let Large have a volley of abuse in French, mistaking him for a German. When she realised what had really happened, he was rewarded with a kiss. Philippe Liewer returned at the same time in another Lysander. On 24 May 1944 Szabo was promoted to Ensign in the FANY.

===Second mission===
After two aborted attempts, due to stormy weather on the night of 4/5 June and the abandonment of the intended landing ground on 5/6 June by the Resistance reception committee because of German patrols, Szabo and three colleagues were dropped by parachute from a USAAF Liberator flown from RAF Harrington in Northamptonshire onto a landing field near Sussac on the outskirts of Limoges early on 8 June 1944 (immediately following D-Day, and Tania Szabo&#x27;s second birthday). Szabo was part of a four-person team sent to operate in the department of Haute Vienne with the circuit codename &#x27;Salesman II&#x27;, led by her SOE commander Philippe Liewer (now codenamed Hamlet), whose rolled-up Rouen circuit had been &#x27;Salesman&#x27;, and including Second Lieutenant Jean-Claude Guiet (codenames Claude and Virgile) of the United States Army as wireless operator (W/O), and Bob Maloubier (alias Robert &#x27;Bob&#x27; Mortier; codenames Clothaire and Paco), Szabo and Liewer&#x27;s friend and comrade of SOE who was to act as military instructor to the local Maquis, and who had worked as weapons instructor and explosives officer for Liewer on the original Salesman I circuit. For this mission, Szabo&#x27;s cover was that she was a Mme Villeret, the young widow of an antiques dealer from Nantes. It is possible Szabo had twisted an ankle on landing.

Upon arrival, she was sent to co-ordinate the activities of the local maquis in sabotaging communication lines during German attempts to stem the Normandy landings. When he arrived in the Limousin, Philippe Liewer found the local maquis to be poorly led and less prepared for action than he expected. To better co-ordinate Resistance activity against the Germans, he decided to send his courier, Szabo, as his liaison officer to the more active Maquis of Correze and the Dordogne, led by Jacques Poirier (SOE), head of the renamed Digger circuit, who had taken over from Harry Peulevé of the Author circuit, upon the latter&#x27;s arrest. However, due to poor intelligence gathering by the local Resistance, Liewer was unaware that the 2nd SS Panzer Division was making its slow journey north to the Normandy battlefields through his area.

==Capture and interrogation==
At 9.30 am on 10 June, Szabo set off on her mission, not inconspicuously by bicycle as Liewer would have preferred, but in a Citroen driven by a young maquis section leader, Jacques Dufour (&#x27;Anastasie&#x27;). He had insisted upon using the car, even though the Germans had forbidden the use of cars by the French after D-Day, to drive her half of the of her journey. At her request to Liewer, Szabo was armed with a Sten gun and eight magazines of ammunition. She was dressed in a light suit, flat-heeled shoes and no stockings. On their way across the sunlit fields of south-central France, they picked up Jean Bariaud, a 26-year-old Resistance friend of Dufour, who was meant to accompany them on the return journey.

Their car raised the suspicions of German troops at an unexpected roadblock outside of Salon-la-Tour that had been set up to find Sturmbannführer Helmut Kämpfe, a battalion commander of the 2nd SS Panzer Division, who had been captured by the local resistance. When Dufour slowed the car, the unarmed Bariaud was able to escape and later warn the Salesman team of the arrest of his two companions.

According to Minney and Vickers, when they had stopped, Szabo and Dufour leapt from the car, he to the left and she to the right and the cover of a tree, as Dufour opened fire. A gun battle ensued during which a woman emerging from a barn was killed by the Germans. As armoured cars arrived at the scene, Szabo crossed the road to join Dufour, and they leapt a gate, before running across a field towards a small stream. They then ran up a hill towards some trees, when Szabo fell and severely twisted an ankle. She refused Dufour&#x27;s offer of help, urging him to flee, and, dragging herself to the edge of the cornfield, she struggled to an apple tree. Standing behind the tree, she then provided Dufour with covering fire, allowing him to make his escape to hide in a friend&#x27;s barn. Szabo fought the Germans for thirty minutes, killing a corporal, possibly more, and wounding some others. Eventually, she ran out of ammunition and was captured by two men who dragged her up the hill to a bridge over a railway. She was hot, dishevelled, and in pain. Szabo was questioned by a young officer whose armoured car had drawn up nearby. She was then taken away. Szabo&#x27;s captors were most likely from the 1st Battalion of 3rd SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment Deutschland (&quot;Das Reich&quot; Division) whose commanding officer was the missing Sturmbannführer Kämpfe.

In R.J. Minney&#x27;s biography, as above, she is described as putting up fierce resistance with her Sten gun, although German documents of the incident record no German injuries or casualties. A recent biography of Vera Atkins, the intelligence officer for the French section of SOE, notes that there was a great deal of confusion about what happened to Szabo—the story was revised four times—and states that the Sten gun incident &quot;was probably a fabrication&quot;. Szabo&#x27;s most recent biographer, Susan Ottaway, includes the battle in her book, as does Tania Szabo in hers, and Philip Vickers in his book on &quot;Das Reich&quot;. Authors Sarah Helm and Max Hastings express doubt about the story of the battle.

Violette Szabo was transferred to the custody of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (&quot;SD&quot;, the SS Security Service) in Limoges, where she was interrogated for four days by SS-Sturmbannführer Kowatch. She gave her name as &quot;Vicky Taylor&quot;, the name she had intended to use if she needed to return to England via Spain. (Her reason for choosing this name is unknown, but it may have been a play on &quot;szabo&quot; being the Hungarian word for &quot;tailor&quot;.) From there, she was moved to Fresnes Prison in Paris and brought to Gestapo headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch for interrogation and torture by the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, who by now knew of her true identity and activities as an SOE agent.

==Ravensbrück==
With the Allies driving deep into France and George Patton&#x27;s Third US Army heading towards Paris, the decision was taken by the Germans to send their most valuable French prisoners to Germany. On 8 August 1944, Szabo, shackled to SOE wireless operator Denise Bloch, was entrained with other male and female prisoners, including several SOE agents she knew, for transfer. At some point in the journey, probably outside Chalons-sur-Marne, an Allied air raid caused the guards to temporarily abandon the train, allowing Szabo and Bloch to get water from a lavatory to the caged male prisoners in the next carriage, the two women both providing inspiration and a morale boost to the suffering men. When the train reached Reims, the prisoners were taken by lorries to a large barn for two nights, where Szabo, still tied at the ankle to Bloch, who was in good spirits, was able to wash some of her clothes in a rudimentary fashion and to speak about her experiences to her SOE colleague Harry Peulevé.

From Reims, via Strasbourg, the prisoners went by train to Saarbrücken and a transit camp in the suburb of Neue Bremm, where hygiene facilities were nonexistent, and food was only indigestible bread crusts. After about ten days, Szabo and most of the other women were sent on to Ravensbrück concentration camp for women where 50,000 (out of a total population of 130,000) were to die during the war. They reached Ravensbrück in late August 1944. 

Although she endured hard labour and malnutrition, she helped save the life of Belgian resistance courier Hortense Daman, kept up the spirits of her fellow detainees, and, according to fellow inmate American Virginia d&#x27;Albert-Lake, constantly planned to escape. While at Ravensbrück, Szabo, Denise Bloch, Lilian Rolfe and Lake were among 1,000 French women sent to the Heinkel factory at the sub-camp of Torgau. Here they protested and refused to make munitions, and were forced to work in the vegetable cellar outside the camp walls and then to dig potatoes. The British women also made contact with French prisoners at a nearby POW camp who, being better fed, provided them with extra rations and offered to send messages to London with a transmitter they had built (there is no evidence they were successful).

After the Torgau incident, Szabo, Bloch, Rolfe and Lake were part of a group of around 250 prisoners sent back to Ravensbrück on 6 October, where Szabo was put to work in the fabric store. In late October 1944, the protest women were transferred to a punishment camp at Königsberg, where they were forced into harsh physical labour felling trees, clearing rock-hard icy ground for the construction of an airfield and digging a trench for a narrow-gauge railway. Szabo volunteered for tree-felling in the forest, where the trees gave some shelter from the bitter winds (Lilian and Denise were too ill to join her). In the bitter East Prussian winter of 1944, each day the women were forced to stand for &quot;Appell&quot; (roll-call) in the early morning for up to five hours before being sent to work, many of them freezing to death. Szabo was dressed only in the summer clothes she had been wearing when sent to Germany and the women received barely any food and slept in frozen barracks without blankets. According to Christine Le Scornet, a seventeen-year-old French girl whom Szabo befriended, and Jeannie Rousseau, the co-leader of the Torgau revolt, she maintained her morale, was optimistic about liberation and continued to plan to escape. On 19 or 20 January 1945, the three British agents were recalled to Ravensbrück and sent first to the &quot;Strafblock&quot;, where they were possibly brutally assaulted and then to the punishment bunker, where they were kept in solitary confinement. The women were already in poor physical condition—Rolfe could barely walk—and the abuse finally weakened Szabo&#x27;s morale.

===Execution===
Szabo was killed in the execution alley at Ravensbrück, aged 23, on or before 5 February 1945. She was shot in the back of the head while kneeling down, by SS-Rottenführer Schult in the presence of camp commandant Fritz Suhren (who pronounced the death penalty), camp overseer and deputy commandant Johann Schwarzhuber, SS-Scharführer Zappe, SS-Rottenführer Walter Schenk (responsible for the crematorium), chief camp doctor Dr. Richard Trommer and dentist Dr. Martin Hellinger, from the deposition of Schwarzhuber recorded by Vera Atkins 13 March 1946. Denise Bloch and Lilian Rolfe – neither of whom could walk and were carried on stretchers – were shot at the same time, by order of the highest Nazi authorities; the bodies were disposed of in the camp crematorium. Their clothes were not returned to the camp &quot;Effektenkammer&quot; (property store) as usually happened after executions.

===Comparisons===
Along with Szabo, Bloch, and Rolfe, one other member of the SOE was also executed at Ravensbrück: Cecily Lefort. She was killed in the gas chamber sometime in February 1945. 

Forty-one female Section F SOE agents served in France, some for more than two years, most for only a few months. Twenty-six of them survived World War II. Twelve were executed including Szabo, one was killed when her ship was sunk, two died of disease while imprisoned, and one died of natural causes. Female agents ranged in age from 20 to 53 years.

==Awards and honours==
Szabo was the second woman to be awarded the George Cross, bestowed posthumously on 17 December 1946. The citation was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and read:

The &quot;croix de guerre avec étoile de bronze&quot; was awarded by the French government in 1947 and the Médaille de la Résistance in 1973. As one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France, Lieutenant Violette Szabo, FANY, is listed on the Valençay SOE Memorial.

Both Violette and Étienne Szabo were awarded the French Croix de Guerre for their bravery in the field. On 28 January 1947 their four-year-old daughter Tania was presented with Violette&#x27;s George Cross (gazetted on 17 December 1946) from King George VI on behalf of her late mother. Violette and Étienne Szabo are believed to be the most decorated married couple of the Second World War.

On 22 July 2015, Violette Szabo&#x27;s medals and numerous associated items were sold at auction, realising £260,000 (£312,000 including buyer&#x27;s premium). The purchaser was Lord Ashcroft, who placed the George Cross on permanent display at the Imperial War Museum from 7 October 2015.

==Museums and memorials==
Szabo has no known grave. Her official point of commemoration is the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Brookwood 1939–1945 Memorial to the Missing in Brookwood Military Cemetery, Surrey. She is named on panel 26. column 3.

The Violette Szabo GC Museum is housed in the cottage in Wormelow Tump, Herefordshire, that Violette&#x27;s English cousins formerly owned, and that Violette would visit before the war to enjoy walks in the surrounding hills. She also stayed at the farm while she was recuperating from her ankle injury and between her two missions to France. Tania Szabo attended the museum&#x27;s opening in 2000, as did Virginia McKenna, Leo Marks and members of SOE.

The Jersey War Tunnels have a permanent exhibition room dedicated to Szabo.

The Royal College of Music offers an annual award called the Violette Szabo GC Memorial Prize for pianists who accompany singers.

There is a mural dedicated to Szabo in Stockwell, South London, painted in 2001: Stockwell War Memorial, Stockwell Road. Painted on the exterior of the entrance to a deep level shelter, this mural was executed by Brian Barnes (with the assistance of children from Stockwell Park School). It features Stockwell&#x27;s famous people such as Szabo and Vincent Van Gogh. It also commemorates the local people who gave their life in the war.

In 2008, a bronze bust of Szabo by sculptor Karen Newman was unveiled at the Albert Embankment of the River Thames, in front of Lambeth Palace.
At the entrance to Lambeth Town Hall there is a plaque commemorating Szabo&#x27;s residence in that borough.

There is a memorial to Szabo in Le Clos, close to where the Salesman II team landed on 8 June 1944. She is named on the SOE memorial at Valençay to the agents of F Section who gave their lives for the liberation of France, and also on the memorial to the SOE agents who flew from England but did not return at RAF Tempsford.

There is also a memorial to Szabo at the entrance to the rugby field in the village of Salon-la-Tour, where she was captured.

Szabo&#x27;s daughter, Tania Szabo, wrote a reconstruction of her two 1944 missions in France with flashbacks to her growing up. Author Jack Higgins wrote the foreword and US-French radio-operator, Jean-Claude Guiet, who had accompanied her on the mission in the Limousin, wrote the introduction. On 15 November 2007, at the launch of the book, &quot;Young Brave and Beautiful: The Missions of Special Operations Executive Agent Lieutenant Violette Szabo&quot; (), at the Jersey War Tunnels, the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey said of her, &quot;She&#x27;s an inspiration to those young people today doing the same work with the risk of the same dangers&quot;. Odette Churchill GC said, &quot;She was the bravest of us all.&quot;

Szabo&#x27;s wartime activities in German-occupied France were dramatised in the film &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot;, starring Virginia McKenna and based on the 1956 book of the same name by R. J. Minney.

The 2009 video game &quot;Velvet Assassin&quot; by Replay Studios is inspired by Szabo&#x27;s life as an allied spy during the Second World War, with the protagonist sharing her first name.

The 2018 ten minute short play, &quot;The Life That I Have&quot;, developed for the 365 Days of Women by playwright Libby Mitchell, is inspired by Szabo&#x27;s last moments and her time in Ravensbrück. It also includes the heroines Vera Atkins, Denise Bloch, and Lilian Rolfe.

In June 2018, her daughter Tania was interviewed about her mother for the Pioneering Women Special airing on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, Series 41.

<text>In aviation, visual flight rules (VFR) is a set of regulations under which a pilot operates an aircraft in weather conditions generally clear enough to allow the pilot to see where the aircraft is going. Specifically, the weather must be better than basic VFR weather minima, i.e., in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), as specified in the rules of the relevant aviation authority. The pilot must be able to operate the aircraft with visual reference to the ground, and by visually avoiding obstructions and other aircraft.

If the weather is less than VMC, pilots are required to use instrument flight rules, and operation of the aircraft will be primarily through referencing the instruments rather than visual reference. In a control zone, a VFR flight may obtain a clearance from air traffic control to operate as Special VFR.

== Requirements ==

VFR requires a pilot to be able to see outside the cockpit to control the aircraft&#x27;s altitude, navigate, and avoid obstacles and other aircraft. Governing agencies establish specific requirements for VFR flight, including minimum visibility, and distance from clouds, to ensure that aircraft operating under VFR are visible from enough distance to ensure safety.

Under visual meteorological conditions, the minimum visual range, distance from clouds, or cloud clearance requirements to be maintained above ground vary by jurisdiction, and may also vary according to the airspace in which the aircraft is operating.

In some countries, VFR flight is permitted at night, and is known as night VFR. This is generally permitted only under more restrictive conditions, such as maintaining minimum safe altitudes, and may require additional training as a pilot at night may not be able to see and avoid obstacles.

The VFR pilot is required to &quot;see and avoid&quot; obstacles and other aircraft. Pilots flying under VFR assume responsibility for their separation from all other aircraft and are generally not assigned routes or altitudes by air traffic control (ATC). Depending on the category of airspace in which the flight is being conducted, VFR aircraft may be required to have a transponder to help Air Traffic Control identify the aircraft on radar in order that ATC can provide separation from IFR aircraft.

Meteorological conditions that meet the minimum requirements for VFR flight are termed visual meteorological conditions (VMC). If they are not met, the conditions are considered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), and a flight may only operate under IFR. IFR operations have specific training requirements and certification required of the pilot, and increased equipment requirements for the aircraft. Additionally, an IFR flight plan must usually be filed in advance. 

For efficiency of operations, some ATC operations will routinely provide &quot;pop-up&quot; IFR clearances for aircraft operating VFR, but that are arriving at an airport that does not meet VMC requirements. For example, in the United States, California&#x27;s Oakland (KOAK), Monterey (KMRY) and Santa Ana (KSNA) airports routinely grant temporary IFR clearance when a low coastal overcast forces instrument approaches, while the rest of the state is still under visual flight rules. 

For pilots without an instrument rating who cannot legally fly by instrument flight rules, the restrictions of VMC minima can be troublesome in locations where weather conditions can change suddenly and unexpectedly or when weather events are highly localized. For instance, a small cloud forming over the airport at less than 1000 feet technically requires the airport to allow only IFR flights using instrument approaches/departures. A VFR flight intending to land there would normally be denied clearance, and would either have to divert to another field with VMC, or declare an emergency and override the denial of clearance, which can prompt an inquiry and possibly result in adverse consequences for the pilot.

To avoid these scenarios, VFR flights intending to land at or take off from an airport experiencing localized conditions marginally below VMC minima may request Special VFR clearance from the tower. SVFR flight is only allowed while within the portion of an airport&#x27;s controlled airspace (class B, C, or D) that extends to the surface, and it must be explicitly requested by the pilot and granted by the tower (some airports, primarily large Class B facilities, do not allow SVFR operation in their airspace at all). Visibility on the ground must still be greater than one statute mile, but most other VMC minima such as ceiling are waived. The pilot is required to maintain VFR separation distances from other aircraft and, by requesting SVFR, asserts that they can do so despite the marginal conditions. For departing flights, the pilot must be flying in VMC by the time they leave the surface footprint of the controlled airspace (otherwise they would be flying VFR in IMC which is illegal).

VFR flight is not allowed in airspace known as &quot;class A&quot;, regardless of the meteorological conditions except after failure of two way radio communications or during declared emergencies such as VFR traffic attempting to avoid severe weather formations. In the United States, class A airspace is measured using flight levels, and begins at FL180 up to FL600, which is about 18,000 to 60,000 feet as measured using an altimeter at standard pressure (29.92 inHg, 1013 mbar). An exception to IFR-only flying in this airspace is the occasional allowance of sailplanes within designated &quot;wave windows&quot; which may be opened by air traffic control when high altitude flights are to be conducted into mountain lee waves. 

== Traffic advisories ==
In the United States, Canada, and Australia, a pilot operating under VFR outside Class B, C, D airspace can request &quot;flight following&quot; from ATC, to receive continuous verbal updates on air traffic. This service is provided by ATC if workload permits, but it is an advisory service only. The responsibility for maintaining separation with other aircraft and proper navigation still remains with the pilot in command (PIC). In the United Kingdom, this is known as a &quot;Traffic Service&quot;. In other countries, it is known as &quot;Flight Information Service&quot;.

== Pilot certifications ==
In the United States and Canada, any certified pilot who meets specific recency of experience criteria may operate an airworthy aircraft under VFR.

== VFR cruising altitude rules in the US and Canada ==
In the US, there are specific VFR cruising altitudes, based on the aircraft&#x27;s course, to assist pilots in separating their aircraft while operating under visual flight above 3,000 ft above the surface (AGL) but below 18,000 ft Mean Sea Level (MSL). Unofficially, most pilots use these rules at all levels of cruise flight. FAR 91.159 states that any aircraft:
* On a magnetic course of 0-179 degrees shall fly at an odd thousand ft MSL altitude +500 feet (e.g., 3,500, 5,500, or 7,500 ft); or
* On a magnetic course of 180-359 degrees shall fly at an even thousand ft MSL altitude +500 feet (e.g., 4,500, 6,500, or 8,500 ft).

== Low flying rules in the US ==
In the US, FAR Part 91 (specifically 91.119) of the Federal Aviation Regulations controls the minimum safe altitudes by which aircraft can be operated in the National Airspace System.

;&quot;Notwithstanding&quot; rule
:Though specific altitudes are called as noted below - there is an overreaching general requirement to maintain sufficient altitude that if a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface can be made. This may be significantly higher than 500 feet or 1,000 feet.

;500 ft rule
:An aircraft must maintain an altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.

;1000 ft rule
:An aircraft must maintain an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons.

Other aircraft, such as helicopters, powered parachutes, and weight-shift-control aircraft, are not required to meet the FAR 91 minimums, so long as their operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.

== Low flying rules in the EU==

In all EU member states, the Standardised European Rules of the Air apply: these set out a minimum altitude of 150 m (500 ft) above any obstacle within a radius of 150 m (500 ft), except with permission, or when taking off or landing. If an aircraft is flying over a congested area (town, settlement, etc.) it must fly high enough so that in the case of an engine failure, it is able to land clear safely &quot;AND&quot; it must not fly less than 300 m (1000 ft) above the highest fixed object within 600 m of the aircraft.

Member states are allowed to modify the low flying rule to suit their jurisdiction, for instance in the UK, the &quot;500 ft Rule&quot; allows pilots to fly below 500 ft as long as they are no closer than 500 ft to any person, vessel, vehicle, building or structure. 
The rules for flying near congested areas are the same in the UK as the rest of the EU

== Controlled visual flight rules ==

CVFR flight is used in locations where aviation authorities have determined that VFR flight should be allowed, but that ATC separation and minimal guidance are necessary. In this respect, CVFR is similar to instrument flight rules (IFR) in that ATC will give pilots headings and altitudes at which to fly, and will provide separation and conflict resolution. However, pilots and aircraft do not need to be IFR rated to fly in CVFR areas, which is highly advantageous. An example of airspace where CVFR is common would be &quot;Canadian Class B&quot; airspace.

The CVFR concept is used in Canada and certain European countries, but not in the U.S., where the Private Pilot certificate itself authorizes the pilot to accept clearances under VFR.

In Israel, for example, VFR does not exist. All visual flights must be performed under CVFR rules.

<doc id="32699" wikidata="Q163800" url="?curid=32699" title="Veit Stoss">
<text>Veit Stoss (, also spelled Stoß and Stuoss; ; ; before 1450about 20 September 1533) was a leading German sculptor, mostly working with wood, whose career covered the transition between the late Gothic and the Northern Renaissance. His style emphasized pathos and emotion, helped by his virtuoso carving of billowing drapery; it has been called &quot;late Gothic Baroque&quot;. He had a large workshop, and in addition to his own works there are a number by pupils. He is best known for the altarpiece in St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica in Kraków, Poland.

==Life==
According to the contracts and other official documents written in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Stoss was born in a place pronounced as Horb or Horbn. Most researchers identify this place with Horb am Neckar near Stuttgart in Germany. However, there are artistic traces indicating that Stoss&#x27;s early education could have taken place in the modern Switzerland. Moreover, his brother was certainly born in Aarau in northern Switzerland, which suggests that the artist&#x27;s family lived in the region and that Stoss was rather born in the town of Horben, located 30 km southeast of Aarau
His exact date of birth is unknown though it must have been shortly before 1450. Nothing about his life is known for certain before 1473 when he moved to Nuremberg in Franconia and married Barbara Hertz. Their eldest son Andreas was born there before 1477, when Stoss moved to Kraków, the royal capital of Poland, where he was commissioned to produce the enormous polychrome wooden Altar of Veit Stoss (Ołtarz Wita Stwosza) at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Kraków. His son Stanisław who was born in Kraków the next year was also a sculptor.

==In Kraków==
Veit lived and worked in Kraków for almost twenty years, from 1477–1496. His name is usually polonized as Wit Stwosz. The altar in Kraków was completed in 1489, and was the largest triptych of its time. Like Stoss&#x27; other large works, it required a large workshop including specialized painters and gilders. Other important works from Stoss&#x27; period in Poland were the tomb of Casimir IV in Wawel Cathedral, the marble tomb of Zbigniew Oleśnicki in Gniezno, and the altar of Saint Stanislaus. The Polish court was more aware of Italian styles than Nuremberg patrons of that time, and some of Stoss&#x27; Polish work used Renaissance classical ornament.

During World War II, on the order of Hans Frankthe Governor-General of that region of occupied Polandthe dismantled Altar was shipped to Nazi Germany around 1941. It was rediscovered in 1945 in Bavaria, hidden in the basement of the heavily bombed Nuremberg Castle. The High Altar underwent major restoration work in Poland and was put back in its place at the Basilica ten years later.

==Nuremberg==
In 1496, Stoss returned to Nuremberg with his wife and eight children. He reacquired his citizenship for three gulden and resumed his work there as a sculptor. Between 1500 and 1503 he carved an altar, now lost, for the parish church of Schwaz, Tyrol of the &quot;Assumption of Mary&quot;. In 1503, he was arrested for forging the seal and signature of a fraudulent contractor and was sentenced to be branded on both of his cheeks and prohibited from leaving Nuremberg without the explicit permission of the city council. He was pardoned in 1506 by Emperor Maximilian and his civil rights reinstated.

Despite the prohibition he went to Münnerstadt in 1504, to paint and gild the altarpiece that Tilman Riemenschneider had left in plain wood ten years earlier, presumably according to his contract (unlike Stoss, his workshop did not include painters and gilders). Leaving wood sculpture unpainted was a new taste at the time, and &quot;perhaps the tastes of the city council were somewhat provincial.&quot; He also created the altar for Bamberg Cathedral and various other sculptures in Nuremberg, including the &quot;Annunciation&quot; and &quot;Tobias and the Angel&quot;. In 1506 he was arrested a second time. In 1507, Emperor Maximilian wrote a letter of pardon. The sole argument was made on the account of his genius. The council of the Imperial free city Nuremberg refused to give him a public notice. But Maximilian&#x27;s intervention saved him from the dungeons and having his hands chopped off. He was able to resettle in Nuremberg from 1506, but was shunned by the council and received few large commissions from that time onwards. In 1512, the Emperor asked Stoss to help with the planning of his tomb monument, which was eventually placed in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck; it seems Stoss&#x27;s attempts to cast in brass were unsuccessful.

During the period 1515–1520, Veit Stoss received a commission for sculptures by Raffaele Torrigiani, a rich Florentine merchant. In 1516 he made &quot;Tobias and the Angel&quot; (now in Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg), and a statue of Saint Roch for the Basilica of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. This wooden statue represents the saint in a traditional way: in the garb of a pilgrim, lifting his tunic to demonstrate the plague sore in his thigh. Even Giorgio Vasari, who did not think much of artists north of the Alps, praised it in his &quot;Le Vite&quot; and called it &quot;a miracle in wood&quot;, though misattributing it.

Veit Stoss was buried at St. Johannis cemetery in Nuremberg. His artistic legacy was continued by his son Stanisław.

==In popular culture==
Veit Stoss is featured in Judith Weir&#x27;s opera, &quot;The Black Spider&quot;. He is one of the singing sculptors in Act 3 Scene 2 inside the Wawel Cathedral. He is shown chiseling at the tomb of King Casimir IV.
There is a Polish book (1913) and film (1961) &quot;Historia żółtej ciżemki&quot; (&quot;The story of a yellow crakow&quot;) about Veit Stoss in Cracow.

<doc id="32700" wikidata="Q210510" url="?curid=32700" title="Volcanic explosivity index">
<text>The volcanic explosivity index (VEI) is a scale used to measure the size of explosive volcanic eruptions. It was devised by Christopher G. Newhall of the United States Geological Survey and Stephen Self in 1982.

Volume of products, eruption cloud height, and qualitative observations (using terms ranging from &quot;gentle&quot; to &quot;mega-colossal&quot;) are used to determine the explosivity value. The scale is open-ended with the largest eruptions in history given a magnitude of 8. A value of 0 is given for non-explosive eruptions, defined as less than of tephra ejected; and 8 representing a supervolcanic eruption that can eject (240 cubic miles) of tephra and have a cloud column height of over . The scale is logarithmic, with each interval on the scale representing a tenfold increase in observed ejecta criteria, with the exception of between VEI-0, VEI-1 and VEI-2.

==Classification==
With indices running from 0 to 8, the VEI associated with an eruption is dependent on how much volcanic material is thrown out, to what height, and how long the eruption lasts. The scale is logarithmic from VEI-2 and up; an increase of 1 index indicates an eruption that is 10 times as powerful. As such, there is a discontinuity in the definition of the VEI between indices 1 and 2. The lower border of the volume of ejecta jumps by a factor of one hundred, from , while the factor is ten between all higher indices. In the following table, the frequency of each VEI indicates the approximate frequency of new eruptions of that VEI or higher.


About 40 eruptions of VEI-8 magnitude within the last 132 million years (Mya) have been identified, of which 30 occurred in the past 36 million years. Considering the estimated frequency is on the order of once in 50,000 years, there are likely many such eruptions in the last 132 Mya that are not yet known. Based on incomplete statistics, other authors assume that at least 60 VEI-8 eruptions have been identified. The most recent is Lake Taupō&#x27;s Oruanui eruption, more than 27,000 years ago, which means that there have not been any Holocene eruptions with a VEI of 8.

There have been at least 10 eruptions of VEI-7 in the last 11,700 years. There are also 58 Plinian eruptions, and 13 caldera-forming eruptions, of large, but unknown magnitudes. By 2010, the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution had cataloged the assignment of a VEI for 7,742 volcanic eruptions that occurred during the Holocene (the last 11,700 years) which account for about 75% of the total known eruptions during the Holocene. Of these 7,742 eruptions, about 49% have a VEI of 2 or lower, and 90% have a VEI of 3 or lower.

==Limitations==
Under the VEI, ash, lava, lava bombs, and ignimbrite are all treated alike. Density and vesicularity (gas bubbling) of the volcanic products in question is not taken into account. In contrast, the DRE (dense-rock equivalent) is sometimes calculated to give the actual amount of magma erupted. Another weakness of the VEI is that it does not take into account the power output of an eruption, which makes the VEI extremely difficult to determine with prehistoric or unobserved eruptions.

Although VEI is quite suitable for classifying the explosive magnitude of eruptions, the index is not as significant as sulfur dioxide emissions in quantifying their atmospheric and climatic impact.

<doc id="32703" wikidata="Q621" url="?curid=32703" title="Versailles, Yvelines">
<text>Versailles ( ; ) is a commune in the department of the Yvelines, Île-de-France, known worldwide for the Château de Versailles and the gardens of Versailles, designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Located in the western suburbs of the French capital, from the centre of Paris, Versailles is a wealthy suburb of Paris with a service-based economy and is a major tourist destination. According to the 2017 census, the population of the city is 85,862 inhabitants, down from a peak of 94,145 in 1975.

A new town founded at the will of King Louis XIV, Versailles was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Kingdom of France for over a century, from 1682 to 1789, before becoming the cradle of the French Revolution. After having lost its status as a royal city, it became the &quot;préfecture&quot; (regional capital) of the Seine-et-Oise département in 1790, then of Yvelines in 1968. It is also a Roman Catholic diocese.

Versailles is historically known for numerous treaties such as the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolution, and the Treaty of Versailles, after World War I. Today, the Congress of France – the name given to the body created when both houses of the French Parliament, the National Assembly and the Senate, meet – gathers in the Château de Versailles to vote on revisions to the Constitution.

==Name==
The argument over the etymology of &quot;Versailles&quot; tends to privilege the Latin word &quot;versare&quot;, meaning &quot;to keep turning, turn over and over&quot;, an expression used in medieval times for ploughed lands, cleared lands (lands that had been repeatedly &quot;turned over&quot;). This word formation is similar to Latin &quot;seminare&quot; (&quot;to sow&quot;) which gave French &quot;semailles&quot; (&quot;sowings&quot;, &quot;sown seeds&quot;).

During the Revolution of 1789, city officials had proposed to the convention to rename Versailles &quot;Berceau-de-la-Liberté&quot; (&quot;Cradle of Liberty&quot;), but they had to retract their proposal when confronted with the objections of the majority of the population.

==A seat of power==

From May 1682, when Louis XIV moved the court and government permanently to Versailles, until his death in September 1715, Versailles was the unofficial capital of the kingdom of France. For the next seven years, during the &quot;Régence&quot; of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, the royal court of the young King Louis XV was the first in Paris, while the Regent governed from his Parisian residence, the Palais-Royal. Versailles was again the unofficial capital of France from June 1722, when Louis XV returned to Versailles, until October 1789, when a Parisian mob forced Louis XVI and the royal family to move to Paris. Versailles again became the unofficial capital of France from March 1871, when Adolphe Thiers&#x27; government took refuge in Versailles, fleeing the insurrection of the Paris Commune, until November 1879, when the newly elected government and parliament returned to Paris. During the various periods when government affairs were conducted from Versailles, Paris remained the official capital of France.

Versailles was made the &quot;préfecture&quot; of the Seine-et-Oise &quot;département&quot; at its inception in March 1790 (at which time Seine-et-Oise had approximately 420,000 inhabitants). By the 1960s, with the growth of the Paris suburbs, the &quot;Seine-et-Oise&quot; had reached more than 2 million inhabitants, and was deemed too large and ungovernable, and thus it was split into three &quot;départements&quot; in January 1968. Versailles was made the &quot;préfecture&quot; of the Yvelines &quot;département&quot;, the largest chunk of the former &quot;Seine-et-Oise&quot;. At the 2017 census the &quot;Yvelines&quot; had 1,438,266 inhabitants.

The Hôtel de Ville has been the meeting place of the town council since 1900.

Versailles is the seat of a Roman Catholic diocese (bishopric) which was created in 1790. The diocese of Versailles is subordinate to the archdiocese of Paris.

In 1975, Versailles was made the seat of a Court of Appeal whose jurisdiction covers the western suburbs of Paris.

Since 1972, Versailles has been the seat of one of France&#x27;s 30 nationwide &quot;académies&quot; (districts) of the Ministry of National Education. The &quot;académie de Versailles&quot;, the largest of France&#x27;s thirty &quot;académies&quot; by its number of pupils and students, is in charge of supervising all the elementary schools and high schools of the western suburbs of Paris.

Versailles is also an important node for the French army, a tradition going back to the monarchy with, for instance, the military camp of Satory and other institutions.

==Geography==
Versailles is located west-southwest from the centre of Paris. The city sits on an elevated plateau, above sea level (whereas the elevation of the centre of Paris is only above sea level), surrounded by wooded hills: in the north the forests of &quot;Marly&quot; and Fausses-Reposes, and in the south the forests of Satory and Meudon.

The city (commune) of Versailles has an area of , which is a quarter of the area of the city of Paris. In 1989, Versailles had a population density of , whereas Paris had a density of .

Born out of the will of a king, the city has a rational and symmetrical grid of streets. By the standards of the 18th century, Versailles was a very modern European city. Versailles was used as a model for the building of Washington, D.C., by Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant.

==Climate==
Versailles has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between , and a fair amount of sunshine. in the winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around . Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below . Snow falls every year, but rarely stays on the ground. The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.

==History==
The name of Versailles appears for the first time in a medieval document dated 1038. In the feudal system of medieval France, the lords of Versailles came directly under the king of France, with no intermediary overlords between them and the king; yet they were not very important lords. At the end of the 11th century, the village curled around a medieval castle and the Saint Julien church. Its farming activity and its location on the road from Paris to Dreux and Normandy brought prosperity to the village, culminating at the end of the 13th century, the so-called &quot;century of Saint Louis&quot;, famous for the prosperity of northern France and the building of Gothic cathedrals. The 14th century brought the Black Death and the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and with it death and destruction. At the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War in the 15th century, the village started to recover, with a population of only 100 inhabitants.

In 1561, Martial de Loménie, secretary of state for finances under King Charles IX, became lord of Versailles. He obtained permission to establish four annual fairs and a weekly market on Thursdays. The population of Versailles was 500 inhabitants. Martial de Loménie was murdered during the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre (24 August 1572). In 1575, Albert de Gondi, a man from Florence who had come to France with Catherine de&#x27; Medici, bought the seigneury of Versailles.

===Louis XIII===

Henceforth Versailles was the possession of the Gondi family, a family of wealthy and influential parliamentarians at the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris. Several times during the 1610s, the de Gondis invited King Louis XIII to hunt in the large forests around Versailles. In 1622, the king purchased a parcel of forest for his private hunting. In 1624, he acquired more and entrusted Philibert Le Roy with the construction of a small hunting lodge of red bricks and stone with a slate roof. In 1632, the king bought the totality of the land and seigneury of Versailles from Jean-François de Gondi. The hunting lodge was enlarged to the size of a small château between 1632 and 1634.

At the death of Louis XIII, in 1643, the village had 1,000 inhabitants.

This small château was the site of one of the historical events that took place during the reign of Louis XIII, on 10 November 1630, when, on the Day of the Dupes, the party of the queen mother was defeated and Richelieu was confirmed as Prime minister.

===Louis XIV===
King Louis XIV, son of Louis XIII, was only four years old when his father died. It was 20 years later, in 1661, when Louis XIV commenced his personal reign, that the young king showed interest in Versailles. The idea of leaving Paris, where, as a child, he had experienced first-hand the insurrection of the Fronde, had never left him. Louis XIV commissioned his architect Le Vau and his landscape architect Le Nôtre to transform the castle of his father, as well as the park, in order to accommodate the court. In 1678, after the Treaty of Nijmegen, the king decided that the court and the government would be established permanently in Versailles, which happened on 6 May 1682.

At the same time, a new city was emerging from the ground, resulting from an ingenious decree of the king dated 22 May 1671, whereby the king authorized anyone to acquire a lot in the new city for free. There were only two conditions to acquire a lot: 1- a token tax of 5 shillings (&quot;5 sols&quot;) per arpent of land should be paid every year ($0.03 per per year in 2005 US dollars); 2- a house should be built on the lot according to the plans and models established by the &quot;Surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi&quot; (architect in chief of the royal demesne). The plans provided for a city built symmetrically with respect to the &quot;Avenue de Paris&quot; (which starts from the entrance of the castle). The roofs of the buildings and houses of the new city were not to exceed the level of the Marble Courtyard, at the entrance of the castle (built above a hill dominating the city), so that the perspective from the windows of the castle would not be obstructed.

The old village and the Saint Julien church were demolished to make room for buildings housing the administrative services managing the daily life in the castle. On both sides of the &quot;Avenue de Paris&quot; were built the Notre-Dame neighbourhood and the Saint-Louis neighbourhood, with new large churches, markets, and aristocratic mansions, all built in a very homogeneous style according to the models established by the &quot;Surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi&quot;. Versailles was a vast construction site for many years. Little by little came to Versailles all those who needed or desired to live close to the maximum power. At the death of the Sun King in 1715, the village of Versailles had turned into a city of approximately 30,000 inhabitants.

===Louis XV and Louis XVI===
When the court of King Louis XV returned to Versailles in 1722, the city had 24,000 inhabitants. With the reign of Louis XV, Versailles grew even further. Versailles was the capital of the most powerful kingdom in Europe, and the whole of Europe admired its new architecture and design trends. Soon enough, the strict building rules decided under Louis XIV were not respected anymore, real estate speculation flourished, and the lots that had been given for free under Louis XIV were now on the market for hefty prices. By 1744, the population reached 37,000 inhabitants. The cityscape changed considerably under kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. Buildings were now taller. King Louis XV built a Ministry of War, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (where the Treaty of Paris (1783) ending the American Revolutionary War was signed in 1783 with the United Kingdom), and a Ministry of the Navy. By 1789, the population had reached 60,000 inhabitants, and Versailles was now the seventh or eighth-largest city in France, and one of the largest cities in Europe.

===French Revolution===
Seat of political power, Versailles naturally became the cradle of the French Revolution. The Estates-General met in Versailles on 5 May 1789. The members of the Third Estate took the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789, and the National Constituent Assembly abolished feudalism on 4 August 1789. Eventually, on 5 and 6 October 1789, a crowd of women joined by some members of the national guard from Paris invaded the castle to protest bread prices and forced the royal family to move to Paris. The National Constituent Assembly followed the king to Paris soon afterwards, and Versailles lost its role as capital city. During this turbulent time, Jean-François Coste, who had also been the chief physician of the King&#x27;s Armies, was appointed mayor of Versailles.

From then on, Versailles lost a good deal of its inhabitants. From 60,000, the population had declined to 26,974 inhabitants by 1806. The castle, stripped of its furniture and ornaments during the Revolution, was left abandoned, with only Napoleon briefly staying one night there and then leaving the castle for good. Louis-Philippe, who took the throne in the July Revolution of 1830, transformed the palace into a National Museum dedicated to &quot;all the glories of France&quot; in 1837. Versailles had become a sleepy town, a place of pilgrimage for those nostalgic for the old monarchy.

===19th century to the present day===
The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 put Versailles in the limelight again. On 18 January 1871, the victorious Germans proclaimed the king of Prussia, Wilhelm I, emperor of Germany in the very Hall of Mirrors of the castle, in an attempt to take revenge for the conquests of Louis XIV two centuries earlier. Then in March of the same year, following the insurrection of the Paris Commune, the French Third Republic government under Thiers relocated to Versailles, and from there directed the military suppression of the insurrection.

Restoration of a monarchy almost occurred in 1873, with parliament offering the crown to Henri, comte de Chambord, but his refusal to accept the tricolour flag that had been adopted during the Revolution made the restoration of monarchy impossible for the time being. Versailles became again the political centre of France, full of buzz and rumours, with its population briefly peaking at 61,686 in 1872, matching the record level of population reached on the eve of the French Revolution 83 years earlier. Eventually, however, left-wing republicans won a string of parliamentary elections, defeating the parties supporting a restoration of the monarchy, and the new majority decided to relocate the government to Paris in November 1879. Versailles then experienced a new population setback (48,324 inhabitants at the 1881 census). After that, Versailles never again functioned as the seat of the capital of France, but the presence of the French Parliament there in the 1870s left a vast hall, built in one aisle of the palace, which the French Parliament uses when it meets in Congress to amend the French Constitution, as well as when the President of France addresses the two chambers of the French Parliament.
Only in 1911 did Versailles definitely recover its level of population of 1789, with 60,458 inhabitants at the 1911 census. In 1919, at the end of the First World War, Versailles came into the limelight again as the various treaties ending the war were signed in the castle proper and in the Grand Trianon. After 1919, as the suburbs of Paris continued to expand, Versailles was absorbed by the urban area of Paris and the city experienced a strong demographic and economic growth, turning it into a large suburban city of the metropolitan area of Paris. The role of Versailles as an administrative and judicial centre has been reinforced in the 1960s and 1970s, and somehow Versailles has become the main centre of the western suburbs of Paris.

In the present times, the centre of the town has kept its very bourgeois atmosphere, while more middle-class neighbourhoods have developed around the train stations and on the outskirts of the city. Versailles is a chic suburb of Paris, well linked with the centre of Paris by several train lines. However, the city is extremely compartmentalized, divided by large avenues inherited from the monarchy which create the impression of several small cities ignoring each other. Versailles was never an industrial city, even though there are a few chemical and food-processing plants. Essentially, Versailles is a place of services, such as public administration, tourism, business congresses, and festivals. From 1951 until France&#x27;s withdrawal from the NATO unified command in 1966, nearby Rocquencourt functioned as the site for SHAPE. Versailles is an important military centre, with several units and training schools headquartered at the Satory military base, which hosted the headquarters of the famed 2nd French Armored Division until 1999, and where a military exhibition is organized annually.

==Culture==
Versailles&#x27; primary cultural attraction is the Palace, with its ornately decorated rooms and historic significance. The Potager du roi is a kitchen garden created under Louis XIV to supply fruits and vegetables to the Court. It is officially recognized as a Remarkable Garden of France.

The town also has other points of cultural notability; in recent times, its position as an affluent suburb of Paris has meant that it forms a part of the Paris artistic scene, and musical groups such as Phoenix, Air, Fuzati, and Daft Punk have some link to the city, as does the director Michel Gondry.

==Sport==
Football Club de Versailles 78 is a semi-professional association football club founded in 1989. Their home stadium is the Stade de Montbauron, which has a capacity of 6,208 people.

==Population==
===Immigration===
== Education ==
The headquarters of the Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University is located in the city, as well as the ISIPCA, a post-graduate school in perfume, cosmetics products and food flavour formulation.

==Transport==

Versailles is served by Versailles-Chantiers station, which is an interchange station on Paris RER line C, on the Transilien La Défense suburban rail line, on the Transilien Paris-Montparnasse suburban rail line, and on several national rail lines, including low-frequency TGV service.

Versailles is also served by two other stations on Paris RER line C: Versailles-Château–Rive Gauche (the closest station to the Palace of Versailles and consequently the station most frequently used by tourists) and Porchefontaine.

Versailles is also served by two stations on the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail line: and .

<text>Vancouver is a major city in Western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. As the most populous city in the province, the 2021 Canadian census recorded 662,248 people in the city, up from 631,486 in 2016. The Metro Vancouver area had a population of 2.6million in 2021, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. Greater Vancouver, along with the Fraser Valley, comprises the Lower Mainland with a regional population of over 3million. Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada, with over , and the fourth highest in North America (after New York City, San Francisco, and Mexico City).

Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 49.3 percent of its residents are not native English speakers, 47.8 percent are native speakers of neither English nor French, and 54.5 percent of residents belong to visible minority groups. It has been consistently ranked one of the most livable cities in Canada and in the world. In terms of housing affordability, Vancouver is also one of the most expensive cities in Canada and in the world. Vancouverism is the city&#x27;s urban planning design philosophy.

Indigenous settlement of Vancouver began more than 10,000 years ago and included the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples. The beginnings of the modern city, which was originally named Gastown, grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of Hastings Mill that was built on July 1, 1867, and owned by proprietor Gassy Jack. The Gastown steam clock marks the original site. Gastown then formally registered as a townsite dubbed Granville, Burrard Inlet. The city was renamed &quot;Vancouver&quot; in 1886 through a deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. The city&#x27;s large natural seaport on the Pacific Ocean became a vital link in the trade between Asia-Pacific, East Asia, Europe, and Eastern Canada.

Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events, including the 1954 Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, APEC Canada 1997, the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009; several matches of 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup including the finals at BC Place in downtown Vancouver, and the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler, a resort community north of the city. In 1969, Greenpeace was founded in Vancouver. The city became the permanent home to TED conferences in 2014.

, the Port of Vancouver is the fourth-largest port by tonnage in the Americas, the busiest and largest in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America. While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest industry. Major film production studios in Vancouver and nearby Burnaby have turned Greater Vancouver and nearby areas into one of the largest film production centres in North America, earning it the nickname &quot;Hollywood North&quot;.

==Etymology==
The city takes its name from George Vancouver, who explored the inner harbour of Burrard Inlet in 1792 and gave various places British names. The family name &quot;Vancouver&quot; itself originates from the Dutch &quot;van Coevorden&quot;, denoting somebody from the city of Coevorden, Netherlands. The explorer&#x27;s ancestors came to England &quot;from Coevorden&quot;, which is the origin of the name that eventually became &quot;Vancouver&quot;.

The indigenous Squamish people who reside in a region that encompasses southwestern British Columbia including this city gave the name which means &quot;place of many maple trees&quot;; this was originally the name of a village inhabited by said people where a sawmill was established by Edward Stamp as part of the foundations to the British settlement later becoming part of Vancouver.

In hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ (the Downriver dialect of Halkomelem) spoken by the Musqueam, there is no specific term for Vancouver. Rather there existed names for specific villages and landscape features that the people knew intimately in the area Vancouver exists in currently, as opposed to larger geographic features. The region where Vancouver is currently located was referred to by the Stó꞉lō in the Upriver Halkomelem dialect as , meaning &quot;wide at the bottom/end&quot;. Speakers of the Island dialect of Halkomelem referred to the region of Vancouver as or , referring to the Squamish, or as , a transliteration of the English word &quot;Vancouver&quot;.

==History==

===Before 1850===
Archaeological records indicate that Aboriginal people were already living in the Vancouver area from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.

The Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples of the Coast Salish group had villages in various parts of present-day Vancouver, such as Stanley Park, False Creek, Kitsilano, Point Grey and near the mouth of the Fraser River.

Europeans became acquainted with the area of the future Vancouver when José María Narváez of Spain explored the coast of present-day Point Grey and parts of Burrard Inlet in 1791—although one author contends that Francis Drake may have visited the area in 1579.
The explorer and North West Company trader Simon Fraser and his crew became the first-known Europeans to set foot on the site of the present-day city. In 1808, they travelled from the east down the Fraser River, perhaps as far as Point Grey.

===Early growth===

The Fraser Gold Rush of 1858 brought over 25,000 men, mainly from California, to nearby New Westminster (founded February 14, 1859) on the Fraser River, on their way to the Fraser Canyon, bypassing what would become Vancouver. Vancouver is among British Columbia&#x27;s youngest cities; the first European settlement in what is now Vancouver was not until 1862 at McCleery&#x27;s Farm on the Fraser River, just east of the ancient village of Musqueam in what is now Marpole. A sawmill was established at Moodyville (now the City of North Vancouver) in 1863, beginning the city&#x27;s long relationship with logging. It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp, who had begun logging in the Port Alberni area, first attempted to run a mill at Brockton Point, but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to a point near the foot of Dunlevy Street. This mill, known as the Hastings Mill, became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill&#x27;s central role in the city waned after the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 1880s. It nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s. The settlement, which came to be called Gastown, proliferated around the original makeshift tavern established by Gassy Jack in 1867 on the edge of the Hastings Mill property.

In 1870, the colonial government surveyed the settlement and laid out a townsite, renamed &quot;Granville&quot; in honour of the then–British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Granville. This site, with its natural harbour, was selected in 1884 as the terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway, to the disappointment of Port Moody, New Westminster and Victoria, all of which had vied to be the railhead. A railway was among the inducements for British Columbia to join the Confederation in 1871, but the Pacific Scandal and arguments over the use of Chinese labour delayed construction until the 1880s.

===Incorporation===

The City of Vancouver was incorporated on April 6, 1886, the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived. CPR president William Van Horne arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by Henry John Cambie and gave the city its name in honour of George Vancouver. The Great Vancouver Fire on June 13, 1886, razed the entire city. The Vancouver Fire Department was established that year and the city quickly rebuilt. Vancouver&#x27;s population grew from a settlement of 1,000 people in 1881 to over 20,000 by the turn of the century and 100,000 by 1911.

Vancouver merchants outfitted prospectors bound for the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898. One of those merchants, Charles Woodward, had opened the first Woodward&#x27;s store at Abbott and Cordova Streets in 1892 and, along with Spencer&#x27;s and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay department stores, formed the core of the city&#x27;s retail sector for decades.

The economy of early Vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the CPR, which fuelled economic activity and led to the rapid development of the new city; in fact, the CPR was the main real estate owner and housing developer in the city. While some manufacturing did develop, including the establishment of the British Columbia Sugar Refinery by Benjamin Tingley Rogers in 1890, natural resources became the basis for Vancouver&#x27;s economy. The resource sector was initially based on logging and later on exports moving through the seaport, where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in Vancouver by the 1930s.

===The 20th century===
The dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement. The first major sympathy strike was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed by CPR police while picketing at the docks, becoming the movement&#x27;s first martyr in British Columbia. The rise of industrial tensions throughout the province led to Canada&#x27;s first general strike in 1918, at the Cumberland coal mines on Vancouver Island. Following a lull in the 1920s, the strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province. After two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting, the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the On-to-Ottawa Trek, but their protest was put down by force. The workers were arrested near Mission and interned in work camps for the duration of the Depression.

Other social movements, such as the first-wave feminist, moral reform, and temperance movements, were also instrumental in Vancouver&#x27;s development. Mary Ellen Smith, a Vancouver suffragist and prohibitionist, became the first woman elected to a provincial legislature in Canada in 1918. Alcohol prohibition began in the First World War and lasted until 1921 when the provincial government established control over alcohol sales, a practice still in place today. Canada&#x27;s first drug law came about following an inquiry conducted by the federal minister of Labour and future prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King. King was sent to investigate damages claims resulting from a riot when the Asiatic Exclusion League led a rampage through Chinatown and Japantown. Two of the claimants were opium manufacturers, and after further investigation, King found that white women were reportedly frequenting opium dens as well as Chinese men. A federal law banning the manufacture, sale, and importation of opium for non-medicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations. These riots, and the formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League, also act as signs of a growing fear and mistrust towards the Japanese living in Vancouver and throughout BC. These fears were exacerbated by the attack on Pearl Harbor leading to the eventual internment or deportation of all Japanese-Canadians living in the city and the province. After the war, these Japanese-Canadian men and women were not allowed to return to cities like Vancouver causing areas, like the aforementioned Japantown, to cease to be ethnically Japanese areas as the communities never revived.

Amalgamation with Point Grey and South Vancouver gave the city its final boundaries not long before it became the third-largest metropolis in the country. As of January 1, 1929, the population of the enlarged Vancouver was 228,193.

==Geography==
Located on the Burrard Peninsula, Vancouver lies between Burrard Inlet to the north and the Fraser River to the south. The Strait of Georgia, to the west, is shielded from the Pacific Ocean by Vancouver Island. The city has an area of , including both flat and hilly ground and is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC−8) and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.

Until the city&#x27;s naming in 1885, &quot;Vancouver&quot; referred to Vancouver Island, and it remains a common misconception that the city is located on the island. The island and the city are both named after Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver (as is the city of Vancouver, Washington, in the United States).

Vancouver has one of the largest urban parks in North America, Stanley Park, which covers . The North Shore Mountains dominate the cityscape, and on a clear day, scenic vistas include the snow-capped volcano Mount Baker in the state of Washington to the southeast, Vancouver Island across the Strait of Georgia to the west and southwest, and Bowen Island to the northwest.

===Ecology===
The vegetation in the Vancouver area was originally temperate rainforest, consisting of conifers with scattered pockets of maple and alder and large areas of swampland (even in upland areas, due to poor drainage). The conifers were a typical coastal British Columbia mix of Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock. The area is thought to have had the largest trees of these species on the British Columbia Coast. Only in Elliott Bay, Seattle, did the size of trees rival those of Burrard Inlet and English Bay. The largest trees in Vancouver&#x27;s old-growth forest were in the Gastown area, where the first logging occurred and on the southern slopes of False Creek and English Bay, especially around Jericho Beach. The forest in Stanley Park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s, and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there.

Many plants and trees growing throughout Vancouver and the Lower Mainland were imported from other parts of the continent and points across the Pacific. Examples include the monkey puzzle tree, the Japanese maple and various flowering exotics, such as magnolias, azaleas and rhododendrons. Some species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe have grown to immense sizes. The native Douglas maple can also attain a tremendous size. Many of the city&#x27;s streets are lined with flowering varieties of Japanese cherry trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of Japan. These flower for several weeks in early spring each year, an occasion celebrated by the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival. Other streets are lined with flowering chestnut, horse chestnut and other decorative shade trees.

===Climate===

Vancouver&#x27;s climate, one of the mildest and most temperate climates in Canada, is classified as oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) bordering on a warm-summer Mediterranean (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;). While the city has the coolest summer average high of all major Canadian metropolitan areas, winters in Greater Vancouver are the fourth-mildest of Canadian cities, after nearby Victoria, Nanaimo and Duncan, all on Vancouver Island.

Vancouver is one of the wettest Canadian cities. However, precipitation varies throughout the metropolitan area. Annual precipitation as measured at Vancouver International Airport in Richmond averages , compared with in the downtown area and in North Vancouver. The daily maximum averages in July and August, with highs rarely reaching . The summer months are typically dry, with only one in five days receiving precipitation during July and August. In contrast, most days from November through March record some precipitation.

The highest temperature ever recorded at the airport was set on July 30, 2009, and the highest temperature ever recorded within the city of Vancouver was occurring first on July 31, 1965, again on August 8, 1981, and also on May 29, 1983. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was on January 14, 1950 and again on December 29, 1968.

On average, snow falls nine days per year, with three days receiving or more. Average yearly snowfall is but typically does not remain on the ground for long.

Vancouver&#x27;s growing season averages 237 days, from March 18 until November 10. Vancouver&#x27;s 1981–2010 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone ranges from 8a to 9a depending on elevation and proximity to water.
==Cityscape==
===Urban planning===
 Vancouver is the most densely populated city in Canada. Urban planning in Vancouver is characterized by high-rise residential and mixed-use development in urban centres, as an alternative to sprawl. As part of the larger Metro Vancouver region, it is influenced by the policy direction of livability as illustrated in Metro Vancouver&#x27;s Regional Growth Strategy.

Vancouver ranked high on the Global Liveability Ranking and stood at number 1 on the list for several years until 2011. In recent years, it has dropped, ranking as low as 16 in 2021. , Vancouver was ranked as having the fifth-highest quality of living of any city on Earth. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Vancouver had the fourth-most expensive real estate market in the world in 2019. Vancouver has also been ranked among Canada&#x27;s most expensive cities to live in. Sales in February 2016 were 56.3 percent higher than the 10-year average for the month. &quot;Forbes&quot; also ranked Vancouver as the tenth-cleanest city in the world in 2007.

Vancouver&#x27;s characteristic approach to urban planning originated in the late 1950s, when city planners began to encourage the building of high-rise residential towers in Vancouver&#x27;s West End, subject to strict requirements for setbacks and open space to protect sight lines and preserve green space. The success of these dense but livable neighbourhoods led to the redevelopment of urban industrial sites, such as North False Creek and Coal Harbour, beginning in the mid-1980s. The result is a compact urban core that has gained international recognition for its &quot;high amenity and &#x27;livable&#x27; development&quot;. In 2006, the city launched a planning initiative entitled EcoDensity, with the stated goal of exploring ways in which &quot;density, design, and land use can contribute to environmental sustainability, affordability, and livability&quot;.

===Architecture===


The Vancouver Art Gallery is housed downtown in the neoclassical former courthouse built in 1906. The courthouse building was designed by Francis Rattenbury, who also designed the British Columbia Parliament Buildings and the Empress Hotel in Victoria, and the lavishly decorated second Hotel Vancouver. The 556-room Hotel Vancouver, opened in 1939 and the third by that name, is across the street with its copper roof. The Gothic-style Christ Church Cathedral, across from the hotel, opened in 1894 and was declared a heritage building in 1976.

There are several modern buildings in the downtown area, including the Harbour Centre, the Vancouver Law Courts and surrounding plaza known as Robson Square (designed by Arthur Erickson) and the Vancouver Library Square (designed by Moshe Safdie and DA Architects), reminiscent of the Colosseum in Rome, and the recently completed Woodward&#x27;s building Redevelopment (designed by Henriquez Partners Architects).

The original BC Hydro headquarters building (designed by Ron Thom and Ned Pratt) at Nelson and Burrard Streets is a modernist high-rise, now converted into the Electra condominium. Also notable is the &quot;concrete waffle&quot; of the MacMillan Bloedel building on the north-east corner of the Georgia and Thurlow intersection.
A prominent addition to the city&#x27;s landscape is the giant tent-frame Canada Place (designed by Zeidler Roberts Partnership Partnership, MCMP &amp; DA Architects), the former Canada Pavilion from the 1986 World Exposition, which includes part of the Convention Centre, the Pan-Pacific Hotel, and a cruise ship terminal. Two modern buildings that define the southern skyline away from the downtown area are City Hall and the Centennial Pavilion of Vancouver General Hospital, both designed by Townley and Matheson in 1936 and 1958, respectively.

A collection of Edwardian buildings in the city&#x27;s old downtown core were, in their day, the tallest commercial buildings in the British Empire. These were, in succession, the Carter-Cotton Building (former home of &quot;The Province&quot; newspaper), the Dominion Building (1907) and the Sun Tower (1911), the former two at Cambie and Hastings Streets and the latter at Beatty and Pender Streets.
The Sun Tower&#x27;s cupola was finally exceeded as the Empire&#x27;s tallest commercial building by the elaborate Art Deco Marine Building in the 1920s. The Marine Building is known for its elaborate ceramic tile facings and brass-gilt doors and elevators, which make it a favourite location for movie shoots. Topping the list of tallest buildings in Vancouver is Living Shangri-La, the tallest building in BC at and 62 storeys. The second-tallest building in Vancouver is the Paradox Hotel Vancouver at , followed by the Private Residences at Hotel Georgia, at . The fourth-tallest is One Wall Centre at and 48 storeys, followed closely by the Shaw Tower at .

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Vancouver had a population of 662,248 living in 305,336 of its 328,347 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 631,486, making it the eighth-largest among Canadian cities. More specifically, Vancouver is the fourth-largest in Western Canada after Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021, the most densely populated Canadian municipality with more than 5,000 residents.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the metropolitan area referred to as Greater Vancouver had a population of 2,642,825 living in 1,043,319 of its 1,104,532 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 2,463,431, the third-most populous metropolitan area in the country and the most populous in Western Canada. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. Approximately 75 percent of the people living in Metro Vancouver live outside Vancouver itself.

The larger Lower Mainland-Southwest economic region (which includes also the Squamish-Lillooet, Fraser Valley, and Sunshine Coast Regional District) has a population of over 3.04million.

The 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 274,365 persons or 42.2% of the total population of Vancouver. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were mainland China (63,275 persons or 23.1%), Philippines (29,930 persons or 10.9%), Hong Kong (25,480 persons or 9.3%), India (14,640 persons or 5.3%), United Kingdom (12,895 persons or 4.7%), Vietnam (12,120 persons or 4.4%), Taiwan (9,870 persons or 3.6%), United States of America (9,790 persons or 3.6%), Iran (8,775 persons or 3.2%), and South Korea (6,495 persons or 2.4%).

=== Ethnicity ===

Vancouver has been called a &quot;city of neighbourhoods.&quot; Each neighbourhood in Vancouver has a distinct character and ethnic mix. People of English, Scottish, and Irish origins were historically the largest ethnic groups in the city, and elements of British society and culture are still visible in some areas, particularly South Granville and Kerrisdale. Germans are the next-largest European ethnic group in Vancouver and were a leading force in the city&#x27;s society and economy until the rise of anti-German sentiment with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Today Chinese are the largest visible ethnic group in Vancouver; the city has a diverse Chinese-speaking community with speakers of several dialects, notably Cantonese and Mandarin. Neighbourhoods with distinct ethnic commercial areas include Chinatown, Punjabi Market, Little Italy, Greektown, and (formerly) Japantown.

Since the 1980s, immigration increased substantially, making the city more ethnically and linguistically diverse; 49 percent of Vancouver&#x27;s residents do not speak English as their first language. Over 25 percent of the city&#x27;s inhabitants are of Chinese heritage. In the 1980s, an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, combined with an increase in immigrants from mainland China and previous immigrants from Taiwan, established in Vancouver one of the highest concentrations of ethnic Chinese residents in North America. Another significant Asian ethnic group in Vancouver includes South Asians, forming approximately 7 percent of the city&#x27;s inhabitants; while a small community had existed in the city since 1897, larger waves of migration began in the 1950s and 1960s, prompting new Punjabi immigrants to establish a &quot;Little India&quot; (known as Punjabi Market) and preside over much of the mass construction of the &quot;Vancouver Special&quot; across the southeastern quadrant of the city, notably within the Sunset neighbourhood prior to the suburbanization of the community to outer suburbs such as Surrey or Delta.

Other Asian-origin groups that reside in Vancouver include Filipinos (5.9%), Japanese (1.7%), Korean (1.7%), West Asians (1.9%), as well as sizable communities of Vietnamese, Indonesians, and Cambodians. Despite increases in Latin American immigration to Vancouver in the 1980s and 1990s, recent immigration has been comparatively low. However, growth in the Latino populationwhich largely consists of Mexicans and Salvadoransrose in the late 2010s and early 2020s. African immigration has been similarly stagnant (3.6% and 3.3% of total immigrant population, respectively). The black population of Vancouver is small in comparison to other Canadian major cities, making up 1.3 percent of the city. Hogan&#x27;s Alley, a small area adjacent to Chinatown, just off Main Street at Prior, was once home to a significant black community. The Black population consists of Somalis, Jamaicans/Caribbeans, and other groups, including those who descended from African Americans. The neighbourhood of Strathcona was the core of the city&#x27;s Jewish community. In 1981, approximately 24 percent of the city population belonged to a visible minority group; at the same time, this proportion was roughly 14 percent for the entire metropolitan area. By 2016, the proportion in the city had grown to 52 percent.

Prior to the Hong Kong diaspora of the 1990s, the largest non-British ethnic groups in the city were Irish and German, followed by Scandinavian, Italian, Ukrainian, Chinese, and Punjabi. From the mid-1950s until the 1980s, many Portuguese immigrants came to Vancouver, and the city had the third-largest Portuguese population in Canada in 2001. Eastern Europeans, including Russians, Czechs, Poles, Romanians and Hungarians began immigrating after the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe after World War II. Greek immigration increased in the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s, with most settling in the Kitsilano area. Vancouver also has a significant aboriginal community of about 15,000 people.

=== Sexual orientation and gender identity ===
Vancouver has a large LGBT community, with a recognized gay male enclave focused in the West End neighbourhood of the downtown core, particularly along Davie Street, officially designated as Davie Village, though the gay community is omnipresent throughout West End and Yaletown areas. Vancouver is host to one of the country&#x27;s largest annual pride parades.

=== Language ===
According to the 2021 Canadian census, 612,215 persons, or 94.1% of Vancouver&#x27;s population, know the English language; 96,965 persons or 14.9% of the population, know the Cantonese language, followed by Mandarin (74,695 or 11.5%), French (60,990 or 9.4%), Tagalog (30,430 or 4.7%), Punjabi (19,130 or 2.9%), Hindi (15,025 or 2.3%), Vietnamese (14,905 or 2.3%), Persian languages (12,330 or 1.9%), Japanese (12,075 or 1.9%), German (11,050 or 1.7%), Korean (10,480 or 1.6%), Portuguese (8,715 or 1.3%), Italian (7,740 or 1.2%), and Russian (7,620 or 1.2%).

Furthermore, the 2021 census stated 332,135 persons or 50.7% of Vancouver&#x27;s population have English as a mother tongue; Cantonese is the mother tongue of 77,435 persons or 11.8% of the population, followed by Mandarin (41,695 or 6.4%), Tagalog (18,675 or 2.9%), Spanish (16,735 or 2.6%), Punjabi (13,305 or 2.0%), Vietnamese (11,870 or 1.8%), Persian languages (10,315 or 1.6%), Korean (8,605 or 1.3%), Japanese (7,150 or 1.1%), Portuguese (6,740 or 1.0%), Russian (5,155 or 0.8%), German (4,725 or 0.7%), Hindi (4,355 or 0.7%), and Italian (4,000 or 0.6%).

=== Religion ===
While most British Columbians are secular or non-religious, Vancouver&#x27;s Asian population has been noted for its Christian faith. As of the 2021 Canadian census, religious groups in Vancouver include:
*Irreligion (362,925 persons or 55.8%)
*Christianity (194,365 persons or 29.9%)
*Buddhism (26,245 persons or 4.0%)
*Islam (17,910 persons or 2.8%)
*Sikhism (16,535 persons or 2.5%)
*Hinduism (12,585 persons or 1.9%)
*Judaism (11,675 persons or 1.8%)
*Indigenous spirituality (480 persons or 0.1%)
*Other (7,665 persons or 1.2%)

=== Homelessness ===

Homelessness is a significant and persistent issue in Vancouver. A 2019 count found that at least 2,223 people in the city were experiencing homelessness, the highest number recorded since counts began in 2005. Of those surveyed, 28 percent reported having no physical shelter. Indigenous people accounted for 39 percent of all respondents. Three-fifths of respondents said at least two health concerns, and 67 percent said an addiction to at least one substance.

==Economy==

With its location on the Pacific Rim and at the western terminus of Canada&#x27;s transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is one of the nation&#x27;s largest industrial centres. Port Metro Vancouver, Canada&#x27;s largest and most diversified port, does more than $172billion in trade with over 160 different trading economies annually. Port activities generate $9.7billion in gross domestic product and $20.3billion in economic output. Vancouver is also the headquarters of forest product and mining companies. In recent years, Vancouver has become a centre for software development, biotechnology, aerospace, video game development, animation studios and television production and film industry. Vancouver hosts approximately 65 movies and 55 TV series annually and is the third largest film and TV production centre in North America, supporting 20,000 jobs. The city&#x27;s strong focus on lifestyle and health culture also makes it a hub for many lifestyle brands with Lululemon, Arc&#x27;teryx, Kit and Ace, Mountain Equipment Co-op, Herschel Supply Co., Aritzia, Reigning Champ, and Nature&#x27;s Path Foods all founded and headquartered in Vancouver. Vancouver was also the birthplace of 1-800-GOT-JUNK? and Western Canada&#x27;s largest online-only publication, &quot;Daily Hive&quot;.
 Conversely, since the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, multiple media organizations and economists have continued to warn of a severe long-term economic doom loop impending for Vancouver, similar to the decline noted in San Francisco, California.

Vancouver&#x27;s scenic location makes it a major tourist destination. Over 10.3million people visited Vancouver in 2017. Annually, tourism contributes approximately $4.8billion to the Metro Vancouver economy and supports over 70,000 jobs. Many visit to see the city&#x27;s gardens, Stanley Park, Queen Elizabeth Park, VanDusen Botanical Garden and the mountains, ocean, forest and parklands which surround the city. Each year over a million people pass through Vancouver on cruise ship vacations, often bound for Alaska.

Vancouver is the most stressed city in the spectrum of affordability of housing in Canada. In 2012, Vancouver was ranked by Demographia as the second-most unaffordable city in the world, rated as even more severely unaffordable in 2012 than in 2011. The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs, including cooperative housing, legalized secondary suites, increased density and smart growth. As of April 2010, the average two-level home in Vancouver sold for a record high of $987,500, compared with the Canadian average of $365,141. A factor explaining the high property prices may be policies by the Canadian government which permit snow washing, which allows foreigners to buy property in Canada while shielding their identities from tax authorities, making real estate transactions an effective way to conduct money laundering.

Since the 1990s, the development of high-rise condominiums in the downtown peninsula has been financed, in part, by an inflow of capital from Hong Kong immigrants due to the former colony&#x27;s 1997 handover to China. Such development has clustered in the Yaletown and Coal Harbour districts and around many of the SkyTrain stations to the east of the downtown. The city&#x27;s selection to co-host the 2010 Winter Olympics was also a major influence on economic development. Concern was expressed that Vancouver&#x27;s increasing homelessness problem would be exacerbated by the Olympics because owners of single-room occupancy hotels, which house many of the city&#x27;s lowest-income residents, converted their properties to attract higher-income residents and tourists. Another significant international event held in Vancouver, the 1986 World Exposition, received over 20million visitors and added $3.7billion to the Canadian economy. Some still-standing Vancouver landmarks, including the SkyTrain public transit system and Canada Place, were built as part of the exposition.

==Government==
Vancouver, unlike other British Columbia municipalities, is incorporated under the &quot;Vancouver Charter&quot;. The legislation, passed in 1953, supersedes the &quot;Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921&quot; and grants the city more and different powers than other communities possess under British Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Municipalities Act&quot;.

The civic government was dominated by the centre-right Non-Partisan Association (NPA) since World War II, albeit with some significant centre-left interludes until 2008. The NPA fractured over the issue of drug policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) on a harm reduction platform. Subsequently, North America&#x27;s only legal safe injection site at the time, Insite, was opened for the significant number of intravenous heroin users in the city.

Vancouver is governed by the eleven-member Vancouver City Council, a nine-member School Board, and a seven-member Park Board, all of whom serve four-year terms. Unusually for a city of Vancouver&#x27;s size, all municipal elections are on an at-large basis. Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along conservative or liberal lines. In contrast, the city&#x27;s eastern side has voted along left-wing lines. This was reaffirmed with the results of the 2005 provincial election and the 2006 federal election.

Though polarized, a political consensus has emerged in Vancouver around several issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of rapid transit as opposed to a freeway system, a harm-reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the political spectrum in Vancouver.

In the 2008 municipal election campaign, NPA incumbent mayor Sam Sullivan was ousted as mayoral candidate by the party in a close vote, which instated Peter Ladner as the new mayoral candidate for the NPA. Gregor Robertson, a former MLA for Vancouver-Fairview and head of Happy Planet, was the mayoral candidate for Vision Vancouver, the other main contender. Vision Vancouver candidate Gregor Robertson defeated Ladner by a considerable margin, nearing 20,000 votes. The balance of power was significantly shifted to Vision Vancouver, which held seven of the ten spots for councillor. Of the remaining three, COPE received two and the NPA one. For park commissioner, four seats went to Vision Vancouver, one to the Green Party, one to COPE, and one to NPA. For school trustees, there were four Vision Vancouver seats, three COPE seats, and two NPA seats. In the 2018 Vancouver municipal election, independent Kennedy Stewart was elected mayor of Vancouver. Stewart was later defeated as mayor in the 2022 Vancouver municipal election by Ken Sim, the runner-up in the 2018 election.

Vancouver&#x27;s budget consists of a capital and an operating component. In 2023, the operating budget was $1.97billion, with a 5-year financial plan, developed in 2022, that projected the budget would increase to $2.46billion by 2027. The 2023 capital budget was $580million, with a 2023 to 2026 Capital Plan that anticipates $3.5billion in expenditures in those four years. Budget increases are primarily funded through increases in property taxes and community amenity contributions imposed in exchange for increases in allowable density as part of the construction permitting process. Utility and other user fees have also been increased but represent a small portion of Vancouver&#x27;s overall budget.

===Regional government===

Along with 20 other municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation, Vancouver is a member municipality of Metro Vancouver, the regional government whose seat is in Burnaby. While each member of Metro Vancouver has its own separate local governing body, Metro Vancouver oversees standard services and planning functions within the area, such as providing drinking water; operating sewage and solid waste handling; maintaining regional parks; managing air quality, greenhouse gases and ecological health; and providing a strategy for regional growth and land use.

===Provincial and federal representation===

In the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, Vancouver is represented by 11 members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). As of June 2022, there are two seats held by BC United, and nine by the BC New Democratic Party.

In the House of Commons of Canada, Vancouver is represented by six members of Parliament. In the 2021 federal election, the Liberals retained three seats (Vancouver Quadra, Vancouver Centre, and Vancouver South) and gained one (Vancouver Granville), while the NDP held on to the two seats (Vancouver East and Vancouver Kingsway) they held at dissolution. The Conservatives were shut out of the city&#x27;s ridings. Two current Cabinet ministers hail from the city – Vancouver South MP Harjit Sajjan is Minister of International Development, and Vancouver Quadra MP Joyce Murray is Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard.

===Policing and crime===

Vancouver operates the Vancouver Police Department, with 1,327 sworn members and an operating budget of $316.5million in 2018. Over 19 percent of the city&#x27;s budget was spent on police protection in 2018 and by 2023 that has increased to 20.2 percent.

The Vancouver Police Department&#x27;s operational divisions include a bicycle squad, a marine squad, and a dog squad. It also has a mounted squad, used primarily to patrol Stanley Park and for crowd control. The police work in conjunction with civilian and volunteer-run Community Police Centres. In 2006, the police department established its own counterterrorism unit. In 2005, a new transit police force, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority Police Service (now the Metro Vancouver Transit Police), was established with full police powers.

Before the legalization of marijuana, Vancouver police generally did not arrest people for possessing small amounts of marijuana. In 2000, the Vancouver Police Department established a specialized drug squad, &quot;Growbusters&quot;, to carry out an aggressive campaign against the city&#x27;s estimated 4,000 hydroponic marijuana growing operations (or grow-ops) in residential areas. As with other law enforcement campaigns targeting marijuana this initiative has been sharply criticized.

Since 1982, when Vancouver&#x27;s homicide rate peaked at around 9.6 per 100,000 people with a total of 40 murders, the city&#x27;s overall crime rate has declined, with a few notable exceptions, one being in 1991, when the city surpassed its homicide record with 41 being reported, giving the city a slightly lower homicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000 residents than its peak. However in 2013, Vancouver reached a record low 6 murders, resulting in a homicide rate of 1 per 100,000 residents. , Vancouver had the ninth-highest crime rate, dropping five spots since 2005, among Canada&#x27;s 35 census metropolitan areas. As with other Canadian cities, the overall crime rate has been falling &quot;dramatically&quot;. The rate of firearm related violence dropped from 45.3 per 100,000 in 2006, the highest of any major metropolitan region in Canada at that time, to 16.2 in 2017. A series of gang-related incidents in early 2009 escalated into what police dubbed a gang war.

Vancouver plays host to special events, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, the Clinton-Yeltsin Summit, and the Symphony of Fire fireworks show that require significant policing. The 1994 Stanley Cup riot overwhelmed police and injured as many as 200 people. A second riot took place following the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.

To reduce the public health risk from discarded hypodermic needles commonly found on downtown and the adjacent Downtown Eastside streets, the city runs a continuous collection effort, recovering approximately 1000 needles per day from public spaces. According to Vancouver Coastal Health, the regional health authority and a distributor of clean needles to intravenous drug users, there has never been a documented case of disease transmission from an accidental needlestick.

===Military===
Jericho Beach in Vancouver is the location of the headquarters of 39 Canadian Brigade Group of the Canadian Army. Local primary reserve units include The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada and The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own), based at the Seaforth Armoury and the Beatty Street Drill Hall, respectively, and the 15th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery. The Naval Reserve Unit is based on Deadman&#x27;s Island in Stanley Park. RCAF Station Jericho Beach, the first air base in Western Canada, was taken over by the Canadian Army in 1947 when seaplanes were replaced by long-range aircraft. Most of the base facilities were transferred to the City of Vancouver in 1969, and the area was renamed &quot;Jericho Park&quot;.

==Education==
The Vancouver School Board enrolls more than 110,000 students in its elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions, making it the second-largest school district in the province. The district administers about 76 elementary schools, 17 elementary annexes, 18 secondary schools, 7 adult education centres, 2 Vancouver Learning Network schools, which include 18 French immersion schools, a Mandarin bilingual school, and fine arts (Byng Arts Mini School), gifted, and Montessori schools. The &quot;Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique&quot; operates three Francophone schools in that city: the primary schools &quot;école Rose-des-vents&quot; and &quot;école Anne-Hébert&quot; as well as the &quot;école secondaire Jules-Verne&quot;. More than 46 independent schools of a wide variety are also eligible for partial provincial funding and educate approximately 10 percent of pupils in the city.

There are five public universities in the Greater Vancouver area, the largest and most prestigious being the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Simon Fraser University (SFU), with a combined enrolment of more than 90,000 undergraduates, graduates, and professional students in 2008. UBC often ranks among the top 40 best universities in the world and is ranked among the 20 best public universities in Canada. SFU consistently ranks as the top comprehensive university in Canada and is among the 350 best universities in the world. UBC&#x27;s main campus is located on the tip of Burrard Peninsula, on the Point Grey campus lands just west of the University Endowment Lands with the city-proper adjacent to the east. SFU&#x27;s main campus is in Burnaby. Both also maintain campuses in Downtown Vancouver and the southeastern suburban city of Surrey.

The other public universities in the metropolitan area around Vancouver are Capilano University in North Vancouver, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and Kwantlen Polytechnic University, whose four campuses are all outside the city proper. Six private institutions also operate in the region: Trinity Western University in Langley, UOPX Canada in Burnaby, and University Canada West, NYIT Canada, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Columbia College, and Sprott Shaw College, all in Vancouver.

Vancouver Community College and Langara College are publicly funded college-level institutions in Vancouver, as is Douglas College with three campuses outside the city. The British Columbia Institute of Technology in Burnaby provides polytechnic education. These are augmented by private and vocational institutions and other colleges in the surrounding areas of Metro Vancouver that provide career, trade, technical, and university-transfer programs. In contrast, the Vancouver Film School and InFocus Film School provide one-year programs in film production, animation, and other entertainment arts.

International students and English as a second language (ESL) students have been significant in the enrolment of these public and private institutions. For the 2008–2009 school year, 53 percent of Vancouver School Board&#x27;s students spoke a language other than English at home.

==Arts and culture==
===Theatre, dance, film and television===
====Theatre====
Prominent theatre companies in Vancouver include the Arts Club Theatre Company on Granville Island and Bard on the Beach. Smaller companies include Touchstone Theatre, and Studio 58.

====Film====
The Vancouver International Film Festival, which runs for two weeks each September, shows over 350 films and is one of North America&#x27;s most prominent film festivals. The VIFF Centre venue, the Vancity Theatre, runs independent non-commercial films throughout the rest of the year, as do the Cinematheque and the Rio theatres.

=====Films set in Vancouver=====

Vancouver has become a significant film location, known as Hollywood North, as it has stood in for several U.S. cities. However, it has started to appear as itself in several feature films. Among films set in the city and its surroundings are the 1994 US thriller &quot;Intersection&quot;, starring Richard Gere and Sharon Stone; the 2007 Canadian ghost thriller &quot;They Wait&quot;, starring Terry Chen and Jaime King; and the acclaimed Canadian &#x27;mockumentary&#x27; &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;, and was named the second-best Canadian film of the last 15 years, in a 2001 poll of 200 industry voters, performed by Playback. Genie Award-winning filmmaker Mina Shum has filmed and set several of her internationally released features in Vancouver, including the Sundance-screened &quot;Long Life, Happiness &amp; Prosperity&quot; (2002).

====Television shows produced in Vancouver====
Many past and current TV shows have been filmed and set in Vancouver. The first Canadian prime time national series to be produced out of Vancouver was &quot;Cold Squad&quot; and its storyline was also physically set in the city. Other series set in or around the city of Vancouver include &quot;Continuum&quot;, &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot;, &quot;Danger Bay&quot;, &quot;Edgemont&quot;, &quot;Godiva&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Intelligence&quot;, &quot;Motive&quot;, &quot;Northwood&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Robson Arms&quot;, &quot;The Romeo Section&quot;, &quot;Shattered&quot;, &quot;The Switch&quot;, and &quot;These Arms of Mine&quot;.

Television shows produced (but not set) in Vancouver (that have been produced by American and Canadian studios alike) include &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, &quot;The 100&quot;, &quot;The 4400&quot;, &quot;Airwolf&quot;, &quot;Almost Human&quot;, &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Backstrom&quot;, &quot;Caprica&quot;, &quot;Cedar Cove&quot;, &quot;Chesapeake Shores&quot;, &quot;The Commish&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, &quot;Haters Back Off&quot;, &quot;Hellcats&quot;, &quot;Intelligence&quot;, &quot;iZombie&quot;, &quot;The Killing&quot;, &quot;The L Word&quot;, &quot;Life Unexpected&quot;, &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Reaper&quot;, &quot;Riverdale&quot;, &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, &quot;The Magicians&quot;, &quot;Tru Calling&quot;, &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, &quot;Wild Cards&quot;, &quot;Witches of East End&quot;, and &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

===Libraries and museums===
Libraries in Vancouver include the Vancouver Public Library, with its main branch at Library Square, designed by Moshe Safdie. The central branch contains 1.5million volumes. Altogether, twenty-two branches contain 2.25million volumes. The Vancouver Tool Library is Canada&#x27;s original tool lending library.

The Vancouver Art Gallery has a permanent collection of nearly 10,000 items and is the home of a significant number of works by Emily Carr. However, little or none of the permanent collection is ever on view. Downtown is also home to the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver), which showcases temporary exhibitions by up-and-coming Vancouver artists. The Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, with a small collection of contemporary works, is part of the University of British Columbia.

In the Kitsilano district are the Vancouver Maritime Museum, the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre, and the Vancouver Museum, the largest civic museum in Canada. The Museum of Anthropology at UBC is a leading museum of Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations culture. A more interactive museum is Science World at the head of False Creek. The city also features a diverse collection of Public Art.

===Visual art===

Vancouver is home to 13 of the 190 Artist Run Centres in Canada. Artwork and cultural artifacts from nations Indigenous to the land on which Vancouver is located are available to view at the Museum of Anthropology at UBC, largely because these artifacts were stolen as part of colonization.

===Music and nightlife===

Musical contributions from Vancouver include performers of classical, folk and popular music. The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra is the professional orchestra based in the city. The Vancouver Opera is a major opera company in the city, and City Opera of Vancouver is the city&#x27;s professional chamber opera company. The city is home to several Canadian composers, including Rodney Sharman, Jeffrey Ryan, and Jocelyn Morlock.

The city produced a number of notable punk rock bands, including D.O.A. Other early Vancouver punk bands included the Subhumans, the Young Canadians, the Pointed Sticks, and U-J3RK5. When alternative rock became popular in the 1990s, several Vancouver groups rose to prominence, including 54-40, Odds, Moist, the Matthew Good Band, Sons of Freedom and Econoline Crush. Recent successful Vancouver bands include Gob, Marianas Trench, Theory of a Deadman and Stabilo. Today, Vancouver is home to several popular independent bands such as The New Pornographers, Japandroids, Destroyer, In Medias Res, Tegan and Sara, and independent labels including Nettwerk and Mint. Vancouver also produced influential metal band Strapping Young Lad and pioneering electro-industrial bands Skinny Puppy, Numb and Front Line Assembly; the latter&#x27;s Bill Leeb is better known for founding ambient pop super-group Delerium. Other popular musical artists who made their mark from Vancouver include Carly Rae Jepsen, Bryan Adams, Sarah McLachlan, Heart, Prism, Trooper, Chilliwack, Payolas, Moev, Images in Vogue, Michael Bublé, Stef Lang and Spirit of the West.

More significant musical performances are usually held at venues such as Rogers Arena, Queen Elizabeth Theatre, BC Place Stadium or the Pacific Coliseum. In contrast, more minor acts are held at places such as the Commodore Ballroom, the Orpheum Theatre and the Vogue Theatre. The Vancouver Folk Music Festival and the Vancouver International Jazz Festival showcase music from around the world in their respective genres. Vancouver&#x27;s Hong Kong Chinese population has produced several Cantopop stars across the Hong Kong entertainment industry. Similarly, various Indo-Canadian artists and actors have a profile in Bollywood or other aspects of India&#x27;s entertainment industry.

Vancouver has a vibrant nightlife scene, whether food and dining or bars and nightclubs. The Granville Entertainment District has the city&#x27;s highest concentration of bars and nightclubs with closing times of 3am, in addition to various after-hours clubs open until late morning on weekends. The street can attract large crowds on weekends and is closed to traffic on such nights. Gastown is also a popular area for nightlife with many upscale restaurants and nightclubs, as well as the Davie Village, which is the centre of the city&#x27;s LGBT community.

==Media==
Vancouver is a centre for film and television production. Nicknamed Hollywood North, a distinction it shares with Toronto, the city has been used as a film making location for nearly a century, beginning with the Edison Manufacturing Company. In 2021, $3.6billion was spent on film production in Vancouver. This ranks Vancouver as the largest production hub in Canada and the 3rd largest in North America, behind Los Angeles and New York City.

A wide mix of local, national, and international newspapers are distributed in the city. The two major English-language daily newspapers are the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot;. Also, there are two national newspapers distributed in the city, including &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, which began publication of a &quot;national edition&quot; in BC in 1983 and recently expanded to include a three-page BC news section, and the &quot;National Post&quot;, which centres on national news. Other local newspapers have included &quot;24H&quot; (a local free daily), the Vancouver franchise of the national free daily &quot;Metro&quot;, the twice-a-week &quot;Vancouver Courier&quot;, and the independent newspaper &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;. Three Chinese-language daily newspapers&quot;Ming Pao&quot;, &quot;Sing Tao&quot; and &quot;World Journal&quot;cater to the city&#x27;s large Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking population. Several other local and international papers serve other multicultural groups in the Lower Mainland.

Some of the local television stations include CBC, Citytv, CTV and Global BC. OMNI British Columbia produces daily newscasts in Cantonese, Mandarin, Punjabi and Korean, and weekly newscasts in Tagalog, as well as programs aimed at other cultural groups. Fairchild Group also has two television stations: Fairchild TV and Talentvision, serving Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking audiences, respectively.

Radio stations with news departments include CBC Radio One, CKNW and News 1130. The Franco-Columbian community is served by Radio-Canada outlets CBUFT-DT channel 26 (Ici Radio-Canada Télé), CBUF-FM 97.7 (Première Chaîne) and CBUX-FM 90.9 (Espace musique). The multilingual South Asian community is served by Spice Radio on 1200 AM, which was established in 2014.

Media dominance is a frequently discussed issue in Vancouver as newspapers the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, &quot;The Province&quot;, the &quot;Vancouver Courier&quot; and other local newspapers such as the &quot;Surrey Now&quot;, the &quot;Burnaby Now&quot; and the &quot;Richmond News&quot;, are all owned by Postmedia Network. The concentration of media ownership has spurred alternatives, making Vancouver a centre for independent online media including &quot;The Tyee&quot;, &quot;The Vancouver Observer&quot;, and NowPublic, as well as hyperlocal online media, like &quot;Daily Hive&quot; and &quot;Vancouver Is Awesome&quot;, which provide coverage of community events and local arts and culture.

==Transportation==

Vancouver&#x27;s streetcar system began on June 28, 1890, and ran from the (first) Granville Street Bridge to Westminster Avenue (now Main Street and Kingsway). Less than a year later, the Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company began operating Canada&#x27;s first interurban line between the two cities (extended to Chilliwack in 1910). Another line (1902), the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway, was leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the British Columbia Electric Railway in 1905 and ran from the Granville Street Bridge to Steveston via Kerrisdale, which encouraged residential neighbourhoods outside the central core to develop. After 1897, the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) became the operator of the urban and interurban rail systems until 1958, when its remaining lines were dismantled in favour of trackless electric trolleys and gasoline or diesel buses. BCER later became the core of the newly created, publicly owned BC Hydro, established in 1962. Vancouver currently has the second-largest trolleybus fleet in North America, after San Francisco.

Successive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s prohibited the construction of freeways as part of a long-term plan. As a result, the only major freeway within city limits is Highway 1, which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city. While the number of cars in Vancouver proper has been steadily rising with population growth, the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by daily commuters have fallen since the early 1990s. Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with these trends. Even though the journey time per vehicle has increased by one-third and growing traffic mass, there are 7 percent fewer cars making trips into the downtown core. In 2012, Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in Canada and the second-highest in North America, behind Los Angeles. , Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in North America. Residents have been more inclined to live in areas closer to their interests, or use more energy-efficient means of travel, such as mass transit and cycling. This is, in part, the result of a push by city planners for a solution to traffic problems and pro-environment campaigns. Transportation demand management policies have imposed restrictions on drivers, making commuting more difficult and expensive while introducing more benefits for non-drivers.

TransLink is responsible for roads and public transportation within Metro Vancouver (in succession to BC Transit, which had taken over the transit functions of BC Hydro). It provides bus service, including the RapidBus express service, a foot passenger and bicycle ferry service (known as SeaBus), an automated rapid transit service called SkyTrain, and West Coast Express commuter rail. Vancouver&#x27;s SkyTrain system is currently running on three lines, the Millennium Line, the Expo Line and the Canada Line with a total of 53 stations as of 2017. Only 20 stations are within the City of Vancouver borders, with the remainder in the adjacent suburbs. A number of the city&#x27;s biggest tourist attractionssuch as English Bay, Stanley Park, the Vancouver Aquarium, the Museum of Anthropology, and the Kitsilano neighbourhoodare not connected by this rapid transit system.

Changes are being made to the regional transportation network as part of Translink&#x27;s 10-Year Transportation Plan. The Canada Line, opened on August 17, 2009, connects Vancouver International Airport and the neighbouring city of Richmond with the existing SkyTrain system. The Evergreen Extension, which opened on December 2, 2016, links the cities of Coquitlam and Port Moody with the SkyTrain system. As of January 2019, plans to extend the SkyTrain Millennium Line west to UBC as a subway under Broadway have been approved and there are plans for capacity upgrades and an extension to the Expo Line. Several road projects will be completed within the next few years, as part of the Provincial Government&#x27;s Gateway Program.

Other modes of transport add to the diversity of options available in Vancouver. Inter-city passenger rail service is operated from Pacific Central Station by Via Rail to points east, Amtrak Cascades to Seattle and Portland, and Rocky Mountaineer rail tour routes. Small passenger ferries in False Creek provide commuter service to Granville Island, Downtown Vancouver and Kitsilano. Vancouver has a citywide network of bicycle lanes and routes, supporting an active cyclist population year-round. Cycling has become Vancouver&#x27;s fastest-growing mode of transportation. The bicycle-sharing system Mobi was introduced to the city in June 2016.

Vancouver is served by Vancouver International Airport (YVR), located on Sea Island in the city of Richmond, immediately south of Vancouver. Vancouver&#x27;s airport is Canada&#x27;s second-busiest airport, and the second-largest gateway on the west coast of North America for international passengers. HeliJet and float plane companies operate scheduled air service from Vancouver harbour and YVR south terminal. Two BC Ferry terminals also serve the city. One is to the northwest at Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver, and the other is to the south at Tsawwassen in Delta.

==Sports and recreation==
The city&#x27;s mild climate and proximity to the ocean, mountains, rivers and lakes make the area a popular destination for outdoor recreation. Vancouver has over of parks, of which Stanley Park, at , is the largest. The city has several large beaches, many adjacent to one another, extending from the shoreline of Stanley Park around False Creek to the south side of English Bay, from Kitsilano to the University Endowment Lands, (which also has beaches that are not part of the city proper). The of beaches include Second and Third Beaches in Stanley Park, English Bay (First Beach), Sunset, Kitsilano Beach, Jericho, Locarno, Spanish Banks, Spanish Banks Extension, Spanish Banks West, and Wreck Beach. There is also a freshwater beach at Trout Lake in John Hendry Park. The coastline provides for many types of water sports, and the city is a popular destination for boating enthusiasts.

Within a 20- to 30-minute drive from downtown Vancouver are the North Shore Mountains, with three ski areas: Cypress Mountain, Grouse Mountain, and Mount Seymour. Mountain bikers have created world-renowned trails across the North Shore. The Capilano River, Lynn Creek and Seymour River, also on the North Shore, provide opportunities to whitewater enthusiasts during periods of rain and spring melt. However, the canyons of those rivers are more utilized for hiking and swimming than whitewater.

Running races include the Vancouver Sun Run (a race) every April; the Vancouver Marathon, held every May; and the Scotiabank Vancouver Half-Marathon held every June. The Grouse Grind is a climb up Grouse Mountain, open throughout the summer and fall months, including the annual Grouse Grind Mountain Run. Hiking trails include the Baden-Powell Trail, an arduous hike from West Vancouver&#x27;s Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove in the District of North Vancouver.

Vancouver is also home to notable cycling races. During most summers since 1973, the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix has been held on the cobblestone streets of Gastown. This race and the UBC Grand Prix are part of BC Superweek, an annual series of professional cycling races in Metro Vancouver.

The British Columbia Derby is a nine-furlong horse race held at the Hastings Racecourse in the third week of September.

In 2009, Metro Vancouver hosted the World Police and Fire Games. Swangard Stadium, in the neighbouring city of Burnaby, hosted games for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Vancouver, along with Whistler and Richmond, was the host city for the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Paralympics. On June 12, 2010, it played host to Ultimate Fighting Championship 115 (UFC 115), which was the fourth UFC event to be held in Canada (and the first outside Montreal).

In 2011, Vancouver hosted the Grey Cup, the Canadian Football League (CFL) championship game, which is awarded every year to a different city that has a CFL team. The BC Titans of the International Basketball League played their inaugural season in 2009, with home games at the Langley Event Centre. Vancouver is a centre for the fast-growing sport of ultimate. During the summer of 2008 Vancouver hosted the World Ultimate Championships.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) expanded into Vancouver in 1995 with the establishment of the Vancouver Grizzlies. They played their games at Rogers Arena. After six years in Vancouver, the team relocated to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001.

==Sustainability==

The City of Vancouver is a member of Metro Vancouver, which provides sustainable regional services to the Greater Vancouver area. The city electrical grid is serviced by BC Hydro, which claims 97.8% of the energy it generates is clean owing to the extensive use of hydroelectric power generation. The City of Vancouver is the greenest city in Canada according to an independent ongoing urban ecological footprint study.

The Greenest City action plan (GCAP) is a City of Vancouver urban sustainability initiative. Its primary mission was to ensure Vancouver would become the greenest city in the world by 2020. The GCAP originated based on the 2009 work of the Greenest City Action Team, a committee co-chaired by Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson. The GCAP was approved by Vancouver city council in July 2011.

In May 2018, the Zero Waste 2040 Strategy was passed The city began work the same year on decreasing the amount of single-use items distributed in the city. It intends to ban these items by 2021 if businesses do not meet reduction targets. As part of the plan, a ban on plastic straws, polystyrene food packaging and free shopping bags was to go into effect in mid-2019.

In January 2022, the city council passed a regulation mandating that businesses charge a $0.25 fee on single-use cups. This decision was criticized because the fees stayed within the business and were not re-invested in city-wide environmental efforts. On March 28, 2023, the council enacted a by-law that repealed all single-use cup fees.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
The City of Vancouver was one of the first cities in Canada to enter into an international sister cities arrangement. Special arrangements for cultural, social and economic benefits have been created with these sister cities.

<text>The Sarasvati River () is a deified mythological river first mentioned in the Rigveda and later in Vedic and post-Vedic texts. It played an important role in the Vedic religion, appearing in all but the fourth book of the Rigveda.

As a physical river, in the oldest texts of the Rigveda it is described as a &quot;great and holy river in north-western India,&quot; but in the middle and late Rigvedic books it is described as a small river ending in &quot;a terminal lake (samudra).&quot; As the goddess Sarasvati, the other referent for the term &quot;Sarasvati&quot; which developed into an independent identity in post-Vedic times, the river is also described as a powerful river and mighty flood. The Sarasvati is also considered by Hindus to exist in a metaphysical form, in which it formed a confluence with the sacred rivers Ganga and Yamuna, at the Triveni Sangam. According to Michael Witzel, superimposed on the Vedic Sarasvati river is the &quot;heavenly river&quot;: the Milky Way, which is seen as &quot;a road to immortality and heavenly after-life.&quot;

Rigvedic and later Vedic texts have been used to propose identification with present-day rivers, or ancient riverbeds. The Nadistuti Sukta in the Rigveda (10.75) mentions the Sarasvati between the Yamuna in the east and the Shutudri in the west, while RV 7.95.1-2, describes the Sarasvati as flowing to the samudra, a word now usually translated as &#x27;ocean&#x27;, but which could also mean &quot;lake.&quot; Later Vedic texts such as the Tandya Brahmana and the Jaiminiya Brahmana, as well as the Mahabharata, mention that the Sarasvati dried up in a desert.

Since the late 19th century CE, numerous scholars have proposed to identify the Sarasvati with the Ghaggar-Hakra River system, which flows through modern-day northwestern-India and eastern-Pakistan, between the Yamuna and the Shutudri, and ends in the Thar desert. Recent geophysical research shows that the supposed downstream Ghaggar-Hakra paleochannel is actually a paleochannel of the Shutudri, which flowed into the Nara river, a delta channel of the Sindhu River. 10,000–8,000 years ago this channel was abandoned when the Sutlej diverted its course, leaving the Ghaggar-Hakra as a system of monsoon-fed rivers which did not reach the sea.

The Sindhu Valley Civilisation prospered when the monsoons that fed the rivers diminished around 5,000 years ago, and ISRO has observed that major Sindhu Valley Civilisation sites at Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Banawali and Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Dholavira and Lothal (Gujarat) lay along this course. When the monsoons that fed the rivers further diminished, the Hakra dried-up some 4,000 years ago, becoming an intermittent river, and the urban Harappan civilisation declined, becoming localized in smaller agricultural communities.
Identification of a mighty &quot;physical&quot; Rigvedic Sarasvati with the Ghaggar-Hakra system is therefore problematic, since the Ghaggar-Hakra had dried up well before the time of the composition of the Rigveda. In the words of Wilke and Moebus, the Sarasvati had been reduced to a &quot;small, sorry trickle in the desert&quot; by the time that the Vedic people migrated into north-west India. Rigvedic references to a physical river also indicate that the Sarasvati &quot;had already lost its main source of water supply and must have ended in a terminal lake (samudra) approximately 3000 years ago,&quot; &quot;depicting the present-day situation, with the Sarasvatī having lost most of its water.&quot; Also, Rigvedic descriptions of the Sarasvati do not match the actual course of the Ghaggar-Hakra.

&quot;Sarasvati&quot; has also been identified with the Helmand in ancient Arachosia, or , in present day southern Afghanistan, the name of which may have been reused from the more ancient Sanskrit name of the Ghaggar-Hakra river, after the Vedic tribes moved to the Punjab. The &quot;Sarasvati&quot; of the Rigveda may also refer to two distinct rivers, with the family books referring to the Helmand River, and the more recent 10th mandala referring to the Ghaggar-Hakra.

The identification with the Ghaggar-Hakra system took on new significance in the early 21st century CE, with some Hindutva proponents suggesting an earlier dating of the Rigveda; renaming the Sindhu Valley Civilisation as the &quot;Sarasvati Culture&quot;, the &quot;Sarasvati Civilization&quot;, the &quot;Sindhu-Sarasvati Culture&quot; or the &quot;Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization,&quot; suggesting that the Indus Valley and Vedic cultures can be equated; and rejecting the Indo-Aryan migrations theory, which postulates an extended period of migrations of Indo-European speaking people into the Indian subcontinent between ca. 1900 BCE and 1400 BCE.

== Etymology ==
&#x27; is the feminine nominative singular form of the adjective &#x27; (which occurs in the Rigveda as the name of the keeper of the celestial waters), derived from &#x27;sáras&#x27; + &#x27;vat&#x27;, meaning &#x27;having sáras-&#x27;. Sanskrit &#x27; means &#x27;lake, pond&#x27; (cf. the derivative &#x27; &#x27;lake bird = Sarus crane&#x27;). Mayrhofer considers unlikely a connection with the root *&quot;&quot; &#x27;run, flow&#x27; but does agree that it could have been a river that connected many lakes due to its abundant volumes of water-flow.
&quot;&quot; is considered to be a cognate of Avestan &quot;Haraxvatī&quot;. In the younger Avesta, &quot;Haraxvatī&quot; is Arachosia, a region described to be rich in rivers, and its Old Persian cognate &quot;Harauvati&quot;.

== Importance in Hinduism ==
The Sarasvati river was revered and considered important for Hindus because it is said that it was on this river&#x27;s banks, along with its tributary Drishadvati, in the Vedic state of Brahmavarta, that Vedic Sanskrit had its genesis, and important Vedic scriptures like initial part of Rigveda and several Upanishads were supposed to have been composed by Vedic seers. In the Manusmriti, Brahmavarta is portrayed as the &quot;pure&quot; centre of Vedic culture. Bridget and Raymond Allchin in &quot;The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan&quot; took the view that &quot;The earliest Aryan homeland in India–Pakistan (Aryavarta or Brahmavarta) was in the Punjab and in the valleys of the Sarasvati and Drishadvati rivers in the time of the Rigveda.&quot;

=== Rigveda ===
====As a river====
The Sarasvati River is mentioned in all but the fourth book of the Vedas. Macdonell and Keith provided a comprehensive survey of Vedic references to the Sarasvati River in their &quot;Vedic Index&quot;. In the late book 10, only two references are unambiguously to the river: 10.64.9, calling for the aid of three &quot;great rivers&quot;, Sindhu, Sarasvati, Sarayu; and 10.75.5, the geographical list of the Nadistuti Sukta. In this hymn, the Sarasvati River is placed between the Yamuna and the Shutudri.

In the oldest texts of the Rigveda she is described as a &quot;great and holy river in north-western India,&quot; but Michael Witzel notes that the Rigveda indicates that the Sarasvati &quot;had already lost its main source of water supply and must have ended in a terminal lake (samudra) approximately 3000 years ago.&quot; The middle books 3 and 7 and the late books 10 &quot;depict the present-day situation, with the Sarasvatī having lost most of its water.&quot; The Sarasvati acquired an extalted status in the mythology of the Kuru kingdom, where the Rigveda was compiled.

==== As a goddess ====

Sarasvati is mentioned some fifty times in the hymns of the Rigveda. It is mentioned in thirteen hymns of the late books (1 and 10) of the Rigveda.

The most important hymns related to Sarasvati goddess are RV 6.61, RV 7.95 and RV 7.96. As a river goddess, she is described as a mighty flood, and is clearly not an earthly river. According to Michael Witzel, superimposed on the Vedic Sarasvati river is the heavenly river Milky Way, which is seen as &quot;a road to immortality and heavenly after-life.&quot; The description of the Sarasvati as the river of heavens, is interpreted to suggest its mythical nature.

In 10.30.12, her origin as a river goddess may explain her invocation as a protective deity in a hymn to the celestial waters. In 10.135.5, as Indra drinks Soma, he is described as refreshed by Sarasvati. The invocations in 10.17 address Sarasvati as a goddess of the forefathers as well as of the present generation. In 1.13, 1.89, 10.85, 10.66 and 10.141, she is listed with other gods and goddesses, not with rivers. In 10.65, she is invoked together with &quot;holy thoughts&quot; (&#x27;) and &quot;munificence&quot; (&#x27;), consistent with her role as a goddess of both knowledge and fertility.

Though Sarasvati initially emerged as a river goddess in the Vedic scriptures, in later Hinduism of the Puranas, she was rarely associated with the river. Instead, she emerged as an independent goddess of knowledge, learning, wisdom, music and the arts. The evolution of the river goddess into the goddess of knowledge started with later Brahmanas, which identified her as &quot;Vāgdevī&quot;, the goddess of speech, perhaps due to the centrality of speech in the Vedic cult and the development of the cult on the banks of the river. It is also possible to postulate two originally independent goddesses that were fused into one in later Vedic times. Aurobindo has proposed, on the other hand, that &quot;the symbolism of the Veda betrays itself to the greatest clearness in the figure of the goddess Sarasvati ... She is, plainly and clearly, the goddess of the World, the goddess of a divine inspiration ...&quot;.

=== Other Vedic texts ===
In post-Rigvedic literature, the disappearance of the Sarasvati is mentioned. Also the origin of the Sarasvati is identified as Plaksa Prasravana (Pippala tree or Ashvaththa tree as known in India and Nepal).

In a supplementary chapter of the Vajasaneyi-Samhita of the Yajurveda (34.11), Sarasvati is mentioned in a context apparently meaning the Sindhu: &quot;Five rivers flowing on their way speed onward to Sarasvati, but then become Sarasvati a fivefold river in the land.&quot; According to the medieval commentator Uvata, the five tributaries of the Sarasvati were the Punjab rivers Drishadvati, Shutudri (Sutlej), Asikini (Chenab), Vipasha (Beas), Iravati (Ravi).

The first reference to the disappearance of the lower course of the Sarasvati is from the Brahmanas, texts that are composed in Vedic Sanskrit, but dating to a later date than the Veda Samhitas. The Jaiminiya Brahmana (2.297) speaks of the &#x27;diving under (upamajjana) of the Sarasvati&#x27;, and the Tandya Brahmana (or Pancavimsa Br.) calls this the &#x27;disappearance&#x27; (vinasana). The same text (25.10.11–16) records that the Sarasvati is &#x27;so to say meandering&#x27; (kubjimati) as it could not sustain heaven which it had propped up.

The Plaksa Prasravana (place of source of the river) may refer to a spring in the Sivalik hills. The distance between the source and the Vinasana (place of disappearance of the river) is said to be 44 Ashvinas (between several hundred and 1,600 miles) (Tandya Br. 25.10.16; cf. Av. 6.131.3; Pancavimsa Br.).

In the Latyayana Srautasutra (10.15–19) the Sarasvati seems to be a perennial river up to the Vinasana, which is west of its confluence with the Drshadvati (Chautang). The Drshadvati is described as a seasonal stream (10.17), meaning it was not from Himalayas. Bhargava has identified Drashadwati river as present-day Sahibi river originating from Jaipur hills in Rajasthan. The Asvalayana Srautasutra and Sankhayana Srautasutra contain verses that are similar to the Latyayana Srautasutra.

=== Post-Vedic texts ===
Wilke and Moebus note that the &quot;historical river&quot; Sarasvati was a &quot;topographically tangible mythogeme&quot;, which was already reduced to a &quot;small, sorry trickle in the desert&quot;, by the time of composition of the Hindu epics. These post-Vedic texts regularly talk about drying up of the river, and start associating the goddess Sarasvati with language, rather than the river.

====Mahabharata====
According to the Mahabharata (3rd c. BCE – 3rd c. CE) the Sarasvati River dried up to a desert (at a place named Vinasana or Adarsana) and joins the sea &quot;impetuously&quot;. MB.3.81.115 locates the state of Kurupradesh or Kuru Kingdom to the south of the Sarasvati and north of the Drishadvati. The dried-up, seasonal Ghaggar River in Rajasthan and Haryana reflects the same geographical view described in the Mahabharata.

According to Hindu scriptures, a journey was made during the Mahabharata by Balrama along the banks of the Saraswati from Dwarka to Mathura. There were ancient kingdoms too (the era of the Mahajanapads) that lay in parts of north Rajasthan and that were named on the Sarasvati River.

====Puranas====
Several Puranas describe the Sarasvati River, and also record that the river separated into a number of lakes (&quot;saras&quot;).

In the Skanda Purana, the Sarasvati originates from the water pot of Brahma and flows from Plaksa spring on the Himalayas. It then turns west at Kedara and also flows underground. Five distributaries of the Sarasvati are mentioned. The texts reveal Sarasvati river&#x27;s goddess isSarasvati. According to the Vamana Purana 32.1–4, the Sarasvati rose from the Plaksa spring.

The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; says:
====Smritis====
* In the Manu Smriti, the sage Manu, escaping from a flood, founded the Vedic culture between the Sarasvati and Drishadvati rivers. The Sarasvati River was thus the western boundary of Brahmavarta: &quot;the land between the Sarasvati and Drishadvati is created by God; this land is Brahmavarta.&quot;
* Similarly, the Vasistha Dharma Sutra I.8–9 and 12–13 locates Aryavarta to the east of the disappearance of the Sarasvati in the desert, to the west of Kalakavana, to the north of the mountains of Pariyatra and Vindhya and to the south of the Himalaya. Patanjali&#x27;s Mahābhāṣya defines Aryavarta like the Vasistha Dharma Sutra.
* The Baudhayana &quot;Dharmasutra&quot; gives similar definitions, declaring that Aryavarta is the land that lies west of Kalakavana, east of Adarsana (where the Sarasvati disappears in the desert), south of the Himalayas and north of the Vindhyas.

=== Contemporary religious significance ===
Diana Eck notes that the power and significance of the Sarasvati for present-day Indian Subcontinent is in the persistent symbolic presence at the confluence of rivers all over Indian Subcontinent. Although underground , it is the third river, which emerges to join in the meeting of rivers, thus making the waters holy.

After the Vedic Sarasvati dried, new myths about the rivers arose. Sarasvati is described to flow in the underworld and rise to the surface at some places. For centuries, the Sarasvati river existed in a &quot;subtle or mythic&quot; form, since it corresponds with none of the major rivers of present-day South Asia. The confluence (&quot;sangam&quot;) or joining of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers at Triveni Sangam, Prayagaraja, is believed to also converge with the unseen Sarasvati river, which is believed to flow underground. This is despite Prayagaraja being at a large distance from the historic route of Sarasvati river as a underground river flowing east.

At the Kumbha Mela, a mass bathing festival is held at Triveni Sangam, literally &quot;confluence of the three rivers&quot;, every 12 years. The belief of Sarasvati joining at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna originates from the Puranic scriptures and denotes the &quot;powerful legacy&quot; the Vedic river left after her disappearance. The belief is interpreted as &quot;symbolic&quot;. The three rivers Sarasvati, Yamuna, Ganga are companions of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva respectively.

In lesser known configuration, Sarasvati is said to form the &quot;Triveni&quot; confluence with rivers Hiranya and Kapila at Somnath. There are several other &quot;Triveni&quot;s in India where two physical rivers are joined by the &quot;unseen&quot; Sarasvati, which adds to the sanctity of the confluence.

Romila Thapar notes that &quot;once the river had been mythologized through invoking the memory of the earlier river, its name – Sarasvati – could be applied to many rivers, which is what happened in various parts of the Indian Subcontinent.&quot;

Several present-day rivers are also named Sarasvati, after the Vedic Sarasvati:
* Sarasvati is the present-day name of a river originating in a submontane region (Ambala district) and joining the Ghaggar near Shatrana in PEPSU. Near Sadulgarh (Hanumangarh) the Naiwala channel, a dried out channel of the Sutlej, joins the Ghaggar. Near Suratgarh, the Ghaggar is then joined by the dried up Drishadvati river.
* Sarasvati is the name of a river originating in the Aravalli mountain range in Rajasthan, passing through Sidfhpur and Patan before submerging in the Rann of Kutch.
* Sarasvati River, a tributary of Alaknanda River, originates near Badrinath.
* Sarasvati River in Bengal, formerly a distributary of the Hooghly River, has dried up since the 17th century CE.

== Identification theories ==
Already since the 19th century CE, attempts have been made to identify the mythical Sarasvati of the Vedas with physical rivers. Many think that the Vedic Sarasvati river once flowed east of the Indus (Sindhu) river. Scientists, geologists as well as scholars have identified the Sarasvati with many present-day or now-defunct rivers.

Two theories are popular in the attempts to identify the Sarasvati. Several scholars have identified the river with the present-day Ghaggar-Hakra River or dried up part of it, which is located in Northwestern India and Pakistan. A second popular theory associates the river with the Helmand river or an ancient river in the present Helmand Valley in Afghanistan.

Others consider Sarasvati a mythical river, an allegory not a &quot;thing&quot;.

The identification with the Ghaggar-Hakra system took on new significance in the early 21st century CE, suggesting an earlier dating of the Rigveda, and renaming the Indus Valley Civilisation as the &quot;Sarasvati culture&quot;, the &quot;Sarasvati Civilization&quot;, the &quot;Indus-Sarasvati Civilization&quot; or the &quot;Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization,&quot; suggesting that the Indus Valley and Vedic cultures can be equated.

===Rigvedic course===
The Rigveda contains several hymns which give an indication of the flow of the geography of the river, and an identification of the Sarasvati as described in the later books of the Rigveda with the Ghaggra-Hakra:
* RV 3.23.4 mentions the Sarasvati River together with the Drishadvati River and the Āpayā River.
* RV 6.52.6 describes the Sarasvati as swollen (pinvamānā) by the rivers (sindhubhih).
* RV 7.36.6, &quot;sárasvatī saptáthī síndhumātā&quot; can be translated as &quot;Sarasvati the Seventh, Mother of Floods,&quot; but also as &quot;whose mother is the Sindhu&quot;, which would indicate that the Sarasvati is here a tributary of the Indus.
* RV 7.95.1–2, describes the Sarasvati as flowing to the samudra, a word now usually translated as &quot;ocean,&quot; but which could also mean &quot;lake.&quot;
* RV 10.75.5, the late Rigvedic Nadistuti Sukta, enumerates all important rivers from the Ganges in the east up to the Indus in the west in a clear geographical order. The sequence &quot;Ganges, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Shutudri&quot; places the Sarasvati between the Yamuna and the Sutlej, which is consistent with the Ghaggar identification.

Yet, the Rigveda also contains clues for an identification with the Helmand river in Afghanistan: 
* The Sarasvati River is perceived to be a great river with perennial water, which does not apply to the Hakra and Ghaggar. 
* The Rigveda seems to contain descriptions of several Sarasvatis. The earliest Sararvati is said to be similar to the Helmand in Afghanistan which is called the Harakhwati in the Āvestā.
* Verses in RV 6.61 indicate that the Sarasvati river originated in the hills or mountains (giri), where she &quot;burst with her strong waves the ridges of the hills (giri)&quot;. It is a matter of interpretation whether this refers only to the Himalayan foothills, where the present-day Sarasvati (Sarsuti) river flows, or to higher mountains.

The Rigveda was composed during the latter part of the late Harappan period, and according to Shaffer, the reason for the predominance of the Sarasvati in the Rigveda is the late Harappan (1900-1300 BCE) population shift eastwards to Haryana.

=== Ghaggar-Hakra River ===
The present Ghaggar-Hakra River is a seasonal river in India and Pakistan that flows only during the monsoon season, but satellite images in possession of the ISRO and ONGC have confirmed that the major course of a river ran through the present-day Ghaggar River. The supposed paleochannel of the Hakra is actually a paleochannel of the Sutlej, flowing into the Nara river bed, presently a delta channel c.q. paleochannel of the Indus River. At least 10,000 years ago, well before the rise of the Harappan civilization, the sutlej diverted its course, leaving the Ghaggar-Hakra as a monsoon-fed river. Early in the 2nd millennium BCE the monsoons diminished and the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system dried up, which affected the Harappan civilisation.

====Paleochannels and ancient course====
While there is general agreement that the river courses in the Indus Basin have frequently changed course, the exact sequence of these changes and their dating have been problematic.

=====Pre-Holocene diversion of the Sutlej and Yamuna=====
Older publications have suggested that the Sutlej and the Yamuna drained into the Hakra well into Mature Harappan times, providing ample volume to the supply provided by the monsoon-fed Ghaggar. The Sutlej and Yamuna then changed course between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE, due to either tectonic events or &quot;slightly altered gradients on the extremely flat plains,&quot; resulting in the drying-up of the Hakra in the Thar Desert. More recent publications have shown that the Sutlej and the Yamuna shifted course well before Harappan times, leaving the monsoon-fed Ghaggar-Hakra which dried-up during late Harappan times.

Clift et al. (2012), using dating of zircon sand grains, have shown that subsurface river channels near the Indus Valley Civilisation sites in Cholistan immediately below the presumed Ghaggar-Hakra channel show sediment affinity not with the Ghagger-Hakra, but instead with the Beas River in the western sites and the Sutlej and the Yamuna in the eastern ones. This suggests that the Yamuna itself, or a channel of the Yamuna, along with a channel of the Sutlej may have flowed west some time between 47,000 BCE and 10,000 BCE. The drainage from the Yamuna may have been lost from the Ghaggar-Hakra well before the beginnings of Indus civilisation.

Ajit Singh et al. (2017) show that the paleochannel of the Ghaggar-Hakra is a former course of the Sutlej, which diverted to its present course between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago, well before the development of the Harappan Civilisation. Ajit Singh et al. conclude that the urban populations settled not along a perennial river, but a monsoon-fed seasonal river that was not subject to devastating floods.

Khonde et al. (2017) confirm that the Great Rann of Kutch received sediments from a different source than the Indus, but this source stopped supplying sediments after ca. 10,000 years ago. Likewise, Dave et al. (2019) state that &quot;[o]ur results disprove the proposed link between ancient settlements and large rivers from the Himalayas and indicate that the major palaeo-fluvial system traversing through this region ceased long before the establishment of the Harappan civilisation.&quot;

According to Chaudhri et al. (2021) &quot;the Sarasvati River used to flow from the glaciated peaks of the Himalaya to the Arabian sea,&quot; and an &quot;enormous amount of water was flowing through this channel network until BCE 11,147.&quot;

=====IVC and diminishing of the monsoons=====

Many Indus Valley Civilisation (Harrapan Civilisation) sites are found on the banks of and in the proximity of the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system, due to the &quot;high monsoon rainfall&quot; which fed the Ghaggar-Hakra in Mature Harappan Times.

Giosan et al., in their study &quot;Fluvial landscapes of the Harappan civilisation&quot;, make clear that the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system was not a large glacier-fed Himalayan river, but a monsoonal-fed river. They concluded that the Indus Valley Civilisation prospered when the monsoons that fed the rivers diminished around 5,000 years ago. When the monsoons, which fed the rivers that supported the civilisation, further diminished and the rivers dried out as a result, the IVC declined some 4000 years ago. This in particular effected the Ghaggar-Hakra system, which became an intermittent river and was largely abandoned. Localized Late IVC-settlements are found eastwards, toward the more humid regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, where the decentralised late Harappan phase took place.

The same widespread aridification in the third millennium BCE also led to water shortages and ecological changes in the Eurasian steppes, leading to a change of vegetation, triggering &quot;higher mobility and transition to nomadic cattle breeding,&quot; These migrations eventually resulted in the Indo-Aryan migrations into South Asia.

====Identification with the Sarasvati====
A number of archaeologists and geologists have identified the Sarasvati river with the present-day Ghaggar-Hakra River, or the dried up part of it, despite the fact that it had already dried-up and become a small seasonal river before Vedic times.

In the late 19th century CE and early 20th century CE, a number of scholars, archaeologists and geologists have identified the Vedic Sarasvati River with the Ghaggar-Hakra River, such as Christian Lassen (1800-1876), Max Müller (1823-1900), Marc Aurel Stein (1862–1943), C.F. Oldham and Jane Macintosh. Danino notes that &quot;the 1500 km-long bed of the Sarasvati&quot; was &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the 19th century. According to Danino, &quot;most Indologists&quot; were convinced in the 19th century that &quot;the bed of the Ghaggar-Hakra was the relic of the Sarasvati.&quot;

Recent archaeologists and geologists, such as Philip and Virdi (2006), K.S. Valdiya (2013) have identified the Sarasvati with Ghaggar. According to Gregory Possehl, &quot;Linguistic, archaeological, and historical data show that the Sarasvati of the Vedas is the modern Ghaggar or Hakra.&quot;

According to R.U.S. Prasad, &quot;we [...] find a considerable body of opinions [sic] among the scholars, archaeologists and geologists, who hold that the Sarasvati originated in the Sivalik hills [...] and descended through Adi Badri, situated in the foothills of the Shivaliks, to the plains [...] and finally debouched herself into the Arabian sea at the Rann of Kutch.&quot; According to Valdiya, &quot;it is plausible to conclude that once upon a time the Ghagghar was known as &quot;Sarsutī&quot;,&quot; which is &quot;a corruption of &quot;Sarasvati&quot;,&quot; because &quot;at Sirsā on the bank of the Ghagghar stands a fortress called &quot;Sarsutī&quot;. Now in derelict condition, this fortress of antiquity celebrates and honours the river &quot;Sarsutī&quot;.&quot;

====Textual and historical objections====
Ashoke Mukherjee (2001), is critical of the attempts to identify the Rigvedic Sarasvati. Mukherjee notes that many historians and archaeologists, both Indian and foreign, concluded that the word &quot;Sarasvati&quot; (literally &quot;being full of water&quot;) is not a noun, a specific &quot;thing&quot;. However, Mukherjee believes that &quot;Sarasvati&quot; is initially used by the Rigvedic people as an adjective to the Indus as a large river and later evolved into a &quot;noun&quot;. Mukherjee concludes that the Vedic poets had not seen the palaeo-Sarasvati, and that what they described in the Vedic verses refers to something else. He also suggests that in the post-Vedic and Puranic tradition the &quot;disappearance&quot; of Sarasvati, which to refers to &quot;[going] under [the] ground in the sands&quot;, was created as a complementary myth to explain the visible non-existence of the river.

Romila Thapar terms the identification controversial and dismisses it, noticing that the descriptions of Sarasvati flowing through the high mountains does not tally with Ghaggar&#x27;s course and suggests that Sarasvati is Haraxvati of Afghanistan. Wilke and Moebus suggest that the identification is problematic since the Ghaggar-Hakra river was already dried up at the time of the composition of the Vedas, let alone the migration of the Vedic people into northern India.

Rajesh Kocchar further notes that, even if the Sutlej and the Yamuna had drained into the Ghaggar during Rigvedic, it still would not fit the Rigvedic descriptions because &quot;the snow-fed Satluj and Yamuna would strengthen lower Ghaggar. Upper Ghaggar would still be as puny as it is today.&quot;

=== Helmand river ===


An alternative suggestion for the identity of the early Rigvedic Sarasvati River is the Helmand River and its tributary Arghandab River in the Arachosia region in Afghanistan, separated from the watershed of the Indus by the Sanglakh Range. The Helmand historically besides Avestan &quot;Haetumant&quot; bore the name &quot;Haraxvaiti&quot;, which is the Avestan form cognate to Sanskrit &quot;Sarasvati&quot;. The Avesta extols the Helmand in similar terms to those used in the Rigveda with respect to the Sarasvati: &quot;The bountiful, glorious Haetumant swelling its white waves rolling down its copious flood&quot;. However unlike the Rigvedic Sarasvati, Helmand river never attained the status of a deity despite the praises in the Avesta. The identification of the &quot;Sarasvati&quot; river with the &quot;Helmand&quot; river was first proposed by Thomas (1886), followed by Alfred Hillebrandt a couple of years thereafter.

According to Konrad Klaus (1989), the geographic situation of the Sarasvati and the Helmand rivers are similar. Both flow into terminal lakes: The Helmand flows into a swamp on the Iranian plateau (the extended wetland and lake system of Hamun-i-Helmand). This matches the Rigvedic description of the Sarasvati flowing to the &quot;samudra&quot;, which according to him at that time meant &#x27;confluence&#x27;, &#x27;lake&#x27;, &#x27;heavenly lake&#x27;, &#x27;ocean&#x27;; the current meaning of &#x27;terrestrial ocean&#x27; was not even felt in the Pali Canon.

Rajesh Kocchar, after a detailed analysis of the Vedic texts and geological environments of the rivers, concludes that there are two Sarasvati rivers mentioned in the Rigveda. The early Rigvedic Sarasvati, which he calls &quot;Naditama Sarasvati&quot;, is described in Suktas 2.41, 7.36, etc. of the family books of the Rigveda, and drains into a &quot;samudra&quot;. The description of the &quot;Naditama Sarasvati&quot; in the Rigveda matches the physical features of the Helmand River in Afghanistan, more precisely its tributary the Harut River (Heu Rúd or Sabzawar River). Rajesh Kocchar, however, believes that the name &#x27;Harut&#x27; is traced to &#x27;Harauvaiti&#x27; (the name for the region of Arachosia, not a river) and Harut is not actually a part of Arachosia but of Dragiana. The later Rigvedic Sarasvati, which he calls &quot;Vinasana Sarasvati&quot;, is described in the Rigvedic Nadistuti Sukta (10.75), which was composed centuries later, after an eastward migration of the bearers of the Rigvedic culture to the western Ganga plain some 600 km to the east. The Sarasvati by this time had become a underground river, and the name was transferred to the Ghaggar which disappeared in the desert. The later Rigvedic Sarasvati is only in the post-Rigvedic Brahmanas said to disappear in the sands. According to Kocchar the Ganga and Yamuna were small streams in the vicinity of the Harut River. When the Vedic people moved east into Punjab, they named the new rivers they encountered after the old rivers they knew from Helmand, and the &quot;Vinasana Sarasvati&quot; may correspond with the Ghaggar-Hakra river.

Romila Thapar (2004) declares the identification of the Ghaggar with the Sarasvati controversial. Furthermore, the early references to the Sarasvati could be the Haraxvati plain in Afghanistan. The identification with the Ghaggar is problematic, as the Sarasvati is said to cut its way through high mountains, which is not the landscape of the Ghaggar.

=== Contemporary politico-religious meaning ===
==== Drying-up and dating of the Vedas ====
The Vedic description of the goddess Sarasvati as a mighty river, and the Vedic and Puranic statements about the drying-up and diving-under of the Sarasvati, have been used by some as a reference point for a revised dating of the Vedic culture. Some see these descriptions as a mighty river as evidence for an earlier dating of the Rigveda, identifying the Vedic culture with the Harappan culture, which flourished at the time that the Gaggar-Hakra had not dried up, and rejecting the Indo-Aryan migrations theory, which postulates a migration at 1500 BCE.

Michel Danino places the composition of the Vedas therefore in the third millennium BCE, a millennium earlier than the conventional dates. Danino notes that accepting the Rigveda accounts as a mighty river as factual descriptions, and dating the drying up late in the third millennium, are incompatible. According to Danino, this suggests that the Vedic people were present in northern India in the third millennium BCE, a conclusion which is controversial amongst professional archaeologists. Danino states that there is an absence of &quot;any intrusive material culture in the Northwest during the second millennium BCE,&quot; a biological continuity in the skeletal remains, and a cultural continuity. Danino then states that if the &quot;testimony of the Sarasvati is added to this, the simplest and most natural conclusion is that the Vedic culture was present in the region in the third millennium.&quot;

Danino acknowledges that this asks for &quot;studying its tentacular ramifications into linguistics, archaeoastronomy, anthropology and genetics, besides a few other fields&quot;.

====Identification with the Indus Valley Civilisation====
The Indus Valley Civilisation is sometimes called the &quot;Sarasvati culture&quot;, &quot;Sarasvati Civilization&quot;, &quot;Indus Ghaggar-Hakra civilisation,&quot; &quot;Indus-Sarasvati Civilization,&quot; or &quot;Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization&quot; by Hindutva revisionists subscribing to the theory of Indigenous Aryanism. The terms refer to the Sarasvati river mentioned in the Vedas, and equate the Vedic culture with the Indus Valley Civilisation. In this view, the Harappan civilisation flourished predominantly on the banks of the Ghaggar-Hakra, not the Indus. For example, Danino notes that his proposed dating of the Vedas to the third millennium BCE coincides with the mature phase of the Indus Valley civilisation, and that it is &quot;tempting&quot; to equate the Indus Valley and Vedic cultures.

Romila Thapar points out that an alleged equation of the Indus Valley civilization and the carriers of Vedic culture stays in stark contrast to not only linguistic, but also archeological evidence. She notes that the essential characteristics of Indus valley urbanism, such as planned cities, complex fortifications, elaborate drainage systems, the use of mud and fire bricks, monumental buildings, extensive craft activity, are completely absent in the Rigveda. Similarly the Rigveda lacks a conceptual familiarity with key aspects of organized urban life (e.g. non-kin labour, facets or items of an exchange system or complex weights and measures) and doesn&#x27;t mention objects found in great numbers at Indus Valley civilization sites like terracotta figurines, sculptural representation of human bodies or seals.

Hetalben Sindhav notes that claims of a large number of Ghaggar-Hakra sites are politically motivated and exaggerated. While the Indus remained an active river, the Ghaggar-Hakra dried-up, leaving many sites undisturbed. Sidhav further notes that the Ghaggar-Hakra was a tributary of the Indus, so the proposed Sarasvati nomenclatura is redundant. According to archaeologist Shereen Ratnagar, many Ghaggar-Hakra sites in India are actually those of local cultures; some sites display contact with Harappan civilization, but only a few are fully developed Harappan ones. Moreover, around 90% of the Indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites in Pakistan along the Indus river, while other places accounting only for the remaining 10%.

==== Revival ====
In 2015, Reuters reported that &quot;members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh know that proof of the physical existence of the Vedic river would bolster their concept of a golden age of Hindu Indian Subcontinent.&quot; The Bharatiya Janata Party Government had therefore ordered archaeologists to search for the river.

According to the government of Indian state of Haryana, research and satellite imagery of the region has confirmed to have found the lost river when water was detected during digging of the dry river bed at Yamunanagar. Surveys and satellite photographs confirm that there was once a great river that rose in the Himalayas, entered the plains of Haryana, flowed through the Thar-Cholistan desert of Rajasthan and eastern Sindh (running roughly parallel to the Indus) and then reached the sea in the Rann of Kutchh in Gujarat. The strange marshy landscape of the Rann of Kutchh is partly due to the fact that it was once the estuary of a great river.

The government constituted Sarasvati Heritage Development Board (SHDB) had conducted a trial run on 30 July 2016 filling the river bed with 100 cusecs of water which was pumped into a dug-up channel from tubewells at Uncha Chandna village in Yamunanagar. The water is expected to fill the channel until Kurukshetra, a distance of 40 kilometres. Once confirmed that there is no obstructions in the flow of the water, the government proposes to flow in another 100 cusecs after a fortnight. At that time, there were also plans to build three dams on the river route to keep it flowing perennially.

In 2021, the Chief Minister of the State of Haryana stated that over 70 organizations were involved with researching the Sarasvati River&#x27;s heritage, and that the river &quot;is still flowing underground from Adi Badri and up to Kutch in Gujarat.&quot;

The Sarasvati revival project seeks to build channels and dams along the route of the lost river, and develop it as a tourist and pilgrimage circuit.

<text>A vertical take-off and landing(VTOL)aircraft is one that can take off and land vertically without relying on a runway. This classification can include a variety of types of aircraft including helicopters as well as thrust-vectoring fixed-wing aircraft and other hybrid aircraft with powered rotors such as cyclogyros/cyclocopters and gyrodynes.

Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off &amp; landing), STOL (short take-off &amp; landing), or STOVL (short take-off &amp; vertical landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate as VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle taxiing. VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical or short take-off &amp; landing).

Some lighter-than-air aircraft also qualify as VTOL aircraft, as they can hover, takeoff and land with vertical approach/departure profiles.

Electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or eVTOLs, are being developed along with more autonomous flight control technologies and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) to enable advanced air mobility (AAM), that could include on-demand air taxi services, regional air mobility, freight delivery, and personal air vehicles (PAVs).

Besides the ubiquitous helicopters, there are currently two types of VTOL aircraft in military service: tiltrotor aircraft, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, and thrust-vectoring airplanes, such as the Harrier family and new F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). In the civilian sector, currently only helicopters are in general use (some other types of commercial VTOL aircraft have been proposed and are under development ). Generally speaking, VTOL aircraft capable of STOVL use the latter wherever possible, since it typically significantly increases takeoff weight, range, or payload compared to pure VTOL.

==History==
===Props, proprotors, and advanced rotorcraft===

The idea of vertical flight has been around for thousands of years, and sketches for a VTOL (helicopter) show up in Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s sketch book. Manned VTOL aircraft, in the form of primitive helicopters, first flew in 1907, but would take until after World War Two to be perfected.

In addition to helicopter development, many approaches have been tried to develop practical aircraft with vertical take-off and landing capabilities, including Henry Berliner&#x27;s 1922–1925 experimental horizontal-rotor fixed-wing aircraft, and Nikola Tesla&#x27;s 1928 patent, and George Lehberger&#x27;s 1930 patent for relatively impractical VTOL fixed wing airplanes with tilting engines. In the late 1930s, British aircraft designer Leslie Everett Baynes was issued a patent for the Baynes Heliplane, another tiltrotor aircraft. In 1941, German designer Heinrich Focke&#x27;s began work on the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269, which had two rotors that tilted downward for vertical takeoff, but wartime bombing halted development.
In May 1951, both Lockheed and Convair were awarded contracts in the attempt to design, construct, and test two experimental VTOL fighters. Lockheed produced the XFV, and Convair producing the Convair XFY Pogo. Both experimental programs proceeded to flight status and completed test flights 1954–1955, when the contracts were cancelled. Similarly, the Ryan X-13 Vertijet flew a series of test flights between 1955 and 1957, but also suffered the same fate.

The use of vertical fans driven by engines was investigated in the 1950s. The US built an aircraft where the jet exhaust drove the fans, while British projects not built included fans driven by mechanical drives from the jet engines.

NASA has flown other VTOL craft such as the Bell XV-15 research craft (1977), as have the Soviet Navy and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Sikorsky tested an aircraft dubbed the X-Wing, which took off in the manner of a helicopter. The rotors would become stationary in mid-flight, and function as wings, providing lift in addition to the static wings. Boeing X-50 is a Canard Rotor/Wing prototype that utilizes a similar concept.

A different British VTOL project was the gyrodyne, where a rotor is powered during take-off and landing but which then freewheels during flight, with separate propulsion engines providing forward thrust. Starting with the Fairey Gyrodyne, this type of aircraft later evolved into the much larger twin-engined Fairey Rotodyne, that used tipjets to power the rotor on take-off and landing but which then used two Napier Eland turboprops driving conventional propellers mounted on substantial wings to provide propulsion, the wings serving to unload the rotor during horizontal flight. The Rotodyne was developed to combine the efficiency of a fixed-wing aircraft at cruise with the VTOL capability of a helicopter to provide short-haul airliner service from city centres to airports.


The CL-84 Dynavert was a Canadian V/STOL turbine tilt-wing monoplane designed and manufactured by Canadair between 1964 and 1972. The Canadian government ordered three updated CL-84s for military evaluation in 1968, designated the CL-84-1. From 1972 to 1974, this version was demonstrated and evaluated in the United States aboard the aircraft carriers USS &quot;Guam&quot; and USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;, and at various other centres. These trials involved military pilots from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. During testing, two of the CL-84s crashed due to mechanical failures, but no loss of life occurred as a result of these accidents. No production contracts resulted.

Although tiltrotors such as the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269 of the mid-1940s and the Centro Técnico Aeroespacial &quot;Convertiplano&quot; of the 1950s reached testing or mock-up stages, the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey is considered the world&#x27;s first production tiltrotor aircraft. It has one three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. The Osprey is a multi-mission aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing capability (STOL). It is designed to perform missions like a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. The FAA classifies the Osprey as a model of powered lift aircraft.

Attempts were made in the 1960s to develop a commercial passenger aircraft with VTOL capability. The Hawker Siddeley Inter-City Vertical-Lift proposal had two rows of lifting fans on either side. However, none of these aircraft made it to production after they were dismissed as too heavy and expensive to operate.

In 2018, Opener Aero demonstrated an electrically powered fixed-wing VTOL aircraft, the Blackfly, which the manufacturer claims is the world&#x27;s first ultralight fixed-wing, all-electric, VTOL aircraft.

====Modern drones====

In the 21st century, unmanned drones are becoming increasingly commonplace. Many of these have VTOL capability, especially the quadcopter type.

===Jet lift===
====Tail-sitters====

In 1947, the Ryan X-13 Vertijet, a tailsitter design, was ordered by the US Navy, who then further issued a proposal in 1948 for an aircraft capable of VTOL aboard platforms mounted on the afterdecks of conventional ships. Both Convair and Lockheed competed for the contract but in 1950, the requirement was revised, with a call for a research aircraft capable of eventually evolving into a VTOL ship-based convoy escort fighter.

At the end of 1958, the French SNECMA Coléoptère, a tailsitter annular wing design, performed its maiden flight. However the sole prototype was destroyed on its ninth flight in 1959, and financing was never sourced for a second prototype.

====Conventional design====
Another more influential early functional contribution to VTOL was Rolls-Royce&#x27;s Thrust Measuring Rig (&quot;flying bedstead&quot;) of 1953. This led to the first VTOL engines as used in the first British VTOL aircraft, the Short SC.1 (1957), Short Brothers and Harland, Belfast which used four vertical lift engines with a horizontal one for forward thrust.

The Short SC.1 was the first British fixed-wing VTOL aircraft. The SC.1 was designed to study the problems with VTOL flight and the transition to and from forward flight. The SC.1 was designed to meet a Ministry of Supply (MoS) request for tender (ER.143T) for a vertical take-off research aircraft issued in September 1953. The design was accepted by the ministry and a contract was placed for two aircraft (XG900 and XG905) to meet Specification ER.143D dated 15 October 1954. The SC.1 was also equipped with the first &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; control system for a VTOL aircraft. This permitted three modes of control of the aerodynamic surfaces or the nozzle controls.

The Republic Aviation AP-100 was a prototype VTOL 6x General Electric J85 turbojet-engined nuclear-capable strike fighter concept designed by Alexander Kartveli that had three ducted fans in the centre of its fuselage and tail as a possible contender for the TFX Program. Another design was the A400 AVS that used variable-geometry wings but was found too complicated; however, it led to the development of the AFVG, which in turn helped the development of the Panavia Tornado.

The Yakovlev Yak-38 was a Soviet Navy VTOL aircraft intended for use aboard their light carriers, cargoships, and capital ships. It was developed from the Yakovlev Yak-36 experimental aircraft in the 1970s. Before the Soviet Union broke up, a supersonic VTOL aircraft was developed as the Yak-38&#x27;s successor, the Yak-141, which never went into production.


In the 1960s and early 1970s, Germany planned three different VTOL aircraft. One used the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter as a basis for research for a V/STOL aircraft. Although two models (X1 and X2) were built, the project was canceled due to high costs and political problems as well as changed needs in the German Air Force and NATO. The EWR VJ 101C did perform free VTOL take-offs and landings, as well as test flights beyond mach 1 in the mid- and late 60s. One of the test aircraft is preserved in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany, another outside Friedrichshafen Airport. The others were the VFW-Fokker VAK 191B light fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and the Dornier Do 31E-3 (troop) transport.

The LLRV was a spacecraft simulator for the Apollo lunar lander. It was designed to mimic the flight characteristics of the lunar exploration module (LEM), which had to rely on a reaction engine to land on the Moon.

The idea of using the same engine for vertical and horizontal flight by altering the path of the thrust was conceived by Michel Wibault. It led to the Bristol Siddeley Pegasus engine which used four rotating nozzles to direct thrust over a range of angles. This was developed side-by-side with an airframe, the Hawker P.1127, which became subsequently the Kestrel and then entered production as the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, though the supersonic Hawker Siddeley P.1154 was canceled in 1965. The French in competition with the P.1154 had developed a version of the Dassault Mirage III capable of attaining Mach 1. The Dassault Mirage IIIV achieved transition from vertical to horizontal flight in March 1966, reaching Mach 1.3 in level flight a short time later.

====V/STOL====
The Harrier is usually flown in STOVL mode, which enables it to carry a higher fuel or weapon load over a given distance. In V/STOL, the VTOL aircraft moves horizontally along the runway before taking off using vertical thrust. This gives aerodynamic lift as well as thrust lift and permits taking off with heavier loads and is more efficient. When landing, the aircraft is much lighter due to the loss of propellant weight, and a controlled vertical landing is possible. An important aspect of Harrier STOL operations aboard naval carriers is the &quot;ski jump&quot; raised forward deck, which gives the craft additional vertical momentum at takeoff.

The March 1981 cover of Popular Science showed three illustrations for its &quot;Tilt-engine V/STOL – speeds like a plane, lands like a copter&quot; front-page feature story; a followup story was part of the April 2006 issue that mentioned &quot;the fuel-consumption and stability problems that plagued earlier plane/copter.&quot;

Retired from the British Royal Navy in 2006, the Indian Navy continued to operate Sea Harriers until 2016, mainly from its aircraft carrier . The latest version of the Harrier, the BAE Harrier II, was retired in December 2010 after being operated by the British Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. The United States Marine Corps and the Italian and Spanish navies all continue to use the AV-8B Harrier II, an American-British variant. Replacing the Harrier II/AV-8B in the air arms of the US and UK is the STOVL variant of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, the F-35B.

====Rockets====

SpaceX developed several prototypes of Falcon 9 to validate various low-altitude, low-velocity engineering aspects of its reusable launch system development program. The first prototype, Grasshopper, made eight successful test flights in 2012–2013. It made its eighth, and final, test flight on October 7, 2013, flying to an altitude of before making its eighth successful VTVL landing. This was the last scheduled test for the Grasshopper rig; next up will be low altitude tests of the Falcon 9 Reusable (F9R) development vehicle in Texas followed by high altitude testing in New Mexico.

On November 23, 2015, Blue Origin&#x27;s New Shepard booster rocket made the first successful vertical landing following an uncrewed suborbital test flight that reached space. On December 21, 2015, SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage made a successful landing after boosting 11 commercial satellites to low Earth orbit on Falcon 9 Flight 20. These demonstrations opened the way for substantial reductions in space flight costs.

==Rotorcraft==

===Helicopter===

The helicopter&#x27;s form of VTOL allows it to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forwards, backwards, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft would usually not be able to take off or land. The capability to efficiently hover for extended periods of time is due to the helicopter&#x27;s relatively long, and hence efficient, rotor blades, and allows a helicopter to accomplish tasks that fixed-wing aircraft and other forms of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft could not perform at least as well until 2011.

On the other hand, the long rotor blades restrict the maximum speed to about of at least conventional helicopters, as retreating blade stall causes lateral instability.

===Autogyro===

Autogyros are also known as gyroplanes or gyrocopters. The rotor is unpowered and rotates freely in the airflow as the craft travels forward, so the craft needs a conventional powerplant to provide thrust. An autogyro is not intrinsically capable of VTOL: for VTO, the rotor must be spun up to speed by an auxiliary drive, and vertical landing requires precise control of rotor momentum and pitch.

===Gyrodyne===

Gyrodynes are also known as compound helicopters or compound gyroplanes. A gyrodyne has the powered rotor of a helicopter with a separate forward thrust system of an autogyro. Apart from take-off and landing, the rotor may be unpowered and autorotate. Designs may also include stub wings for added lift.

===Cyclogyro===

A cyclogyro or cyclocopter has a rotary wing whose axis and surfaces remain sideways across the airflow, as with a conventional wing.

==Powered lift==
There are number of designs for achieving power lift, and some designs may use more than one. There are many experimental designs that have unique design features to achieve powered lift. 

===Convertiplane===

A convertiplane takes off under rotor lift like a helicopter, then transitions to fixed-wing lift in forward flight. Examples of this include the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey

====Tiltrotor====

A tiltrotor or proprotor tilts its propellers or rotors vertically for VTOL and then tilts them forwards for horizontal wing-borne flight, while the main wing remains fixed in place.

====Tilting ducted fan====
Similar to tiltrotor concept, but with ducted fans, as can be seen in the Bell X-22.

====Tiltwing====

A tiltwing has its propellers or rotors fixed to a conventional wing and tilts the whole assembly to transition between vertical and horizontal flight.

===Tail-sitter===

A tail-sitter sits vertically on its tail for takeoff and landing, then tilts the whole aircraft forward for horizontal flight.

===Vectored thrust===

Thrust vectoring is a technique used for jet and rocket engines, where the direction of the engine exhaust is varied. In VTOL, the exhaust can be varied between vertical and horizontal thrust.

====Tiltjet====

Similar to tiltrotor concept, but with turbojet or turbofan engines instead of ones with propellers.

===Lift jets===

A lift jet is an auxiliary jet engine used to provide lift for VTOL operation, but may be shut down for normal wing-borne flight. The Yak-38 is the only production aircraft to employ lift jets.

===Lift fans===

Lift fan is an aircraft configuration in which lifting fans are located in large holes in an otherwise-conventional fixed wing or fuselage. It is used for V/STOL operation.

The aircraft takes off using the fans to provide lift, then transitions to fixed-wing lift in forward flight. Several experimental craft have been flown, but only the F-35 Lightning II entered into production.

===Lift via Coandă effect===

Aircraft in which VTOL is achieved by exploiting the Coandă effect are capable of redirecting air much like thrust vectoring, but rather than routing airflow through a duct, the airflow is simply routed along an existing surface, which is usually the body of the craft allowing less material and weight.

The Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar, or simply the VZ-9, was a Canadian VTOL aircraft developed by Avro Aircraft Ltd. which utilizes this phenomenon by blowing air into a central area, then it is directed down over the top surface, which is parabolic and resembles a bowed flying saucer. Due to the Coandă effect, the airflow is attracted to the nearest surface and continues to move along that surface despite the change in the surface&#x27;s direction away from the airflow. The craft is designed to direct the airflow downward to provide lift.

Jetoptera announced a proposed line of aircraft based on what it called fluidic propulsion that employs the Coandă effect. The company claims an Oswald efficiency number of 1.45 for its boxwing design. Other claims include increased efficiency, 30% lower weight, reduced complexity, as much as 25 dBA lower (and atonal) noise, shorter wings, and scalability. Jetoptera says its approach yields thrust augmentation ratios exceeding 2.0 and 50% fuel savings when compared to a turbofan in static or hovering conditions. Its efflux can be used for Upper Surface Blown architectures to boost the Lift Coefficient to values exceeding 8.0.

<doc id="32712" wikidata="Q3427" url="?curid=32712" title="Vega">
<text>Vega is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. It has the Bayer designation α Lyrae, which is Latinised to Alpha Lyrae and abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr. This star is relatively close at only from the Sun, and one of the most luminous stars in the Sun&#x27;s neighborhood. It is the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus.

Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed &quot;arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun&quot;. Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BCE and will be so again around the year 13,727, when its declination will be . Vega was the first star other than the Sun to have its image and spectrum photographed. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has functioned as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale and was one of the stars used to define the zero point for the UBV photometric system.

Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive, its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their main sequence lifetimes. Compared with the Sun, Vega has a lower abundance of elements heavier than helium. Vega is also a variable star—that is, a star whose brightness fluctuates. It is rotating rapidly with a speed of at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star&#x27;s photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.

Based on observations of more infrared radiation than expected, Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars that display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope show that the disk is exceptionally smooth, with no evidence of shaping by massive planets, though there is some evidence that there may be one or more Neptune-mass planets closer to the star.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;α Lyrae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Lyrae&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. The traditional name &quot;Vega&quot; (earlier &quot;Wega&quot;) comes from a loose transliteration of the Arabic word &#x27; (Arabic: واقع) meaning &quot;falling&quot; or &quot;landing&quot;, via the phrase &#x27; (Arabic: النّسر الْواقع), &quot;the falling eagle&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Vega&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

==Observation==
Vega can often be seen near the zenith in the mid-northern latitudes during the evening in the Northern Hemisphere summer. From mid-southern latitudes, it can be seen low above the northern horizon during the Southern Hemisphere winter. With a declination of +38.78°, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51° S. Therefore, it does not rise at all anywhere in Antarctica or in the southernmost part of South America, including Punta Arenas, Chile (53° S). At latitudes to the north of 51° N, Vega remains continuously above the horizon as a circumpolar star. Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses the meridian at that time. Complementarily, Vega swoops down and kisses the horizon at true North at midnight on Dec 31/Jan 1, as seen from 51° N. 
Each night the positions of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770 years, during which time the pole of the Earth&#x27;s rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BCE the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around 14,000 CE. Vega is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars. In 210,000 years, Vega will become the brightest star in the night sky, and will peak in brightness in 290,000 years with an apparent magnitude of –0.81.

This star lies at a vertex of a widely spaced asterism called the Summer Triangle, which consists of Vega plus the two first-magnitude stars Altair, in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus. This formation is the approximate shape of a right triangle, with Vega located at its right angle. The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.

==Observational history==

Astrophotography, the photography of celestial objects, began in 1840 when John William Draper took an image of the Moon using the daguerreotype process. On 17 July 1850, Vega became the first star (other than the Sun) to be photographed, when it was imaged by William Bond and John Adams Whipple at the Harvard College Observatory, also with a daguerreotype. In August 1872, Henry Draper took a photograph of Vega&#x27;s spectrum, the first photograph of a star&#x27;s spectrum showing absorption lines. Similar lines had already been identified in the spectrum of the Sun. In 1879, William Huggins used photographs of the spectra of Vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve &quot;very strong lines&quot; that were common to this stellar category. These were later identified as lines from the Hydrogen Balmer series. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

The distance to Vega can be determined by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. Giuseppe Calandrelli noted stellar parallax in 1805-6 and came up with a 4-second value for the star which was a gross overestimate. The first person to publish a star&#x27;s parallax was Friedrich G. W. von Struve, when he announced a value of 0.125 arcsecond () for Vega. Friedrich Bessel was skeptical about Struve&#x27;s data, and, when Bessel published a parallax of 0.314″ for the star system 61 Cygni, Struve revised his value for Vega&#x27;s parallax to nearly double the original estimate. This change cast further doubt on Struve&#x27;s data. Thus most astronomers at the time, including Struve, credited Bessel with the first published parallax result. However, Struve&#x27;s initial result was actually close to the currently accepted value of 0.129″, as determined by the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; astrometry satellite.

The brightness of a star, as seen from Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest in the night sky, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega and several similar stars and averaged their brightness to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega was used as a baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration and varies in brightness.

The UBV photometric system measures the magnitude of stars through ultraviolet, blue and yellow filters, producing &quot;U&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;V&quot; values, respectively. Vega is one of six A0V stars that were used to set the initial mean values for this photometric system when it was introduced in the 1950s. The mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as: = = 0. In effect, the magnitude scale has been calibrated so that the magnitude of these stars is the same in the yellow, blue and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region—wavelength range 350–850 nanometers, most of which can be seen with the human eye—so the flux densities are roughly equal; 2,000–. However, the flux density of Vega drops rapidly in the infrared, and is near at .

Photometric measurements of Vega during the 1930s appeared to show that the star had a low-magnitude variability on the order of ±0.03 magnitude (around ±2.8% luminosity). This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time, and so the subject of Vega&#x27;s variability has been controversial. The magnitude of Vega was measured again in 1981 at the David Dunlap Observatory and showed some slight variability. Thus it was suggested that Vega showed occasional low-amplitude pulsations associated with a Delta Scuti variable. This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star&#x27;s luminosity. Although Vega fits the physical profile for this type of variable, other observers have found no such variation. Thus the variability was thought to possibly be the result of systematic errors in measurement. However, a 2007 article surveyed these and other results, and concluded that &quot;A conservative analysis of the foregoing results suggests that Vega is quite likely variable in the 1–2% range, with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4% from the mean&quot;. Also, a 2011 article affirms that &quot;The long-term (year-to-year) variability of Vega was confirmed&quot;.

Vega became the first solitary main-sequence star beyond the Sun known to be an X-ray emitter when in 1979 it was observed from an imaging X-ray telescope launched on an Aerobee 350 from the White Sands Missile Range. In 1983, Vega became the first star found to have a disk of dust. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.

==Physical characteristics==
Vega&#x27;s spectral class is A0V, making it a blue-tinged white main-sequence star that is fusing hydrogen to helium in its core. Since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones, Vega&#x27;s main-sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years, a tenth of the Sun&#x27;s. The current age of this star is about 455 million years, or up to about half its expected total main-sequence lifespan. After leaving the main sequence, Vega will become a class-M red giant and shed much of its mass, finally becoming a white dwarf. At present, Vega has more than twice the mass of the Sun and its bolometric luminosity is about 40 times the Sun&#x27;s. Because it is rotating rapidly, approximately once every 16.5 hours, and seen nearly pole-on, its apparent luminosity, calculated assuming it was the same brightness all over, is about 57 times the Sun&#x27;s. If Vega is variable, then it may be a Delta Scuti type with a period of about 0.107 day.

Most of the energy produced at Vega&#x27;s core is generated by the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. This process becomes dominant at a temperature of about 17 million K, which is slightly higher than the core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun&#x27;s proton–proton chain fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the &#x27;ash&#x27; from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.

The energy flux from Vega has been precisely measured against standard light sources. At , the flux density is with an error margin of 2%. The visual spectrum of Vega is dominated by absorption lines of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n=2 principal quantum number. The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron and chromium. The X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non-existent. However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar coronal hole may be present, confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted along the line of sight.

Using spectropolarimetry, a magnetic field has been detected on the surface of Vega by a team of astronomers at the Observatoire du Pic du Midi. This is the first such detection of a magnetic field on a spectral class A star that is not an Ap chemically peculiar star. The average line of sight component of this field has a strength of gauss (G). This is comparable to the mean magnetic field on the Sun. Magnetic fields of roughly 30 G have been reported for Vega, compared to about 1 G for the Sun. In 2015, bright starspots were detected on the star&#x27;s surface—the first such detection for a normal A-type star, and these features show evidence of rotational modulation with a period of 0.68 day.

===Rotation===
Vega has a rotation period of 16.3 hours, much faster than the Sun&#x27;s rotational period but similar to, and slightly slower than, those of Jupiter and Saturn. Because of that, Vega is significantly oblate like those two planets.

When the radius of Vega was measured to high accuracy with an interferometer, it resulted in an unexpectedly large estimated value of times the radius of the Sun. This is 60% larger than the radius of the star Sirius, while stellar models indicated it should only be about 12% larger. However, this discrepancy can be explained if Vega is a rapidly rotating star that is being viewed from the direction of its pole of rotation. Observations by the CHARA array in 2005–06 confirmed this deduction.

The pole of Vega—its axis of rotation—is inclined no more than five degrees from the line-of-sight to the Earth. At the high end of estimates for the rotation velocity for Vega is along the equator, much higher than the observed (i.e. projected) rotational velocity because Vega is seen almost pole-on. This is 88% of the speed that would cause the star to start breaking up from centrifugal effects. This rapid rotation of Vega produces a pronounced equatorial bulge, so the radius of the equator is 19% larger than the polar radius, compared to just under 11% for Saturn, the most oblate of the Solar System&#x27;s planets. (The estimated polar radius of this star is solar radii, while the equatorial radius is solar radii.) From the Earth, this bulge is being viewed from the direction of its pole, producing the overly large radius estimate.

The local surface gravity at the poles is greater than at the equator, which produces a variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near , while the equatorial temperature is about . This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong gravity darkening effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower-intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean that Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium. By the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is higher at the poles. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator instead of almost pole-on, then its overall brightness would be lower.

As Vega had long been used as a standard star for calibrating telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric. With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this will allow improved instrument calibrations.

===Element abundance===
In astronomy, those elements with higher atomic numbers than helium are termed &quot;metals&quot;. The metallicity of Vega&#x27;s photosphere is only about 32% of the abundance of heavy elements in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere. (Compare this, for example, to a threefold metallicity abundance in the similar star Sirius as compared to the Sun.) For comparison, the Sun has an abundance of elements heavier than helium of about ZSol = . Thus, in terms of abundances, only about 0.54% of Vega consists of elements heavier than helium. Nitrogen is slightly &quot;more&quot; abundant, oxygen is only marginally less abundant and sulfur abundance is about 50% of solar. On the other hand, Vega has only 10% to 30% of the solar abundance for most other major elements with barium and scandium below 10%.

The unusually low metallicity of Vega makes it a weak Lambda Boötis star. However, the reason for the existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0–F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity may be the result of diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star&#x27;s hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.

The observed helium to hydrogen ratio in Vega is , which is about 40% lower than the Sun. This may be caused by the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.

===Kinematics===
The radial velocity of Vega is the component of this star&#x27;s motion along the line-of-sight to the Earth. Movement away from the Earth will cause the light from Vega to shift to a lower frequency (toward the red), or to a higher frequency (toward the blue) if the motion is toward the Earth. Thus the velocity can be measured from the amount of shift of the star&#x27;s spectrum. Precise measurements of this blueshift give a value of . The minus sign indicates a relative motion toward the Earth.

Motion transverse to the line of sight causes the position of Vega to shift with respect to the more distant background stars. Careful measurement of the star&#x27;s position allows this angular movement, known as proper motion, to be calculated. Vega&#x27;s proper motion is (mas) per year in right ascension—the celestial equivalent of longitude—and in declination, which is equivalent to a change in latitude. The net proper motion of Vega is , which results in angular movement of a degree every .

In the galactic coordinate system, the space velocity components of Vega are (U, V, W) = , for a net space velocity of . The radial component of this velocity—in the direction of the Sun—is , while the transverse velocity is . Although Vega is at present only the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, the star is slowly brightening as proper motion causes it to approach the Sun. Vega will make its closest approach in an estimated 264,000 years at a perihelion distance of .

Based on this star&#x27;s kinematic properties, it appears to belong to a stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of .

==Possible planetary system==



=== Infrared excess ===
One of the early results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the discovery of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60 and , and came from within an angular radius of () centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension on the order of a millimetre, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.

Subsequent measurements of Vega at showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, suggesting that they must instead be on the order of or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that were in the process of collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120-astronomical-unit-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than .

Following the discovery of an infrared excess around Vega, other stars have been found that display a similar anomaly that is attributable to dust emission. As of 2002, about 400 of these stars have been found, and they have come to be termed &quot;Vega-like&quot; or &quot;Vega-excess&quot; stars. It is believed that these may provide clues to the origin of the Solar System.

===Debris disks===
By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had produced high-resolution infrared images of the dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ () at a wavelength of , 70″ () at and () at . These much wider disks were found to be circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1– in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times the mass of the Earth (around 7.5 times more massive than the asteroid belt). Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.

The inner boundary of the debris disk was estimated at , or 70–. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production of the amount of dust observed over the course of Vega&#x27;s lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is more likely to have been produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star&#x27;s age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.

Observations, first with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer by David Ciardi and Gerard van Belle in 2001 and then later confirmed with the CHARA array at Mt. Wilson in 2006 and the Infrared Optical Telescope Array at Mt. Hopkins in 2011, revealed evidence for an inner dust band around Vega. Originating within of the star, this exozodiacal dust may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system. This may be caused by an intense bombardment of comets or meteors, and may be evidence for the existence of a planetary system.

The disk was also observed with ALMA in 2020, the LMT in 2022 and with Hubble STIS and JWST MIRI in 2024. The ALMA image did resolve the outer disk for the first time. The Hubble observation is the first image of the disk in scattered light and found an outer halo made up of small dust grains. JWST observations also detected the Halo, the outer disk and for the first time the inner disk. The infrared observations also showed a gap at 60 AU for the first time. The dust interior of the outer disk is consistent with dust being dragged by the Poynting-Robertson effect. The inner edge of the inner disk is hidden behind the coronagraph, but it was inferred to be 3-5 AU from photometry. The star is also surrounded by hot infrared excess, located at the sub-AU region, leaving a second gap between the inner disk and the hot dust around the star. This hot infrared excess lies within about 0.2 AU or closer and is made up of small grains, like graphite and iron and manganese oxides, which was previously verified.

===Possible planets===
Observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in 1997 revealed an &quot;elongated bright central region&quot; that peaked at 9″ () to the northeast of Vega. This was hypothesized as either a perturbation of the dust disk by a planet or else an orbiting object that was surrounded by dust. However, images by the Keck telescope had ruled out a companion down to magnitude 16, which would correspond to a body with more than 12 times the mass of Jupiter. Astronomers at the Joint Astronomy Centre in Hawaii and at UCLA suggested that the image may indicate a planetary system still undergoing formation.

Determining the nature of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an eccentric orbit. Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion resonances with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.

In 2003, it was hypothesized that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to over 56 million years, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.

Using a coronagraph on the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii in 2005, astronomers were able to further constrain the size of a planet orbiting Vega to no more than 5–10 times the mass of Jupiter. The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer, more sensitive instrumentation on the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric. No evidence was found of the blobs reported earlier, casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet. The smooth structure has been confirmed in follow-up observations by Hughes et al. (2012) and the Herschel Space Telescope.

Although a planet has yet to be directly observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system cannot yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star.

From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3-magnitude star in the Columba constellation.

In 2021, a paper analyzing 10 years of spectra of Vega detected a candidate 2.43-day signal around Vega, statistically estimated to have only a 1% chance of being a false positive. Considering the amplitude of the signal, the authors estimated a minimum mass of Earth masses, but considering the very oblique rotation of Vega itself of only 6.2° from Earth&#x27;s perspective, the planet may be aligned to this plane as well, giving it an actual mass of Earth masses. The researchers also detected a faint -day signal which could translate to Earth masses ( at 6.2° inclination) but is too faint to claim as a real signal with available data.

Observations of the disk with JWST MIRI did find a very circular face-on disk. The morphology indicate that there is no planet more massive than Saturn beyond 10 AU. The disk has a gap at around 60 AU. Gap-opening planets are inferred for disks around other stars and the team tests this idea for Vega by running simulations. The simulations have shown that a planet with &lt;6 at 65 AU would introduce interior asymetric structures that are not seen in the disk of Vega. Any gap-opening planet would need to be less massive. Additionally the inner edge of the inner disk was inferred to be 3-5 AU. Vega shows also evidence for hot infrared excess at the sub-AU region. The inner boundary of the warm debris might indicate that there is a Neptune-mass planet inside, shepherding it.

==Etymology and cultural significance==
The name is believed to be derived from the Arabic term &quot;Al Nesr al Waki&quot; النسر الواقع which appeared in the Al Achsasi al Mouakket star catalogue and was translated into Latin as &quot;Vultur Cadens&quot;, &quot;the falling eagle/vulture&quot;. The constellation was represented as a vulture in ancient Egypt, and as an eagle or vulture in ancient India. The Arabic name then appeared in the western world in the &quot;Alfonsine tables&quot;, which were drawn up between 1215 and 1270 by order of King Alfonso X. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe used the names Wega and Alvaca, and depicted it and Altair as birds.

Among the northern Polynesian people, Vega was known as &quot;whetu o te tau&quot;, the year star. For a period of history it marked the start of their new year when the ground would be prepared for planting. Eventually this function became denoted by the Pleiades.

The Assyrians named this pole star Dayan-same, the &quot;Judge of Heaven&quot;, while in Akkadian it was Tir-anna, &quot;Life of Heaven&quot;. In Babylonian astronomy, Vega may have been one of the stars named Dilgan, &quot;the Messenger of Light&quot;. To the ancient Greeks, the constellation Lyra was formed from the harp of Orpheus, with Vega as its handle. For the Roman Empire, the start of autumn was based upon the hour at which Vega set below the horizon.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Weaving Girl (asterism)&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Vega, ε Lyrae and ζ1 Lyrae. Consequently, the Chinese name for Vega is (, ). In Chinese mythology, there is a love story of Qixi () in which Niulang (, Altair) and his two children (β Aquilae and γ Aquilae) are separated from their mother Zhinü (, lit. &quot;weaver girl&quot;, Vega) who is on the far side of the river, the Milky Way. However, one day per year on the seventh day of the seventh month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, magpies make a bridge so that Niulang and Zhinü can be together again for a brief encounter. The Japanese Tanabata festival, in which Vega is known as &quot;Orihime&quot; (織姫), is also based on this legend.

In Zoroastrianism, Vega was sometimes associated with Vanant, a minor divinity whose name means &quot;conqueror&quot;.

The indigenous Boorong people of north-western Victoria, Australia, named it &quot;Neilloan&quot;, &quot;the flying loan&quot;.

In the &quot;Srimad Bhagavatam&quot;, Shri Krishna tells Arjuna, that among the Nakshatras he is Abhijit, which remark indicates the auspiciousness of this Nakshatra.

Medieval astrologers counted Vega as one of the Behenian stars and related it to chrysolite and winter savory. Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign under &quot;Vultur cadens&quot;, a literal Latin translation of the Arabic name. Medieval star charts also listed the alternate names Waghi, Vagieh and Veka for this star.

W. H. Auden&#x27;s 1933 poem &quot;A Summer Night (to Geoffrey Hoyland)&quot; famously opens with the couplet, &quot;Out on the lawn I lie in bed,/Vega conspicuous overhead&quot;.

Vega became the first star to have a car named after it with the French Facel Vega line of cars from 1954 onwards, and later on, in America, Chevrolet launched the Vega in 1971. Other vehicles named after Vega include the ESA&#x27;s Vega launch system and the Lockheed Vega aircraft.

<text>The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, commonly called the Vietnam Memorial, is a U.S. national memorial in Washington, D.C., honoring service members of the U.S. armed forces who served in the Vietnam War. The site is dominated by two black granite walls engraved with the names of those service members who died or remain missing as a result of their service in Vietnam and South East Asia during the war. The Memorial Wall was designed by American architect Maya Lin and is an example of minimalist architecture. The Wall, completed in 1982, has since been supplemented with the statue &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; in 1984 and the Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial in 1993.

The memorial is in Constitution Gardens, adjacent to the National Mall and just northeast of the Lincoln Memorial. It is maintained by the National Park Service and receives around three million visitors each year. It was initially controversial for its lack of heroic ornamentation and iconography, but its reputation improved over time. In 2007, it was ranked tenth on the &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; by the American Institute of Architects. As a national memorial, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Appearance==

===Memorial Wall===
The memorial is composed of two adjoining walls. Each wall is long and is composed of 72 black granite panels that are polished to a high finish. Seventy of the panels on each wall are inscribed with the names of the men and women being honored. The walls taper from tall at their extremities to tall at the apex where they meet, their bottom edges descending below the level of the surrounding earth while their top edges stay level. As such, visitors walking the length of the memorial start at ground level, descend below it, and ascend back to ground level. This is symbolic of a &quot;wound that is closed and healing&quot; and exemplifies the Land art movement of the 1960s, which produced sculptures that sought to reconnect with the natural environment. The stone for the 144 panels was quarried in Bangalore, India.

One wall points to the Washington Monument, the other to the Lincoln Memorial, meeting at an angle of 125° 12′. Each wall has 72 panels, 70 listing names (numbered 1E through 70E and 70W through 1W), and two very small blank panels at the extremities. A pathway for visitors extends along the base of the Wall.

The names on the Wall, originally numbering 57,939 when it was dedicated in 1982, are listed in the chronological order of the dates of casualty. Additional names have been added throughout the years since: there are 58,320 names. The number of names on the wall differs from other counts of U.S. Vietnam War deaths. Directories of the names and their locations are located on nearby podiums at both ends of the Memorial.

The memorial has had some unforeseen maintenance issues. In 1984, cracks were detected in the granite and, as a result, two of the panels were temporarily removed in 1986 for study. More cracks were later discovered in 2010. There are a number of hypotheses about the cause of the cracks, the most common being due to thermal cycling. In 1990, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund purchased several blank panels to use in case any were ever damaged; these were placed into storage at Quantico Marine Base. Two of the blank panels were shattered by the 2011 Virginia earthquake.

====Names====

Inscribed on the Memorial are the names of service members who were classified as dead, missing, or prisoner. The list includes names of individuals who died due to circumstances other than &quot;killed in action&quot;, including murder, vehicle accidents, drowning, heart attack, animal attack, snake bites and others. The names are inscribed in Optima typeface, designed by Hermann Zapf. Information about rank, unit, or decorations is not provided on the Wall itself.

Those who were confirmed as dead are denoted by a diamond shape next to the name, and those who are status unknown are denoted with a &quot;cross&quot; sign. When the death of one who was previously missing is confirmed, a diamond is superimposed over the cross. If a missing man were to return alive, which has never occurred to date, the cross is to be circumscribed by a circle.

The earliest date of eligibility for a name to be included on the Memorial is November 1, 1955, which corresponds to when President Eisenhower deployed the Military Assistance Advisory Group to train the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The last date of eligibility is May 15, 1975, which corresponds to the final day of the &quot; Mayaguez&quot; incident. The names are listed in chronological order, starting at the apex on panel 1E on July 8, 1959, moving day by day to the end of the eastern wall at panel 70E, which ended on May 25, 1968, starting again at panel 70W at the end of the western wall, completing the list for May 25, 1968, and returning to the apex at panel 1W in 1975. There are some deaths that predate July 8, 1959, including the death of Richard B. Fitzgibbon Jr. in 1956.

There are circumstances that allow for a name to be added to the Memorial, but the death must be directly attributed to a wound received within the combat zone while on active duty. The determination of addition is made by the Department of Defense. In these cases, the name is added according to the date of injury—not the date of death.

The names of 32 men were erroneously included in the memorial, and while those names remain on the wall, they have been removed from the databases and printed directories. The extra names resulted from a deliberate decision to err on the side of inclusiveness, with 38 questionable names being included. One person, whose name was added as late as 1992, had gone AWOL immediately upon his return to the United States after his second completed tour of duty. His survival only came to the attention of government authorities in 1996.

There are eight women’s names included in the memorial—Eleanor Grace Alexander, Pamela Dorothy Donovan, Carol Ann Drazba, Annie Ruth Graham, Elizabeth Ann Jones, Mary Therese Klinker, Sharon Ann Lane, and Hedwig Diane Orlowski. All were nurses.

===&quot;Three Servicemen&quot;===

A component of the Memorial, located a short distance from the Wall, is a bronze statue named &quot;Three Servicemen&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Three Soldiers&quot;). The work depicts three soldiers. Two are purposefully identifiable as European American and African American, while the third is intended to represent all other ethnic groups in America. In their final arrangement, the statue and the Wall appear to interact with one another, with the soldiers looking on in solemn tribute at the names of their fallen comrades. The distance between the two allows them to interact without affecting the design of the other.

===Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial===

The Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial is dedicated to the women of the United States who served in the Vietnam War, most of whom were nurses. It serves as a reminder of the importance of women in the conflict. It depicts three uniformed women with a wounded soldier. It is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., a short distance south of The Wall, north of the Reflecting Pool. It was authorized by separate legislation from that of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 

===In Memory memorial plaque===
A memorial plaque, authorized by an Act of Congress (), was dedicated on November 10, 2004, at the northeast corner of the plaza surrounding the Three Soldiers statue to honor veterans who died after the war as a result of injuries suffered in Vietnam, but who fall outside Department of Defense guidelines. The plaque is a carved block of black granite, , inscribed &quot;In memory of the men and women who served in the Vietnam War and later died as a result of their service. We honor and remember their sacrifice.&quot;

Ruth Coder Fitzgerald, the founder of The Vietnam War In Memory Memorial Plaque Project, worked for years to have the In Memory Memorial Plaque completed. The organization has been dissolved, but its web site is maintained by the Vietnam War Project at Texas Tech University.

==Ritual==

Visitors to the memorial began leaving sentimental items at the memorial at its opening. They continue leaving objects forty years after the dedication of the memorial. One story claims this practice began during construction when a Vietnam veteran threw the Purple Heart his brother received posthumously into the concrete of the memorial&#x27;s foundation. Several thousand items are left at the memorial each year. The largest item left at the memorial was a sliding glass storm door with a full-size replica &quot;tiger cage&quot;. The door was painted with a scene from Vietnam and the names of U.S. POWs and MIAs from the conflict. 

==History==
On April 27, 1979, four years after the fall of Saigon, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc. (VVMF) was incorporated as a non-profit organization to establish a memorial to honor the veterans of the Vietnam War. The impetus for the founding of VVMF fund came from a wounded Vietnam War veteran, Jan Scruggs, who was inspired by the film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. VVMF was joined by a volunteer cadre of Vietnam veterans, primarily former junior officers and enlisted men, among whom two emerged as principal leaders with Scruggs: West Point graduate John P. Wheeler III and Robert W. Doubek, a former Air Force intelligence officer. In recognition of their leadership, Scruggs, Wheeler, and Doubek were nominated for the Congressional Gold Medal in 1986. Eventually, $8.4 million was raised through private donations. 

On July 1, 1980, a site consisting of two acres next to the Lincoln Memorial was chosen and authorized by Congress. The World War I Munitions Building previously occupied that area. VVMF decided to choose a design for the Memorial through a national design competition, with a first prize of $20,000. The competition was open to any American over 18 years of age, and by the end of the year 1980, 2,573 individuals and teams had registered for the competition, and by the deadline of March 30, 1981, 1,421 designs were submitted. The designs were displayed at an airport hangar at Andrews Air Force Base for the selection jury, in rows covering more than of floor space. Each entry was identified by number only. All entries were examined by each juror; the entries were narrowed down to 232, then to 39. Finally, the jury selected entry number 1026, which had been designed by Maya Lin.

===Opposition to design and compromise===

The selected design was controversial, in particular due to its black color, its lack of ornamentation, and its configuration below ground level. Among other attacks, it was called &quot;a black gash of shame and sorrow.&quot; Two prominent early supporters of the project, Ross Perot and James Webb, withdrew their support once they saw the design. Webb said, &quot;I never in my wildest dreams imagined such a nihilistic slab of stone.&quot; James Watt, secretary of the interior under President Ronald Reagan, delayed issuing a building permit for the Memorial due to the political opposition.
Since its early years, criticism of the Memorial&#x27;s design faded. In the words of Scruggs, &quot;It has become something of a shrine.&quot;

Negative reactions to Maya Lin&#x27;s design created a controversy; a compromise was reached by VVMF&#x27;s agreement to add a flagstaff and a realist statue at the site. Consequently Frederick Hart (who designed the sculpture that was part of the third-place winner in the original design competition) was commissioned to produce a bronze figurative sculpture. Opponents of Lin&#x27;s design wanted to place this sculpture of three soldiers at the apex of the two walls, to make the soldiers the focal point of the memorial and the Wall a mere backdrop. In the end, the sculpture was placed in an entry plaza. On October 13, 1982, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved the addition of the flagstaff and the Hart sculptures. The statue &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; was dedicated in 1984.

===Building the memorial===
On March 11, 1982, the revised design was formally approved, and on March 26, 1982, ground was formally broken. Stone from Bangalore, India, was chosen because of its reflective quality; Cutting and fabrication of the panels were done in Barre, Vermont. The panels were then shipped to Memphis, Tennessee, where the names were inscribed. The inscriptions were done with a photoemulsion and sandblasting process. Typesetting of the original 57,939 names on the wall was performed by Datalantic in Atlanta, Georgia. The negatives used in the process are in storage at the Smithsonian Institution.

The memorial was dedicated on November 13, 1982, as part of a five-day ceremony that began on November 10, 1982, called the &quot;National Salute to Vietnam Veterans,&quot; which included a reading of names at the National Cathedral, unit reunions, an entertainers&#x27; show, a parade, the Memorial&#x27;s dedication, and a service at the Cathedral.
====Timeline for those listed on the wall====
* November 1, 1955 – Dwight D. Eisenhower deployed the Military Assistance Advisory Group, referred to now as MAAG, to train the South Vietnamese military units and secret police. However, the U.S. Department of Defense does not recognize this date since the men were supposedly training only the Vietnamese, so the officially recognized date is the formation of the Military Assistance Command Viet Nam, better known as MACV. This marked the official beginning of American involvement in the war as recognized by the memorial.
* June 8, 1956 – The first official death in Vietnam was Technical Sergeant Richard Bernard Fitzgibbon Jr., United States Air Force, of Stoneham, Massachusetts, who was murdered by another U.S.A.F. airman.
* October 21, 1957  – Capt. Harry Griffith Cramer, Jr., a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, was killed near Nha Trang, Vietnam. He served in Korea, where he was injured and awarded the Purple Heart, as well as in Vietnam. He was the first US Army soldier to be killed in the line of duty in the Vietnam War. A street at Fort Lewis, Washington, is named in his honor. He is buried at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York.
* July 8, 1959 – Chester M. Ovnand and Dale R. Buis were killed by guerrillas at Bien Hoa while watching the film &quot;The Tattered Dress&quot;. They are listed Nos. 1 and 2 at the wall&#x27;s dedication. Ovnand&#x27;s name is spelled on the memorial as &quot;Ovnard,&quot; due to conflicting military records of his surname.
* April 30, 1975 – Fall of Saigon. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs uses May 7, 1975, as the official end date for the Vietnam War era as defined by .
* May 15, 1975 – 18 U.S. servicemen (14 Marines, two Navy corpsmen, and two Air Force crewmen) are killed on the last day of a rescue operation known as the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; incident with troops from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. They are the last servicemen listed on the timeline.

Since 1982, over 400 names have been added to the memorial, but not necessarily in chronological order. Some were men who died in Vietnam but were left off the list due to clerical errors. Others died after 1982, and their deaths were determined by the Department of Defense to be the direct result of their Vietnam War service. For those who died during the war, their name is placed in a position that relates to their date of death. For those who died after the war, their name is placed in a position that relates to the date of their injury. Because space is usually not available in the exact right place, names are placed as close to their correct chronological position as possible, but usually not in the exact spot. The order could be corrected as panels are replaced.

Furthermore, over 100 names have been identified as misspelled. In some cases, the correction could be done in place. In others, the name had to be chiseled again elsewhere, moving them out of chronological order. Others have remained in place, with the misspelling, at the request of their family.

===Addition of the Women&#x27;s Memorial===
The Women&#x27;s Memorial was designed by Glenna Goodacre for the women of the United States who served in the Vietnam War. Before Goodacre&#x27;s design was selected, two design entries had been awarded as co-finalists – one a statue and the other a setting – however, the two designs were unable to be reconciled. Glenna Goodacre&#x27;s entry received an honorable mention in the contest and she was asked to submit a modified maquette (design model). Goodacre&#x27;s original design for the Women&#x27;s Memorial statue included a standing figure of a nurse holding a Vietnamese baby, which although not intended as such, was deemed a political statement, and it was asked that this be removed. She replaced them with a figure of a kneeling woman holding an empty helmet. On November 11, 1993, the Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial was dedicated. There is a smaller replica of that memorial at Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park in Angel Fire, New Mexico.

===Memorial plaque===
On November 10, 2000, a memorial plaque, authorized by , honoring veterans who died after the war as a direct result of injuries suffered in Vietnam, but who fall outside Department of Defense guidelines was dedicated. Ruth Coder Fitzgerald, the founder of The Vietnam War In Memory Memorial Plaque Project, worked for years and struggled against opposition to have the In Memory Memorial Plaque completed. The organization was disbanded, but their website is maintained by the Vietnam War Project at Texas Tech University.

===Education center===
In 2003, after some years of lobbying, the National Park Service and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund won permission from Congress to build The Education Center at The Wall. A two-story museum, located below ground just west of the Maya Lin-designed memorial, was proposed to display the history of the Vietnam War and the multiple design competitions and artworks which make up the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial, and the Memorial Plaque. The center would have also provided biographical details on and photographs of many of the 58,000 names listed on the Wall as well as the more than 6,600 servicemembers killed since 2001 fighting the War on Terror. The $115-million museum would be jointly operated by the Park Service and the Fund. A ceremonial groundbreaking for the project occurred in November 2012, but insufficient fundraising led the Fund to cancel construction of the center in September 2018 and instead focus on digital education and outreach.

==Vietnam Veterans Memorial Collection==

Items left at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial are collected by National Park Service employees and transferred to the NPS Museum Resource Center, which catalogs and stores all items except perishable organic matter (such as fresh flowers) and unaltered U.S. flags. The flags are redistributed through various channels.

From 1992 to 2003, selected items from the collection were placed on exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History as &quot;Personal Legacy: The Healing of a Nation&quot; including the Medal of Honor of Charles Liteky, who renounced it in 1986 by placing the medal at the memorial in an envelope addressed to then-president Ronald Reagan.
==Inspired works==
===Traveling replicas===
There are several transportable replicas of the Vietnam Veteran&#x27;s Memorial created so those who are not able to travel to Washington, D.C., would be able to simulate an experience of visiting the Wall.
* Using personal finances, John Devitt founded Vietnam Combat Veterans, Ltd. With the help of friends, the half-size replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, named The Moving Wall, was built and first put on display to the public in Tyler, Texas, in 1984. The Moving Wall visits hundreds of small towns and cities throughout the U.S., staying five or six days at each site. Local arrangements for each visit are made months in advance by veterans&#x27; organizations and other civic groups. The desire for a hometown visit of The Moving Wall was so high that the waiting list became very long. Vietnam Combat Veterans built a second structure of The Moving Wall. A third structure was added in 1989. In 2001, one of the structures was retired due to wear. By 2006, there had been more than 1,000 hometown visits of The Moving Wall. The count of people who visited The Moving Wall at each display ranges from 5,000 to more than 50,000; the total estimate of visitors is in the tens of millions. As the wall moves from town to town on interstates, it is often escorted by state troopers and up to thousands of local citizens on motorcycles. Many of these are Patriot Guard Riders, who consider escorting The Moving Wall to be a &quot;special mission&quot;, which is coordinated on their website. As it passes towns, even when it is not planning a stop in those towns, local veterans organizations sometimes plan for local citizens to gather by the highway and across overpasses to wave flags and salute the Wall. The first Moving Wall structure to retire has been on permanent display at the Veterans Memorial Amphitheater in Pittsburg, Kansas since 2004. The Memorial is open to the public with no admission fee, 24 hours a day, year-round.

* Duluth, Minnesota, holds the Northland Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a site that was dedicated on May 30, 1992.
* &quot;The Wall That Heals&quot; is a traveling three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial started in 1996 by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. A tractor-trailer transports the wall replica and converts to a mobile Education Center at each stop, showing letters and memorabilia left at The Wall in Washington, D.C., and more details about those whose names are shown. An earlier half-scale replica has been retired to permanent display in front of the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center in Altoona, PA.
* Created by the American Veterans Traveling Tribute, The Traveling Wall is an 80% replica Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and is long and tall at its apex. It claims to be the largest traveling replica.
* Created by Vietnam and All Veterans of Brevard, Inc, The Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall is a scale of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and is almost long and tall at the center.
* Created by Dignity Memorial, the Dignity Memorial Vietnam Wall is scale of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

===Fixed replicas===
Located at 200 S. 9th Ave in Pensacola, Florida, the first permanent replica of the National Vietnam Veterans Memorial was unveiled on October 24, 1992. Now known as &quot;Wall South,&quot; the half-size replica bears the names of all Americans killed or missing in Southeast Asia and is updated each Mother&#x27;s Day. It is the centerpiece of Veterans Memorial Park Pensacola, a -acre site overlooking Pensacola Bay, which also includes a World War I Memorial, a World War II Memorial, a Korean War Memorial, a Revolutionary War Memorial and a running series of plaques to honor local casualties from the Global War on Terror. There is also a Purple Heart Memorial, a Marine Corps Aviation Bell Tower and a monument to the submarine lifeguards who rescued Navy pilots in World War II. A Global War on Terror Memorial is planned to be completed in 2017 and will include an artifact from the World Trade Center as a component of the sculpture.

Located in Fox Park in Wildwood, New Jersey, The Wildwoods Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was unveiled and dedicated on May 29, 2010. The memorial wall is an almost half-size granite replica of the National Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the only permanent memorial north of the nation&#x27;s capital.

Plans for the Vietnam War Memorial located 401 East Ninth Street in Winfield, Kansas began in 1987 when friends who had gathered for a class reunion wanted to find a way to honor their fallen classmates. The project quickly grew from honoring only Cowley County servicemen to representing all 777 servicemen and nurses from Kansas who lost their lives or are missing in action from the Vietnam War.

Located at Freedom Park in South Sioux City, Nebraska exists a half-scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall that duplicates the original design. Dedicated in 2014, the 250-foot wall is constructed with black granite mined from the same quarry in India as the original.

Located in Layton, Utah, the Layton Vietnam Memorial Wall at 437 N Wasatch Dr, 84041, contains the names of all 58,000 Americans who died in the war. According to Utah Vietnam Veterans of America, the wall is 80 percent of the original size of the memorial in Washington, D.C., and it is the only replica of its size west of the Mississippi. The memorial was officially opened and dedicated on July 14, 2018.

Located in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, opened in 2018. This Vietnam Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Wall is 360 feet long, an 80 percent scale of the one in Washington D.C.

Missouri’s National Veterans Memorial located about 1 hour south of St. Louis, Missouri in Perryville, Missouri offers visitors an exact full-sized replica. The MNVM Board was adamant that this would be an exact replication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, character by character. Its mission is to pay tribute to all service men and women and their families and provide an environment for peaceful reflection. The memorial offers a welcome Center fully insulated from the elements, indoor military museum, scenic views, a gorgeous clear skyline and plenty of parking. All features are wheelchair accessible.

Located in Augusta, Georgia, opened in 2019, the Augusta-CSRA Vietnam War Veterans Memorial is not a replica but follows the principles set forth by the national monument of honoring those fallen in Vietnam with inscriptions of the names, 169 total, who made the supreme sacrifice in Vietnam.

===As a memorial genre===
The first US memorial to an ongoing war, the Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial in Irvine, California, is modeled on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in that it includes a chronological list of the dead engraved in dark granite. As the memorialized wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan) have not concluded, the Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial will be updated yearly. It has space for about 8000 names, of which 5,714 were engraved as of the Dedication of the Memorial on November 14, 2010.

==Cultural representations==
The Vietnam Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Wall inspired over 60 songs, identified by the Vietnam War Song Project, showing how the war has been represented in subsequent decades, performed by professional musicians and Vietnam veterans. The songs present patriotic tributes to the names on the Wall, the perspective of families and friends, as well as recriminations and anti-war sentiment. One of the first songs released on record was &quot;The Wall&quot; by Britt Small &amp; Festival, who performed the song at the memorial in November 1982, and subsequently released as a 7&quot; single. This was followed by &quot;Who are the names on the Wall?&quot;, by Vietnam veterans Michael J. Martin and Tim Holiday, also released in 1982. In 1983, contemporary folk artist Michael Jerling released &quot;Long Black Wall&quot; on the &quot;CooP Fast Folk Musical Magazine (Vol. 2, No. 4) - Political Song&quot;, published by Fast Folk. Commercially successful songs include: &quot;More Than a Name on the Wall&quot; (1989) by The Statler Brothers, which peaked at #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart; &quot;The Big Parade&quot; (1989) by 10,000 Maniacs on the album Blind Man&#x27;s Zoo, which reached #13 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart; Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Civil War&quot; (1991), which referenced the memorial, and reaching #4 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts. Other well-known songs include &quot;The Wall&quot; (2014) by Bruce Springsteen on his album &quot;High Hopes&quot; and &quot;Xmas in February&quot; (1989) by Lou Reed, released on the album &quot;New York&quot;.

==Vandalism==
There have been hundreds of incidents of vandalism at the memorial wall. Some of the most notable cases are:
* In April 1988, when a swastika and various scratches were found etched in two of the panels.
* In 1993, someone burned one of the directory stands at the entrance to the memorial.
* On September 7, 2007, an oily substance was found by park rangers on the memorial&#x27;s wall panels and paving stones. It was spread over an area of . Memorial Fund founder Jan Scruggs deplored the scene, calling it an &quot;act of vandalism on one of America&#x27;s sacred places&quot;. The removal process took a few weeks to complete.

<doc id="32714" wikidata="Q2529133" url="?curid=32714" title="Vince Foster">
<text>Vincent Walker Foster Jr. (January 15, 1945 – July 20, 1993) was an American attorney who served as deputy White House counsel during the first six months of the Clinton administration.

Foster had been a partner at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where, as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; later wrote, he rose to &quot;the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment.&quot; At the White House, he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression, and in July 1993, he was found dead of a gunshot wound in Fort Marcy Park. Five official governmental investigations ruled his death a suicide, but several conspiracy theories emerged.

==Early life and education==
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Vincent W. Foster Sr. and Alice Mae Foster (1914–2012). His father became a successful real estate developer. Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.

Vincent was a childhood friend of Bill Clinton, then known as Billy Blythe. Clinton, a year and a half younger than Foster, resided in an adjoining property to Foster&#x27;s with his grandparents while his mother was often away studying nursing. Clinton later recalled, &quot;I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster&#x27;s nice, big, white brick house.&quot; Another Clinton recollection was that Foster &quot;was kind to me and never lorded it over me the way so many older boys did with younger ones.&quot; Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton. In 1950, Clinton&#x27;s mother remarried and they relocated to a different part of Hope. By several accounts, Foster and Clinton attended Miss Marie Purkins&#x27; School for Little Folks together, a private kindergarten, although Foster was a year ahead in school. Then, around late 1952, the Clintons moved away to Hot Springs. However, Clinton would often return to visit his grandparents in Hope during summers, weekends, and holidays and he maintained connections with the people there.

Foster excelled as a student and athlete. At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty serving as vice president. He graduated from Hope High School in 1963.

Foster attended Davidson College, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology in 1967. His father wanted him to join the family real estate business, but instead, he opted to attend law school.

After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War to avoid the military draft. To be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he was managing editor of the law review. He received his Juris Doctor in 1971, graduating first in his class. He scored the highest in his class on the Arkansas bar exam.

==Marriage and family==
Foster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Davidson; she was the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville and was attending Sweet Briar College. They married on April 20, 1968, at St. Henry Catholic Church in Nashville. They had three children: Vincent III, Laura, and John.

== Career ==
===Lawyer in Arkansas===
In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in 1974 was made partner, one of only nine in the firm at the time. He was the head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients. Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate (and later first female partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman. The hiring occurred soon after Bill Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas, which led Clinton and Rodham to move from Fayetteville to Little Rock. Foster and Rodham worked together on a number of cases. And as Bill Clinton&#x27;s political career gained force, Foster supported him. They were also personal friends and Foster was the one who taught their daughter Chelsea Clinton how to swim.
Foster practiced mostly corporate law, eventually earning nearly $300,000 a year. Known for his extensive preparation of cases ahead of time, including the creation of decision trees, Foster developed a reputation as one of the best trial litigators in Arkansas. Hillary Rodham Clinton&#x27;s memoir calls Foster &quot;one of the best lawyers I&#x27;ve ever known,&quot; and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck&#x27;s portrayal of Atticus Finch in the classic 1962 film &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. In Bill Clinton&#x27;s memoir, he characterizes Foster as &quot;a tall, handsome, wise, good man.&quot; Writer Carl Bernstein has described Foster as &quot;tall, with impeccable manners and a formal mien ... elegant in perfectly tailored suits, and soft-spoken to the point of taciturnity.&quot; Writer Dan Moldea characterized him as &quot;a &#x27;can-do&#x27; lawyer who worked best when under pressure.&quot; Phillip Carroll, the leading litigator at Rose Law Firm, once said of Foster, &quot;He was my ideal of a young lawyer.&quot; The &quot;ABA Journal&quot; reported that Foster was &quot;acknowledged by many as the soul of the firm&quot;.

He appeared to experience only success at Rose Law; a partner later said, &quot;I never saw a professional setback. Never. Not even a tiny one.&quot; The firm grew five times its size during his time there. The Arkansas Bar Association gave him a number of awards and in June 1993 would name him as its Outstanding Lawyer of the Year. He was also listed in the &quot;Best Lawyers in America&quot; book. His wife Lisa described him as driven to prevail, staying up around the clock to prepare for big cases, believing he would lose the case even though he rarely did; she later viewed this as an early sign of depressed behavior.

By 1992, Vince Foster was, as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; later wrote, at &quot;the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment.&quot; He was also an established figure in Little Rock society, serving as the chair of the board of the Arkansas Repertory Theatre and belonging to the exclusive Country Club of Little Rock.

===White House counsel===
After Clinton&#x27;s 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton&#x27;s presidential transition team. Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster joined his White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993. This was despite Foster&#x27;s initial reluctance to leave his Little Rock life behind and come to Washington. There he worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, although Nussbaum would consider the pair to be &quot;co-senior partners&quot;. He was also joined with two other Rose Law Firm partners, William H. Kennedy, III, who served as his associate counsel, and Webster Hubbell, who became Associate Attorney General. The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.

Foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in Washington. Unlike some other Clinton-associated figures, he had no experience with campaigns or electoral politics. His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his senior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock. His initial role was in vetting potential administration appointees. As one subject of the vetting process later said, &quot;I wondered why I was being interviewed by the guy who would be deputy counsel. Seemed his job was to find out how honest I was, and what level of ego I was bringing. It&#x27;s a measure of how much the Clintons trusted him.&quot; But Foster found this involvement in vetting appointments to be causing him depression and anxiety. In particular, he blamed himself for the failed Zoë Baird nomination; he had thought that Baird had been justified in following her lawyer&#x27;s advice regarding the payment of taxes on household employees, but he had failed to anticipate the political backlash that led to it becoming known as &quot;Nannygate&quot; and that blemished the early days of the administration. The equally unsuccessful Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also under Foster&#x27;s purview. He had to resign from the Country Club of Little Rock once its all-white membership became a political issue for others in the administration.

As Deputy Counsel, Foster was also involved in a range of other matters, including preparation of executive orders, analyzing the legal effect of various policies, examining international treaties, discussing the ramifications of authorizations for use of military force, and authorizing expenditures within the White House. Foster worked on placing the Clintons&#x27; financial holdings into a blind trust.

He handled the Clintons&#x27; Madison Guaranty and Industrial Development Corporation paperwork and also several Whitewater-related tax returns. He worked twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, and although thin to begin with, began losing weight.

On May 8, 1993, Foster gave the commencement address at the University of Arkansas Law School, his alma mater, and said:

One faculty member listening to it recalled telling another that it was &quot;the most depressing graduation speech I had ever heard, in both content and manner.&quot; A friend of Foster&#x27;s has said, &quot;Look, it&#x27;s just crazy, right? You get one dent and it can never be fixed? In Washington, you get them all the time. You get twenty dents and you go to the body shop. Vince couldn&#x27;t see that, apparently.&quot;

==Depression and death==
Four days after the commencement speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted.
Foster was the target of several critical &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorials in June and July 1993, with titles such as &quot;Who is Vincent Foster?&quot; He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing at which he might have been called to testify. Disliking the public spotlight and having continued weight loss and insomnia, he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.

Struggling with depression, which after his death was assessed as clinical depression, Foster was prescribed the anti-depressant medication trazodone over the phone by his Arkansas doctor, starting with a low initial dosage. The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. He was 48 years old. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body.

A draft resignation letter was found torn into 27 pieces in his briefcase. The letter contained a list of grievances, including, &quot;The WSJ editors lie without consequence&quot; and saying, &quot;I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport.&quot;

His funeral mass was held at the St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in Little Rock. Bill Clinton gave a eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from Leon Russell&#x27;s &quot;A Song for You&quot;: &quot;I love you in a place that has no space and time.&quot;

Foster was buried in Memory Gardens Cemetery in his hometown of Hope. Foster was survived by his wife and three children.

===Subsequent investigations===
Five official or governmental investigations into Foster&#x27;s death all concluded that he died of suicide.

* The first investigation was conducted by the United States Park Police, in whose jurisdiction the death occurred, in 1993. Because of Foster&#x27;s position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation, as did several other state and federal agencies. The result of this investigation was released as a joint report from the Department of Justice, FBI, and the Park Police on August 10, 1993, and it stated: &quot;The condition of the scene, the medical examiner&#x27;s findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that Mr. Foster committed suicide.&quot;
* Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released on June 30, 1994, also concluded that Foster&#x27;s death was a suicide. This report made use of FBI resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists; it concluded: &quot;The overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion ... that Vincent Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993.&quot;
* A pair of investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster died of suicide: One was by Representative William F. Clinger Jr. of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who reached this conclusion in findings published on August 12, 1994. The other was by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wherein both the majority Democrats and minority Republicans on the committee developed findings that reached the same conclusion in reports issued on January 3, 1995. Theories of a cover-up persisted, however, some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.
* After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr released a report on October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide. In response, Sheila Foster Anthony, Vince Foster&#x27;s sister, said she agreed with Starr&#x27;s findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing to the existence of &quot;ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive&quot;. The inclusion of Foster&#x27;s death in the Starr investigation, and the length of time it took, was in part due to the role of Starr associate counsel Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh&#x27;s role in this became controversial two decades later during his Supreme Court nomination process.

In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in &quot;National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish&quot; that the pictures of the scene and autopsy should not be released.

==Legacy==
Foster&#x27;s death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff. White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that &quot;It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact.&quot; Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened. As it did happen, how Hillary Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff, Maggie Williams, in particular handled Foster&#x27;s files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself.

Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: &quot;I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn&#x27;t give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts [of Foster&#x27;s friends and family]. It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with.&quot;

Foster&#x27;s death also had an effect on Rose Law Firm, as many within the firm had expected Foster to become its leader once he returned from service in Washington. As one partner later said, &quot;In meetings of the partners, he didn&#x27;t often take a vocal stand. ... But when he did, it almost always swayed the firm. When he left for Washington, people here spoke openly about the emotional vacuum.&quot; Colleagues speculated that Foster might have someday become president of the state bar association or a choice for a federal judgeship.

Beginning in 1993, the Vince Foster Jr. Outstanding Lawyer Award was given out annually by the Pulaski County Bar Association to recognize members who contributed to the bar and advanced the legal profession. An endowed chair at the University of Arkansas School of Law, the Vincent Foster University Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, was created in his name. In 2015 a holder of the chair, Howard W. Brill, was appointed Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

<text>VBScript (Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition) is a deprecated programming language for scripting on Microsoft Windows using Component Object Model (COM) based on classic Visual Basic and Active Scripting.

VBScript was popular with system administrators for managing computers; automating many aspects of computing environment.

VBScript running environments include: Windows Script Host (WSH), Internet Explorer (IE), and Internet Information Services (IIS). The running environment is embeddable in other programs via the Microsoft Script Control ().

VBScript has been installed by default in every desktop release of Microsoft Windows since Windows 98; in Windows Server since Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack; and optionally with Windows CE (depending on the device it is installed on).

In October 2023, Microsoft announced that VBScript was deprecated. In May 2024, a multi-phase deprecation schedule was announced with removal planned for 2027 or later.

==History==

VBScript began as part of the Microsoft Windows Script Technologies, launched in 1996. This technology (which also included JScript) was initially targeted at web developers. During a period of just over two years, VBScript advanced from version 1.0 to 2.0, and over that time it gained support from Windows system administrators seeking an automation tool more powerful than the batch language first developed in the early 1980s. On August 1, 1996, Internet Explorer was released with features that included VBScript. 

In version 5.0, the functionality of VBScript was increased with new features including regular expressions; classes; the &quot;With&quot; statement; the &quot;Eval&quot;, &quot;Execute&quot;, and &quot;ExecuteGlobal&quot; functions to evaluate and execute script commands built during the execution of another script; a function-pointer system via GetRef, and Distributed COM (DCOM) support.

In version 5.5, &quot;SubMatches&quot; were added to the &quot;regular expression&quot; class in VBScript, to finally allow script authors to capture the text within the expression&#x27;s groups. That capability had already been available in JScript.

With the advent of the .NET Framework, the scripting team decided to implement future support for VBScript within ASP.NET for web development, and therefore no new versions of the VBScript engine would be developed. It would henceforth be supported by Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Sustaining Engineering Team&quot;, who are responsible for bug fixes and security enhancements. For Windows system administrators, Microsoft suggests migrating to Windows PowerShell, as VBScript is deprecated and will eventually be removed from Windows.

==Environments==

===Client-side web===

In a web page loaded by Internet Explorer, VBScript is similar in function to JavaScript. The VBScript code in the HTML is logic that interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page allowing for functionality not possible in HTML alone. However, other web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Opera do not support VBScript. Therefore, when client-side scripting and cross-browser compatibility are required, developers usually choose JavaScript due to its wide cross-browser compatibility.

===Active server page===

VBScript is used for server-side web page functionality via Active Server Pages (ASP). The ASP engine, , invokes to run VBScript scripts. VBScript that is embedded in an ASP page is contained within &lt;% and %&gt; context switches. The following example displays the current time in 24-hour format.
 &lt;% Option Explicit %&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;VBScript Example&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;&lt;% 
 &#x27; Grab current time from Now() function.
 &#x27; An &#x27;=&#x27; sign occurring after a context switch (&lt;%) is shorthand 
 &#x27; for a call to the Write() method of the Response object.
 Dim timeValue : timeValue = Now %&gt;
 The time, in 24-hour format, is 
 &lt;%=Hour(timeValue)%&gt;:&lt;%=Minute(timeValue)%&gt;:&lt;%=Second(timeValue)%&gt;.
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
===Windows script host===

VBScript can run directly in the operating system via the Windows Script Host (WSH). A script file, usually with extension codice_1 can be run either via for graphical user interface (GUI) or for command line interface (CLI).

===Windows script file===

A Windows Script File (WSF), styled after XML, can include multiple VBS files and is therefore a library of VBScript code that can be reused in a modular way. The files have extension codice_2 and can be executed using or , as with a codice_1 file.

===HTML Application===

An HTML Application (HTA) is styled after HTML. The HTML in the file is used to generate the user interface, and a scripting language such as VBScript is used for the program logic. The files have extension codice_4 and can be executed using .

===Windows Script Component===

VBScript can also be used in a Windows Script Component, an ActiveX-enabled script class that can be invoked by other COM-enabled applications. These files have extension .

==Functionality==

===Language features===
The VBScript language is modeled on classic Visual Basic. Notable features include:

A &quot;procedure&quot; is the main construct in VBScript for separating code into smaller modules. VBScript distinguishes between a function, which can return a result in an assignment statement, and a subroutine, which cannot. Parameters are positional, and can be passed by value or by reference.

Control structures include the usual iterative and conditional Do Loops, If-Then-Else statements, and Case statements, with some more complex variants, such as ElseIf and nested control structures.

As a memory aid in coding, and certainly for readability, there are a large number of constants, such as True and False for logical values, vbOKCancel and vbYesNo for MsgBox codes, vbBlack and vbYellow for color values, vbCR for the carriage return character, and many others.

Variables have &quot;Variant&quot; type by default, but it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to force a particular type (integer, date, etc.) using conversion functions (CInt, CDate, etc.)

User interaction is provided through the functions codice_5 and codice_6 which provide a simple dialogue box format for messages and input. Both functions display prompting messages, with the former returning a standard response, and the latter returning one user-supplied text or numeric value. For more elaborate GUI interaction with controls, VBScript can be used in combination with HTML, for example, in an HTML Application. Event-driven forms are not supported as in Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications.

Names are not case-sensitive. However, it is considered a best practice of VBScript style to be consistent and to capitalize judiciously.

===VBScript functionalities===
When hosted by the Windows Script Host, VBScript provides numerous features which are common to scripting languages, but not available from Visual Basic 6.0. These features include:

* Named and unnamed command line arguments
* Stdin and stdout, which could be redirected
* WSH.Echo which writes to the console and cannot be redirected
* WSH.ExitCode which can be tested from DOS batch files, or by the process which invoked the script file
* Network printers
* Network shares
* Special folders, e.g. Desktop, Favorites, MyDocuments and so on
* Network user information, such as group membership
* Methods for runtime execution of text defined at runtime: Eval and Execute
* Methods for executing scripts on remote machines
* Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
* Functionality for embedding a VBScript engine in other applications, using a widely known language

CScript, the command line runner, provides options for:

* Interactive or batch mode
* Invoking debug mode from the command line
* Error reporting including the line number

=== Additional functionality ===
File system management, file modification, and streaming text operations are implemented with the Scripting Runtime Library codice_7. This provides objects such as FileSystemObject, File, and TextStream, which expose the Windows file system to the programmer.

Binary file and memory I/O are provided by the &quot;ADODB.Stream&quot; class, which can also be used for string builders (to avoid excessive string concatenation, which can be costly), and to interconvert byte arrays and strings. Database access is made possible through ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), and the IIS Metabase can be manipulated using the GetObject() function with sufficient permissions (useful for creating and destroying sites and virtual directories). XML files and schemas can be manipulated with the Microsoft XML Library Application Programming Interfaces (, ), which also can be used to retrieve content from the World Wide Web via the XMLHTTP and ServerXMLHTTP objects (class strings &quot;MSXML2.XMLHTTP.6.0&quot; and &quot;MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0&quot;, respectively).

Functionality can also be added through ActiveX technologies. Security concerns have led to many ActiveX controls being blacklisted in the Internet Explorer process by Microsoft, which deploys the killbit via monthly Windows security updates to disable vulnerable Microsoft and third party code.

Programmers can utilize the extensibility via COM (ActiveX) modules to specifically equip the Script Host and VBScript with required or desired functions. The &quot;VTool&quot; component, for instance, adds a number of dialog windows, binary file access, and other functionality.

==Development tools==
Microsoft does not routinely make available an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for VBScript, although the Microsoft Script Editor has been bundled with certain versions of Microsoft Office.

For debugging purposes the Microsoft Script Debugger can still be used in current Windows versions, even though the tool has not been updated in years. It allows the user to set break points in the VBScript code but the user interface is more than clumsy.

There are VBScript debuggers available from third-party sources, and many text editors offer syntax highlighting for the language.

During execution, when an error occurs, the script host issues a message stating the type of error and the number of the offending line.

== Uses ==
Although VBScript is a general-purpose scripting language, several particular areas of use are noteworthy. First, it used to be widely used among system administrators in the Microsoft environment, but it has since been vastly surpassed by PowerShell. Second, VBScript is the scripting language for Micro Focus Unified Functional Testing, a test automation tool. A third area to note is the adoption of VBScript as the internal scripting language for some embedded applications, such as industrial operator interfaces and human machine interfaces. The hierarchical DBMS InterSystems Caché (which has its roots in the language MUMPS) also supports an implementation of VBScript, Cache BASIC, for programming stored code.

VBScript omits several useful features of the full Visual Basic, such as strong typing, extended error trapping and the ability to pass a variable number of parameters to a subroutine. However, its use is relatively widespread because it is easy to learn and because those who implement code in the language need not pay royalties to Microsoft as long as the VBScript trade mark is acknowledged. When an organization licenses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from Microsoft, as companies such as Autodesk, StatSoft, Great Plains Accounting and Visio (subsequently acquired by Microsoft) have done, it is allowed to redistribute the full VBA code-writing and debugging environment with its product.

VBScript is used in place of VBA as the macro language of Outlook 97.

VBScript can be effectively used for automating day to day office tasks as well as monitoring in the Windows-based environment. It can also be used in collaboration with ADODB ActiveX Data Objects (ADODB) for effective database connectivity.

VBScript can also be used to create malware and viruses, such as the ILOVEYOU worm that spread through email attachment in Outlook 97 that cost billions of dollars.

<text>Vintage dance is the authentic recreation of historical dance styles.

Vintage dancing styles include jazz, swing, blues, disco, and breakdancing.

==Societies==

Several vintage dance societies hold balls and events to promote and teach vintage dances.

===Connecticut===
* Hartford Underground is a vintage swing dance society in the greater Hartford area.
* The community dance hall Vinnie&#x27;s Jump &amp; Jive in Middletown frequently hosts swing and blues dance nights.
* Yale Swing, Blues, and Fusion is a &quot;noncompetitive swing and blues dancing community&quot; on Yale University&#x27;s campus. Their &quot;regular events include monthly swing dances, weekly swing, blues, and fusion practica on Sundays, weekly fusion practica on Tuesdays, and trips to local dancing events.&quot; They &quot;offer Lindy Hop and Blues lessons every semester, for a nominal fee, and invite guest instructors for dance workshops at various points throughout the year. Their &quot;events are open to everyone – undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff, and members of the broader New Haven community.&quot;

===Massachusetts===

* The Commonwealth Vintage Dancers have been active for more than 26 years and sponsor monthly vintage Victorian dance classes and balls throughout the greater Boston area. Every summer, the group gathers in Newport, Rhode Island, for week-long dance training, seaside teas, and evenings enjoying the splendors of the Gilded Age.

===California===
* The Gaskell Ball is a long-running bimonthly Victorian Ball held in Oakland, California.
* The Period Events and Entertainments Reenactment Society holds themed vintage dance events of various eras on the first Saturday of each month.
* The Bay Area Country Dance Society promotes, preserves, and teaches traditional English and American music and dance in the San Francisco Bay area.
* The Bay Area English Regency Society, another group in the San Francisco Bay area, specializes in the dances of the English Regency.

===Colorado===
* American Vernacular Dance hosts ragtime-era vintage dance events with live music, principally at the Avalon Ballroom in Boulder, Colorado. This organization hosted its first event &quot;The Columbine Ball and Tango Trot&quot;, in June 1989. It has hosted ragtime-era tea dances monthly since 1991 with the Mont Alto Ragtime and Tango Orchestra. It co-hosts annual dance weekends with vintage dance historian and dancing master Richard Powers.
* Watch Your Step! is a Boulder, Colorado-based group available for presentations, costumed performances, and instruction in vintage dance of the ragtime era through the 1930s.

===New Jersey===
*The Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts and Humanities, a nonprofit organization committed to preservation, interpretation, and cultural enrichment for Cape May&#x27;s residents and visitors, has been sponsoring vintage dance weekends in Cape May for more than 20 years. Held each April and October, these weekends provide instruction and costume dance opportunities with live music. Cape May is a National Historic landmark city at the southernmost tip of New Jersey with an unparalleled collection of Victorian-era homes.

===North Carolina===
*Since 2001, Triangle Vintage Dance has offered classes focusing on dances from the Victorian and ragtime eras for the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area. In addition to classes and a monthly dance mixer, the group also holds an annual Victorian Ball.

===Ohio===

* &gt;Flying Cloud Academy of Vintage Dance&gt;, in Cincinnati Ohio, is dedicated to the preservation, performance, and teaching of historic ballroom dance and music. The group creates and maintains a thriving vintage dance community, which provides opportunities for dancers at all levels to enjoy authentic historic dance and other related traditions. They share the love of dance through classes, performances, and the recreation of elegant evenings of dancing in period settings.

<doc id="32718" wikidata="Q745768" url="?curid=32718" title="Condorcet paradox">
<text>In social choice theory, Condorcet&#x27;s voting paradox is a fundamental discovery by the Marquis de Condorcet that majority rule is inherently self-contradictory. The result implies that it is logically impossible for any voting system to guarantee that a winner will have support from a majority of voters: for example there can be rock-paper-scissors scenario where a majority of voters will prefer A to B, B to C, and also C to A, even if every voter&#x27;s individual preferences are rational and avoid self-contradiction. Examples of Condorcet&#x27;s paradox are called Condorcet cycles or cyclic ties.

In such a cycle, every possible choice is rejected by the electorate in favor of another alternative, who is preferred by more than half of all voters. Thus, any attempt to ground social decision-making in majoritarianism must accept such self-contradictions (commonly called spoiler effects). Systems that attempt to do so, while minimizing the rate of such self-contradictions, are called Condorcet methods.

Condorcet&#x27;s paradox is a special case of Arrow&#x27;s paradox, which shows that &quot;any&quot; kind of social decision-making process is either self-contradictory, a dictatorship, or incorporates information about the strength of different voters&#x27; preferences (e.g. cardinal utility or rated voting).

== History ==
Condorcet&#x27;s paradox was first discovered by Catalan philosopher and theologian Ramon Llull in the 13th century, during his investigations into church governance, but his work was lost until the 21st century. The mathematician and political philosopher Marquis de Condorcet rediscovered the paradox in the late 18th century.

Condorcet&#x27;s discovery means he arguably identified the key result of Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem, albeit under stronger conditions than required by Arrow: Condorcet cycles create situations where any ranked voting system that respects majorities must have a spoiler effect.

==Example==
Suppose we have three candidates, A, B, and C, and that there are three voters with preferences as follows:


If C is chosen as the winner, it can be argued that B should win instead, since two voters (1 and 2) prefer B to C and only one voter (3) prefers C to B. However, by the same argument A is preferred to B, and C is preferred to A, by a margin of two to one on each occasion. Thus the society&#x27;s preferences show cycling: A is preferred over B which is preferred over C which is preferred over A.

As a result, any attempt to appeal to the principle of majority rule will lead to logical self-contradiction. Regardless of which alternative we select, we can find another alternative that would be preferred by most voters.

=== Practical scenario ===
The voters in Cactus County prefer the incumbent county executive Alex of the Farmers&#x27; Party over rival Beatrice of the Solar Panel Party by about a 2-to-1 margin. This year a third candidate, Charlie, is running as an independent. Charlie is a wealthy and outspoken businessman, of whom the voters hold polarized views.

The voters divide into three groups:

* Group 1 revere Charlie for saving the high school football team. They rank Charlie first, and then Alex above Beatrice as usual (CAB).
* Group 2 despise Charlie for his sharp business practices. They rank Charlie &quot;last&quot;, and then Alex above Beatrice as usual (ABC).
* Group 3 are Beatrice&#x27;s core supporters. They want the Farmers&#x27; Party out of office in favor of the Solar Panel Party, and regard Charlie&#x27;s candidacy as a sideshow. They rank Beatrice first and Alex last as usual, and Charlie second by default (BCA).

Therefore a majority of voters prefer Alex to Beatrice (A &gt; B), as they always have. A majority of voters are either Beatrice-lovers or Charlie-haters, so prefer Beatrice to Charlie (B &gt; C). And a majority of voters are either Charlie-lovers or Alex-haters, so prefer Charlie to Alex (C &gt; A). Combining the three preferences gives us A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; A, a Condorcet cycle.

== Likelihood ==
It is possible to estimate the probability of the paradox by extrapolating from real election data, or using mathematical models of voter behavior, though the results depend strongly on which model is used.

=== Impartial culture model ===
We can calculate the probability of seeing the paradox for the special case where voter preferences are uniformly distributed among the candidates. (This is the &quot;impartial culture&quot; model, which is known to be a &quot;worst-case scenario&quot;—most models show substantially lower probabilities of Condorcet cycles.)

For formula_1 voters providing a preference list of three candidates A, B, C, we write formula_2 (resp. formula_3, formula_4) the random variable equal to the number of voters who placed A in front of B (respectively B in front of C, C in front of A). The sought probability is formula_5 (we double because there is also the symmetric case A&gt; C&gt; B&gt; A). We show that, for odd formula_1, formula_7 where formula_8 which makes one need to know only the joint distribution of formula_2 and formula_3.

If we put formula_11, we show the relation which makes it possible to compute this distribution by recurrence: formula_12.

The following results are then obtained:

The sequence seems to be tending towards a finite limit.

Using the central limit theorem, we show that formula_13 tends to formula_14 where formula_15 is a variable following a Cauchy distribution, which gives formula_16 (constant ).

The asymptotic probability of encountering the Condorcet paradox is therefore formula_17 which gives the value 8.77%.

Some results for the case of more than three candidates have been calculated and simulated. The simulated likelihood for an impartial culture model with 25 voters increases with the number of candidates:

The likelihood of a Condorcet cycle for related models approach these values for three-candidate elections with large electorates:
* Impartial anonymous culture (IAC): 6.25%
* Uniform culture (UC): 6.25%
* Maximal culture condition (MC): 9.17%

All of these models are unrealistic, but can be investigated to establish an upper bound on the likelihood of a cycle.

=== Group coherence models ===
When modeled with more realistic voter preferences, Condorcet paradoxes in elections with a small number of candidates and a large number of voters become very rare.

=== Spatial model ===
A study of three-candidate elections analyzed 12 different models of voter behavior, and found the spatial model of voting to be the most accurate to real-world ranked-ballot election data. Analyzing this spatial model, they found the likelihood of a cycle to decrease to zero as the number of voters increases, with likelihoods of 5% for 100 voters, 0.5% for 1000 voters, and 0.06% for 10,000 voters.

Another spatial model found likelihoods of 2% or less in all simulations of 201 voters and 5 candidates, whether two or four-dimensional, with or without correlation between dimensions, and with two different dispersions of candidates.

=== Empirical studies ===
Many attempts have been made at finding empirical examples of the paradox. Empirical identification of a Condorcet paradox presupposes extensive data on the decision-makers&#x27; preferences over all alternatives—something that is only very rarely available.

While examples of the paradox seem to occur occasionally in small settings (e.g., parliaments) very few examples have been found in larger groups (e.g. electorates), although some have been identified.

A summary of 37 individual studies, covering a total of 265 real-world elections, large and small, found 25 instances of a Condorcet paradox, for a total likelihood of 9.4% (and this may be a high estimate, since cases of the paradox are more likely to be reported on than cases without).

An analysis of 883 three-candidate elections extracted from 84 real-world ranked-ballot elections of the Electoral Reform Society found a Condorcet cycle likelihood of 0.7%. These derived elections had between 350 and 1,957 voters. A similar analysis of data from the 1970–2004 American National Election Studies thermometer scale surveys found a Condorcet cycle likelihood of 0.4%. These derived elections had between 759 and 2,521 &quot;voters&quot;.

Andrew Myers, who operates the Condorcet Internet Voting Service, analyzed 10,354 nonpolitical CIVS elections and found cycles in 17% of elections with at least 10 votes, with the figure dropping to 2.1% for elections with at least 100 votes, and 1.2% for ≥300 votes.

=== Real world instances ===
A database of 189 ranked United States elections from 2004 to 2022 contained only one Condorcet cycle: the 2021 Minneapolis City Council election in Ward 2, with a narrow circular tie between candidates of the Green Party (Cam Gordon), the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, (Yusra Arab) and an independent democratic socialist (Robin Wonsley). Voters&#x27; preferences were non-transitive: Arab was preferred over Gordon, Gordon over Wonsley, and Wonsley over Arab, creating a cyclical pattern with no clear winner. Additionally, the election exhibited a downward monotonicity paradox, as well as a paradox akin to Simpson’s paradox.

==Implications==
When a Condorcet method is used to determine an election, the voting paradox of cyclical societal preferences implies that the election has no Condorcet winner: no candidate who can win a one-on-one election against each other candidate. There will still be a smallest group of candidates, known as the Smith set, such that each candidate in the group can win a one-on-one election against each of the candidates outside the group. The several variants of the Condorcet method differ on how they resolve such ambiguities when they arise to determine a winner. The Condorcet methods which always elect someone from the Smith set when there is no Condorcet winner are known as Smith-efficient. Note that using only rankings, there is no fair and deterministic resolution to the trivial example given earlier because each candidate is in an exactly symmetrical situation.

Situations having the voting paradox can cause voting mechanisms to violate the axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives—the choice of winner by a voting mechanism could be influenced by whether or not a losing candidate is available to be voted for.

=== Two-stage voting processes ===
One important implication of the possible existence of the voting paradox in a practical situation is that in a paired voting process like those of standard parliamentary procedure, the eventual winner will depend on the way the majority votes are ordered. For example, say a popular bill is set to pass, before some other group offers an amendment; this amendment passes by majority vote. This may result in a majority of a legislature rejecting the bill as a whole, thus creating a paradox (where a popular amendment to a popular bill has made it unpopular). This logical inconsistency is the origin of the poison pill amendment, which deliberately engineers a false Condorcet cycle to kill a bill. Likewise, the order of votes in a legislature can be manipulated by the person arranging them to ensure their preferred outcome wins.

Despite frequent objections by social choice theorists about the logically incoherent results of such procedures, and the existence of better alternatives for choosing between multiple versions of a bill, the procedure of pairwise majority-rule is widely-used and is codified into the by-laws or parliamentary procedures of almost every kind of deliberative assembly.

=== Spoiler effects ===
Condorcet paradoxes imply that majoritarian methods fail independence of irrelevant alternatives. Label the three candidates in a race &quot;Rock&quot;, &quot;Paper&quot;, and &quot;Scissors&quot;. In one-on-one races, Rock loses to Paper, Paper loses to Scissors, and Scissors loses to Rock. 

Without loss of generality, say that Rock wins the election with a certain method. Then, Scissors is a spoiler candidate for Paper; if Scissors were to drop out, Paper would win the only one-on-one race (Paper defeats Rock). The same reasoning applies regardless of the winner.

This example also shows why Condorcet elections are rarely (if ever) spoiled; spoilers can &quot;only&quot; happen when there is no Condorcet winner. Condorcet cycles are rare in large elections, and the median voter theorem shows cycles are impossible whenever candidates are arrayed on a left-right spectrum.

<doc id="32722" wikidata="Q1060660" url="?curid=32722" title="Virtua Fighter (video game)">
<text>is a fighting video game developed and published by Sega for arcades. It was developed for the Sega Model 1 arcade platform by AM2, a development group within Sega headed by Yu Suzuki. An early prototype version was location tested in Japan by August 1993, before the complete game was released worldwide in December 1993. It was the first arcade fighting game to feature fully 3D polygon graphics. The game was ported to Sega Saturn as a global launch title in 1994 and 1995, and also received a port to the Sega 32X.

The game was critically acclaimed and a major hit, becoming one of Sega&#x27;s best-selling arcade games of all time with more than 40,000 arcade units sold while the Saturn versions sold over copies. &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; was highly regarded for its in-depth 3D fighting engine and real-world fighting techniques, and has been revolutionary and highly influential in the evolution of the genre and video games in general. Its success led to the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series, with its sequel &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; released in 1994.

In 1995, an update titled Virtua Fighter Remix was developed and released by AM1, featuring drastic graphical improvements. This improved version was quickly ported to the Saturn console and later also received a port to Microsoft Windows. The game&#x27;s remake, Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary, was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 as a stand-alone title in Japan and as a bonus to &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; in North America.

==Gameplay==

The &quot;Virtua&quot; label indicates that the onscreen action takes place in a 3D environment; however, movement is restricted to 2D. The graphics were made using wireframe and flat-shaded quad polygons. The game retains the fighting game staple of having multiple characters, each with their own distinctive moves.

In the game&#x27;s single-player mode, the player faces all eight characters (including a duplicate of the chosen character) in a pre-determined order, followed by a fight with the game&#x27;s boss, Dural. Each fight is a best-of-three match, and the player has three ways of winning: knocking out the opponent, forcing them out of the ring, or having more health left when time runs out.

Unlike other fighting games of the early 1990s (such as &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; or &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;), the game relies on a control stick and only three buttons, punch, kick and guard (block), although different situations and button combinations led to a vast variety of moves for each character. 

==Plot==
===Characters===

* Akira Yuki—An assistant kung fu teacher from Japan, fights with Bajiquan.
* Pai Chan—A martial arts film star from Hong Kong, fights with Mizongquan.
* Lau Chan—Pai&#x27;s father and a cook from China, fights with a fictional fighting style .
* Wolf Hawkfield—A professional wrestler from Canada, fights with professional wrestling maneuvers.
* Jeffry McWild—A fisherman from Australia, fights with Pancratium.
* Kage-Maru (&quot;Kage&quot;)—A ninja from Japan, fights with Jujutsu.
* Sarah Bryant—A college student from San Francisco, CA who had been abducted and brainwashed by a criminal organization, fights with Jeet Kune Do (Sega changed her fighting style to &quot;martial arts&quot;, which also includes Tae Kwon Do, Savate and Karate as of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot;).
* Jacky Bryant—Sarah&#x27;s older brother and a race car driver also from San Francisco, fights with Jeet Kune Do.
* Dural—A gynoid that is the game&#x27;s boss character and is Kage&#x27;s missing mother, Tsukikage. She fights with a mix of all the other characters&#x27; styles.

An Arab fighter named Siba was planned, and his character model appeared on some &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; arcade cabinets (though, in some cases, Akira&#x27;s name was placed under his portrait). Siba was originally to be the protagonist of the franchise. He was ultimately dropped, but later appeared in &quot;Fighters Megamix&quot;. Two other characters were also discovered. One was an early design of Akira Yuki, who was shirtless and wore pants and shoes. The other was a military man named Jeff.

===Story===
Once in the Shōwa period, the defunct Japanese army intended to approach Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing Dynasty in their effort to take advantages. However, they were defeated by the Imperial guards who used the martial art called Hakkyoku-ken. During World War II, the Japanese army research the mysteries of Hakkyoku-ken to create supersoldiers, developing the ultimate martial art.

Approximately half a century has passed since then, the ultimate World Fighting Tournament is about to start, and all kinds of fighters from around the world engage to determine the world&#x27;s best. Behind the Tournament, however, there exists an intrigue designed by a sinister syndicate.

==Development and release==
===&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;===
The game&#x27;s development began in 1992, following the development of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; was developed to run on Sega Model 1 arcade hardware, developed internally at Sega. According to Sega of Japan&#x27;s publicity manager, Kurokawa, &quot;We deliberately didn&#x27;t publicize all the [fighting] moves at the same time but instead revealed them to gamers one at a time by means of the Japanese videogame press.&quot; &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; also used 3D motion capture technology. Before &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, Sega AM3simulated 3D using a creative method of sprite scaling on the 1993 arcade fighting game &quot;Dark Edge&quot;.

According to Suzuki, an issue during the game&#x27;s development was performing fast division calculations for 3D operations. The only applications he was aware of performing fast enough divisions at the time were nuclear reactors and space rockets. The team &quot;were working away with craftsmanship equivalent to inscribing 100 words on a single grain of rice&quot; to achieve fast 3D division operations, according to Suzuki.

An early prototype version of the arcade game featured an Arab fighter called Siba. This early version did not have Akira Yuki, who was added later in development as a replacement for Siba, with Akira becoming the game&#x27;s protagonist. This early prototype version was location tested in Japan and then demonstrated at the Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in August 1993.

&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; was a launch game for the Sega Saturn, and served as the pack-in launch game in North America. Its Sega 32X version was developed by the same team responsible for the Genesis port of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;.

===&quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot;===
&quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; was an update of the original &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; with higher-polygon models, texture mapping, and some gameplay changes. It was given free to all registered Saturn owners in the United States via mail. It had an arcade release on the ST-V (an arcade platform based on the Sega Saturn) and later ported to Microsoft Windows as &quot;Virtua Fighter PC&quot;. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their August 1, 1995, issue as being the twenty-first most-successful arcade game of the month.

===&quot;Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary&quot;===
With the 2003 PlayStation 2 release of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; arriving in time for the series&#x27; tenth anniversary, a remake of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, &quot;Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary&quot;, was released on the PlayStation 2. While the music, stages and low-polygon visual style were retained from the first game, the character roster, animations, mechanics and movesets were taken from &quot;Evolution&quot;. In the previous PS2 release of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;, a button code would make the player&#x27;s character look like a &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; model. In Japan, the game was included as part of a box set with a book called &quot;Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary: Memory of a Decade&quot; and a DVD. The box set was released in November 2003 and was published by Enterbrain. In North America, the game was included in the home version of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot;, and in Europe it was only available as a promotional item; it was not sold at retail.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
Sega began location testing an early prototype version in Japan prior to the game&#x27;s demonstration at the Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in August 1993. Sega reported it to be their highest-earning location test performance of all time, with each test machine earning a daily average of or . At the 1993 AM Show, it was rated the &quot;hit of the show&quot; by many visitors. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; on their January 1, 1994, issue as being the most-popular upright/cockpit arcade game for the previous two weeks. It went on to become Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game of 1994, and one of the highest-grossing arcade games of all time in Japan. According to &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine in 1995, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; was &quot;the biggest game in Japan since &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.&quot; In North America, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; to be the sixth most-popular upright arcade game in February 1994, and it went on to be one of America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1994. In the United Kingdom, it was the second top-grossing arcade game in London during early 1994 (below &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;), and went on to be one of the most popular coin-ops of the year.

&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; sold more than 40,000 arcade units worldwide by 1996, with each unit costing between and £14,000 / . &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; (1994) became Sega&#x27;s best-selling arcade games of all time, surpassing their previous record holder &quot;Out Run&quot; (1986).

Following its demonstration at the 1993 AM Show, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; received a positive industry reception. &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine called &quot;the adaptation of 3-D polygon graphics to video fighting games&quot; a &quot;sensational development that could define and revitalize this already-hot category.&quot; California Games CEO Pat Schroeder said &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; &quot;was by far the dawn of a new era of games&quot; with praise for the &quot;computerized 3-D graphics with effects that are unreal&quot; and how it &quot;shows the fighting action&quot; from different angles. &quot;Edge&quot; magazine called &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; &quot;a tantalising glimpse into the future of fighting games employing the same ground-breaking CG computer graphics system as &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;.&quot; While criticizing the appearance of the &quot;excessively blocky polygonised people,&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; said &quot;the 3D scrolling, animation and movement are all silky-smooth and very realistic&quot; and that &quot;the fluid animation and imaginative camera angles quickly won the audience over.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; hailed &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as a demonstration of &quot;just how far video games have come in the last eight years.&quot; &quot;EGM&quot; made particular note of the advanced graphics, how the camera moves along different axes depending on the fighters&#x27; location, the use of multiple viewpoints in the instant replay, the high quality of the gameplay, and the smoothness and realism of the animation.

In January 1994, Rik Skews of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine, after playing for 1 hour, initially praised the &quot;brilliant 64-bit&quot; 3D graphics, animation and camera work but compared the gameplay unfavorably to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; was later more positive towards the gameplay, stating in December 1994 that the game &quot;combined cutting edge arcade technology with motion capture techniques and some excellent gameplay design.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; said in 1995 that it epitomized Yu Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;skill of finding the perfect blend of state-of-the-art technology with solid gameplay&quot; in &quot;the cut-throat world&quot; of arcades.

===Ports===
The console port of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, which was very close to the arcade game, sold at a nearly 1:1 ratio with the Saturn hardware during the Japanese launch. The Future Publishing magazine &quot;Ultimate Future Games&quot; called &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; the &quot;game that killed&quot; the 16-bit machines. The Saturn version sold 630,000 units in Japan, while &quot;Remix&quot; sold a further 437,036 units there in 1995, for a combined total of 1,067,036 units sold for the Saturn in Japan.

On release of the Saturn version, &quot;Sega Saturn Tsūshin&quot; scored the game a 38 out of 40. &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; would score the same version a 36 out of 40 five months later. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed a Japanese import in December 1994, stating &quot;the last machine to generate so much interest in this office was the arrival of&quot; the Super Famicom with &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. Steve James praised the &quot;superlative&quot; moves, &quot;amazingly crisp&quot; sound samples, and &quot;totally realistic&quot; action; Mark Patterson, while criticizing the high UK import price of (), concluded with &quot;credit to Sega for producing an excellent machine, and even more to AM2 for its near-perfect conversion of this fantastic game.&quot; In a review of the Japanese release, &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the retention of the fighters, moves, varying camera angles, and controls of the arcade version, as well as the improved voice and sound effects and home version options, and concluded it to be &quot;one of the best games ever bundled with a system&quot;. Their later review of the North American release was similarly laudatory, but remarked that &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; for the soon-to-launch PlayStation were even better. &quot;Next Generation&quot;, which also reviewed the game prior to the Saturn&#x27;s USA launch, disagreed, contending that &quot;What &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; lacks in &quot;[Battle Arena] Tohshinden&quot;″s immediate graphical punch, it makes up for in grinding longevity.&quot; They particularly praised the game&#x27;s depth and realism, and summarized that &quot;The Saturn &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; is, to all intents and purposes, the coin-op game brought home. And away from the arcade, under the harsh light of unhurried examination, its merits grow.&quot;

&quot;Maximum&quot; gave it five out of five stars, calling it &quot;a stunningly close conversion that is quite possibly the best game available for the machine.&quot; They remarked that the innovations such as the 3D motion capture remained impressive, as well as the depth and variety of the character&#x27;s gameplay application: &quot;every fighter has almost limitless scope for coming up with all-new attacks.&quot; They also praised the &quot;very clever mixture of superbly exaggerated sound effects coupled with a tangible, realistic impact for every blow.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; were more subdued in their reaction, but two of their four reviewers commented that it was nearly identical to the arcade version. They scored it 31.5 out of 40 (average 7.875 out of 10). &quot;Edge&quot; rated the Saturn version 9/10, stating: &quot;Saturn &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; has all the pulling power of the arcade version, including the swooping, gliding game camera, the stylish polygon characters, the totally convincing animation and the compulsive gameplay ... [The graphics] were impressive enough in the original, but on the Saturn, under the kind of intense scrutiny you can never give a game in the arcades, they emerge as simply astounding ... It&#x27;s arguably the first true &#x27;next generation&#x27; console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound&quot;.

&quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; gave &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; five out of five stars, saying that it fixed the glitches and graphics of the original game while maintaining the already excellent gameplay. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored &quot;Remix&quot; 29 out of 40 (average 7.25 out of 10). The reviewers praised all the game&#x27;s improvements, but most of them concluded that it was still not worth buying for players who already owned the original game. &quot;Maximum&quot; likewise praised the quality of the game and its low price tag, but felt it was not worth buying, with the release of the even better Saturn conversion of &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; less than a month away. They scored it four out of five stars. The staff of &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave it five out of five stars, applauding the graphical improvements and glitch fixes. They commented: &quot;Perhaps never in videogame history has a problem such as &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; been so quickly and thoroughly corrected. &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; contains all the great gameplay of the original without any of the weak spots.&quot; Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the game a highly positive review for its graphical enhancements and retention of all the excellent gameplay of the original Saturn version. &quot;GamePro&quot; also ran two reader-submitted reviews for the game; King Kane argued that the graphical and audio improvements make the game worth trying even for those who are not fans of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, while Tricky Ricky argued that though the game is an impressive upgrade, the lack of changes to the gameplay make its appeal quickly fade. &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; a 35 out of 40, and the Sega 32X version of the game a 30 out of 40. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game, and stated that &quot;The drawback of all Titan games, including &quot;Remix&quot;, is that the technology isn&#x27;t as advanced, fast, or powerful as Model 2B [...] and these games are really like playing fast Saturn games in the arcade.&quot;

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored the 32X version 30.5 out of 40 (average 7.625 out of 10), calling it an excellent conversion given the system it&#x27;s on, but dated next to the graphically superior Saturn version and especially &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot;, both of which had already been released. &quot;GamePro&quot; also noted that the 32X version suffers from more slowdown and fewer polygons than the Saturn version, as well as &quot;tinny sound quality&quot;, but praised the additional options not included in the Saturn version and rated it as an overall strong port. A critic for &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly said that the 32X version is not as impressive looking as the Saturn version but has more options and fewer glitches, making it an overall excellent port. He argued that the game was not worth buying a 32X for, since the system was not powerful enough to handle ports of &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot; or &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; (which was soon to be released for the Saturn), but that it was an essential purchase for those who already own a 32X.

In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; rated the arcade version 16th in its Top 100 Video Games. At the time, they called &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;: &quot;The most satisfying fighter in existence.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Virtua Fighter PC&quot; the 121st-best computer game ever released. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; eighth on their &quot;The GamesMaster Saturn Top 10.&quot;

==Legacy and impact==

&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; dispensed with sprite-based graphics, replacing them with flat-shaded polygons rendered in real-time, by the Model 1&#x27;s 3D-rendering hardware, allowing for effects and technologies that were impossible in sprite-based fighters, such as characters that could move in three dimensions, and a dynamic camera that could zoom, pan and swoop dramatically around the arena. It has been credited with both introducing and popularizing the use of polygon-based 3D graphics in fighting games. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said in 1995 that &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; was &quot;arguably the most significant game&quot; of the 1990s. &quot;1UP&quot; listed it as one of the 50 most important games of all time. They credited &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; for creating the 3D fighting game genre, and more generally, demonstrating the potential of 3D polygon human characters (as the first to implement them in a useful way), showing the potential of realistic gameplay (introducing a character physics system and realistic character animations), and introducing fighting game concepts such as the ring-out and the block button.

At a time when fighting games were becoming increasingly focused on violence and shock value, the popularity of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; demonstrated that fighting games focused on gameplay were still commercially viable. Nintendo&#x27;s Shigeru Miyamoto said that for several years after &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; was released he was disinterested in making fighting games because he felt that &quot;I was beaten to the punch when &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; came out&quot;, and that any fighting game he produced would have been perceived as an attempt to copy &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. Game designer Yasuyuki Oda remarked that he was impressed by this video game while working for SNK. In particular, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with the game&#x27;s strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;&#x27;s fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites.

&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. Some of the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) staff involved in the creation of the original PlayStation video game console credit &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as inspiration for the PlayStation&#x27;s 3D graphics hardware. According to SCE&#x27;s former producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, the PlayStation was originally being considered as a 2D focused hardware, and it was not until the success of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; in the arcades that they decided to design the PlayStation as a 3D focused hardware. Toby Gard also cited &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as an influence on the use of polygon characters—and the creation of Lara Croft—in &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;: &quot;It became clear to me watching people play &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, which was kind of the first big 3D-character console game, that even though there were only two female characters in the lineup, in almost every game I saw being played, someone was picking one of the two females.&quot; John Romero also cited &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as a major influence on the creation of 3D first-person shooter &quot;Quake&quot;. Team Ico&#x27;s Fumito Ueda also cited &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as an influence on his animation work.

<text>The &quot;Virginia&quot; class, or the SSN-774 class, is the newest class of nuclear-powered cruise missile fast attack submarines in service with the United States Navy. The class is designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, including anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering operations. They are scheduled to replace older s, many of which have already been decommissioned. &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines will be acquired through 2043, and are expected to remain in service until at least 2060, with later submarines expected to operate into the 2070s.

On 14 March 2023, the trilateral Australian-British-American security pact known as AUKUS announced that the Royal Australian Navy would purchase three &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines as a stopgap measure between the retirement of their conventionally powered s and the acquisition of the future SSN-AUKUS class submarines. If SSN-AUKUS falls behind schedule, Australia will have the option of purchasing two additional &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines.

== History ==
The class was developed under the codename Centurion, later renamed New SSN (NSSN). The &quot;Centurion Study&quot; was initiated in February 1991. The &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine was the first US Navy warship with its development coordinated using such 3D visualization technology as CATIA, which comprises computer-aided engineering (CAE), computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management (PLM). Design problems for Electric Boat—and maintenance problems for the Navy—ensued nonetheless.

By 2007 approximately 35 million labor hours had been spent to design the &quot;Virginia&quot; class. Constructing a single &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine has required around nine million labor hours, and over 4,000 suppliers. Each submarine is projected to make 14–15 deployments during its 33-year service life.

The &quot;Virginia&quot; class was intended in part as a less expensive alternative to the ($1.8 billion vs $2.8 billion), whose production run was canceled after just three boats had been completed. To reduce costs, the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines use many &quot;commercial off-the-shelf&quot; (COTS) components, especially in their computers and data networks. Improvements in shipbuilding technology have trimmed production costs below the $1.8 billion projected fiscal year 2009 dollars.

In hearings before both House of Representatives and Senate committees, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and expert witnesses testified that the annual procurement rate of only one &quot;Virginia&quot;-class boat—rising to two in 2012—would result in excessive unit production costs, yet an insufficient complement of attack submarines. In a 10 March 2005 statement to the House Armed Services Committee, Ronald O&#x27;Rourke of the CRS testified that, assuming that the production rate remains as planned, &quot;production economies of scale for submarines would continue to remain limited or poor.&quot;

In 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding and the General Dynamics Electric Boat Company built a quarter-scale version of a &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine dubbed Large Scale Vehicle II (LSV II) &quot;Cutthroat&quot;. The vehicle was designed as an affordable test platform for new technologies.

The &quot;Virginia&quot; class is built through an industrial arrangement designed to maintain both GD Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding, the only two U.S. shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered submarines. Under the present arrangement, the Newport News facility builds the stern, habitability, machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room and control room. The facilities alternate work on the reactor plant as well as the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery.

O&#x27;Rourke wrote in 2004 that, &quot;Compared to a one-yard strategy, approaches involving two yards may be more expensive but offer potential offsetting benefits.&quot; Among the claims of &quot;offsetting benefits&quot; that O&#x27;Rourke attributes to supporters of a two-facility construction arrangement is that it &quot;would permit the United States to continue building submarines at one yard even if the other yard is rendered incapable of building submarines permanently or for a sustained period of time by a catastrophic event of some kind&quot;, including an enemy attack.

To get the submarine&#x27;s price down to $2 billion per submarine in FY-05 dollars, the Navy instituted a cost-reduction program to shave off approximately $400 million of each submarine&#x27;s price tag. The project was dubbed &quot;2 for 4 in 12&quot;, referring to the Navy&#x27;s desire to buy two boats for $4 billion in FY-12. Under pressure from Congress, the Navy opted to start buying two boats per year in FY-11, meaning that officials would not be able to get the $2 billion price tag before the service started buying two submarines per year. However, program manager Dave Johnson said at a conference on 19 March 2008 that the program was only $30 million away from achieving the $2 billion price goal, and would reach that target on schedule.

The &quot;Virginia&quot;-class Program Office received the David Packard Excellence in Acquisition Award in 1996, 1998, 2008, &quot;for excelling in four specific award criteria: reducing life-cycle costs; making the acquisition system more efficient, responsive, and timely; integrating defense with the commercial base and practices; and promoting continuous improvement of the acquisition process&quot;.

In December 2008, the Navy signed a $14 billion contract with General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman to supply eight submarines. The contract required the delivery of one submarine in each of fiscal 2009 and 2010, and two submarines on each of fiscal 2011, 2012, and 2013. This contract was designed to bring the Navy&#x27;s &quot;Virginia&quot;-class fleet to 18 submarines. In December 2010, the United States Congress passed a defense authorization bill that expanded production to two subs per year. Two submarine-per-year production resumed on 2 September 2011 with commencement of construction.

On 21 June 2008, the Navy christened , the first Block II submarine. This boat was delivered eight months ahead of schedule and $54 million under budget. Block II boats are built in four sections, compared to the ten sections of the Block I boats. This enables a cost saving of about $300 million per boat, reducing the overall cost to $2 billion per boat and the construction of two new boats per year. Beginning in 2010, new submarines of this class were to have included a software system that can monitor and reduce their electromagnetic signatures when needed.

The first full-duration six-month deployment was successfully carried out from 15 October 2009 to 13 April 2010. Authorization of full-rate production and the declaration of full operational capability was achieved five months later. In September 2010, it was found that urethane tiles, applied to the hull to damp internal sound and absorb rather than reflect sonar pulses, were falling off while the subs were at sea. Admiral Kevin McCoy announced that the problems with the Mold-in-Place Special Hull Treatment for the early subs had been fixed in 2011, then &quot;Minnesota&quot; was built and found to have the same problem.

In 2013, just as two-per-year sub construction was supposed to commence, Congress failed to resolve the United States fiscal cliff, forcing the Navy to attempt to &quot;de-obligate&quot; construction funds.

In April 2019, the CRS reported that the Navy estimated the cost of a boat was $2.8 billion. In July 2023, the CRS reported that the Navy estimates at the present production rate of two boats per year that the cost per boat when equipped with the additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM) mid-body section was $4.3 billion.

On 14 September 2023, at a Senate confirmation hearing, Admiral Lisa Franchetti said that the US Navy would have to work with builders to raise the rate of production from 1.2/year to 2.2/year to meet the AUKUS target.

== Innovations ==

The &quot;Virginia&quot; class incorporates several innovations not found in previous US submarine classes.

=== Technology barriers ===
Because of the low rate of &quot;Virginia&quot; production, the Navy entered into a program with DARPA to overcome technology barriers to lower the cost of attack submarines so that more could be built, to maintain the size of the fleet.

These include:
* Propulsion concepts not constrained by a centerline shaft.
* Externally stowed and launched weapons (especially torpedoes).
* Conformal alternatives to the existing spherical sonar array.
* Technologies that eliminate or substantially simplify existing submarine hull, mechanical, and electrical systems.
* Automation to reduce crew workload for standard tasks

=== Unified Modular Masts ===
&quot;Virginia&quot;-class subs are the first class where all masts share common design – the Universal Modular Mast (UMM) – designed by L3 KEO (previously Kollmorgen). Shared components have been maximized and some design choices are also shared between different masts. The first UMM was installed on , a &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine. The UMM is an integrated system for housing, erecting, and supporting submarine mast-mounted antennas and sensors. The UMMs are the following:
* Snorkel mast
* Two photonic masts
* Two communication masts
* One or two high-data-rate satellite communication (SATCOM) masts, built by Raytheon, enabling communication at super high frequency (for downlink) and extremely high frequency (for uplink) range
* Radar mast (carrying AN/BPS-16 surface search and navigation radar)
* Electronic warfare mast (AN/BLQ-10 Electronic Support Measures) used to detect, analyze, and identify both radar and communication signals from ships, aircraft, submarines, and land-based transmitters

===Photonics masts===
The &quot;Virginia&quot; class is the first to utilize photonic sensors instead of a traditional periscope. The class is equipped with high-resolution cameras, along with light-intensification and infrared sensors, an infrared laser rangefinder, and an integrated Electronic Support Measures (ESM) array. Two redundant sets of these sensors are mounted on two AN/BVS-1 photonics masts located outside the pressure hull. Signals from the masts&#x27; sensors are transmitted through optical fiber data lines through signal processors to the control center. Visual feeds from the masts are displayed on liquid-crystal display interfaces in the command center.

The design of earlier optical periscopes required them to penetrate the pressure hull, reducing the structural integrity of the pressure hull as well as increasing the risk of flooding, and also required the submarine&#x27;s control room to be located directly below the sail/fin. Implementation of photonics masts (which do not penetrate the pressure hull) enabled the submarine control room to be relocated to a position inside the pressure hull which is not necessarily directly below the sail.

The current photonics masts have a visual appearance so different from ordinary periscopes that when the submarine is detected, it can be distinctly identified as a &quot;Virginia&quot;-class vessel. As a result, current photonic masts will be replaced with Low-Profile Photonics Masts (LPPM) which resemble traditional submarine periscopes more closely.

In the future, a non-rotational Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast may be fitted, enabling the submarine to obtain a simultaneous 360° view of the sea surface.

=== Propulsor ===
In contrast to a traditional bladed propeller, the &quot;Virginia&quot; class uses pump-jet propulsors by BAE Systems, originally developed for the Royal Navy&#x27;s s. The propulsor significantly reduces the risks of cavitation, and allows quieter operation.

=== Improved sonar systems ===
Sonar arrays aboard &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines have an &quot;Open System Architecture&quot; (OSA) which enables rapid insertion of new hardware and software as they become available. Hardware upgrades (dubbed Technology Insertions) are usually carried out every four years, while software updates (dubbed Advanced Processor Builds) are carried out every two years. &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines feature several types of sonar arrays.
* BQQ-10 bow-mounted spherical active/passive sonar array (Large Aperture Bow (LAB) sonar array from SSN-784 onward)
* A wide aperture lightweight fiber optic sonar array, consisting of three flat panels mounted low along either side of the hull
* Two high frequency active sonars mounted in the sail and bow. The chin-mounted (below the bow) and sail-mounted high frequency sonars supplement the (spherical/LAB) main sonar array, enabling safer operations in coastal waters, enhancing under-ice navigation, and improving anti-submarine warfare performance.
* Low-Cost Array (LCCA) high frequency sonar, mounted on both sides of the submarine&#x27;s sail. Provides coverage above and behind the submarine.

&quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines are also equipped with a low frequency towed sonar array and a high frequency towed sonar array.
* TB-16 or TB-34 fat line tactical towed sonar array
* TB-29 or TB-33 thin line long-range search towed sonar array

=== Rescue equipment ===
* Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment MK11 suit(s) that enable ascent from a sunken submarine (maximum ascent depth )
* Lithium hydroxide canisters that remove carbon dioxide from the submarine&#x27;s atmosphere
* Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (SEPIRB)

=== Virginia Payload Module ===

The Block III submarines have two multipurpose Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) replacing the dozen single purpose cruise missile launch tubes.

The Block V submarines built from 2019 onward will have an additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM) mid-body section, increasing their overall length. The VPM will add four more VPTs of the same diameter and greater height, located on the centerline, carrying up to seven Tomahawk missiles apiece, that would replace some of the capabilities lost when the SSGN conversion s are retired from the fleet. Initially eight payload tubes/silos were planned but this was later rejected in favor of four tubes installed in a long module between the operations compartment and the propulsion spaces.

The VPM could potentially carry (non-nuclear) medium-range ballistic missiles. Adding the VPM would increase the cost of each submarine by $500 million (2012 prices). This additional cost would be offset by reducing the total submarine force by four boats. More recent reports state that as a cost reduction measure the VPM would carry only Tomahawk SLCM and possibly unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) with the new price tag now estimated at $360–380 million per boat (in 2010 prices). The VPM launch tubes/silos will reportedly be similar in design to the ones planned for the &quot;Ohio&quot; class replacement. In July 2016 General Dynamics was awarded $19 million for VPM development. In February 2017 General Dynamics was awarded $126 million for long lead time construction of Block V submarines equipped with VPM.

The VPM was designed by General Dynamics Electric Boat; however, manufacturing is undertaken by BWX Technologies and BAE Systems.

===High-energy laser weapon===
According to open-source budget documents, &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines are planned to be equipped with a high-energy laser weapon likely to be incorporated into the photonics mast and have a power output of 300–500 kilowatts, based on the submarine&#x27;s 30 megawatts reactor capacity.

=== Other improved equipment ===

* Optical fiber fly-by-wire &quot;Ship Control System&quot; replaces electro-hydraulic systems for control surface actuation.
* Command and control system module (CCSM) built by Lockheed Martin.
* The auxiliary generator is powered by a Caterpillar model 3512B V-12 marine diesel engine. This replaced the Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine, which would not fit in &quot;Virginia&quot;″s auxiliary machinery room.
* Modernized version of the AN/BSY-1 integrated combat system designated AN/BYG-1 (previously designated CCS Mk2) and built by General Dynamics AIS (previously Raytheon). AN/BYG-1 integrates the submarine Tactical Control System (TCS), Payload Control System (PCS) (formerly Weapon Control System (WCS)), and Information Assurance (IA).
* USS &quot;California&quot; was the first &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine with the advanced electromagnetic signature reduction system built into it, but this system is being retrofitted into the other submarines of the class.
* Integral 9-man lock-out diving chamber.

This would increase the total number of torpedo-sized weapons (such as Tomahawks) carried by the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class design from about 37 to about 65—an increase of about 76%.
* Decoys: Acoustic Device Countermeasure Mk 3/4

== Blocks ==
=== Block I ===

Block I includes 4 boats and modular construction techniques were incorporated during construction. Earlier submarines (e.g., &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class SSNs) were built by assembling the pressure hull and then installing the equipment via cavities in the pressure hull. This required extensive construction activities within the narrow confines of the pressure hull which was time-consuming and dangerous. Modular construction was implemented in an effort to overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine. Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.
=== Block II ===

Block II comprised 6 boats; they were built in four sections rather than ten, saving about $300 million per boat. Block II boats (except the &quot;New Hampshire&quot;) were also built under a multi-year procurement agreement as opposed to a block-buy contract in Block I, enabling savings in the range of $400 million ($80 million per boat). As a result of improvements in the construction process, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; (SSN-778) was US$500 million cheaper, required 3.7 million fewer labor hours to build (25% less), thus shortening the construction period by 15 months (20% less) compared to &quot;Virginia&quot;.
=== Block III ===

Construction of Block III, through SSN-791 (8 boats), began in 2009. Block III subs feature a revised bow with a Large Aperture Bow (LAB) sonar array, as well as technology from &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSGNs (2 VLS tubes each containing 6 missiles). The horseshoe-shaped LAB sonar array replaces the spherical main sonar array which has been used on all U.S. Navy SSNs since 1960. The LAB sonar array is water-backed—as opposed to earlier sonar arrays which were air-backed—and consists of a passive array and a medium-frequency active array. Compared to earlier &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines about 40% of the bow has been redesigned.

&quot;South Dakota&quot; (SSN-790) will be equipped with a new propulsor, possibly the Hybrid Multi-Material Rotor (HMMR), developed by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Hybrid Multi-Material Rotor program is an attempt to improve the design and manufacturing process of submarine propellers with an aim of reducing the cost and weight of the propeller/rotor as well as improving overall acoustic performance.

=== Block IV ===

Block IV consists of 10 submarines. The 2013 budget sequestration put this 10-submarine in doubt by budget sequestration that same year. The most costly shipbuilding contract in history, worth $17.6 billion, was awarded on 28 April 2014 to General Dynamics Electric Boat. The main improvement over the Block III is the reduction of major maintenance periods from four to three, increasing each boat&#x27;s total lifetime deployments by one.

The long-lead-time materials contract for SSN-792 was awarded on 17 April 2012, with SSN-793 and SSN-794 following on 28 December 2012. The U.S. Navy has awarded General Dynamics Electric Boat a $208.6 million contract modification for the second fiscal year (FY) 14 &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine, SSN-793, and two FY 15 submarines, SSN-794 and SSN-795. With this modification, the overall contract is worth $595 million. 

===Block V===
Block V has 12 boats and may incorporate the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which would give guided-missile capability when the SSGNs are retired from service. The Virginia Payload Module will be included on Block V submarines starting with the second boat, SSN-803. The Block V boats with VPM are expected to triple the capacity of shore targets for each boat. Construction on the first two boats of this block was expected to begin in 2019 but was pushed back to 2020, with contracts for long lead time material for SSN-802 and SSN-803 being awarded to General Dynamics Electric Boat. HII Newport News Shipbuilding was awarded a long-lead materials contract for two Block V boats in 2017, the first Block Vs for the company.

On 2 December 2019, the Navy announced an order for nine new &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines—eight Block Vs and one Block IV—for a total contract price of $22 billion with an option for a tenth boat. The Block V subs were confirmed to have an increased length, from 377 ft (115 m) to 460 ft (140 m), and displacement, from 7,800 tons to 10,200 tons. This would make the Block V the second-longest US submarine, behind only the s (at 560 ft; 170 m).

On 22 March 2021, the U.S. Navy added the 10th boat of the Block V series of the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class attack submarine, issuing a $2.4 billion adjustment on the December 2019 contract. This brings the total cost of the contract with prime contractor General Dynamics Electric Boat to $24.1 billion. The net increase for the contract is $1.89 billion, according to a General Dynamics release. Huntington Ingalls Industries&#x27; Newport News Shipbuilding is the partner yard in the program.

== Boats in class ==
=== Future acquisitions ===
The Navy initially planned to acquire at least 30 &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines, however, more recent data provided by the Naval Submarine League (in 2011) and the Congressional Budget Office (in 2012) seems to imply that more than 30 submarines may eventually be built. The Naval Submarine League believes that up to 10 Block V boats will be built. The same source also states that 10 additional submarines could be built after Block V submarines, with 5 in the so-called Block VI and 5 in Block VII, largely due to the delays experienced with the &quot;Improved &quot;Virginia&quot;&quot;. These 20 submarines (10 Block V, 5 Block VI, 5 Block VII) would carry VPM bringing the total number of &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines to 48 (including the 28 submarines in Blocks I, II, III and IV). The CBO in its 2012 report states that 33 &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines will be procured in the 2013–2032 timeframe, resulting in 49 submarines in total since 16 were already procured by the end of 2012. Such a long production run seems unlikely but another naval program, the , is still ongoing even though the first vessel was ordered in 1985. However, other sources believe that production will end with Block V. In addition, data provided in CBO reports tends to vary considerably compared to earlier editions.

One Block VI submarine will include an organic ability to employ seabed warfare equipment.

General Dynamics Electric Boat, a business unit of General Dynamics, announced on 5 August 2024 it has been awarded a $1.3 billion undefinitized contract modification allowing Electric Boat to purchase long lead time materials for Virginia Class Block VI submarines.

During the Naval Submarine League&#x27;s annual symposium on 13 November 2024 plans for extending Virginia class to Block VIII - due to SSN(X) delays - were voiced.

==SSN(X)/Improved &quot;Virginia&quot;==

Initially dubbed Future Attack Submarine and Improved &quot;Virginia&quot; class in early Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports, the SSN(X) will instead be a largely new design that initially supplements and eventually replaces the &quot;Virginia&quot; class submarines.

In late 2014, the US Navy began early preparation work on the SSN(X). It was planned that the first submarine would be procured in 2025. However, their introduction (i.e., procurement of the first submarine) has been pushed back to 2033/2034. The long-range shipbuilding plan is for the new SSN to be authorized in 2034, and become operational by 2044 after the last Block VII &quot;Virginia&quot; is built. Roughly a decade would be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe.

In 2019, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the SSN(X) boats could cost up to $5.5 billion per hull. The current &quot;Virginia&quot;-class boats cost about $2.8 billion per hull, while the Block V boats with the 80-foot Virginia Payload Module will cost about $3.2 billion. &quot;The Navy indicates that the next-generation attack submarine should be faster, stealthier, and able to carry more torpedoes than the &quot;Virginia&quot; class, similar to the &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class submarine. CBO therefore assumed that the SSN(X) would be a &quot;Seawolf&quot;-sized SSN, which displaces about 9,100 tons when submerged, and would have an all-new design in keeping with the Navy&#x27;s description of it as a fast, lethal next-generation attack submarine&quot;, the CBO wrote.

== Potential exports ==
On 16 September 2021, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia had canceled its contract with French shipbuilder Naval Group for 12 diesel-electric submarines based on the French nuclear submarine that were to replace Australia&#x27;s diesel-electric s. The AUKUS trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, was announced the same day. Under the pact, the US will share nuclear propulsion technology with Australia the same as it has with the UK since 1958 as will the UK. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) would acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons with basic design and key technologies decided by an 18-month research project. On 22 November 2021, Australia, UK and the US signed the &quot;Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information Agreement&quot; (ENNPIA) treaty to share classified information about nuclear propulsion.

On 13 March 2023, AUKUS announced that &quot;in the early 2030s, pending Congressional approval, the United States intends to sell Australia three &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed&quot;. These submarines will ensure there is no capability gap between when the &quot;Collins&quot;-class is retired and the introduction of a new class of nuclear-powered submarines the SSN-AUKUS. AUKUS also announced on the same day, the UK&#x27;s SSNR submarine design will be renamed SSN-AUKUS and be trilaterally developed and built in the UK and in Australia. The SSN-AUKUS class &quot;will have a high degree of commonality&quot; with the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class, including &quot;sharing elements of the propulsion plant, combat system and weapons&quot;.

The first in-service United States Navy Block IV &quot;Virginia&quot;-class boat is planned to be sold to the RAN in 2032 and the second in-service Block IV in 2035. The third boat to be sold to the RAN in 2038 will be a new Block VII without the Virginia Payload Module. The first boat of the SSN-AUKUS class for the RAN is planned to be delivered in the early 2040s. Five boats are planned to be built with a boat built every three years. If the SSN-AUKUS build schedule falls behind, the RAN has the option of purchasing up to two additional &quot;Virginia&quot;-class boats.

<text>The Vectrex is a vector display-based home video game console, the only one ever designed and released for the home market, that was developed by Smith Engineering and manufactured and sold by General Consumer Electronics. It was first released for the North America market in October 1982 and then Europe and Japan in 1983. Originally produced by General Consumer Electronics, it was later licensed to Milton Bradley after they acquired the company. Bandai released the system in Japan.

The Vectrex, in contrast to other video game systems at the time, did not need to be hooked up to a television set; it had an integrated (vertically oriented) monochrome CRT monitor. A detachable wired control pad could be folded into the lower base of the console. Games came with translucent color overlays to place over the screen. Optional peripherals include a pair of 3D goggles known as the &quot;3D Imager&quot; and a light pen for drawing directly on the screen. The &quot;Asteroids&quot;-inspired &quot;Mine Storm&quot; was built into the system.

The console was conceived by John Ross, of Smith Engineering, in late 1980 as a handheld called the &quot;Mini Arcade&quot;. As development progressed, it morphed into a tabletop system that was manufactured by General Consumer Electronics. Strong initial sales caused General Consumer Electronics to be acquired by Milton Bradley. However, sales of the Vectrex soon stalled amid the video game crash of 1983, and the system was discontinued in early 1984.

Despite its commercial failure, the Vectrex was praised for its software library, unique graphical capabilities, and built-in monitor. Several publications lauded it as one of the best consoles available at the time. The Vectrex was the first console to have a 3D-based peripheral. A color handheld version of the Vectrex was conceived in the late 1980s, but was shelved because of its manufacturing cost and the success of the Nintendo Game Boy.

==History==

The Vectrex was conceived by John Ross of Smith Engineering. He, Mike Purvis, Tom Sloper, and Steve Marking had gone to Electro-Mavin, a surplus warehouse in Los Angeles. They found a 1-inch cathode-ray tube (CRT) and wondered if a small electronic game could be made of it. A demonstration of a vector-drawing cathode-ray tube display was made by connecting the deflection yoke in a standard television to the channels of a stereo amplifier fed with music program material. An auxiliary yoke was used to keep the raster television&#x27;s horizontal fly-back high-voltage system running. The demo led to a system originally conceived as a handheld called the Mini Arcade but, as Smith Engineering shopped the idea around to developers, it evolved into a tabletop with nine-inch screen.

The system was licensed to General Consumer Electronics in 1981. After a brief hardware and software development period, the Vectrex was unveiled on 7 June 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. It was publicly released in seven select introductory markets in October at a retail price of US$199 before being distributed nationally in the first quarter of 1983. The launch sales were strong enough that Milton Bradley bought out General Consumer Electronics in early 1983.

Milton Bradley&#x27;s greater resources allowed the Vectrex to be released in parts of Europe by mid-1983 and, through a co-branding agreement with Bandai, in Japan as well. However, the video game crash of 1983 turned Milton Bradley&#x27;s support of the Vectrex into a costly mistake, even despite reducing its price by 25% and then later 50% in desperation to sell units. In February 1984, after losing $31.6 million on the Vectrex, Milton Bradley announced the discontinuation of the console and cancelled development of new games. The company&#x27;s entire inventory of consoles and accessories was sold off to mass-market discount houses, where they were liquidated at a fraction of the console&#x27;s introductory price. By May 1984, Milton Bradley merged with Hasbro and after-market support ended.

Prior to the Vectrex&#x27;s discontinuation, a successor console with a color screen had been planned. After the rights reverted to Smith Engineering, the company made plans to revive the Vectrex as a handheld, but the imminent arrival of Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy put an end to those plans. In the mid-1990s, Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering, allowed new hardware and software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis. Smith has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not-for-profit basis to allow Vectrex owners to obtain the original titles at low cost or for free.

==Design and technical specifications==
The Vectrex&#x27;s CPU is a Motorola 68A09 clocked at 1.5 MHz, with 1 KB of RAM (two 4-bit 2114 chips) and 8 KB ROM (one 8-bit 2363 chip). It also uses a MOS Technology 6522 versatile interface adapter (VIA). Games are stored on ROM cartridges that are 32 KB in size. Controller inputs and audio are provided by a General Instrument AY-3-8912 sound chip. Sound is played through a 3-inch electrodynamic paper cone speaker.

The computer and vector generator were designed by Gerry Karr. The computer runs the game&#x27;s computer code, watches the user&#x27;s inputs, runs the sound generator, and controls the vector generator to make the screen drawings. The vector generator is an all-analog design using two integrators: X and Y. The computer sets the integration rates using a digital-to-analog converter. The computer controls the integration time by momentarily closing electronic analog switches within the operational-amplifier based integrator circuits. Voltage ramps are produced that the monitor uses to steer the electron beam over the face of the phosphor screen of the cathode-ray tube. Another signal is generated that controls the brightness of the line.

The cathode-ray tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 monochrome unit measuring 9 × 11 inches, displaying a picture of 240 mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob on the back of the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard raster-based television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the deflection yoke. This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV deflection yoke. The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen&#x27;s phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized &quot;Asteroids&quot; arcade machine.

During development, the possibility of using the MOS Technology 6502 processor was considered, but later its performance was considered insufficient.

Early units have a very audible &quot;buzzing&quot; from the built-in speaker that reacts to the graphics generated on screen. This is due to improper production grounding of signal lines of the low-level audio circuitry, and was eventually resolved in later production models. A &quot;ground loop&quot; had been created by a grounding strap added in production to meet U.S. Federal Communications Commission signal radiation requirements. This idiosyncrasy has become a familiar characteristic of the machine.

==Peripherals==
===3-D Imager===

The 3-D Imager, invented by John Ross, turns the 2-D black-and-white images drawn by the Vectrex into a color 3-D experience. The imager works by spinning a disk in front of the viewer&#x27;s eyes. The disk is black for 180 degrees and in some cases has 60 degree wedges of transparent red, green, and blue filters. The user looks through this to the Vectrex screen. The Vectrex synchronizes the rotation of the disk to the software frame rate as it draws 6 screens: with the right eye covered: the left eye red image, then green, and then the blue image is drawn, and then, while the left eye is covered by the black 180-degree sector: the right eye red, green, and then the blue image is drawn. Only one eye will see the Vectrex screen and its 3 associated images (or colors) at any one time while the other will be blocked by the 180-degree mask. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Viewmaster. The disc spins freely and is driven by a motor. The Vectrex software generates its own frame-rate and compares it to an index signal from the glasses once per revolution. Score is kept of how many wheel rotations are early compared to the software frame rate, and how many are late. The software tries to keep these two trends equal by adjusting the power being delivered to the motor that spins the filter and mask wheel. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control the motor speed: the ratio of the &quot;on&quot; time versus the &quot;off&quot; time of a rapid stream of power pulses to the motor. In this way the software synchronizes the rotation of the wheel to the software&#x27;s frame rate, or drawing time, for the combined and repeating group of up to 6 evolving images.

A single object that does not lie on the plane of the monitor (&quot;i.e.&quot;, in front of or into the monitor) is drawn at least twice to provide information for each eye. The distance between the duplicate images and the angles from which they are drawn will determine where the object will appear to &quot;be&quot; in 3-D space. The 3-D illusion is also enhanced by adjusting the brightness of the object (dimming objects in the background). Spinning the disk at a high enough speed will fool the viewer&#x27;s eyes/brain into thinking that the multiple images it is seeing are two different views of the same object due to the persistence of vision. This creates the impression of 3-D and color.

The same 3-D effect is in fact possible with raster or film-projection images, and the shutter glasses used in some 3-D theaters and virtual reality theme park rides work on the same principle.

===Light pen===
The light pen allows the user to &quot;draw&quot;, to create images and to indicate, on the screen. It has a photo-detector that can see the bright spot of the vector-drawing display monitor when it goes by under the light pen&#x27;s position where it is being held to the screen. The photo-detector feeds internal pulse-catching circuits that tell the Vectrex and its software of the event. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Marks-A-Lot felt-tipped marker pen. The Vectrex draws a spider-web-like search-pattern to track the pen&#x27;s location. The software changes the pattern size as the pen changes motions and velocity in an attempt keep a continuous lock on the pen&#x27;s position. The Vectrex light pen was invented by John Ross.

==Screen overlays==

In order to enhance the display visuals of the Vectrex, every commercially released game included its own unique translucent plastic screen overlay that accompanied the cartridge (a concept first seen with the Magnavox Odyssey, as well as some early arcade machines). Instead of physically touching the CRT screen, four tabs on the Vectrex console securely held them in place in front of it, with a small gap between the actual screen and the overlay. Made up of one to three colors for the play field area, these overlays simulate simple color graphics (on an otherwise black and white screen), helped reduced glare, flicker and gave the appearance of a flat screen. They also allowed changes in brightness intensity of vector graphics to be more visually distinctive. In some cases game designers created pseudo color cycling effects, for a sense of movement, by using alternating colored patterns. In addition to players&#x27; score areas, some overlays also contained additional artwork and patterns, to add to the game&#x27;s play field. Across the bottom of each overlay are game-specific joystick and button functions as a guide for the player. Each overlay also displayed the title and logo of each game, along with a colored border or design, to add cosmetic flair to the Vectrex (much like an arcade machine with its marquee or side art). Overlays were not required, but added to the experience in terms of the visual look of game graphics and the overall display appearance of the console.

==Software==
Some of the Vectrex&#x27;s library consisted of ports of arcade hits, most of them brought to the console through a licensing deal with Cinematronics.

The liquor company Old Mr. Boston gave out a limited number of customized &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; cartridges, with a Mr. Boston sticker on the box. The overlay was the regular &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; overlay with the Mr. Boston name, logo, and copyright info running up either side. The game itself had custom text, and the player controlled a top hat rather than a vacuum. &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; was written by Richard Moszkowski.

==Reception==
&quot;Byte&quot; in 1982 called Vectrex &quot;one of the greatest game machines we have seen this year ... [Vectrex] is a good bet to score big with the consumer&quot;. The magazine praised the screen, stating that &quot;it almost has to be seen to be believed; imagine playing games at home (or in the office) using vector graphics with three-dimensional rotation and zoom&quot;, and noted that &quot;It is unusual and refreshing to see a product appearing on the market with its software ready to run&quot;. David H. Ahl stated in &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; in 1983 that &quot;Vector graphics really do make a difference, and the strong line-up of games helps immensely&quot;.

==Legacy==
Since late 1995, there has been a Usenet community of hobbyists writing games for ParaJVE, a Vectrex emulator. Its emulation is also a compound of MESS (included in MAME, so RetroArch too via libretro), DVE, lr-vex, Vecx, with a Wii version called VectrexWii. Schematics for a &quot;Vectrex Multicart&quot; cartridge is available, allowing several games to be packed on one cartridge. There are also several people manufacturing and selling newly made games, some complete as cartridges with packing and overlays in the style of the original commercially released games, others with varying degrees of packaging.
New hardware has also been developed for the Vectrex in recent years, including a light pen that addressed the limitation of the original version by including buttons that replace the second controller required on the original version, and a daughterboard that addresses the well-known buzz in the system&#x27;s audio (bypassing the original audio circuitry on the power board in favor of a module installed elsewhere within the cabinet).
