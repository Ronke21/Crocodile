<text>In the theory of computational complexity, the travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: &quot;Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?&quot; It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.

The travelling purchaser problem, the vehicle routing problem and the ring star problem are three generalizations of TSP.

The decision version of the TSP (where given a length &quot;L&quot;, the task is to decide whether the graph has a tour whose length is at most &quot;L&quot;) belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for any algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (but no more than exponentially) with the number of cities.

The problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization. It is used as a benchmark for many optimization methods. Even though the problem is computationally difficult, many heuristics and exact algorithms are known, so that some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely, and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%.

The TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation, such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept &quot;city&quot; represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept &quot;distance&quot; represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure between DNA fragments. The TSP also appears in astronomy, as astronomers observing many sources want to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources; in such problems, the TSP can be embedded inside an optimal control problem. In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed.

== History ==

The origins of the travelling salesman problem are unclear. A handbook for travelling salesmen from 1832 mentions the problem and includes example tours through Germany and Switzerland, but contains no mathematical treatment.

The TSP was mathematically formulated in the 19th century by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton and by the British mathematician Thomas Kirkman. Hamilton&#x27;s icosian game was a recreational puzzle based on finding a Hamiltonian cycle. The general form of the TSP appears to have been first studied by mathematicians during the 1930s in Vienna and at Harvard, notably by Karl Menger, who defines the problem, considers the obvious brute-force algorithm, and observes the non-optimality of the nearest neighbour heuristic:
It was first considered mathematically in the 1930s by Merrill M. Flood who was looking to solve a school bus routing problem. Hassler Whitney at Princeton University generated interest in the problem, which he called the &quot;48 states problem&quot;. The earliest publication using the phrase &quot;travelling [or traveling] salesman problem&quot; was the 1949 RAND Corporation report by Julia Robinson, &quot;On the Hamiltonian game (a traveling salesman problem).&quot;

In the 1950s and 1960s, the problem became increasingly popular in scientific circles in Europe and the United States after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps in solving the problem. Notable contributions were made by George Dantzig, Delbert Ray Fulkerson, and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the cutting plane method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which, with these new methods, they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. Dantzig, Fulkerson, and Johnson, however, speculated that, given a near-optimal solution, one may be able to find optimality or prove optimality by adding a small number of extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea to solve their initial 49-city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as cutting plane methods, Dantzig, Fulkerson, and Johnson used branch-and-bound algorithms perhaps for the first time.

In 1959, Jillian Beardwood, J.H. Halton, and John Hammersley published an article entitled &quot;The Shortest Path Through Many Points&quot; in the journal of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. The Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley theorem provides a practical solution to the travelling salesman problem. The authors derived an asymptotic formula to determine the length of the shortest route for a salesman who starts at a home or office and visits a fixed number of locations before returning to the start.

In the following decades, the problem was studied by many researchers from mathematics, computer science, chemistry, physics, and other sciences. In the 1960s, however, a new approach was created that, instead of seeking optimal solutions, would produce a solution whose length is provably bounded by a multiple of the optimal length, and in doing so would create lower bounds for the problem; these lower bounds would then be used with branch-and-bound approaches. One method of doing this was to create a minimum spanning tree of the graph and then double all its edges, which produces the bound that the length of an optimal tour is at most twice the weight of a minimum spanning tree.

In 1976, Christofides and Serdyukov (independently of each other) made a big advance in this direction: the Christofides-Serdyukov algorithm yields a solution that, in the worst case, is at most 1.5 times longer than the optimal solution. As the algorithm was simple and quick, many hoped it would give way to a near-optimal solution method. However, this hope for improvement did not immediately materialize, and Christofides-Serdyukov remained the method with the best worst-case scenario until 2011, when a (very) slightly improved approximation algorithm was developed for the subset of &quot;graphical&quot; TSPs. In 2020 this tiny improvement was extended to the full (metric) TSP.

Richard M. Karp showed in 1972 that the Hamiltonian cycle problem was NP-complete, which implies the NP-hardness of TSP. This supplied a mathematical explanation for the apparent computational difficulty of finding optimal tours.

Great progress was made in the late 1970s and 1980, when Grötschel, Padberg, Rinaldi and others managed to exactly solve instances with up to 2,392 cities, using cutting planes and branch-and-bound.

In the 1990s, Applegate, Bixby, Chvátal, and Cook developed the program &quot;Concorde&quot; that has been used in many recent record solutions. Gerhard Reinelt published the TSPLIB in 1991, a collection of benchmark instances of varying difficulty, which has been used by many research groups for comparing results. In 2006, Cook and others computed an optimal tour through an 85,900-city instance given by a microchip layout problem, currently the largest solved TSPLIB instance. For many other instances with millions of cities, solutions can be found that are guaranteed to be within 2–3% of an optimal tour.

==Description==

===As a graph problem===

TSP can be modeled as an undirected weighted graph, such that cities are the graph&#x27;s vertices, paths are the graph&#x27;s edges, and a path&#x27;s distance is the edge&#x27;s weight. It is a minimization problem starting and finishing at a specified vertex after having visited each other vertex exactly once. Often, the model is a complete graph (i.e., each pair of vertices is connected by an edge). If no path exists between two cities, then adding a sufficiently long edge will complete the graph without affecting the optimal tour.

===Asymmetric and symmetric===
In the &quot;symmetric TSP&quot;, the distance between two cities is the same in each opposite direction, forming an undirected graph. This symmetry halves the number of possible solutions. In the &quot;asymmetric TSP&quot;, paths may not exist in both directions or the distances might be different, forming a directed graph. Traffic congestion, one-way streets, and airfares for cities with different departure and arrival fees are real-world considerations that could yield a TSP problem in asymmetric form.

===Related problems===
* An equivalent formulation in terms of graph theory is: Given a complete weighted graph (where the vertices would represent the cities, the edges would represent the roads, and the weights would be the cost or distance of that road), find a Hamiltonian cycle with the least weight. This is more general than the Hamiltonian path problem, which only asks if a Hamiltonian path (or cycle) exists in a non-complete unweighted graph.
* The requirement of returning to the starting city does not change the computational complexity of the problem; see Hamiltonian path problem.
* Another related problem is the bottleneck travelling salesman problem: Find a Hamiltonian cycle in a weighted graph with the minimal weight of the weightiest edge. A real-world example is avoiding narrow streets with big buses. The problem is of considerable practical importance, apart from evident transportation and logistics areas. A classic example is in printed circuit manufacturing: scheduling of a route of the drill machine to drill holes in a PCB. In robotic machining or drilling applications, the &quot;cities&quot; are parts to machine or holes (of different sizes) to drill, and the &quot;cost of travel&quot; includes time for retooling the robot (single-machine job sequencing problem). 
* The generalized travelling salesman problem, also known as the &quot;travelling politician problem&quot;, deals with &quot;states&quot; that have (one or more) &quot;cities&quot;, and the salesman must visit exactly one city from each state. One application is encountered in ordering a solution to the cutting stock problem in order to minimize knife changes. Another is concerned with drilling in semiconductor manufacturing; see e.g., . Noon and Bean demonstrated that the generalized travelling salesman problem can be transformed into a standard TSP with the same number of cities, but a modified distance matrix.
* The sequential ordering problem deals with the problem of visiting a set of cities, where precedence relations between the cities exist.
* A common interview question at Google is how to route data among data processing nodes; routes vary by time to transfer the data, but nodes also differ by their computing power and storage, compounding the problem of where to send data.
* The travelling purchaser problem deals with a purchaser who is charged with purchasing a set of products. He can purchase these products in several cities, but at different prices, and not all cities offer the same products. The objective is to find a route between a subset of the cities that minimizes total cost (travel cost + purchasing cost) and enables the purchase of all required products.

==Integer linear programming formulations==
The TSP can be formulated as an integer linear program. Several formulations are known. Two notable formulations are the Miller–Tucker–Zemlin (MTZ) formulation and the Dantzig–Fulkerson–Johnson (DFJ) formulation. The DFJ formulation is stronger, though the MTZ formulation is still useful in certain settings.

Common to both these formulations is that one labels the cities with the numbers formula_1 and takes formula_2 to be the cost (distance) from city formula_3 to city formula_4. The main variables in the formulations are:

:formula_5

It is because these are 0/1 variables that the formulations become integer programs; all other constraints are purely linear. In particular, the objective in the program is to minimize the tour length

: formula_6

Without further constraints, the formula_7 will effectively range over all subsets of the set of edges, which is very far from the sets of edges in a tour, and allows for a trivial minimum where all formula_8. Therefore, both formulations also have the constraints that, at each vertex, there is exactly one incoming edge and one outgoing edge, which may be expressed as the formula_9 linear equations

: formula_10 for formula_11 and formula_12 for formula_13

These ensure that the chosen set of edges locally looks like that of a tour, but still allow for solutions violating the global requirement that there is &quot;one&quot; tour which visits all vertices, as the edges chosen could make up several tours, each visiting only a subset of the vertices; arguably, it is this global requirement that makes TSP a hard problem. The MTZ and DFJ formulations differ in how they express this final requirement as linear constraints.

===Miller–Tucker–Zemlin formulation===
In addition to the formula_14 variables as above, there is for each formula_15 a dummy variable formula_16 that keeps track of the order in which the cities are visited, counting from city the interpretation is that formula_17 implies city formula_3 is visited before city formula_19 For a given tour (as encoded into values of the formula_14 variables), one may find satisfying values for the formula_21 variables by making formula_21 equal to the number of edges along that tour, when going from city formula_23 to city formula_24

Because linear programming favors non-strict inequalities (formula_25) over strict we would like to impose constraints to the effect that

: formula_26 if formula_27

Merely requiring formula_28 would &quot;not&quot; achieve that, because this also requires formula_29 when formula_30 which is not correct. Instead MTZ use the formula_31 linear constraints

: formula_32 for all distinct formula_33

where the constant term formula_34 provides sufficient slack that formula_8 does not impose a relation between formula_36 and formula_37

The way that the formula_21 variables then enforce that a single tour visits all cities is that they increase by at least formula_39 for each step along a tour, with a decrease only allowed where the tour passes through city formula_40 That constraint would be violated by every tour which does not pass through city formula_41 so the only way to satisfy it is that the tour passing city formula_39 also passes through all other cities.

The MTZ formulation of TSP is thus the following integer linear programming problem:

:formula_43

The first set of equalities requires that each city is arrived at from exactly one other city, and the second set of equalities requires that from each city there is a departure to exactly one other city. The last constraint enforces that there is only a single tour covering all cities, and not two or more disjointed tours that only collectively cover all cities.

===Dantzig–Fulkerson–Johnson formulation===
Label the cities with the numbers 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; and define:

:formula_5

Take formula_2 to be the distance from city &quot;i&quot; to city &quot;j&quot;. Then TSP can be written as the following integer linear programming problem:

:formula_46

The last constraint of the DFJ formulation—called a &quot;subtour elimination&quot; constraint—ensures that no proper subset Q can form a sub-tour, so the solution returned is a single tour and not the union of smaller tours. Intuitively, for each proper subset Q of the cities, the constraint requires that there be fewer edges than cities in Q: if there were to be as many edges in Q as cities in Q, that would represent a subtour of the cities of Q. Because this leads to an exponential number of possible constraints, in practice it is solved with row generation.

==Computing a solution==
The traditional lines of attack for the NP-hard problems are the following:
* Devising exact algorithms, which work reasonably fast only for small problem sizes.
* Devising &quot;suboptimal&quot; or heuristic algorithms, i.e., algorithms that deliver approximated solutions in a reasonable time.
* Finding special cases for the problem (&quot;subproblems&quot;) for which either better or exact heuristics are possible.

===Exact algorithms===

The most direct solution would be to try all permutations (ordered combinations) and see which one is cheapest (using brute-force search). The running time for this approach lies within a polynomial factor of formula_47, the factorial of the number of cities, so this solution becomes impractical even for only 20 cities.

One of the earliest applications of dynamic programming is the Held–Karp algorithm, which solves the problem in time formula_48. This bound has also been reached by Exclusion-Inclusion in an attempt preceding the dynamic programming approach.
Improving these time bounds seems to be difficult. For example, it has not been determined whether a classical exact algorithm for TSP that runs in time formula_49 exists. The currently best quantum exact algorithm for TSP due to Ambainis et al. runs in time formula_50.

Other approaches include:
* Various branch-and-bound algorithms, which can be used to process TSPs containing thousands of cities.

* Progressive improvement algorithms, which use techniques reminiscent of linear programming. This works well for up to 200 cities.
* Implementations of branch-and-bound and problem-specific cut generation (branch-and-cut); this is the method of choice for solving large instances. This approach holds the current record, solving an instance with 85,900 cities, see .

An exact solution for 15,112 German towns from TSPLIB was found in 2001 using the cutting-plane method proposed by George Dantzig, Ray Fulkerson, and Selmer M. Johnson in 1954, based on linear programming. The computations were performed on a network of 110 processors located at Rice University and Princeton University. The total computation time was equivalent to 22.6 years on a single 500 MHz Alpha processor. In May 2004, the travelling salesman problem of visiting all 24,978 towns in Sweden was solved: a tour of length approximately 72,500 kilometres was found, and it was proven that no shorter tour exists. In March 2005, the travelling salesman problem of visiting all 33,810 points in a circuit board was solved using &quot;Concorde TSP Solver&quot;: a tour of length 66,048,945 units was found, and it was proven that no shorter tour exists. The computation took approximately 15.7 CPU-years (Cook et al. 2006). In April 2006 an instance with 85,900 points was solved using &quot;Concorde TSP Solver&quot;, taking over 136 CPU-years; see .

===Heuristic and approximation algorithms===
Various heuristics and approximation algorithms, which quickly yield good solutions, have been devised. These include the multi-fragment algorithm. Modern methods can find solutions for extremely large problems (millions of cities) within a reasonable time which are, with a high probability, just 2–3% away from the optimal solution.

Several categories of heuristics are recognized.

====Constructive heuristics====

The nearest neighbour (NN) algorithm (a greedy algorithm) lets the salesman choose the nearest unvisited city as his next move. This algorithm quickly yields an effectively short route. For &quot;N&quot; cities randomly distributed on a plane, the algorithm on average yields a path 25% longer than the shortest possible path; however, there exist many specially-arranged city distributions which make the NN algorithm give the worst route. This is true for both asymmetric and symmetric TSPs. Rosenkrantz et al. showed that the NN algorithm has the approximation factor formula_51 for instances satisfying the triangle inequality. A variation of the NN algorithm, called nearest fragment (NF) operator, which connects a group (fragment) of nearest unvisited cities, can find shorter routes with successive iterations. The NF operator can also be applied on an initial solution obtained by the NN algorithm for further improvement in an elitist model, where only better solutions are accepted.

The bitonic tour of a set of points is the minimum-perimeter monotone polygon that has the points as its vertices; it can be computed efficiently with dynamic programming.

Another constructive heuristic, Match Twice and Stitch (MTS), performs two sequential matchings, where the second matching is executed after deleting all the edges of the first matching, to yield a set of cycles. The cycles are then stitched to produce the final tour.

==== The Algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov ====

The algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov follows a similar outline but combines the minimum spanning tree with a solution of another problem, minimum-weight perfect matching. This gives a TSP tour which is at most 1.5 times the optimal. It was one of the first approximation algorithms, and was in part responsible for drawing attention to approximation algorithms as a practical approach to intractable problems. As a matter of fact, the term &quot;algorithm&quot; was not commonly extended to approximation algorithms until later; the Christofides algorithm was initially referred to as the Christofides heuristic.

This algorithm looks at things differently by using a result from graph theory which helps improve on the lower bound of the TSP which originated from doubling the cost of the minimum spanning tree. Given an Eulerian graph, we can find an Eulerian tour in time, so if we had an Eulerian graph with cities from a TSP as vertices, then we can easily see that we could use such a method for finding an Eulerian tour to find a TSP solution. By the triangle inequality, we know that the TSP tour can be no longer than the Eulerian tour, and we therefore have a lower bound for the TSP. Such a method is described below.
# Find a minimum spanning tree for the problem.
# Create duplicates for every edge to create an Eulerian graph.
# Find an Eulerian tour for this graph.
# Convert to TSP: if a city is visited twice, then create a shortcut from the city before this in the tour to the one after this.

To improve the lower bound, a better way of creating an Eulerian graph is needed. By the triangle inequality, the best Eulerian graph must have the same cost as the best travelling salesman tour; hence, finding optimal Eulerian graphs is at least as hard as TSP. One way of doing this is by minimum weight matching using algorithms with a complexity of formula_52.

Making a graph into an Eulerian graph starts with the minimum spanning tree; all the vertices of odd order must then be made even, so a matching for the odd-degree vertices must be added, which increases the order of every odd-degree vertex by 1. This leaves us with a graph where every vertex is of even order, which is thus Eulerian. Adapting the above method gives the algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov:

# Find a minimum spanning tree for the problem.
# Create a matching for the problem with the set of cities of odd order. 
# Find an Eulerian tour for this graph.
# Convert to TSP using shortcuts.

==== Pairwise exchange ====
The pairwise exchange or &quot;2-opt&quot; technique involves iteratively removing two edges and replacing them with two different edges that reconnect the fragments created by edge removal into a new and shorter tour. Similarly, the 3-opt technique removes 3 edges and reconnects them to form a shorter tour. These are special cases of the &quot;k&quot;-opt method. The label &quot;Lin–Kernighan&quot; is an often heard misnomer for 2-opt; Lin–Kernighan is actually the more general &quot;k&quot;-opt method.

For Euclidean instances, 2-opt heuristics give on average solutions that are about 5% better than those yielded by Christofides&#x27; algorithm. If we start with an initial solution made with a greedy algorithm, then the average number of moves greatly decreases again and is ; however, for random starts, the average number of moves is . While this is a small increase in size, the initial number of moves for small problems is 10 times as big for a random start compared to one made from a greedy heuristic. This is because such 2-opt heuristics exploit &#x27;bad&#x27; parts of a solution such as crossings. These types of heuristics are often used within vehicle routing problem heuristics to re-optimize route solutions.

==== &quot;k&quot;-opt heuristic, or Lin–Kernighan heuristics ====
The Lin–Kernighan heuristic is a special case of the &quot;V&quot;-opt or variable-opt technique. It involves the following steps:

# Given a tour, delete &quot;k&quot; mutually disjoint edges. 
# Reassemble the remaining fragments into a tour, leaving no disjoint subtours (that is, do not connect a fragment&#x27;s endpoints together). This in effect simplifies the TSP under consideration into a much simpler problem.
# Each fragment endpoint can be connected to other possibilities: of 2&quot;k&quot; total fragment endpoints available, the two endpoints of the fragment under consideration are disallowed. Such a constrained 2&quot;k&quot;-city TSP can then be solved with brute-force methods to find the least-cost recombination of the original fragments.

The most popular of the &quot;k&quot;-opt methods are 3-opt, as introduced by Shen Lin of Bell Labs in 1965. A special case of 3-opt is where the edges are not disjoint (two of the edges are adjacent to one another). In practice, it is often possible to achieve substantial improvement over 2-opt without the combinatorial cost of the general 3-opt by restricting the 3-changes to this special subset where two of the removed edges are adjacent. This so-called two-and-a-half-opt typically falls roughly midway between 2-opt and 3-opt, both in terms of the quality of tours achieved and the time required to achieve those tours.

==== &quot;V&quot;-opt heuristic ====
The variable-opt method is related to, and a generalization of, the &quot;k&quot;-opt method. Whereas the &quot;k&quot;-opt methods remove a fixed number (&quot;k&quot;) of edges from the original tour, the variable-opt methods do not fix the size of the edge set to remove. Instead, they grow the set as the search process continues. The best-known method in this family is the Lin–Kernighan method (mentioned above as a misnomer for 2-opt). Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan first published their method in 1972, and it was the most reliable heuristic for solving travelling salesman problems for nearly two decades. More advanced variable-opt methods were developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s by David Johnson and his research team. These methods (sometimes called Lin–Kernighan–Johnson) build on the Lin–Kernighan method, adding ideas from tabu search and evolutionary computing. The basic Lin–Kernighan technique gives results that are guaranteed to be at least 3-opt. The Lin–Kernighan–Johnson methods compute a Lin–Kernighan tour, and then perturb the tour by what has been described as a mutation that removes at least four edges and reconnects the tour in a different way, then &quot;V&quot;-opting the new tour. The mutation is often enough to move the tour from the local minimum identified by Lin–Kernighan. &quot;V&quot;-opt methods are widely considered the most powerful heuristics for the problem, and are able to address special cases, such as the Hamilton Cycle Problem and other non-metric TSPs that other heuristics fail on. For many years, Lin–Kernighan–Johnson had identified optimal solutions for all TSPs where an optimal solution was known and had identified the best-known solutions for all other TSPs on which the method had been tried.

====Randomized improvement====
Optimized Markov chain algorithms which use local searching heuristic sub-algorithms can find a route extremely close to the optimal route for 700 to 800 cities.

TSP is a touchstone for many general heuristics devised for combinatorial optimization such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, river formation dynamics (see swarm intelligence), and the cross entropy method.

====Constricting Insertion Heuristic====
This starts with a sub-tour such as the convex hull and then inserts other vertices.

====Ant colony optimization====

Artificial intelligence researcher Marco Dorigo described in 1993 a method of heuristically generating &quot;good solutions&quot; to the TSP using a simulation of an ant colony called &quot;ACS&quot; (&quot;ant colony system&quot;). It models behavior observed in real ants to find short paths between food sources and their nest, an emergent behavior resulting from each ant&#x27;s preference to follow trail pheromones deposited by other ants.

ACS sends out a large number of virtual ant agents to explore many possible routes on the map. Each ant probabilistically chooses the next city to visit based on a heuristic combining the distance to the city and the amount of virtual pheromone deposited on the edge to the city. The ants explore, depositing pheromone on each edge that they cross, until they have all completed a tour. At this point the ant which completed the shortest tour deposits virtual pheromone along its complete tour route (&quot;global trail updating&quot;). The amount of pheromone deposited is inversely proportional to the tour length: the shorter the tour, the more it deposits.


==Special cases==

===Metric===

In the &quot;metric TSP&quot;, also known as &quot;delta-TSP&quot; or Δ-TSP, the intercity distances satisfy the triangle inequality.

A very natural restriction of the TSP is to require that the distances between cities form a metric to satisfy the triangle inequality; that is, the direct connection from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is never farther than the route via intermediate &quot;C&quot;:
:formula_53.

The edges then build a metric on the set of vertices. When the cities are viewed as points in the plane, many natural distance functions are metrics, and so many natural instances of TSP satisfy this constraint.

The following are some examples of metric TSPs for various metrics.
*In the Euclidean TSP (see below), the distance between two cities is the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points.
*In the rectilinear TSP, the distance between two cities is the sum of the absolute values of the differences of their &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates. This metric is often called the Manhattan distance or city-block metric.
*In the maximum metric, the distance between two points is the maximum of the absolute values of differences of their &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates.

The last two metrics appear, for example, in routing a machine that drills a given set of holes in a printed circuit board. The Manhattan metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts first one coordinate, and then the other, so the time to move to a new point is the sum of both movements. The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both coordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a new point is the slower of the two movements.

In its definition, the TSP does not allow cities to be visited twice, but many applications do not need this constraint. In such cases, a symmetric, non-metric instance can be reduced to a metric one. This replaces the original graph with a complete graph in which the inter-city distance formula_54 is replaced by the shortest path length between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the original graph.

===Euclidean===

For points in the Euclidean plane, the optimal solution to the travelling salesman problem forms a simple polygon through all of the points, a polygonalization of the points. Any non-optimal solution with crossings can be made into a shorter solution without crossings by local optimizations. The Euclidean distance obeys the triangle inequality, so the Euclidean TSP forms a special case of metric TSP. However, even when the input points have integer coordinates, their distances generally take the form of square roots, and the length of a tour is a sum of radicals, making it difficult to perform the symbolic computation needed to perform exact comparisons of the lengths of different tours.

Like the general TSP, the exact Euclidean TSP is NP-hard, but the issue with sums of radicals is an obstacle to proving that its decision version is in NP, and therefore NP-complete. A discretized version of the problem with distances rounded to integers is NP-complete. With rational coordinates and the actual Euclidean metric, Euclidean TSP is known to be in the Counting Hierarchy, a subclass of PSPACE. With arbitrary real coordinates, Euclidean TSP cannot be in such classes, since there are uncountably many possible inputs. Despite these complications, Euclidean TSP is much easier than the general metric case for approximation. For example, the minimum spanning tree of the graph associated with an instance of the Euclidean TSP is a Euclidean minimum spanning tree, and so can be computed in expected &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time for &quot;n&quot; points (considerably less than the number of edges). This enables the simple 2-approximation algorithm for TSP with triangle inequality above to operate more quickly.

In general, for any &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0, where &quot;d&quot; is the number of dimensions in the Euclidean space, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a tour of length at most (1 + 1/&quot;c&quot;) times the optimal for geometric instances of TSP in

:formula_55

time; this is called a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). Sanjeev Arora and Joseph S. B. Mitchell were awarded the Gödel Prize in 2010 for their concurrent discovery of a PTAS for the Euclidean TSP.

In practice, simpler heuristics with weaker guarantees continue to be used.

===Asymmetric===
In most cases, the distance between two nodes in the TSP network is the same in both directions. The case where the distance from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is not equal to the distance from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot; is called asymmetric TSP. A practical application of an asymmetric TSP is route optimization using street-level routing (which is made asymmetric by one-way streets, slip-roads, motorways, etc.).

The stacker crane problem can be viewed as a special case of the asymmetric TSP. In this problem, the input consists of ordered pairs of points in a metric space, which must be visited consecutively in order by the tour. These pairs of points can be viewed as the nodes of an asymmetric TSP, with asymmetric distances reflecting the combined cost of traveling from the first point of a pair to its second and then from the second point of a pair to the first point of the next pair.

====Conversion to symmetric====
Solving an asymmetric TSP graph can be somewhat complex. The following is a 3×3 matrix containing all possible path weights between the nodes &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. One option is to turn an asymmetric matrix of size &quot;N&quot; into a symmetric matrix of size 2&quot;N&quot;.

To double the size, each of the nodes in the graph is duplicated, creating a second &quot;ghost node&quot;, linked to the original node with a &quot;ghost&quot; edge of very low (possibly negative) weight, here denoted −&quot;w&quot;. (Alternatively, the ghost edges have weight 0, and weight w is added to all other edges.) The original 3×3 matrix shown above is visible in the bottom left and the transpose of the original in the top-right. Both copies of the matrix have had their diagonals replaced by the low-cost hop paths, represented by −&quot;w&quot;. In the new graph, no edge directly links original nodes and no edge directly links ghost nodes.

The weight −&quot;w&quot; of the &quot;ghost&quot; edges linking the ghost nodes to the corresponding original nodes must be low enough to ensure that all ghost edges must belong to any optimal symmetric TSP solution on the new graph (&quot;w&quot; = 0 is not always low enough). As a consequence, in the optimal symmetric tour, each original node appears next to its ghost node (e.g. a possible path is formula_56), and by merging the original and ghost nodes again we get an (optimal) solution of the original asymmetric problem (in our example, formula_57).

===Analyst&#x27;s problem===
There is an analogous problem in geometric measure theory which asks the following: under what conditions may a subset &quot;E&quot; of Euclidean space be contained in a rectifiable curve (that is, when is there a curve with finite length that visits every point in &quot;E&quot;)? This problem is known as the analyst&#x27;s travelling salesman problem.

===Path length for random sets of points in a square===
Suppose formula_58 are formula_59 independent random variables with uniform distribution in the square formula_60, and let formula_61 be the shortest path length (i.e. TSP solution) for this set of points, according to the usual Euclidean distance. It is known that, almost surely,

::formula_62

where formula_63 is a positive constant that is not known explicitly. Since formula_64 (see below), it follows from bounded convergence theorem that formula_65, hence lower and upper bounds on formula_63 follow from bounds on formula_67.

The almost-sure limit formula_68 as formula_69 may not exist if the independent locations formula_58 are replaced with observations from a stationary ergodic process with uniform marginals.

====Upper bound====
*One has formula_71, and therefore formula_72, by using a naïve path which visits monotonically the points inside each of formula_73 slices of width formula_74 in the square.
*Few proved formula_75, hence formula_76, later improved by Karloff (1987): formula_77.
* Fietcher empirically suggested an upper bound of formula_78.

====Lower bound====
*By observing that formula_67 is greater than formula_59 times the distance between formula_81 and the closest point formula_82, one gets (after a short computation)

::formula_83

*A better lower bound is obtained by observing that formula_67 is greater than formula_85 times the sum of the distances between formula_81 and the closest and second closest points formula_87, which gives

::formula_88

*The currently-best lower bound is
::formula_89

*Held and Karp gave a polynomial-time algorithm that provides numerical lower bounds for formula_90, and thus for formula_91, which seem to be good up to more or less 1%. In particular, David S. Johnson obtained a lower bound by computer experiment:

::formula_92

where 0.522 comes from the points near the square boundary which have fewer neighbours, and Christine L. Valenzuela and Antonia J. Jones obtained the following other numerical lower bound:
::formula_93.

==Computational complexity==
The problem has been shown to be NP-hard (more precisely, it is complete for the complexity class FPNP; see function problem), and the decision problem version (&quot;given the costs and a number &quot;x&quot;, decide whether there is a round-trip route cheaper than &quot;x&quot;&quot;) is NP-complete. The bottleneck travelling salesman problem is also NP-hard. The problem remains NP-hard even for the case when the cities are in the plane with Euclidean distances, as well as in a number of other restrictive cases. Removing the condition of visiting each city &quot;only once&quot; does not remove the NP-hardness, since in the planar case there is an optimal tour that visits each city only once (otherwise, by the triangle inequality, a shortcut that skips a repeated visit would not increase the tour length).

===Complexity of approximation===

In the general case, finding a shortest travelling salesman tour is NPO-complete. If the distance measure is a metric (and thus symmetric), the problem becomes APX-complete, and the algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov approximates it within 1.5.

If the distances are restricted to 1 and 2 (but still are a metric), then the approximation ratio becomes 8/7. In the asymmetric case with triangle inequality, in 2018, a constant factor approximation was developed by Svensson, Tarnawski, and Végh. An algorithm by Vera Traub and achieves a performance ratio of formula_94. The best known inapproximability bound is 75/74.

The corresponding maximization problem of finding the &quot;longest&quot; travelling salesman tour is approximable within 63/38. If the distance function is symmetric, then the longest tour can be approximated within 4/3 by a deterministic algorithm and within formula_95 by a randomized algorithm.

== Human and animal performance ==
The TSP, in particular the Euclidean variant of the problem, has attracted the attention of researchers in cognitive psychology. It has been observed that humans are able to produce near-optimal solutions quickly, in a close-to-linear fashion, with performance that ranges from 1% less efficient, for graphs with 10–20 nodes, to 11% less efficient for graphs with 120 nodes. The apparent ease with which humans accurately generate near-optimal solutions to the problem has led researchers to hypothesize that humans use one or more heuristics, with the two most popular theories arguably being the convex-hull hypothesis and the crossing-avoidance heuristic. However, additional evidence suggests that human performance is quite varied, and individual differences as well as graph geometry appear to affect performance in the task. Nevertheless, results suggest that computer performance on the TSP may be improved by understanding and emulating the methods used by humans for these problems, and have also led to new insights into the mechanisms of human thought. The first issue of the &quot;Journal of Problem Solving&quot; was devoted to the topic of human performance on TSP, and a 2011 review listed dozens of papers on the subject.

A 2011 study in animal cognition titled &quot;Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus,&quot; named after the children&#x27;s book &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!&quot;, examined spatial cognition in pigeons by studying their flight patterns between multiple feeders in a laboratory in relation to the travelling salesman problem. In the first experiment, pigeons were placed in the corner of a lab room and allowed to fly to nearby feeders containing peas. The researchers found that pigeons largely used proximity to determine which feeder they would select next. In the second experiment, the feeders were arranged in such a way that flying to the nearest feeder at every opportunity would be largely inefficient if the pigeons needed to visit every feeder. The results of the second experiment indicate that pigeons, while still favoring proximity-based solutions, &quot;can plan several steps ahead along the route when the differences in travel costs between efficient and less efficient routes based on proximity become larger.&quot; These results are consistent with other experiments done with non-primates, which have proven that some non-primates were able to plan complex travel routes. This suggests non-primates may possess a relatively sophisticated spatial cognitive ability.

==Natural computation==

When presented with a spatial configuration of food sources, the amoeboid &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; adapts its morphology to create an efficient path between the food sources, which can also be viewed as an approximate solution to TSP.

==Benchmarks==
For benchmarking of TSP algorithms, TSPLIB is a library of sample instances of the TSP and related problems is maintained; see the TSPLIB external reference. Many of them are lists of actual cities and layouts of actual printed circuits.

== Popular culture ==
* &quot;Travelling Salesman&quot;, by director Timothy Lanzone, is the story of four mathematicians hired by the U.S. government to solve the most elusive problem in computer-science history: P vs. NP. 
* Solutions to the problem are used by mathematician Robert A. Bosch in a subgenre called TSP art.

<text>Total Access Communication System (TACS) and ETACS are variants of Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) which were announced as the choice for the first two UK national cellular systems in February 1983, less than a year after the UK government announced the T&amp;Cs for the two competing mobile phone networks in June 1982. This 1G technology is now obsolete.

==History==
Vodafone (known then as Racal-Vodafone) opted for a £30 million turnkey contract from Ericsson (ERA) to design, build and set up its initial network of 100 base station sites.

Cellnet (then known Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd) used development labs in the facilities at General Electric (later made part of Motorola) based at Lynchburg, Virginia, United States. The reason Cellnet used the General Electric labs was because the AMPS system was already in development there, and the company had set up a production facility in readiness for AMPS production in 1985 which the Cellnet TACS was to share. In March 1984 development of prototypes began at General Electric. Production began in 1985 and General Electric produced 20,000 systems that year for Cellnet&#x27;s distribution in the UK. Production of what was to become the Motorola model were then made at Stotfold, Bedfordshire, England. This production facility continued making TACS until the advent of GSM.

TACS cellular phones were used in Europe (including the UK, Italy, Austria and Ireland) and other countries. TACS was also used in Japan under the name Japanese Total Access Communication (JTAC). It was also used in Hong Kong. ETACS was an extended version of TACS with more channels.

TACS and ETACS are now obsolete in Europe, having been replaced by the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) system. In the United Kingdom, the last ETACS service operated by Vodafone was discontinued on 31 May 2001, after 16 years of service. The competing service in the UK operated by Cellnet (latterly BT Cellnet) was closed on Sunday 1 October 2000.

Eircell (now Vodafone Ireland) closed its TACS network on 26 January 2001. This followed a long period during which customers were encouraged to switch to GSM services. When the network was closed, there were very few, if any, active TACS customers left. Customers who switched network were able to keep their phone number, but the (088) prefix was changed to either 087 (Eircell, now Vodafone Ireland) GSM or 086 (Esat Digifone, which became O2 Ireland before merging with Three) GSM. At the time, full mobile number portability was not available to TACS customers and the (088) prefix was closed. An automatic voice message was left in place for 12 months advising callers of the customer&#x27;s new prefix.

== Frequency bands used by ETACS in the UK ==
TACS BAND Summary
ESNs were issued in batches of 65535 by BABT for phone manufacturers to program into each cellular phone to make each one unique to the TACS network with which it attempted to register.

The following countries had more than two batches of ESNs allocated to them: UK, Italy, Austria, China, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, UAE, Kuwait, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Australia.

<text>Time-division multiple access (TDMA) is a channel access method for shared-medium networks. It allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot. This allows multiple stations to share the same transmission medium (e.g. radio frequency channel) while using only a part of its channel capacity. Dynamic TDMA is a TDMA variant that dynamically reserves a variable number of time slots in each frame to variable bit-rate data streams, based on the traffic demand of each data stream.

TDMA is used in the digital 2G cellular systems such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), IS-136, Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) and iDEN, and in the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard for portable phones. TDMA was first used in satellite communication systems by Western Union in its Westar 3 communications satellite in 1979. It is now used extensively in satellite communications, combat-net radio systems, and passive optical network (PON) networks for upstream traffic from premises to the operator.

TDMA is a type of time-division multiplexing (TDM), with the special point that instead of having one transmitter connected to one receiver, there are multiple transmitters. In the case of the &quot;uplink&quot; from a mobile phone to a base station this becomes particularly difficult because the mobile phone can move around and vary the &quot;timing advance&quot; required to make its transmission match the gap in transmission from its peers.

== Characteristics ==
* Shares single carrier frequency with multiple users
* Non-continuous transmission makes handoff simpler
* Slots can be assigned on demand in dynamic TDMA
* Less stringent power control than CDMA due to reduced intra cell interference
* Higher synchronization overhead than CDMA
* Advanced equalization may be necessary for high data rates if the channel is &quot;frequency selective&quot; and creates Intersymbol interference
* Cell breathing (borrowing resources from adjacent cells) is more complicated than in CDMA
* Frequency/slot allocation complexity
* Pulsating power envelope: interference with other devices

== In mobile phone systems ==
=== 2G systems ===
Most 2G cellular systems, with the notable exception of IS-95, are based on TDMA. GSM, D-AMPS, PDC, iDEN, and PHS are examples of TDMA cellular systems.

In the GSM system, the synchronization of the mobile phones is achieved by sending timing advance commands from the base station which instruct the mobile phone to transmit earlier and by how much. This compensates for the speed-of-light propagation delay. The mobile phone is not allowed to transmit for its entire time slot; there is a guard interval at the end of each time slot. As the transmission moves into the guard period, the mobile network adjusts the timing advance to synchronize the transmission.

Initial synchronization of a phone requires even more care. Before a mobile transmits there is no way to know the offset required. For this reason, an entire time slot has to be dedicated to mobiles attempting to contact the network; this is known as the random-access channel (RACH) in GSM. The mobile transmits at the beginning of the time slot as received from the network. If the mobile is near the base station, the propagation delay is short and the initiation can succeed. If, however, the mobile phone is just less than 35 km from the base station, the delay will mean the mobile&#x27;s transmission arrives at the end of the time slot. In this case, the mobile will be instructed to transmit its messages starting nearly a whole time slot earlier so that it can be received at the proper time. Finally, if the mobile is beyond the 35 km cell range of GSM, the transmission will arrive in a neighbouring time slot and be ignored. It is this feature, rather than limitations of power, that limits the range of a GSM cell to 35 km when no special extension techniques are used. By changing the synchronization between the uplink and downlink at the base station, however, this limitation can be overcome.

=== 3G systems ===

In the context of 3G systems, the integration of Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Time-Division Duplexing (TDD) in the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) represents a sophisticated approach to optimizing spectrum efficiency and network performance.

UTRA-FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) employs CDMA and FDD, where separate frequency bands are allocated for uplink and downlink transmissions. This separation minimizes interference and allows for continuous data transmission in both directions, making it suitable for environments with balanced traffic loads.

UTRA-TDD (Time Division Duplex), on the other hand, combines CDMA with TDMA and TDD. In this scheme, the same frequency band is used for both uplink and downlink, but at different times. This time-based separation is particularly advantageous in scenarios with asymmetric traffic loads, where the data rates for uplink and downlink differ significantly. By dynamically allocating time slots based on demand, UTRA-TDD can efficiently manage varying traffic patterns and enhance overall network capacity.

The combination of these technologies in UMTS allows for more flexible and efficient use of the available spectrum, catering to diverse user demands and improving the adaptability of 3G networks to different operational environments.

== In wired networks ==
The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables) is based on a TDMA scheme. In G.hn, a &quot;master&quot; device allocates &quot;Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities&quot; (CFTXOP) to other &quot;slave&quot; devices in the network. Only one device can use a CFTXOP at a time, thus avoiding collisions.
FlexRay protocol which is also a wired network used for safety-critical communication in modern cars, uses the TDMA method for data transmission control.

== Comparison with other multiple-access schemes ==
In radio systems, TDMA is usually used alongside frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and frequency-division duplex (FDD); the combination is referred to as FDMA/TDMA/FDD. This is the case in both GSM and IS-136 for example. Exceptions to this include the DECT and Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) micro-cellular systems, UMTS-TDD UMTS variant, and China&#x27;s TD-SCDMA, which use time-division duplexing, where different time slots are allocated for the base station and handsets on the same frequency.

A major advantage of TDMA is that the radio part of the mobile-only needs to listen and broadcast for its own time slot. For the rest of the time, the mobile can carry out measurements on the network, detecting surrounding transmitters on different frequencies. This allows safe inter-frequency handovers, something which is difficult in CDMA systems, not supported at all in IS-95 and supported through complex system additions in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This in turn allows for co-existence of microcell layers with macrocell layers.

CDMA, by comparison, supports &quot;soft hand-off&quot; which allows a mobile phone to be in communication with up to 6 base stations simultaneously, a type of &quot;same-frequency handover&quot;. The incoming packets are compared for quality, and the best one is selected. CDMA&#x27;s &quot;cell breathing&quot; characteristic, where a terminal on the boundary of two congested cells will be unable to receive a clear signal, can often negate this advantage during peak periods.

A disadvantage of TDMA systems is that they create interference at a frequency that is directly connected to the time slot length. This is the buzz that can sometimes be heard if a TDMA phone is left next to a radio or speakers. Another disadvantage is that the &quot;dead time&quot; between time slots limits the potential bandwidth of a TDMA channel. These are implemented in part because of the difficulty in ensuring that different terminals transmit at exactly the times required. Handsets that are moving will need to constantly adjust their timings to ensure their transmission is received at precisely the right time because as they move further from the base station, their signal will take longer to arrive. This also means that the major TDMA systems have hard limits on cell sizes in terms of range, though in practice the power levels required to receive and transmit over distances greater than the supported range would be mostly impractical anyway.

== Advantages of TDMA ==
TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) is a communication method that allocates radio frequency (RF) bandwidth into discrete time slots, allowing multiple users to share the channel in a sequential manner. This approach not only improves spectrum efficiency compared to analog systems but also offers several specific advantages that enhance communication quality and system performance.

=== Advantages of TDMA ===

# Enhanced spectrum efficiency: TDMA maximizes the use of available bandwidth by allowing multiple users to share the same channel without overlapping. Each user is assigned a specific time slot, ensuring that the channel&#x27;s capacity is fully utilized, thereby increasing overall system efficiency.
# Reduction of intersymbol interference: By assigning non-overlapping time slots to users, TDMA significantly reduces the risk of intersymbol interference. This interference occurs when signals from adjacent symbols overlap, leading to distortion and communication errors. The clear separation of time slots ensures that each symbol is transmitted distinctly, enhancing the reliability and clarity of the signal.
# Elimination of guard bands: Since adjacent channels in TDMA do not interfere with one another, there is no need for guard bands—unused frequency ranges that typically separate channels to prevent interference in other systems. This absence of guard bands allows for more efficient use of the available spectrum, providing additional capacity for more users.
# Flexible rate allocation: TDMA supports dynamic allocation of time slots, allowing the system to adapt to varying user demands. Users can be assigned multiple time slots based on their data transmission needs, which can vary due to factors such as call duration or data requirements. This flexibility optimizes resource usage and can improve overall user experience.
# Low battery consumption: Unlike FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access), which requires continuous transmission, TDMA operates in a noncontinuous manner. Each transmitter can be turned off when not in use, leading to significant power savings. This is particularly advantageous for mobile devices, as it prolongs battery life and reduces the need for frequent recharging.
# Simplified implementation: The time-based nature of TDMA simplifies the implementation of synchronization mechanisms between users. As users take turns using the channel, the system can more easily manage timing and coordination compared to more complex methods like CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), where signals overlap.
# Scalability: TDMA systems can be scaled effectively to accommodate a growing number of users. As demand increases, additional time slots can be introduced without the need for significant changes to the existing infrastructure, making it easier to expand the network capacity.
# Improved quality of service (QoS): With the ability to assign specific time slots and manage user access dynamically, TDMA can enhance the overall quality of service. This can lead to reduced latency and increased throughput, ensuring that users experience reliable and efficient communication.

=== Disadvantages of TDMA ===

# Guard intervals: To prevent interference between adjacent TDMA slots, guard intervals must be added. These intervals, typically ranging from 30 to 50 microseconds, serve as buffers to ensure that transmissions do not overlap. However, this requirement for extra time means that the overall throughput of the system can be reduced, as valuable time is spent in guard intervals rather than transmitting data. This is particularly problematic in cellular networks where time and energy efficiency are paramount.
# Energy consumption: While TDMA allows for some energy savings by turning off transmitters during idle periods, the inclusion of guard intervals can offset these benefits. The need for synchronization and the overhead associated with managing time slots can lead to increased energy consumption, particularly in scenarios where numerous users are competing for access to the channel. This can be a critical issue for mobile devices that rely on battery power.
# Synchronization challenges: TDMA requires precise synchronization between all users to ensure that each user transmits within their designated time slot. This can complicate system design and implementation, especially in dynamic environments where users may frequently join or leave the network. Maintaining synchronization becomes increasingly difficult as the number of users grows, leading to potential disruptions and communication errors if not managed effectively.
# Limited data rates: TDMA generally provides medium data rates compared to other multiple access techniques like CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access). This limitation arises from the fixed time slot allocation, which can restrict the amount of data that can be transmitted in a given timeframe. As a result, users with higher data requirements may experience slower transmission speeds, leading to potential dissatisfaction and reduced performance for data-intensive applications.
# Moderate system flexibility: TDMA offers moderate flexibility in terms of user allocation and data transmission rates. Unlike CDMA, which allows for a more dynamic and adaptive use of bandwidth, TDMA&#x27;s fixed time slot assignment can lead to inefficiencies. In scenarios where user demand fluctuates significantly, the rigid structure of TDMA may result in underutilization of resources, as not all time slots may be filled during periods of low demand.
# Latency issues: Due to the time-sharing nature of TDMA, users may experience increased latency. When multiple users are connected, each must wait for their designated time slot to transmit data. In applications that require real-time communication, such as voice calls or video conferencing, this added delay can affect the quality of service, leading to lag and reduced responsiveness.
# Scalability constraints: While TDMA can accommodate a growing number of users by adding more time slots, this scalability is limited by the need for synchronization and the fixed nature of time slot assignments. As user demand increases, the system may face challenges in maintaining performance levels without significant investment in infrastructure upgrades or more complex management systems.

<text>The Prisoner is a British television series created by Patrick McGoohan. McGoohan portrays Number Six, an unnamed British intelligence agent who is abducted and imprisoned in a mysterious coastal village after resigning from his position. The allegorical plotlines of the series contain elements of science fiction, psychological drama, and spy fiction. It was produced by Everyman Films for distribution by Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment.

A single series of 17 episodes was filmed between September 1966 and January 1968, with exterior location filming primarily taking place in the Welsh seaside village of Portmeirion. Interior scenes were filmed at MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The series was first broadcast in Canada beginning on 5 September 1967, in the UK on 29 September 1967, and in the United States on 1 June 1968. Although the show was sold as a thriller in the mould of &quot;Danger Man&quot;, McGoohan&#x27;s previous series, its surreal and Kafkaesque setting and reflection of concerns of the 1960s counterculture have had a far-reaching influence on popular culture and cultivated a cult following.

==Premise==
The series follows Number Six (Patrick McGoohan), an unnamed British intelligence agent who, after abruptly and angrily resigning from his highly sensitive government job, prepares to go on a trip. While packing his luggage, he is rendered unconscious by knockout gas piped into his home in Westminster.

Upon waking, he finds himself in a re-creation of the interior of his home, located in a mysterious coastal settlement known to its residents as &quot;the Village&quot;. The Village is surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on the other.

The man becomes acquainted with the residents, hundreds of people from all walks of life and cultures, all seeming to be peacefully and mostly enjoyably living out their lives. They do not use names, but have been assigned numbers which, aside from designations such as Two, Three, and Six, give no clue as to their status within the Village with most being captives, but some are guards. Prisoners, therefore, have no idea whom they can and cannot trust. The protagonist is assigned Number Six, but he refuses to accept the designation: &quot;I am not a number! I am a free man!&quot;

Although the residents can freely move about the Village, they are constantly under the surveillance of numerous high-tech monitoring systems and cannot leave. Security forces, including a balloon-shaped automaton called Rover, recapture or kill those who attempt to escape.

Number Six is a particularly important target of the constantly changing Number Two, the Village administrator, who acts as an agent for the unseen Number One. Number Two uses techniques such as hallucinogenic drugs, identity theft, mind control, dream manipulation and forms of social indoctrination and physical coercion in attempt to make Number Six reveal why he resigned from his position. The position of Number Two is assigned to a different person in each episode, with two making repeat appearances. This is assumed to be part of a larger plan to disorient Number Six, but sometimes the change of personnel seems to be the result of the failure of the previous incumbent, whose fate is unknown.

Number Six, distrustful of everyone in the Village, refuses to co-operate or provide the answers they seek. He struggles, usually alone, with various goals, such as determining for which side of the Iron Curtain the Village functions, if either, remaining defiant to its imposed authority, concocting his own plans for escape, learning all he can about the Village, and subverting its operation. His schemes lead to the dismissals of the incumbent Number Two on several occasions. Despite foiling the system, however, Number Six never manages to escape successfully. By the end of the series, the administration, becoming desperate for Number Six&#x27;s knowledge, as well as fearful of his growing influence in the Village, takes drastic measures that threaten the lives of Number Six, Number Two, and the entire Village.

A major theme of the series is the conflict between individualism, as represented by Number Six, and collectivism, as represented by the Village. According to McGoohan, the series aimed to demonstrate a balance between the two ideologies.

McGoohan was the only actor credited during the opening sequence, with Muscat the only actor considered a co-star of the series. Several actors (including Alexis Kanner, Christopher Benjamin and Georgina Cookson) appeared in more than one episode playing different characters. Frank Maher, McGoohan&#x27;s stunt double, who is seen running across the beach in the title sequence, also appears extensively in &quot;The Schizoid Man&quot; and in &quot;Living in Harmony&quot;.

==Episodes==
&quot;The Prisoner&quot; consists of 17 episodes, which were first broadcast from 29 September 1967 to 1 February 1968 in the United Kingdom. While the show was presented as a serialised work, with a clear beginning and end, the ordering of the intermediate episodes is unclear, as the production and original broadcast order were different. Several attempts have been made to create an episode ordering based on script and production notes and interpretations of the broader narrative of Number Six&#x27;s time in the Village.

===Opening and closing sequences===

The opening and closing sequences of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; have become iconic, cited as &quot;one of the great set-ups of genre drama&quot;, by establishing the Orwellian and postmodern themes of the series. The high production values of the opening sequence have been described as more like those of a feature film than a television programme.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;The Prisoner&quot; was created while Patrick McGoohan and George Markstein were working on &quot;Danger Man&quot;, an espionage show produced by Incorporated Television Company. The exact details of who created which aspects of the show are disputed, as there is no &quot;created by&quot; credit. Majority opinion credits McGoohan as the sole creator of the series, but a disputed co-creator status was later ascribed to Markstein after a series of fan interviews were published in the 1980s.

Some sources indicate that McGoohan was the sole or primary creator of the show. McGoohan stated in a 1977 interview that, during the filming of the third series of &quot;Danger Man&quot;, he told ITC Entertainment managing director Lew Grade that he wanted to quit working on &quot;Danger Man&quot; after the filming of the proposed fourth series. Grade was unhappy with the decision, but when McGoohan insisted upon quitting, Grade asked if McGoohan had any other possible projects, and McGoohan later pitched &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. In a 1988 article in British telefantasy magazine &quot;Time Screen&quot;, though, McGoohan indicated that he had planned to pitch &quot;The Prisoner&quot; before speaking with Grade. In both accounts, McGoohan pitched the idea orally, rather than having Grade read the proposal in detail, and the two made an oral agreement for the show to be produced by Everyman Films, the production company formed by McGoohan and David Tomblin. In the 1977 account, McGoohan said that Grade approved of the show despite not understanding it, whereas, in the 1988 account, Grade expressed clear support for the concept.

Other sources, however, credit Markstein, then a script editor for &quot;Danger Man&quot;, with a significant or even primary portion of the development of the show. For example, Dave Rogers, in the book &quot;The Prisoner and Danger Man&quot;, said that Markstein claimed to have created the concept first and McGoohan later attempted to take credit for it, although Rogers himself doubted that McGoohan would have wanted or needed to do that. A four-page document, generally agreed to have been written by Markstein, setting out an overview of the themes of the series, was published as part of an ITC/ATV press book in 1967. It has usually been accepted that this text originated earlier as a guide for the series writers. Further doubt has been cast on Markstein&#x27;s version of events by author Rupert Booth in his biography of McGoohan, entitled &quot;Not a Number&quot;. Booth points out that McGoohan had outlined the themes of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; in a 1965 interview, long before Markstein&#x27;s tenure as script editor on the brief fourth series of &quot;Danger Man&quot;.

Part of Markstein&#x27;s inspiration came from his research into the Second World War, where he found that some people had been incarcerated in a resort-like prison in Scotland called Inverlair Lodge, near Inverness. Markstein suggested that &quot;Danger Man&quot;″s main character John Drake (played by McGoohan) could suddenly resign and be kidnapped and sent to such a location. McGoohan added Markstein&#x27;s suggestion to material he had been working on, which later became &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. Furthermore, a 1960 episode of &quot;Danger Man&quot; entitled &quot;View from the Villa&quot; had exteriors filmed in Portmeirion, a Welsh resort village that struck McGoohan as a good location for future projects.

According to &quot;Fantasy or Reality&quot; — a chapter of &quot;The Prisoner of Portmeirion&quot; — the Village is based, in part, on &quot;a strange place in Scotland&quot; operated by the Inter Services Research Bureau, wherein &quot;people&quot; with &quot;valuable knowledge of one sort or another&quot; were held prisoners on extended &quot;holidays&quot; in a &quot;luxury prison camp&quot;. &quot;The Prisoner&quot;″s story editor, George Markstein, this source contends, knows of &quot;the existence of this &#x27;secure establishment&#x27;&quot;. However, this &quot;Scottish prison camp, in reality, was not, of course, a holiday-type village full of people wearing colourful clothing.&quot;

Further inspiration came from a &quot;Danger Man&quot; episode called &quot;Colony Three&quot;, in which Drake infiltrates a spy school in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The school, in the middle of nowhere, is set up to look like a normal English town in which pupils and instructors mix as in any other normal city, but the instructors are virtual prisoners with little hope of ever leaving. McGoohan also stated that he was influenced by his experience from theatre, including his work in the Orson Welles play &quot;Moby Dick—Rehearsed&quot; (1955) and in a BBC television play, &quot;The Prisoner&quot; by Bridget Boland. McGoohan wrote a forty-page show Bible, which included a &quot;history of the Village, the sort of telephones they used, the sewerage system, what they ate, the transport, the boundaries, a description of the Village, every aspect of it.&quot; McGoohan wrote and directed several episodes, often using pseudonyms. Specifically, McGoohan wrote &quot;Free for All&quot; under the pen name &#x27;Paddy Fitz&#x27; (Paddy being the Irish diminutive for Patrick and Fitzpatrick being his mother&#x27;s maiden name) and directed the episodes &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; and &quot;A Change of Mind&quot; using the stage name &#x27;Joseph Serf&#x27;, the surname being ironically a word meaning a peasant who is under the control of a feudal master. Using his own name, McGoohan wrote and directed the last two episodes—&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &quot;Fall Out&quot;—and directed &quot;Free for All&quot;.

In a 1966 interview for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; by reporter Robert Musel, McGoohan stated, &quot;John Drake of &quot;Secret Agent&quot; is gone.&quot; Furthermore, McGoohan stated in a 1985 interview that Number Six is not the same character as John Drake, adding that he had originally wanted another actor to portray the character. However, other sources indicate that several of the crew members who continued on from &quot;Danger Man&quot; to work on &quot;The Prisoner&quot; considered it to be a continuation, and that McGoohan was continuing to play the character of John Drake. Author, Dave Rogers claims that Markstein had wanted the character to be a continuation of Drake, but by doing so would have meant paying royalties to Ralph Smart, the creator of &quot;Danger Man&quot;. The second officially licensed novel based on &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, published in 1969, refers to Number Six as &quot;Drake&quot; from its first sentence: &quot;Drake woke.&quot; The issue has been extensively debated by fans and television critics.

McGoohan had originally wanted to produce only seven episodes of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, but Grade argued that more shows were necessary in order for him to successfully sell the series to CBS. The exact number that was agreed to and how the series was to end are disputed by different sources.

In an August 1967 article, Dorothy Manners reported that CBS had asked McGoohan to produce 36 segments, but he would agree to produce only 17. According to a 1977 interview, Lew Grade requested 26 episodes, but McGoohan thought this would spread the show too thin managing to come up with only 17. According to &quot;The Prisoner: The Official Companion to the Classic TV Series&quot;, the series was originally supposed to run longer, but was cancelled, forcing McGoohan to write the final episode in only a few days.

&quot;The Prisoner&quot; had its British premiere on 29 September 1967 on ATV Midlands, and the last episode first aired on 1 February 1968 on Scottish Television. The world broadcast premiere was on the CTV Television Network in Canada on 5 September 1967.

===Filming===
Filming began with the shooting of the series&#x27; opening sequence in London on 28 August 1966, with location work beginning on 5 September 1966, primarily in Portmeirion, North Wales. This location partially inspired the show. At the request of Portmeirion&#x27;s architect Clough Williams-Ellis, the main location for the series was not disclosed until the opening credits of the final episode, where it was described as &quot;The Hotel Portmeirion, Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales&quot;. Many local residents were recruited as extras. The Village setting was further augmented by the use of the backlot facilities at MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood.
Additionally, filming of a key sequence of the opening credits ——and of exterior location filming for three episodes— took place at 1 Buckingham Place in Westminster, which at the time was a private residence, presented as Number Six&#x27;s home. The building is now a highlight of &quot;Prisoner&quot; location tours, and currently houses the headquarters of the Royal Warrant Holders Association. The episodes &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;, &quot;The Girl Who Was Death&quot; (the cricket match for which was filmed at four locations, with the main sequences filmed at Eltisley in Cambridgeshire) and &quot;Fall Out&quot; also made use of extensive location shooting in London and other locations.

At the time, most British television was broadcast in black and white, but the show was filmed in color to reach the American audience.

===Background of the Village===
According to the writer James Follett, a friend and protégé of George Markstein, Markstein had developed a backstory explaining the origin of the Village and its connection to Number Six&#x27;s resignation.

Markstein&#x27;s concept was that John Drake (of &quot;Danger Man&quot;) had once proposed a strategy for dealing with retired secret agents who could still pose a security risk. Years later, Drake discovers that his proposal was put into practice, not as a benign means of retirement, but an interrogation centre and prison camp known as The Village.

Outraged, Drake resigns, knowing he will be taken to The Village, where he planned to learn everything he can about how his idea has been implemented and find a way to destroy it. However, due to the range of nationalities and agents present, Drake realises that he can&#x27;t be sure whose Village he is in—his own, or one belonging to the other side.

Markstein later commented:The prisoner was going to leave the Village and he was going to have adventures in many parts of the world, but ultimately he would always be a prisoner. By that I don&#x27;t mean he would always go back to the Village. He would always be a prisoner of his circumstances, his situation, his secret, his background... and &#x27;they&#x27; would always be there to ensure that his captivity continues.

==Reception==
The finale of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; left numerous open-ended questions, generating controversy and letters of outrage. Following the final episode, McGoohan &quot;claimed he had to go into hiding for a while&quot;.

==Home media==
===Video tapes===
Numerous editions of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; were released in the UK by companies such as Carlton, the copyright holder of the TV series. The first VHS and Betamax releases were through Precision Video in 1982 from 16mm original prints. They released four tapes, each with two episodes edited together: &quot;The Arrival&quot;/&quot;The Schizoid Man&quot;, &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;/&quot;A. B. and C.&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot;/&quot;Free For All&quot;, and &quot;The General&quot;/&quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot;, thus omitting the final storyline. In 1986 Channel 5 Video (a now-defunct home video brand owned by Universal Pictures) released a series of all 17 episodes on VHS and LaserDisc. In 1993 PolyGram Video released the entire series plus a special feature called &quot;The Best of The Prisoner&quot; on five VHS cassette tapes.

In North America, MPI Home Video released a total of 20 VHS videotapes in 1984 encompassing the entire series: one tape for each of the 17 episodes plus three more containing &quot;The Alternate Version of &#x27;The Chimes of Big Ben&#x27;&quot;, a documentary, and a &quot;best of&quot; retrospective. MPI also released editions of nine LaserDiscs in 1988 and 1998, the last disc of which comprised the final Episode 17, &quot;Fall Out&quot;, plus &quot;The Prisoner Video Companion&quot; on side two.

===DVD===
In 2000, the first DVD release in the UK was issued by Carlton International Entertainment, with A&amp;E Home Video releasing the same DVDs in North America/Region 1 (in four-episode sets as well as a comprehensive 10-disc &quot;mega-box&quot; edition). A&amp;E subsequently reissued the mega-box in a 40th anniversary edition in 2007. The A&amp;E issue included an alternative version of &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot; and the MPI-produced documentary (but not the redundant &quot;best of&quot; retrospective) among its limited special features. In Australia, Umbrella Entertainment released a DVD set in 2003. In 2005 DeAgostini in the UK released all 17 episodes in a fortnightly partwork series.

&quot;The Prisoner: 40th Anniversary Special Edition&quot; DVD box-set released in 2007 featured standard-definition versions from high-definition masters created by Network. It also included a production guide to the series by Andrew Pixley.

===Blu-ray===
&quot;The Prisoner: The Complete Series&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2009, following in North America on 27 October 2009. The episodes were restored by the A&amp;E Network to create new high-definition masters. The box-set features all 17 remastered episodes plus extensive special features, including the feature-length documentary &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock Yourself Out&quot;, a restored original edit of &quot;Arrival&quot; and extensive archive photos and production stills.

&quot;The Prisoner: 50th Anniversary Set&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 29 July 2019. It featured a six-disc Blu-ray collection with none of the extra material found on the DVD box-set released for the 40th anniversary included. The first half of Andrew Pixley&#x27;s production book was now illustrated and presented in hardback, and text commentaries for every episode detailing the production story of the series were included for the first time. A six-CD set of remastered music was also included. Some additional extras were included such as an interview with McGoohan&#x27;s daughter, Catherine. Missing from the set was the &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock Yourself Out&quot; documentary, the script PDFs and some episode commentaries.

==Spin-offs==
===Books===
In the late 1960s, the TV series quickly spawned three novels tied into the series. In the 1970s and into the 1980s, as the series gained cult status, a large amount of fan-produced material began to appear, with the official appreciation society forming in 1977. In 1988, the first officially sanctioned guide – &quot;The Prisoner Companion&quot; – was released. It was not well received by fans or Patrick McGoohan. In 1989, Oswald and Carraze released &quot;The Prisoner&quot; in France with a translated version appearing shortly after. From the 1990s, numerous other books about the TV series and Patrick McGoohan have been produced. Robert Fairclough&#x27;s books - including two volumes of original scripts - are considered some of the best researched books available. For the 40th anniversary, Andrew Pixley wrote a well-received and in depth account of the series&#x27; production. There are guides to shooting locations in Portmeirion and also a biography of co-creator George Markstein. Some members of the production crew have released books about their time working on the series including Eric Mival and Ian Rakoff.

===Games===
In the early 1980s, Edu-Ware produced two computer games based upon the series for the Apple II computer. The first, titled simply &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, was released in 1980, followed by &quot;Prisoner 2&quot; in 1982.

Steve Jackson Games&#x27; popular role-playing game system &quot;GURPS&quot; released a (now out of print) world book for &quot;The Prisoner.&quot; It included maps, episode synopses and details of the Village and its inhabitants.

===Comics===
In 1988, DC Comics released &quot;Shattered Visage&quot;, the first part of a four-part series of comics based on the characters in the TV series. In 2018 Titan Comics re-issued &quot;Shattered Visage&quot; as well as releasing &quot;The Prisoner: The Uncertainty Machine&quot;, another four-part series of comics about another spy returning to the Village. Although Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s Number Six is depicted on covers of the 2018 series, the character plays no direct role in the story.

===Remake===

In 2009, the show was remade as a miniseries, also titled &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, which aired in the U.S. on AMC. The miniseries stars Jim Caviezel as Number 6, and Ian McKellen as Number 2, and was shot on location in Namibia and South Africa. The new series received mainly unfavourable reviews, with a 45/100 rating by 21 critics and 3.6/10 by 82 users as of July 2018.

===Proposed film adaptation===
Christopher Nolan was reported to be considering a film version in 2009, but later dropped out of the project. The producer Barry Mendel said a decision to continue with the project depended on the success of the television mini-series. In 2016, Ridley Scott was in talks to direct the screen version. Nolan was once again tied to a potential film adaptation in 2024.

===Audio dramas===
On 5 January 2015, Big Finish Productions, best known for its long-running series of BBC-licensed audio dramas based upon &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, announced that it would be producing licensed audio dramas based on &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, with the first scheduled for release in 2016, and that Mark Elstob would play Number Six. The first series, containing new reimaginings of three original series scripts, &quot;Arrival&quot;, &quot;The Schizoid Man&quot; and &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot;, and one new story, &quot;Your Beautiful Village&quot;, written and directed by Nicholas Briggs, was released in January 2016 and was well received. The first series also featured John Standing, Celia Imrie, Ramon Tikaram and Michael Cochrane as Number Two and Helen Goldwyn as The Village Voice/Operations Controller.

A second series was released in August 2017, comprising four stories: &quot;I Met a Man Today&quot; (adapted from &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;), &quot;Project Six&quot; (adapted from &quot;A, B and C&quot;), an adaptation of &quot;Hammer into Anvil&quot;, and new story &quot;Living in Harmony&quot; (not adapted from the TV episode of the same title).

A third series was released in November 2019, comprising four stories: An adaptation of &quot;Free For All&quot;, and new stories &quot;The Girl Who Was Death&quot; (using story elements, but not directly adapted, from the TV episode of the same title), &quot;The Seltzman Connection&quot;, and &quot;No One Will Know&quot; (the last two using story elements from &quot;Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darling&quot;).

These audio dramas have been broadcast by BBC Radio 4 Extra as part of its The 7th Dimension programming.

<text>Theseus (, ; ) was a divine hero in Greek mythology, famous for slaying the Minotaur. The myths surrounding Theseus, his journeys, exploits, and friends, have provided material for storytelling throughout the ages.

Theseus is sometimes described as the son of Aegeus, king of Athens, and sometimes as the son of the god Poseidon. He is raised by his mother, Aethra, and upon discovering his connection to Aegeus, travels overland to Athens, having many adventures on the way. When he reaches Athens, he finds that Aegeus is married to Medea (formerly wife of Jason), who plots against him.

The most famous legend about Theseus is his slaying of the Minotaur, half man and half bull. He then goes on to unite Attica under Athenian rule: the &quot;synoikismos&quot; (&#x27;dwelling together&#x27;). As the unifying king, he is credited with building a palace on the fortress of the Acropolis. Pausanias reports that after &quot;synoikismos&quot;, Theseus established a cult of Aphrodite (&#x27;Aphrodite of all the People&#x27;) on the southern slope of the Acropolis.

Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Theseus&quot; makes use of varying accounts of the death of the Minotaur, Theseus&#x27;s escape, and his romantic involvement with and betrayal of Ariadne, daughter of King Minos.

Plutarch&#x27;s avowed purpose is to construct a life that parallels the &quot;Life of Romulus&quot;, the founding myth of Rome. Plutarch&#x27;s sources, not all of whose texts have survived independently, include Pherecydes (mid-fifth century BC), Demon (c. 400 BC), Philochorus, and Cleidemus (both fourth century BC). As the subject of myth, the existence of Theseus as a real person has not been proven, but scholars believe that he may have been alive during the Late Bronze Age, or possibly as a king in the 8th or 9th century BC.

==Birth and early years==
Aegeus, one of the primordial kings of Athens, was childless. Desiring an heir, he asked the Oracle of Delphi for advice. Her cryptic words were &quot;Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.&quot; Aegeus did not understand the prophecy and was disappointed. He asked the advice of his host Pittheus, king of Troezen. Pittheus understood the prophecy, got Aegeus drunk, and gave Aegeus his daughter Aethra.

But following the instructions of Athena in a dream, Aethra left the sleeping Aegeus and waded across to the island of Sphairia that lay close to Troezen&#x27;s shore. There, she poured a libation to Sphairos (Pelops&#x27;s charioteer) and Poseidon and was possessed by the sea god in the night. The mix gave Theseus a combination of divine as well as mortal characteristics in his nature; such double paternity, with one immortal and one mortal, was a familiar feature of other Greek heroes. After Aethra became pregnant, Aegeus decided to return to Athens. Before leaving, however, he buried his sandals and sword under a huge rock and told Aethra that when their son grew up, he should move the rock, if he were heroic enough, and take the tokens for himself as evidence of his royal parentage. In Athens, Aegeus was joined by Medea, who had left Corinth after slaughtering the children she had borne to Jason, and had taken Aegeus as her new consort.

Thus Theseus was raised in his mother&#x27;s land. When Theseus grew up to be a young man, he moved the rock and recovered his father&#x27;s tokens. His mother then told him the truth about his father&#x27;s identity and that he must take the sword and sandals back to the king Aegeus to claim his birthright. To journey to Athens, Theseus could choose to go by sea (which was the safe way) or by land, following a dangerous path around the Saronic Gulf, where he would encounter a string of six entrances to the Underworld, each guarded by a chthonic enemy. Young, brave, and ambitious, Theseus decided to go alone by the land route and defeated many bandits along the way.

==The Six Labours==

The six entrances to the underworld, more commonly known as the Six Labours, are as follows:
* At the first site, which was Epidaurus, sacred to Apollo and the healer Asclepius, Theseus turned the tables on the chthonic bandit, Periphetes, the Club Bearer, who beat his opponents into the Earth, taking from him the stout staff that often identifies Theseus in vase-paintings.
* At the Isthmian entrance to the Underworld was a robber named Sinis, often called &quot;Pityokamptes&quot; (). He would capture travelers, tie them between two pine trees that were bent down to the ground, and then let the trees go, tearing his victims apart. Theseus slew him by his own method. He then seduced Sinis&#x27;s daughter, Perigune, fathering the child Melanippus.
* In another deed north of the Isthmus, at a place called Crommyon, he killed an enormous pig, the Crommyonian Sow, bred by an old crone named Phaea. Some versions name the sow herself as Phaea. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; by Pseudo-Apollodorus described the Crommyonian Sow as an offspring of Typhon and Echidna.
* Near Megara, a robber named Sciron forced travelers along the narrow cliff-face pathway to wash his feet. While they knelt, he kicked them off the cliff behind them, where they were eaten by a giant turtle (or, in some versions, a sea monster). Theseus pushed him off the cliff where he was eaten as well.
* Another of these enemies was Cercyon, king at the holy site of Eleusis, who challenged passers-by to a wrestling match and, when he had beaten them, killed them. Theseus beat Cercyon at wrestling and then killed him instead.
* The last bandit was Procrustes the Stretcher, who had two beds, one of which he offered to passers-by in the plain of Eleusis. He then&quot; made&quot; them fit into it, either by stretching them or by cutting off their feet. Since he had two beds of different lengths, no one would fit. Theseus once again employed Procrustes&#x27; own method on him, cutting off his legs and decapitating him with his axe.

==Medea, the Marathonian Bull, Androgeus, and the Pallantides==

When Theseus arrived in Athens, he did not reveal his true identity immediately. Aegeus gave him hospitality but was suspicious of the young, powerful stranger&#x27;s intentions. Aegeus&#x27;s consort Medea recognized Theseus immediately as Aegeus&#x27; son and worried that Theseus would be chosen as heir to Aegeus&#x27; kingdom instead of her son Medus. She tried to arrange to have Theseus killed by asking him to capture the Marathonian Bull, an emblem of Cretan power.

On the way to Marathon, Theseus took shelter from a storm in the hut of an ancient woman named Hecale. She swore to make a sacrifice to Zeus if Theseus were successful in capturing the bull. Theseus did capture the bull, but when he returned to Hecale&#x27;s hut, she was dead. In her honor, Theseus gave her name to one of the demes of Attica, making its inhabitants in a sense her adopted children.

When Theseus returned victorious to Athens, where he sacrificed the Bull, Medea tried to poison him. At the last second, Aegeus recognized the sandals and the sword and knocked the poisoned wine cup from Theseus&#x27;s hands. Thus father and son were reunited, and Medea fled to Asia.

When Theseus appeared in the town, his reputation had preceded him, as a result of his having traveled along the notorious coastal road from Troezen and slain some of the most feared bandits there. It was not long before the Pallantides&#x27; hopes of succeeding the childless Aegeus would be lost if they did not get rid of Theseus (the Pallantides were the sons of Pallas and nephews of King Aegeus, who was then living at the royal court in the sanctuary of Delphic Apollo). So they set a trap for him. One band of them would march on the town from one side while another lay in wait near a place called Gargettus in ambush. The plan was that after Theseus, Aegeus, and the palace guards had been forced out the front, the other half would surprise them from behind. However, Theseus was not fooled. Informed of the plan by a herald named Leos, he crept out of the city at midnight and surprised the Pallantides. &quot;Theseus then fell suddenly upon the party lying in ambush, and slew them all. Thereupon the party with Pallas dispersed,&quot; Plutarch reported.

==Theseus and the Minotaur==
Pasiphaë, wife of King Minos of Crete, had several children. The eldest of these, Androgeus, set sail for Athens to take part in the Panathenaic Games, which were held there every four years. Being strong and skillful, he did very well, winning some events outright. He soon became a crowd favorite, much to the resentment of the Pallantides, who assassinated him, incurring the wrath of Minos.

When King Minos heard what had befallen his son, he ordered the Cretan fleet to set sail for Athens. Minos asked Aegeus for his son&#x27;s assassins, saying that if they were to be handed to him, the city would be spared. However, not knowing who the assassins were, King Aegeus surrendered the whole city to Minos&#x27; mercy. His retribution was to stipulate that at the end of every Great Year, which occurred after every seven cycles on the solar calendar, the seven most courageous youths and the seven most beautiful maidens were to board a boat and be sent as tribute to Crete, never to be seen again.

In another version, King Minos had waged war with the Athenians and was successful. He then demanded that, at nine-year intervals, seven Athenian boys and seven Athenian girls were to be sent to Crete to be devoured by the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster that lived in the Labyrinth created by Daedalus.

On the third occasion, Theseus volunteered to talk to the monster to stop this horror. He took the place of one of the youths and set off with a black sail, promising to his father, Aegeus, that if successful he would return with a white sail. Like the others, Theseus was stripped of his weapons when they sailed. On his arrival in Crete, Ariadne, King Minos&#x27; daughter, fell in love with Theseus and, on the advice of Daedalus, gave him a ball of thread (a clew), so he could find his way out of the Labyrinth. That night, Ariadne escorted Theseus to the Labyrinth, and Theseus promised that if he returned from the Labyrinth he would take Ariadne with him. As soon as Theseus entered the Labyrinth, he tied one end of the ball of string to the doorpost and brandished his sword which he had kept hidden from the guards inside his tunic. Theseus followed Daedalus&#x27; instructions given to Ariadne: go forwards, always down, and never left or right. Theseus came to the heart of the Labyrinth and upon the sleeping Minotaur. The beast awoke and a tremendous fight occurred. Theseus overpowered the Minotaur with his strength and stabbed the beast in the throat with his sword (according to one &quot;scholium&quot; on Pindar&#x27;s Fifth Nemean Ode, Theseus strangled it).
After decapitating the beast, Theseus used the string to escape the Labyrinth and managed to escape with all of the young Athenians and Ariadne as well as her younger sister Phaedra. Then he and the rest of the crew fell asleep on the beach of the island of Naxos, where they stopped on their way back, looking for water. Theseus then abandoned Ariadne, where Dionysus eventually found and married her. On his way back from Crete, he also stopped on the island of Delos, where, according to Plutarch, &quot;Theseus danced with the young Athenians a dance still performed by the inhabitants of the island, consisting of twisting and twisted movements that reproduce the shapes of the labyrinth. Dicearchos states that this dance is called &#x27;Crane&#x27;.&quot; Theseus forgot to put up the white sails instead of the black ones, so his father, the king, believing he was dead, committed suicide, throwing himself off a cliff of Sounion and into the sea, causing this body of water to be named the Aegean Sea.

==Ship of Theseus==
According to Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Theseus&quot;, the ship Theseus used on his return from Minoan Crete to Athens was kept in the Athenian harbor as a memorial for several centuries.

The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place...

The ship had to be maintained in a seaworthy state, for, in return for Theseus&#x27;s successful mission, the Athenians had pledged to honor Apollo every year henceforth. Thus, the Athenians sent a religious mission to the island of Delos (one of Apollo&#x27;s most sacred sanctuaries) on the Athenian state galley—the ship itself—to pay their fealty to the god. To preserve the purity of the occasion, no executions were permitted between the time when the religious ceremony began to when the ship returned from Delos, which took several weeks.

To preserve the ship, any wood that wore out or rotted was replaced; it was thus unclear to philosophers how much of the original ship remained, giving rise to the philosophical question of whether it should be considered &quot;the same&quot; ship or not. Such philosophical questions about the nature of identity are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ship of Theseus&quot; paradox.

Regardless of these issues, the Athenians preserved the ship. They believed that Theseus had been an actual, historical figure and the ship gave them a tangible connection to their divine provenance.

==Theseus and Pirithous==
Theseus&#x27;s best friend was Pirithous, king of the Lapiths. Pirithous had heard stories of Theseus&#x27;s courage and strength in battle but wanted proof so he rustled Theseus&#x27;s herd of cattle and drove it from Marathon and Theseus set out in pursuit. Pirithous took up his arms and the pair met to do battle but were so impressed with each other&#x27;s gracefulness, beauty and courage they took an oath of friendship and joined the Calydonian boar hunt.

In &quot;Iliad&quot; I, Nestor numbers Pirithous and Theseus &quot;of heroic fame&quot; among an earlier generation of heroes of his youth, &quot;the strongest men that Earth has bred, the strongest men against the strongest enemies, a savage mountain-dwelling tribe whom they utterly destroyed.&quot; No trace of such an oral tradition, which Homer&#x27;s listeners would have recognized in Nestor&#x27;s allusion, survived in the literary epic. Later, Pirithous was preparing to marry Hippodamia. The centaurs were guests at the wedding feast, but got drunk and tried to abduct the women, including Hippodamia. The Lapiths won the ensuing battle.
In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; Theseus fights against and kills Eurytus, the &quot;fiercest of all the fierce centaurs&quot; at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia.

Also according to Ovid, Phaedra, Theseus&#x27; wife, felt left out by her husband&#x27;s love for Pirithous and she used this as an excuse to try to convince her stepson, Hippolytus, to accept being her lover, as Theseus also neglected his son because he preferred to spend long periods with his companion.

===Abduction of Persephone and encounter with Hades===
Theseus, a great abductor of women, and his bosom companion, Pirithous, since they were sons of Zeus and Poseidon, pledged themselves to marry daughters of Zeus. Theseus, in an old tradition, chose Helen, and together they kidnapped her, intending to keep her until she was old enough to marry. Pirithous chose Persephone, even though she was already married to Hades, king of the underworld. They left Helen with Theseus&#x27;s mother, Aethra at Aphidna, whence she was rescued by the Dioscuri.

On Pirithous&#x27;s behalf they rather unwisely traveled to the underworld, domain of Persephone and her husband Hades. As they wandered through the outskirts of Tartarus, Theseus sat down to rest on a rock. As he did so he felt his limbs change and grow stiff. He tried to rise but could not. He was fixed to the rock. As he turned to cry out to his friend, he saw that Pirithous too was crying out. Around him gathered the terrible band of Furies with snakes in their hair, torches, and long whips in their hands. Before these monsters, the hero&#x27;s courage failed and he was led away to eternal punishment.

For many months in half-darkness, Theseus sat immovably fixed to the rock, mourning for both his friend and for himself. In the end, he was rescued by Heracles who had come to the underworld for his 12th task. There he persuaded Persephone to forgive him for the part he had taken in the rash venture of Pirithous. So Theseus was restored to the upper air but Pirithous never left the kingdom of the dead, for when Heracles tried to free Pirithous, the underworld shook. They then decided the task was beyond any hero and left. When Theseus returned to Athens, he found that the Dioscuri had taken Helen and Aethra to Sparta.

==Phaedra and Hippolytus==
Phaedra, Theseus&#x27; second wife and the daughter of King Minos, bore Theseus two sons, Demophon and Acamas. While these two were still in their infancy, Phaedra fell in love with Hippolytus, Theseus&#x27; son by the Amazon queen Hippolyta. According to some versions of the story, Hippolytus had scorned Aphrodite to become a follower of Artemis, so Aphrodite made Phaedra fall in love with him as punishment. He rejected her out of chastity.

Alternatively, in Euripides&#x27; version, &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, Phaedra&#x27;s nurse told Hippolytus of her mistress&#x27;s love and he swore he would not reveal the nurse as his source of information. To ensure that she would die with dignity, Phaedra wrote to Theseus on a tablet claiming that Hippolytus had raped her before hanging herself. Theseus believed her and used one of the three wishes he had received from Poseidon against his son. The curse caused Hippolytus&#x27; horses to be frightened by a sea monster, usually a bull, and drag their rider to his death. Artemis would later tell Theseus the truth, promising to avenge her loyal follower on another follower of Aphrodite.

In a version recounted by the Roman playwright Seneca, entitled &quot;Phaedra&quot;, after Phaedra told Theseus that Hippolytus had raped her, Theseus called upon Neptune (as he did Poseidon in Euripides&#x27; interpretation) to kill his son. Upon hearing the news of Hippolytus&#x27; death at the hands of Neptune&#x27;s sea monster, Phaedra committed suicide out of guilt, for she had not intended for Hippolytus to die.

In yet another version, Phaedra simply told Theseus Hippolytus had raped her and did not kill herself. Dionysus sent a wild bull that terrified Hippolytus&#x27;s horses.

A cult grew up around Hippolytus, associated with the cult of Aphrodite. Girls who were about to be married offered locks of their hair to him. The cult believed that Asclepius had resurrected Hippolytus and that he lived in a sacred forest near Aricia in Latium.

==Other stories and death of Theseus==

According to some sources, Theseus also was one of the Argonauts, although Apollonius of Rhodes states in the &quot;Argonautica&quot; that Theseus was still in the underworld at this time. Both statements are inconsistent with Medea being Aegeus&#x27; wife by the time Theseus first came to Athens. With Phaedra, Theseus fathered Acamas, who was one of those who hid in the Trojan Horse during the Trojan War. Theseus welcomed the wandering Oedipus and helped Adrastus to bury the Seven against Thebes.

Lycomedes of the island of Skyros threw Theseus off a cliff after he had lost popularity in Athens. In 475 BC, in response to an oracle, Cimon of Athens, having conquered Skyros for the Athenians, identified as the remains of Theseus &quot;a coffin of a great corpse with a bronze spear-head by its side and a sword.&quot; (Plutarch, &quot;Life of Theseus&quot;). The remains found by Cimon were reburied in Athens. The early modern name &quot;Theseion&quot; (Temple of Theseus) was mistakenly applied to the Temple of Hephaestus which was thought to be the actual site of the hero&#x27;s tomb.

<text>Tax law or revenue law is an area of legal study in which public or sanctioned authorities, such as federal, state and municipal governments (as in the case of the US) use a body of rules and procedures (laws) to assess and collect taxes in a legal context. The rates and merits of the various taxes, imposed by the authorities, are attained via the political process inherent in these bodies of power, and not directly attributable to the actual domain of tax law itself.

Tax law is part of public law. It covers the application of existing tax laws on individuals, entities and corporations, in areas where tax revenue is derived or levied, e.g. income tax, estate tax, business tax, employment/payroll tax, property tax, gift tax and exports/imports tax. There have been some arguments that consumer law is a better way to engage in large-scale redistribution than tax law because it does not necessitate legislation and can be more efficient, given the complexities of tax law.

==Major issues==
Primary taxation issues differ among various countries, although similarities might exist.

=== Developed countries ===
* Taxes can fail to raise sufficient revenue to cover government spending.
* Taxes are generally complex and can be viewed as benefitting high income earners more than they do to lower income earners (in the payment of relatively less tax).
* Tax evasion and avoidance occur, leading to reduced government revenue.
* Taxes can produce poor desired outcomes (lower productivity and provide less incentive for businesses to grow).
* Taxes can curb economic growth through inefficiency, e.g. corporate taxes/hurdles that could impede smaller entities to grow.
* Taxation can be viewed as disproportionate, as in the case of the taxation of capital gains versus labor income, in which investors generally pay less tax on investment income vs workers who proportionally pay more on their wages.
* Taxes can remain questionable in achieving desired goals, such the Ecotax which is primarily intended to promote environmentally friendly activities via economic incentives.

=== Developing countries ===
* Taxes in developing economies can be hard to standardize since most workers work in small, and often unregulated enterprises.
* Tax systems without sound establishments and competent administration to run and manage them can be burdensome and inefficient.
* Tax systems without reliable data are hard to regulate and change.
* Tax systems tend to have the rich bear a heavier burden of taxation.

== Education ==
===Australia===
Tax law education is a specialisation of accountants, tax agents, and lawyers. Accountants are required by either CPA Australia to complete a course in law of taxation and law of financial services. There is a legal obligation to complete taxation law and commercial law for registration as a tax agent with the Tax Practitioner&#x27;s Board. Law students are not typically required to complete a unit in tax law, but may opt to take it as an elective in Australian universities.

===Pertaining to the US===

==== Pre-requisites ====
* completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree - students contemplating tax law might have to consider majoring in economics, accounting or finance.
* sitting for Law School Admission Test (LSAT).

==== Law school ====
* In law school, the students take foundational courses from &quot;constitutional law to civil procedures.&quot;
* At this level, law students can take more specialized courses in taxation, such as &quot;limited partnerships and income taxes, business liquidations and acquisitions.&quot;
* Upon completion, the law students graduate with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree—which is sufficient for admission to an LL.M. in Taxation.

==== Post law school ====
* JD graduates may then enroll in a Master of Laws in Taxation (LL.M.), a one-year program. Other concentrations available to students include: estate planning or business taxation.
* The Bar exam.

=== Pertaining to other countries ===

==== Post law school ====
* JD graduates enroll in a Master of Laws (LL.M) program, as is seen in Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands.

=====General requirements=====
* A bachelor&#x27;s degree - required for entry into law school.
* Law School Admission Test (LSAT) - Required for law school admission in United States, Canada and a growing number of countries. J.D. (Juris Doctor) or First degree in law.
* The Juris Doctor (JD) program is offered by only a number of countries. These include: United States, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Philippines, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The courses vary in duration of years, curriculum and whether or not further training is required, depending on which country the program is in.

===== In Africa =====
Most African countries use the British legal education curriculum in their law educational system to train lawyers.

Overall, legal education, across African countries, starts at the university level as an undergraduate course although a few universities have promulgated a law degree as a graduate program &quot;akin to [that] … in the United States, Canada, and India.&quot;

In most African countries, a law degree does not necessarily qualify one to practice as a lawyer. Further post-graduate practical training is required.

Graduates earn an undergraduate law degree, viz. the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), via a four-year program (as in Malawi, Kenya, Zambia, and most of South African law universities). Subsequently, graduates with the Bachelor of Laws seek to earn the Master of Laws or greater in order to become practitioners of the law. Some law institutions offer tracks to a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), a Doctor of Philosophy degree (Ph.D.), or a Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) with emphasis on tax law.

<doc id="31257" wikidata="Q36566" url="?curid=31257" title="Tadoma">
<text>Tadoma is a method of communication utilized by deafblind individuals, in which the listener places their little finger on the speaker&#x27;s lips and their fingers along the jawline. The middle three fingers often fall along the speaker&#x27;s cheeks with the little finger picking up the vibrations of the speaker&#x27;s throat. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;tactile lipreading&quot;, as the listener feels the movement of the lips, the vibrations of the vocal cords, expansion of the cheeks and the warm air produced by nasal phonemes such as &#x27;N&#x27; and &#x27;M&#x27;. Hand positioning can vary, and it is a sometimes also used by hard-of-hearing people to supplement their remaining hearing.

In some cases, especially if the speaker knows sign language, the deafblind listener may use the Tadoma method with one hand on the speaker&#x27;s face, and their other hand on the speaker’s signing hand to hear the words. In this way, the two methods reinforce each other, increasing the chances of the listener understanding the speaker.

The Tadoma method can also help a deafblind person retain speech skills they may had otherwise. This can, in special cases, allow deafblind people to acquire entirely new words.

It is a difficult method to learn and use, and is rarely used nowadays. However, a small number of deafblind people still use the Tadoma method in everyday communication.

The Tadoma method was invented by American teacher Sophie Alcorn and developed at the Perkins School for the Blind in Massachusetts. It is named after the first two children to whom it was taught: Winthrop &quot;Tad&quot; Chapman and Oma Simpson. It was hoped that the students would learn to speak by trying to reproduce what they felt on the speaker&#x27;s face and throat while touching their own face.

Helen Keller was a famous user of the method.

<text>Toruń is a city on the Vistula River in north-central Poland and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its population was 196,935 as of December 2021. Previously, it was the capital of the Toruń Voivodeship (1975–1998) and the Pomeranian Voivodeship (1921–1945). Since 1999, Toruń has been a seat of the local government of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship and is one of its two capitals, together with Bydgoszcz. The cities and neighboring counties form the Bydgoszcz–Toruń twin city metropolitan area.

Toruń is one of the oldest cities in Poland; it was first settled in the 8th century and in 1233 was expanded by the Teutonic Knights. For centuries it was home to people of diverse backgrounds and religions. From 1264 until 1411, Toruń was part of the Hanseatic League and by the 17th century a leading trading point, which greatly affected the city&#x27;s architecture, ranging from Brick Gothic to Mannerist and Baroque.

In the Early Modern period, Toruń was a royal city of Poland and one of Poland&#x27;s four largest cities. With the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, it became part of Prussia, then of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, serving as the temporary Polish capital in 1809, then again of Prussia, of the German Empire and, after World War I, of the reborn Polish Republic. During the Second World War, Toruń was spared bombing and destruction; its Old Town and iconic central marketplace have been entirely preserved.

Toruń is renowned for its gingerbread – the gingerbread-baking tradition dates back nearly a millennium – as well as for its large Cathedral. It hosts the Camerimage International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography. Toruń is noted for its very high standard of living and quality of life. In 1997 the medieval part of the city was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2007 the Old Town of Toruń was added to the list of Seven Wonders of Poland.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
The first settlement in the vicinity of Toruń is dated by archaeologists to 1100 BC (Lusatian culture). During early medieval times, in the 7th through 13th centuries, it was the location of an old Slavonic settlement, at a ford of the river Vistula. In the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state ruled by the Piast dynasty.
In spring 1231 the Teutonic Knights crossed the river Vistula near the town of Nieszawa and established a fortress. On 28 December 1233, Teutonic Knights Hermann von Salza and Hermann Balk signed the city charters for Toruń (&quot;Thorn&quot;) and Chełmno (&quot;Kulm&quot;). The original document was lost in 1244. The set of rights in general is known as Kulm law. In 1236, due to frequent flooding, it was relocated to the present site of the Old Town. In 1239 Franciscan friars settled in the city, followed in 1263 by Dominicans. In 1264 the adjacent New Town was founded, predominantly to house Torun&#x27;s growing population of craftsmen and artisans, who predominantly came from German-speaking lands.
In 1280, the city (or as it was then, both cities) joined the mercantile Hanseatic League, and thus became an important medieval trade centre.

In the 14th century, papal verdicts ordered the restoration of the area to Poland; however, the Teutonic Knights did not comply and continued to occupy the region. The city was recaptured by Poland in 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War; however, after the First Peace of Thorn was signed in the city in February 1411, the city fell back to the Teutonic Order. In 1411, the city left the Hanseatic League. In the 1420s, Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło built the Dybów Castle, located in present-day left-bank Toruń, which he visited numerous times. During the next big Polish–Teutonic War, Dybów Castle was occupied by the Teutonic Knights from 1431 to 1435.

In 1440, the gentry of Toruń co-founded the Prussian Confederation to further oppose the Knights&#x27; policies. From 1452, talks between Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon and the burghers of the Confederation were held at Dybów Castle. The Confederation rose against the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in 1454 and its delegation submitted a petition to Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon asking him to regain power over the region as its rightful ruler. An act of incorporation was signed in Kraków 6 March 1454, recognizing the region (including Toruń), as part of the Polish Kingdom.
These events led to the Thirteen Years&#x27; War. The citizens of the city, enraged by the Order&#x27;s ruthless exploitation, conquered the Teutonic castle, and dismantled the fortifications brick by brick, except for the Gdanisko tower which was used until the 18th century to store gunpowder. The local mayor pledged allegiance to the Polish king during the incorporation in March 1454 in Kraków, and then in May 1454, an official ceremony was held in Toruń, in which the nobility, knights, landowners, mayors, and local officials from Chełmno Land, including Toruń, again solemnly swore allegiance to the Polish king and the Kingdom of Poland. Since 1454, the city has been authorized by King Casimir IV to mint Polish coins. During the war, Casimir IV often stayed at the Dybów Castle and Toruń financially supported the Polish Army. The New Town and Old Town amalgamated in 1454.

The Thirteen Years&#x27; War ended in 1466, with the Second Peace of Thorn, in which the Teutonic Order renounced any claims to the city and recognised it as part of Poland. The Polish king granted the town great privileges, similar to those of Gdańsk. Also in 1454 at Dybów Castle, the King issued the famous Statutes of Nieszawa, covering a set of privileges for the Polish nobility; an event that is regarded as the birth of the noble democracy in Poland, which lasted until the country&#x27;s demise in 1795.

=== Early modern period ===

In 1473, Nicolaus Copernicus was born, and in 1501 Polish king John I Albert died in Toruń; his heart was buried in St. John&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1500, the Tuba Dei, the largest church bell in Poland at the time, was installed at Toruń Cathedral, and a bridge across the Vistula was built, the country&#x27;s longest wooden bridge at the time. In 1506, Toruń became a royal city of Poland. In 1528, the royal mint started operating in Toruń. In 1568, a gymnasium was founded, which after 1594 became one of the leading schools of northern Poland for centuries to come. Also in 1594, Toruń&#x27;s first museum (&quot;Musaeum&quot;) was established at the school, beginning the city&#x27;s museal traditions. A city of great wealth and influence, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period. Sejms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were held in Toruń in 1576 and 1626.
In 1557, during the Protestant Reformation, the city adopted Protestantism. Under Mayor Henryk Stroband (1586–1609), the city became centralized. Administrative power passed into the hands of the city council. In 1595, Jesuits arrived to promote the Counter-Reformation, taking control of St John&#x27;s Church. Protestant city officials tried to limit the influx of Catholics into the city, as Catholics (Jesuits and Dominican friars) already controlled most of the churches, leaving only St Mary&#x27;s for Protestant citizens. In 1645, at a time when religious conflicts occurred in many other European countries and the disastrous Thirty Years&#x27; War was fought west of Poland, in Toruń, on the initiative of King Władysław IV Vasa, a three-month congress of European Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists was held, known as &quot;Colloquium Charitativum;&quot; an important event in the history of interreligious dialogue.

During the Great Northern War (1700–21), the city was besieged by Swedish troops. The restoration of Augustus II the Strong as King of Poland was prepared in the city in the Treaty of Thorn (1709) by the Russian tsar Peter the Great. In the second half of the 17th century, tensions between Catholics and Protestants grew. In the early 18th century about 50 percent of the populace, especially the gentry and middle class, were German-speaking Protestants, while the other 50 percent were Polish-speaking Roman Catholics. Protestant influence was subsequently pushed back after the Tumult of Thorn of 1724.

=== Late modern period (from 1793) ===
After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the city was annexed by Prussia. It was briefly regained by Poles as part of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807–1815, even serving as the temporary capital in April and May 1809. During these years the city began to attract a growing Jewish community. In 1809, Toruń was successfully defended by the Poles against the Austrians. After being re-annexed by Prussia in 1815, Toruń was subjected to Germanisation and became a strong center of Polish resistance against such policies. The city&#x27;s first synagogue was inaugurated in 1847. New Polish institutions were established, such as Towarzystwo Naukowe w Toruniu (&quot;Toruń Scientific Society&quot;), a major Polish institution in the Prussian Partition of Poland, founded in 1875. After World War I, Poland declared independence and regained control over the city. In interwar Poland, Toruń was the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, Germany occupied the city from 7 September 1939 to 1 February 1945. &quot;Einsatzkommando 16&quot; entered the city to commit various crimes against Poles. Under German occupation, local people were subjected to arrests, expulsions, slave labor, deportations to concentration camps and executions, especially the Polish elites as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;.

A group of Polish railwaymen and policemen from Toruń were murdered by the German gendarmerie and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in Gąbin on 19–21 September 1939. Local Poles, including activists, teachers and priests, arrested in Toruń and Toruń County beginning in September 1939, were initially held in the pre-war prison, and after it became overcrowded in October 1939, the Germans imprisoned Poles in Fort VII of the Toruń Fortress. On 17–19 October 1939 alone, the German police and the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; arrested 1,200 Poles in Toruń and Toruń County. In early November 1939, the Germans carried out further mass arrests of Polish teachers, farmers and priests in Toruń and the county, who were then imprisoned in Fort VII. Imprisoned Poles were then either deported to concentration camps or murdered onsite.
Large massacres of over 1,100 Poles from the city and region, including teachers, school principals, local officials, restaurateurs, shop owners, merchants, farmers, railwaymen, policemen, craftsmen, students, priests, workers, doctors, were carried out in the present-day district of Barbarka. Six mass graves were discovered after the war, in five of which the bodies of the victims were burned, as the Germans had tried to cover up the crime. Local teachers were also among Polish teachers murdered in the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg, Mauthausen and Dachau concentration camps. Nonetheless, the Polish resistance movement was active in the city, and Toruń was the seat of one of the six main commands of the Union of Armed Struggle in occupied Poland (alongside Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Białystok and Lwów).

During the occupation, Germany established and operated Stalag XX-A prisoner-of-war camp in the city, with multiple forced labour subcamps in the region, in which Polish, British, French, Australian and Soviet POWs were held. From 1940 to 1943, in the northern part of the city the German transit camp for Poles expelled from Toruń and the surrounding area, became infamous for inhuman sanitary conditions. Over 12,000 Poles passed through the camp, and around 1,000 died there, including about 400 children. From 1941 to 1945, a German forced labour camp was located in the city. In the spring of 1942, the Germans murdered 30 Polish scouts aged 13–16 in Fort VII.

While the city&#x27;s population suffered many atrocities, as described, there were no battles or bombings that damaged its buildings. Thus, the city avoided damage during both World Wars, and retained its historic architecture, ranging from Gothic through Renaissance and Baroque to 19th and 20th century styles.

== Sights ==
Listed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1997, Toruń has many monuments of architecture dating back to the Middle Ages. The city is famous for having preserved almost intact its medieval spatial layout and many Gothic buildings, all built from brick, including monumental churches, the Town Hall and many burgher houses.

=== Gothic architecture ===
Toruń has the largest number of preserved Gothic houses in Poland, many with Gothic wall paintings or wood-beam ceilings from the 16th to the 18th centuries.

* The Cathedral of SS. John the Evangelist and John the Baptist, an aisled hall church built in the 14th century and extended in the 15th century; outstanding Gothic sculptures and paintings inside (Moses, St. Mary Magdalene, gravestone of Johann von Soest), Renaissance and Baroque epitaphs and altars (among them the epitaph of Copernicus from 1580), as well as the Tuba Dei, the largest medieval church bell in Poland and one of the largest in Europe
* St. Mary&#x27;s church, a formerly Franciscan aisled hall built in the 14th century
* St. James the Greater&#x27;s church (often mistakenly called St Jacob&#x27;s), a basilica from the 14th century, with monumental wall paintings and Gothic stalls
* The Old Town Hall was inaugurated in 1274, than extended and rebuilt between 1391 and 1399, and extended again at the end of the 16th century; considered one of the most monumental town halls in Central Europe (Toruń Regional Museum or &quot;Muzeum Okręgowe&quot; in Polish)
* City fortifications, begun in the 13th century, extended between the 14th and 15th centuries, mostly demolished in the 19th century, but partially preserved with a few city gates and watchtowers (among them the so-called Leaning Tower) from the Vistula side. See also: Toruń Fortress
* A 15th-century Gothic house (now a museum) where Copernicus was reputedly born
* Ruins of 13th-century Teutonic Knights&#x27; castle
* House at the sign of the Star (, the East Asian Museum, previously Gothic, briefly owned by Filip Callimachus, then rebuilt in the 16th century and in 1697, with a richly decorated stucco façade and wooden spiral stairs.

Toruń, unlike many other historic cities in Poland, escaped substantial destruction in World War II. Particularly left intact was the Old Town, all of whose important architectural monuments are originals, not reconstructions.

Major renovation projects have been undertaken in recent years to improve the condition and external presentation of the Old Town. Besides the renovation of various buildings, projects such as the reconstruction of the pavement of the streets and squares (reversing them to their historical appearance), and the introduction of new plants, trees and objects of &#x27;small architecture&#x27;, are underway.

Numerous buildings and other constructions, including the city walls along the boulevard, are illuminated at night, creating an impressive effect - probably unique among Polish cities with respect to the size of Toruń&#x27;s Old Town and the scale of the illumination project itself.

Toruń is also home to the Zoo and Botanical Garden opened in 1965 and 1797 respectively and is one of the city&#x27;s popular tourist attractions.

== Districts ==

Toruń is divided into 24 administrative districts (dzielnica) or boroughs, each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government. The Districts include: Barbarka, Bielany, Bielawy, Bydgoskie Przedmieście, Chełmińskie Przedmieście, Czerniewice, Glinki, Grębocin nad Strugą, Jakubskie Przedmieście, Kaszczorek, Katarzynka, Koniuchy, Mokre, Na Skarpie, Piaski, Podgórz, Rubinkowo, Rudak, Rybaki, Stare Miasto (&quot;Old Town&quot;), Starotoruńskie Przedmieście, Stawki, Winnica, Wrzosy.

==Symbols==
The colors of Toruń are white and blue in the horizontal arrangement, white top, blue bottom, equal in size. The flag of the city of Toruń is a bipartite sheet. The upper field is white, the lower field is blue. If the flag is hung vertically, the upper edge of the flag must be on the left.

The flag with the coat of arms is also in use. The ratio of the height of the coat of arms to the width of the flag is 1:2.

== Climate ==
The climate can be described as humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) if the isotherm of is used or an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) if the isotherm is adopted. Back in 1930s, the city passed close to the original boundary and dividing line of climates C and D groups in the north–south direction proposed by climatologist Wladimir Köppen. Toruń is in the transition between the milder climates of the west and north of the Poland and the more extreme ones like the south (warmer summer) and the east (colder winter). It is not much different from the climates of more southerly Kraków and easterly Warsaw, though it has slightly milder winters and more moderate summers.

Being close to definitely continental climates, it has a high variability caused by the contact of eastern continental air masses and western oceanic ones. This is influenced by the geographical location of the city – the Toruń Basin to the south, and the Vistula Valley to the north.
== Demographics ==

The most recent statistics show a decrease in the population of the city, from 211,169 in 2001 (highest) to 202,562 in 2018. Among the demographic trends influencing this decline, are: suburbanisation, migration to larger urban centres, and wider trends observed in the whole of Poland such as general population decline, slowed down by immigration in 2017. The birth rate in the city in 2017 was 0.75. Low birthrates have been consistent in the city for the first two decades of 21st Century.

The official forecasts from Statistics Poland state that by 2050 the city population will have declined to 157,949.

Inside the city itself, most of the population is concentrated on the right (northern) bank of the Vistula river. Two of the most densely populated areas are Rubinkowo and Na Skarpie, housing projects built mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, located between the central and easternmost districts; their total population is about 70,000.

The Bydgoszcz–Toruń metro area of Toruń and Bydgoszcz, their counties, and a number of smaller towns, may in total have a population of as much as 800,000. Thus the area contains about one third of the population of the Kuyavia-Pomerania region (which has about 2.1 million inhabitants).

== Transport ==

The transport network in the city has undergone major development in recent years. The partial completion of ring road (East and South), the completion of the second bridge (2013) and various road, and cycling lane improvements, including construction of Trasa Średnicowa, have decidedly improved the traffic in the city. However, noise barriers that have been erected along the new or refurbished roads have been criticised as not conducive to a beautiful urban landscape. The extensive roadworks have also drawn attention to the declining population numbers, casting doubt that the city might over-delivered for the future number of road users, as the demographic trends forecast from Statistics Poland predicts a reduction of population by almost 1/4 by year 2050.
The city&#x27;s public transport system comprises five tram lines and about 40 bus routes, covering the city and some of the neighboring communities.

Toruń is situated at a major road junction, one of the most important in Poland. The A1 highway reaches Toruń, and a southern beltway surrounds the city. Besides these, the European route E75 and a number of domestic roads (numbered 10, 15, and 80) run through the city.

With three main railway stations (Toruń Główny, Toruń Miasto and Toruń Wschodni), the city is a major rail junction, with two important lines crossing there (Warsaw–Bydgoszcz and Wrocław–Olsztyn). Two other lines stem from Toruń, toward Malbork and Sierpc.

The rail connection with Bydgoszcz is run under a name &quot;BiT City&quot; as a &quot;metropolitan rail&quot;. Its main purpose is to allow traveling between and within these cities using one ticket. A joint venture of Toruń, Bydgoszcz, Solec Kujawski and the voivodeship, it is considered as important in integrating Bydgoszcz-Toruń metropolitan area. A major modernization of BiT City railroute, as well as a purchase of completely new vehicles to serve the line, is planned for 2008 and 2009. Technically, it will allow to travel between Toruń-East and Bydgoszcz-Airport stations at a speed of in a time of approximately half an hour. In a few years&#x27; time &quot;BiT City&quot; will be integrated with local transportation systems of Toruń and Bydgoszcz, thus creating a uniform metropolitan transportation network – with all necessary funds having been secured in 2008.

Since September 2008, the &quot;one-ticket&quot; solution has been introduced also as regards a rail connection with Włocławek, as a &quot;regional ticket&quot;. The same is planned for connection with Grudziądz.

Two bus depots serve to connect the city with other towns and cities in Poland.

, a small sport airfield exists in Toruń; however, a modernization of the airport is seriously considered with a number of investors interested in it. Independently of this, Bydgoszcz Ignacy Jan Paderewski Airport, located about from Toruń city centre, serves the whole Bydgoszcz-Toruń metropolitan area, with a number of regular flights to European cities.

== Economy ==

Although a medium-sized city, Toruń is the site of the headquarters of some of the largest companies in Poland, or at least of their subsidiaries. The official unemployment rate, , is 5.4%.

In 2006, construction of new plants owned by Sharp Corporation and other companies of mainly Japanese origin has started in the neighboring community of Łysomice - about from city centre. The facilities under construction are located in a newly created special economic zone. As a result of cooperation of the companies mentioned above, a vast high-tech complex is to be constructed in the next few years, providing as many as 10,000 jobs (a prediction for ) at the cost of about 450 million euros. , the creation of another special economic zone is being considered, this time inside city limits.

Thanks to its architectural heritage Toruń is visited by more than 1.5 million tourists a year (1.6 million in 2007). This makes tourism an important branch of the local economy, although time spent in the city by individual tourists or the number of hotels, which can serve them, are still not considered satisfactory. Major investments in renovation of the city&#x27;s monuments, building new hotels (including high-standard ones), improvement in promotion, as well as launching new cultural and scientific events and facilities, give very good prospects for Toruń&#x27;s tourism.

In recent years Toruń has been a site of intense building construction investments, mainly residential and in its transportation network. The latter has been possible partly due to the use of European Union funds assigned for new member states. Toruń city county generates by far the highest number of new dwellings built each year among all Kuyavian-Pomeranian counties, both relative to its population as well as in absolute values. It has led to almost complete rebuilding of some districts. , many major constructions are either under development or are to be launched soon - the value of some of them exceeding 100 million euros. They include a new speedway stadium, major shopping and entertainment centres, a commercial complex popularly called a &quot;New Centre of Toruń&quot;, a music theater, a centre of contemporary art, hotels, office buildings, facilities for the Nicolaus Copernicus University, roads and tram routes, sewage and fresh water delivery systems, residential projects, the possibility of a new bridge over the Vistula, and more. Construction of the A1 motorway and the BiT City fast metropolitan railway also directly affects the city. About 25,000 local firms are registered in Toruń.

== Culture ==
The internationally renowned film festival Camerimage was founded in Toruń in 1993, and has been held annually in the city since 2019. In 2024, with Australian actress Cate Blanchett as jury president, the 32nd International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography Camerimage screened Steve McQueen&#x27;s historical war drama &quot;Blitz&quot;, the first half of Jon M. Chu&#x27;s two-part musical fantasy film &quot;Wicked&quot;, and the world premiere of Joel Souza&#x27;s western film &quot;Rust&quot;.
Toruń has two drama theatres (&quot;Teatr im. Wilama Horzycy&quot; with three stages and &quot;Teatr Wiczy&quot;), two children&#x27;s theatres (&quot;Baj Pomorski&quot; and &quot;Zaczarowany Świat&quot;), two music theatres (&quot;Mała Rewia&quot;, &quot;Studencki Teatr Tańca&quot;), and numerous other theatre groups. The city hosts, among others events, the international theatre festival, &quot;Kontakt&quot;, annually in May.

A building called &quot;Baj Pomorski&quot; has recently been completely reconstructed. It is now one of the most modern cultural facilities in the city, with its front elevation in the shape of a gigantic chest of drawers. It is located at the south-east edge of the Old Town. Toruń has two cinemas including a Cinema City, which has over 2,000 seats.

Over ten major museums document the history of Toruń and the region. Among others, the &quot;House of Kopernik&quot; and the accompanying museum commemorate Nicolaus Copernicus and his revolutionary work, the university museum reveals the history of the city&#x27;s academic past.
The Tony Halik Travelers&#x27; Museum (Muzeum Podróżników im. Tony Halika) was established in 2003 after Elżbieta Dzikowska donated to citizens of Toruń a collection of objects from various countries and cultures following the death of her husband, famous explorer and writer, Toruń native, Tony Halik. It is managed by the District Museum in Toruń.

The Centre of Contemporary Art (&quot;Centrum Sztuki Współczesnej&quot; - &quot;CSW&quot;) opened in June 2008 and is one of the most important cultural facilities of this kind in Poland. The modern building is located in the very centre of the city, adjacent to the Old Town. The Toruń Symphonic Orchestra (formerly the Toruń Chamber Orchestra) is well-rooted in the Toruń cultural landscape.

Toruń is home to a planetarium (located downtown) and an astronomical observatory (located in nearby village of Piwnice). The latter boasts the largest radio telescope in Central Europe with a diameter of , second only to the Effelsberg radio telescope.
Toruń is well known for gingerbread, a type of piernik often made in elaborate molds. Museum of Toruń Gingerbread is a large museum dedicated to it. There are also several gingerbread workshops in the town that offer hands-on experiences for tourists, including the popular Living Museum of Gingerbread. The 15-year-old composer Fryderyk Chopin was smitten with Toruń gingerbread when he visited his godfather, Fryderyk Skarbek, there in the summer of 1825.

Toruń is a center of conservative Roman Catholic culture. Redemptorist Tadeusz Rydzyk has organized here Radio Maryja, Telewizja Trwam, a college whose students contribute to the mentioned media. Now a museum is being constructed.

The 12999 Toruń asteroid is named after the city.

== Education ==

Over 30 elementary and primary schools and over ten high schools make up the educational base of Toruń. Besides these, students can also attend a handful of private schools.

The largest institution of higher education in Toruń, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, serves over 20,000 students and was founded in 1945, based on the Toruń Scientific Society, Stefan Batory University in Wilno, and Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów. The existence of a high-ranked and high-profiled university with so many students plays a great role the city&#x27;s position and importance in general, as well as in creating an image of Toruń&#x27;s streets and clubs filled with crowds of young people. It also has a serious influence on local economy.

Other public institutions of higher education:
* Wyższe Seminarium Duchowne (a section of the Theological Faculty of the Nicolaus Copernicus University)
* The Teacher Training College - Nauczycielskie Kolegium Języków Obcych (affiliated to the Nicolaus Copernicus University)
* College of Fashion (Kolegium Mody)
* University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn - Faculty of Geodesy and Land Management Department in Toruń

<doc id="31259" wikidata="Q35591" url="?curid=31259" title="Tigris">
<text>The Tigris ( ; see below) is the eastern of the two great rivers that define Mesopotamia, the other being the Euphrates. The river flows south from the mountains of the Armenian Highlands through the Syrian and Arabian Deserts, before merging with the Euphrates and reaching to the Persian Gulf. 

The Tigris passes through historical cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad. It is also home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. In ancient times, the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants like the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser.

Today, the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management, and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river&#x27;s legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future.

== Etymology ==

The Ancient Greek form () is an alternative form of (), which was adapted from Old Persian (), itself from Elamite , itself from Sumerian ( or , probably derived from &quot;running water&quot;). The Sumerian term, which can be interpreted as &quot;the swift river&quot;, contrasts the Tigris to its neighbour, the Euphrates, whose leisurely pace caused it to deposit more silt and build up a higher bed than the Tigris. The Sumerian form was borrowed into Akkadian as and from there into the other Semitic languages (compare ; or ; , ).

Another name for the Tigris used in Middle Persian was , literally &quot;swift river&quot;. Today, however, () refers to the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, known in Arabic as the . In Kurdish languages, it is known as , &quot;the Great Water&quot;.

The name of the Tigris in languages that have been important in the region:

==Geography==
The Tigris is long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about southeast of the city of Elazığ and about from the headwaters of the Euphrates. The river then flows for through Southeastern Turkey before forming part of the Syria-Turkey border. This stretch of is the only part of the river that is located in Syria. Some of its affluences are Garzan, Anbarçayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab.

Close to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. First, the artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes. Finally, the Tigris joins the Euphrates near al-Qurnah to form the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris.

Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the banks of the Tigris. The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon, and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2900 B.C.

==Navigation==
The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. Shallow-draft vessels can go as far as Baghdad, but rafts have historically been needed for transport downstream from Mosul.

==Management and water quality==
The Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following April melting of snow in the Turkish mountains. Mosul Dam is the largest dam in Iraq.

Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream.

Water from both rivers is used as a means of pressure during conflicts.

In 2014 a major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved. The consensus, known as the &quot;Geneva Consensus On Tigris River&quot;, was reached at a meeting organized in Geneva by the think tank Strategic Foresight Group.

In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq as well as the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi issued warnings that Mosul Dam could collapse. The United States warned people to evacuate the floodplain of the Tigris because between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were at risk of drowning due to flash flood if the dam collapses, and that the major Iraqi cities of Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad were at risk.

== Religion and mythology ==
In Sumerian mythology, the Tigris was created by the god Enki, who filled the river with flowing water.

In Hittite and Hurrian mythology, &quot;Aranzah&quot; (or &quot;Aranzahas&quot; in the Hittite nominative form) is the Hurrian name of the Tigris River, which was deified. He was the son of Kumarbi and the brother of Teshub and Tašmišu, one of the three gods spat out of Kumarbi&#x27;s mouth onto Mount Kanzuras. Later he colluded with Anu and the Teshub to destroy Kumarbi (The Kumarbi Cycle).

The Tigris appears twice in the Old Testament. First, in the Book of Genesis, it is the third of the four rivers branching off the river issuing out of the Garden of Eden. The second mention is in the Book of Daniel, wherein Daniel states he received one of his visions &quot;when I was by that great river the Tigris&quot;.

The Tigris River is also mentioned in Islam in Sunan Abi Daud 4306. The tomb of Imam Ahmad Bin Hanbal and Syed Abdul Razzaq Jilani is in Baghdad and the flow of Tigris restricts the number of visitors.

Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, also wrote &quot;The Hidden Words&quot; around 1858 while he walked along the banks of the Tigris river during his exile in Baghdad.
The river featured on the coat of arms of Iraq from 1932 to 1959.

<doc id="31260" wikidata="Q191010" url="?curid=31260" title="Titration">
<text>Titration (also known as titrimetry and volumetric analysis) is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine the concentration of an identified analyte (a substance to be analyzed). A reagent, termed the &quot;titrant&quot; or &quot;titrator&quot;, is prepared as a standard solution of known concentration and volume. The titrant reacts with a solution of &quot;analyte&quot; (which may also be termed the &quot;titrand&quot;) to determine the analyte&#x27;s concentration. The volume of titrant that reacted with the analyte is termed the &quot;titration volume&quot;.

==History and etymology==
The word &quot;titration&quot; descends from the French word &quot;titrer&quot; (1543), meaning the proportion of gold or silver in coins or in works of gold or silver; i.e., a measure of fineness or purity. &quot;Tiltre&quot; became &quot;titre&quot;, which thus came to mean the &quot;fineness of alloyed gold&quot;, and then the &quot;concentration of a substance in a given sample&quot;. In 1828, the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac first used &quot;titre&quot; as a verb (&quot;titrer&quot;), meaning &quot;to determine the concentration of a substance in a given sample&quot;.

Volumetric analysis originated in late 18th-century France. French chemist François-Antoine-Henri Descroizilles (fr) developed the first burette (which was similar to a graduated cylinder) in 1791. Gay-Lussac developed an improved version of the burette that included a side arm, and invented the terms &quot;pipette&quot; and &quot;burette&quot; in an 1824 paper on the standardization of indigo solutions. The first true burette was invented in 1845 by the French chemist Étienne-Ossian Henry (1798–1873). A major improvement of the method and popularization of volumetric analysis was due to Karl Friedrich Mohr, who redesigned the burette into a simple and convenient form, and who wrote the first textbook on the topic, &quot;Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrirmethode&quot; (&quot;Textbook of analytical chemistry titration methods&quot;), published in 1855.

==Procedure==

A typical titration begins with a beaker or Erlenmeyer flask containing a very precise amount of the analyte and a small amount of indicator (such as phenolphthalein) placed underneath a calibrated burette or chemistry pipetting syringe containing the titrant. Small volumes of the titrant are then added to the analyte and indicator until the indicator changes color in reaction to the titrant saturation threshold, representing arrival at the endpoint of the titration, meaning the amount of titrant balances the amount of analyte present, according to the reaction between the two. Depending on the endpoint desired, single drops or less than a single drop of the titrant can make the difference between a permanent and temporary change in the indicator. 

===Preparation techniques===
Typical titrations require titrant and analyte to be in a liquid (solution) form. Though solids are usually dissolved into an aqueous solution, other solvents such as glacial acetic acid or ethanol are used for special purposes (as in petrochemistry, which specializes in petroleum.) Concentrated analytes are often diluted to improve accuracy.

Many non-acid–base titrations require a constant pH during the reaction. Therefore, a buffer solution may be added to the titration chamber to maintain the pH.

In instances where two reactants in a sample may react with the titrant and only one is the desired analyte, a separate masking solution may be added to the reaction chamber which eliminates the effect of the unwanted ion.

Some reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions may require heating the sample solution and titrating while the solution is still hot to increase the reaction rate. For instance, the oxidation of some oxalate solutions requires heating to to maintain a reasonable rate of reaction.

==Titration curves==


A titration curve is a curve in graph the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate of which represents the volume of titrant added since the beginning of the titration, and the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate of which represents the concentration of the analyte at the corresponding stage of the titration (in an acid–base titration, the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate usually represents the pH of the solution).

In an acid–base titration, the titration curve represents the strength of the corresponding acid and base. For a strong acid and a strong base, the curve will be relatively smooth and very steep near the equivalence point. Because of this, a small change in titrant volume near the equivalence point results in a large pH change and many indicators would be appropriate (for instance litmus, phenolphthalein or bromothymol blue).

If one reagent is a weak acid or base and the other is a strong acid or base, the titration curve is irregular and the pH shifts less with small additions of titrant near the equivalence point. For example, the titration curve for the titration between oxalic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is pictured. The equivalence point occurs between pH 8-10, indicating the solution is basic at the equivalence point and an indicator such as phenolphthalein would be appropriate. Titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved, with the solution being acidic at the equivalence point and indicators such as methyl orange and bromothymol blue being most appropriate.

Titrations between a weak acid and a weak base have titration curves which are very irregular. Because of this, no definite indicator may be appropriate and a pH meter is often used to monitor the reaction.

The type of function that can be used to describe the curve is termed a sigmoid function.

==Types of titrations==
There are many types of titrations with different procedures and goals. The most common types of qualitative titration are acid–base titrations and redox titrations.

===Acid–base titration===


Acid–base titrations depend on the neutralization between an acid and a base when mixed in solution. In addition to the sample, an appropriate pH indicator is added to the titration chamber, representing the pH range of the equivalence point. The acid–base indicator indicates the endpoint of the titration by changing color. The endpoint and the equivalence point are not exactly the same because the equivalence point is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction while the endpoint is just the color change from the indicator. Thus, a careful selection of the indicator will reduce the indicator error. For example, if the equivalence point is at a pH of 8.4, then the phenolphthalein indicator would be used instead of Alizarin Yellow because phenolphthalein would reduce the indicator error. Common indicators, their colors, and the pH range in which they change color are given in the table above. When more precise results are required, or when the reagents are a weak acid and a weak base, a pH meter or a conductance meter are used.

For very strong bases, such as organolithium reagent, metal amides, and hydrides, water is generally not a suitable solvent and indicators whose pKa are in the range of aqueous pH changes are of little use. Instead, the titrant and indicator used are much weaker acids, and anhydrous solvents such as THF are used.

The approximate pH during titration can be approximated by three kinds of calculations. Before beginning of titration, the concentration of &lt;chem&gt;[H+]&lt;/chem&gt; is calculated in an aqueous solution of weak acid before adding any base. When the number of moles of bases added equals the number of moles of initial acid or so called equivalence point, one of hydrolysis and the pH is calculated in the same way that the conjugate bases of the acid titrated was calculated. Between starting and end points, &lt;chem&gt;[H+]&lt;/chem&gt; is obtained from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and titration mixture is considered as buffer. In Henderson-Hasselbalch equation the and are said to be the molarities that would have been present even with dissociation or hydrolysis. In a buffer, &lt;chem&gt;[H+]&lt;/chem&gt; can be calculated exactly but the dissociation of , the hydrolysis of &lt;chem&gt;A-&lt;/chem&gt; and self-ionization of water must be taken into account. Four independent equations must be used:
:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
In the equations, formula_5 and formula_6 are the moles of acid () and salt ( where X is the cation), respectively, used in the buffer, and the volume of solution is . The law of mass action is applied to the ionization of water and the dissociation of acid to derived the first and second equations. The mass balance is used in the third equation, where the sum of formula_7 and formula_8 must equal to the number of moles of dissolved acid and base, respectively. Charge balance is used in the fourth equation, where the left hand side represents the total charge of the cations and the right hand side represents the total charge of the anions: formula_9 is the molarity of the cation (e.g. sodium, if sodium salt of the acid or sodium hydroxide is used in making the buffer).

===Redox titration===
Redox titrations are based on a reduction-oxidation reaction between an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. A potentiometer or a redox indicator is usually used to determine the endpoint of the titration, as when one of the constituents is the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate. The color change of the solution from orange to green is not definite, therefore an indicator such as sodium diphenylamine is used. Analysis of wines for sulfur dioxide requires iodine as an oxidizing agent. In this case, starch is used as an indicator; a blue starch-iodine complex is formed in the presence of excess iodine, signalling the endpoint.

Some redox titrations do not require an indicator, due to the intense color of the constituents. For instance, in permanganometry a slight persisting pink color signals the endpoint of the titration because of the color of the excess oxidizing agent potassium permanganate. In iodometry, at sufficiently large concentrations, the disappearance of the deep red-brown triiodide ion can itself be used as an endpoint, though at lower concentrations sensitivity is improved by adding starch indicator, which forms an intensely blue complex with triiodide.

===Gas phase titration===
Gas phase titrations are titrations done in the gas phase, specifically as methods for determining reactive species by reaction with an excess of some other gas, acting as the titrant. In one common gas phase titration, gaseous ozone is titrated with nitrogen oxide according to the reaction

:O3 + NO → O2 + NO2.

After the reaction is complete, the remaining titrant and product are quantified (e.g., by Fourier transform spectroscopy) (FT-IR); this is used to determine the amount of analyte in the original sample.

Gas phase titration has several advantages over simple spectrophotometry. First, the measurement does not depend on path length, because the same path length is used for the measurement of both the excess titrant and the product. Second, the measurement does not depend on a linear change in absorbance as a function of analyte concentration as defined by the Beer–Lambert law. Third, it is useful for samples containing species which interfere at wavelengths typically used for the analyte.

===Complexometric titration===
Complexometric titrations rely on the formation of a complex between the analyte and the titrant. In general, they require specialized complexometric indicators that form weak complexes with the analyte. The most common example is the use of starch indicator to increase the sensitivity of iodometric titration, the dark blue complex of starch with iodine and iodide being more visible than iodine alone. Other complexometric indicators are Eriochrome Black T for the titration of calcium and magnesium ions, and the chelating agent EDTA used to titrate metal ions in solution.

===Zeta potential titration===
Zeta potential titrations are titrations in which the completion is monitored by the zeta potential, rather than by an indicator, in order to characterize heterogeneous systems, such as colloids. One of the uses is to determine the iso-electric point when surface charge becomes zero, achieved by changing the pH or adding surfactant. Another use is to determine the optimum dose for flocculation or stabilization.

===Assay===
An assay is a type of biological titration used to determine the concentration of a virus or bacterium. Serial dilutions are performed on a sample in a fixed ratio (such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.) until the last dilution does not give a positive test for the presence of the virus. The positive or negative value may be determined by inspecting the infected cells visually under a microscope or by an immunoenzymetric method such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This value is known as the titer.

==Measuring the endpoint of a titration==

Different methods to determine the endpoint include:
*Indicator: A substance that changes color in response to a chemical change. An acid–base indicator (e.g., phenolphthalein) changes color depending on the pH. Redox indicators are also used. A drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the beginning; the endpoint has been reached when the color changes.
*Potentiometer: An instrument that measures the electrode potential of the solution. These are used for redox titrations; the potential of the working electrode will suddenly change as the endpoint is reached.

*pH meter: A potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H+ ion present in the solution. (This is an example of an ion-selective electrode.) The pH of the solution is measured throughout the titration, more accurately than with an indicator; at the endpoint there will be a sudden change in the measured pH.
*Conductivity: A measurement of ions in a solution. Ion concentration can change significantly in a titration, which changes the conductivity. (For instance, during an acid–base titration, the H+ and OH− ions react to form neutral H2O.) As total conductance depends on all ions present in the solution and not all ions contribute equally (due to mobility and ionic strength), predicting the change in conductivity is more difficult than measuring it.
*Color change: In some reactions, the solution changes color without any added indicator. This is often seen in redox titrations when the different oxidation states of the product and reactant produce different colors.
*Precipitation: If a reaction produces a solid, a precipitate will form during the titration. A classic example is the reaction between Ag+ and Cl− to form the insoluble salt AgCl. Cloudy precipitates usually make it difficult to determine the endpoint precisely. To compensate, precipitation titrations often have to be done as &quot;back&quot; titrations (see below).
*Isothermal titration calorimeter: An instrument that measures the heat produced or consumed by the reaction to determine the endpoint. Used in biochemical titrations, such as the determination of how substrates bind to enzymes.
*Thermometric titrimetry: Differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry because the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the endpoint is determined by &quot;the rate of temperature change&quot;.
*Spectroscopy: Used to measure the absorption of light by the solution during titration if the spectrum of the reactant, titrant or product is known. The concentration of the material can be determined by Beer&#x27;s Law.
*Amperometry: Measures the current produced by the titration reaction as a result of the oxidation or reduction of the analyte. The endpoint is detected as a change in the current. This method is most useful when the excess titrant can be reduced, as in the titration of halides with Ag+.

===Endpoint and equivalence point===
Though the terms equivalence point and endpoint are often used interchangeably, they are different terms. &quot;Equivalence point&quot; is the theoretical completion of the reaction: the volume of added titrant at which the number of moles of titrant is equal to the number of moles of analyte, or some multiple thereof (as in polyprotic acids). &quot;Endpoint&quot; is what is actually measured, a physical change in the solution as determined by an indicator or an instrument mentioned above.

There is a slight difference between the endpoint and the equivalence point of the titration. This error is referred to as an indicator error, and it is indeterminate.

===Back titration===
Back titration is a titration done in reverse; instead of titrating the original sample, a known excess of standard reagent is added to the solution, and the excess is titrated. A back titration is useful if the endpoint of the reverse titration is easier to identify than the endpoint of the normal titration, as with precipitation reactions. Back titrations are also useful if the reaction between the analyte and the titrant is very slow, or when the analyte is in a non-soluble solid.

==Graphical methods==
The titration process creates solutions with compositions ranging from pure acid to pure base. Identifying the pH associated with any stage in the titration process is relatively simple for monoprotic acids and bases. The presence of more than one acid or base group complicates these computations. Graphical methods, such as the equiligraph, have long been used to account for the interaction of coupled equilibria.

==Particular uses==
===Acid–base titrations===

*For biodiesel fuel: waste vegetable oil (WVO) must be neutralized before a batch may be processed. A portion of WVO is titrated with a base to determine acidity, so the rest of the batch may be neutralized properly. This removes free fatty acids from the WVO that would normally react to make soap instead of biodiesel fuel.
*Kjeldahl method: a measure of nitrogen content in a sample. Organic nitrogen is digested into ammonia with sulfuric acid and potassium sulfate. Finally, ammonia is back titrated with boric acid and then sodium carbonate.
*Acid value: the mass in milligrams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) required to titrate fully an acid in one gram of sample. An example is the determination of free fatty acid content.
*Saponification value: the mass in milligrams of KOH required to saponify a fatty acid in one gram of sample. Saponification is used to determine average chain length of fatty acids in fat.
*Ester value (or ester index): a calculated index. Ester value = Saponification value – Acid value.
*Amine value: the mass in milligrams of KOH equal to the amine content in one gram of sample.
*Hydroxyl value: the mass in milligrams of KOH corresponding to hydroxyl groups in one gram of sample. The analyte is acetylated using acetic anhydride then titrated with KOH.

===Redox titrations===

*Winkler test for dissolved oxygen: Used to determine oxygen concentration in water. Oxygen in water samples is reduced using manganese(II) sulfate, which reacts with potassium iodide to produce iodine. The iodine is released in proportion to the oxygen in the sample, thus the oxygen concentration is determined with a redox titration of iodine with thiosulfate using a starch indicator.
*Vitamin C: Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is a powerful reducing agent. Its concentration can easily be identified when titrated with the blue dye Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) which becomes colorless when reduced by the vitamin.
*Benedict&#x27;s reagent: Excess glucose in urine may indicate diabetes in a patient. Benedict&#x27;s method is the conventional method to quantify glucose in urine using a prepared reagent. During this type of titration, glucose reduces cupric ions to cuprous ions which react with potassium thiocyanate to produce a white precipitate, indicating the endpoint.
*Bromine number: A measure of unsaturation in an analyte, expressed in milligrams of bromine absorbed by 100 grams of sample.
*Iodine number: A measure of unsaturation in an analyte, expressed in grams of iodine absorbed by 100 grams of sample.

===Miscellaneous===

*Karl Fischer titration: A potentiometric method to analyze trace amounts of water in a substance. A sample is dissolved in methanol, and titrated with Karl Fischer reagent (consists of iodine, sulfur dioxide, a base and a solvent, such as alcohol). The reagent contains iodine, which reacts proportionally with water. Thus, the water content can be determined by monitoring the electric potential of excess iodine.

<text>&quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; is an English lullaby. The lyrics are from an early-19th-century English poem written by Jane Taylor, &quot;The Star&quot;. The poem, which is in couplet form, was first published in 1806 in &quot;Rhymes for the Nursery&quot;, a collection of poems by Taylor and her sister Ann. It is now sung to the tune of the French melody &quot;Ah! vous dirai-je, maman&quot;, which was first published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers, including Mozart with Twelve Variations on &quot;Ah vous dirai-je, Maman&quot;. The English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known.

Where Jane Taylor was when she wrote the lyric is contested, with the localities of Colchester and Chipping Ongar each asserting a claim. However, Ann Taylor writes (in &quot;The Autobiography and Other Memorials of Mrs. Gilbert&quot;) that the first time Jane ever saw the village of Ongar was in 1810, and the poem had been published in 1806. &quot;In the summer of 1810, Jane, when visiting London, had enjoyed a pic-nic excursion in Epping Forest, and observed on a sign post at one of the turnings, &#x27;To Ongar.&#x27; It was the first time she had seen the name.&quot;

== Lyrics ==
The English lyrics were written as a poem by Jane Taylor (1783–1824) and published with the title &quot;The Star&quot; in &quot;Rhymes for the Nursery&quot; by Jane and her sister Ann Taylor (1782–1866) in London in 1806:

The lyrics were first published with the tune &quot;Ah! vous dirai-je, maman&quot; in &quot;The Singing Master: First Class Tune Book&quot; in 1838. When sung, the first two lines of the entire poem are repeated as a refrain after each stanza.

== Melody ==
&quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; is sung to the French melody &quot;Ah! vous dirai-je, maman&quot;. The melody is used in other nursery rhymes, including the ABC Song and &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;.

2. From 1896 in &quot;Song Stories for the Kindergarten&quot; by Mildred J. Hill.

A parody of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; titled &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat&quot; is recited by the Mad Hatter in of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.
A version using synonyms from &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot; exists.

The opening lyrics are also used to begin the traditional murder ballad &quot;Duncan and Brady.&quot;

The song can also be played as a singing game.

<doc id="31268" wikidata="Q1057377" url="?curid=31268" title="TurboGrafx-16">
<text>The TurboGrafx-16, known as the outside North America, is a home video game console designed by Hudson Soft and sold by NEC Home Electronics. It was the first console marketed in the fourth generation, commonly known as the 16-bit era. It was released in Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1989. In Europe the Japanese model was unofficially imported and distributed in the United Kingdom and France from 1988. In Japan, the system was launched as a competitor to the Famicom, but the delayed United States release meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later the Super NES.

The console has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit graphics processing unit (GPU) chipset consisting of a video display controller (VDC) and video color encoder. The GPUs are capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of just 14 cm × 14 cm × 3.8 cm (5.5 in × 5.5 in × 1.5 in), the Japanese PC Engine is the smallest major home game console ever made. Games were released on HuCard cartridges and later the CD-ROM optical format with the TurboGrafx-CD add-on. The &quot;16&quot; in its North American name and the marketing of the console as a 16-bit platform despite having an 8-bit CPU was criticized by some as deceptive.

In Japan, the PC Engine was very successful. It gained strong third-party support and eventually became the Super Famicom&#x27;s main rival. However, the TurboGrafx-16 failed to break into the North American market and was a commercial failure, which has been blamed on the delayed release and inferior marketing. In Europe, the Japanese models were grey market imported, modified, and distributed in France and the United Kingdom beginning in 1988, but an official PAL model (named simply &quot;TurboGrafx&quot; without the &quot;16&quot;) planned for 1990 was cancelled following the disappointing North American launch with the already-manufactured stock of systems liquidated via mail-order retailers.

At least 17 distinct models of the console were made, including portable versions and those that integrated the CD-ROM add-on. An enhanced model, the PC Engine SuperGrafx, was rushed to market in 1989. It featured many performance enhancements and was intended to supersede the standard PC Engine. It failed to catch on—only six titles were released that took advantage of the added power and it was quickly discontinued. The final model was discontinued in 1994. It was succeeded by the PC-FX, which was released only in Japan and was not successful.

== History ==
The PC Engine was created as a collaborative effort between Hudson Soft, who created video game software, and NEC, a company which was dominant in the Japanese personal computer market with their PC-88 and PC-98 platforms. NEC lacked the vital experience in the video gaming industry and approached numerous video game studios for support. By pure coincidence, NEC&#x27;s interest in entering the lucrative video game market coincided with Hudson&#x27;s failed attempt to sell designs for then-advanced graphics chips to Nintendo; In July 1985, Hudson Soft approached and pitched them a new add-on for the Famicom that played games using their patented Bee Cards, which they had experimented with on the MSX computer. Nintendo liked this concept, as it had the ability to store full games and overwrite existing ones. However, as the technology for it was expensive, and that they would have to pay royalties for each card sold, Nintendo instead decided to pass on Hudson Soft&#x27;s proposal. This eventually led to the partnership between Hudson Soft and NEC. The two companies successfully teamed up to then develop the PC Engine.

The system made its debut in the Japanese market on October 30, 1987, and it was a tremendous success. The PC Engine had an elegant, &quot;eye-catching&quot; design, and it was very small compared to its rivals. The PC Engine sold 500,000 units in its first week of release.

The CD-ROM expansion was a major success for the CD-ROM format, selling 60,000 units in its first five months of release in Japan. By 1989, NEC had sold over consoles and more than 80,000 CD-ROM units in Japan.

In 1988, NEC decided to expand to the American market and directed its U.S. operations to develop the system for the new audience. NEC Technologies boss Keith Schaefer formed a team to test the system. They found out that there was a lack of enthusiasm in its name &quot;PC Engine&quot; and also felt its small size was not very suitable to American consumers who would generally prefer a larger and &quot;futuristic&quot; design. They decided to call the system the &quot;TurboGrafx-16&quot;, a name representing its graphical speed and strength and its 16-bit GPU. They also completely redesigned the hardware into a large, black casing. This lengthy redesign process and NEC&#x27;s questions about the system&#x27;s viability in the United States delayed the TurboGrafx-16&#x27;s debut.

The TurboGrafx-16 (branded as the TurboGrafx-16 Entertainment SuperSystem on the packaging and promotional material) was eventually released in the New York City and Los Angeles test markets in late August 1989. However, this was two weeks after Sega of America released the Sega Genesis with a 16-bit CPU to test markets. Unlike NEC, Sega did not waste time redesigning the original Japanese Mega Drive system, making only slight aesthetic changes.

The Genesis quickly eclipsed the TurboGrafx-16 after its American debut. NEC&#x27;s decision to pack-in &quot;Keith Courage in Alpha Zones&quot;, a Hudson Soft game unknown to western gamers, proved costly as Sega packed-in a port of the hit arcade title &quot;Altered Beast&quot; with the Genesis. NEC&#x27;s American operations in Chicago were also overhyped about its potential and quickly produced 750,000 units, far above actual demand. This was very profitable for Hudson Soft as NEC paid Hudson Soft royalties for every console produced, whether sold or not. By 1990, it was clear that the system was performing very poorly and NEC could not compete with Nintendo and Sega&#x27;s marketing.

In late 1989, NEC announced plans for a coin-op arcade video game version of the TurboGrafx-16. However, NEC cancelled the plans in early 1990.

In Europe, the console is known by its original Japanese name PC Engine, rather than its American name TurboGrafx-16. PC Engine imports from Japan drew a cult following, with a number of unauthorized PC Engine imports available along with NTSC-to-PAL adapters in the United Kingdom during the late 1980s. In 1989, a British company called Mention manufactured an adapted PAL version called the PC Engine Plus. However, the system was not officially supported by NEC. From November 1989 to 1993, PC Engine consoles as well as some add-ons were imported from Japan by French importer Sodipeng (&quot;Société de Distribution de la PC Engine&quot;), a subsidiary of Guillemot International. This came after considerable enthusiasm in the French press. The PC Engine was largely available in France and Benelux through major retailers. It came with French language instructions and also an AV cable to enable its compatibility with SECAM television sets.

After seeing the TurboGrafx-16 falter in America, NEC decided to cancel their European releases. Units for the European markets were already produced, which were essentially US models modified to run on PAL television sets. NEC sold this stock to distributors; in the United Kingdom, Telegames released the console in 1990 in extremely limited quantities.
By March 1991, NEC claimed that it had sold 750,000 TurboGrafx-16 consoles in the United States and 500,000 CD-ROM units worldwide.

In an effort to relaunch the system in the North American market, in mid-1992 NEC and Hudson Soft transferred management of the system in North America to a new joint venture called Turbo Technologies Inc. and released the TurboDuo, an all-in-one unit that included the CD-ROM drive built in. However, the North American console gaming market continued to be dominated by the Genesis and Super NES, which was released in North America in August 1991. In May 1994, Turbo Technologies announced that it was dropping support for the Duo, though it would continue to offer repairs for existing units and provide ongoing software releases through independent companies in the U.S. and Canada.

In Japan, NEC had sold a total of PC Engine units and CD-ROM² units . This adds up to a total of more than PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 units sold in Japan and the United States , and CD-ROM² units sold in Japan. The final licensed release for the PC Engine was &quot;Dead of the Brain Part 1 &amp; 2&quot; on June 3, 1999, on the Super CD-ROM² format.

==Add-ons==
===TurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM²===

The &quot;CD-ROM²&quot; is an add-on attachment for the PC Engine that was released in Japan on December 4, 1988. The add-on allows the core versions of the console to play PC Engine games in CD-ROM format in addition to standard HuCards. This made the PC Engine the first video game console to use CD-ROM as a storage media. The add-on consisted of two devices – the CD player itself and the interface unit, which connects the CD player to the console and provides a unified power supply and output for both. It was later released as the &quot;TurboGrafx-CD&quot; in the United States in November 1989, with a remodeled interface unit in order to suit the different shape of the TurboGrafx-16 console. The TurboGrafx-CD had a launch price of $399.99 and did not include any bundled games. &quot;Fighting Street&quot; and &quot;Monster Lair&quot; were the TurboGrafx-CD launch titles; &quot;Ys Book I &amp; II&quot; soon followed.

===Super CD-ROM²===

In 1991, NEC introduced an upgraded version of the CD-ROM² System known as the &quot;Super CD-ROM²&quot;, which updates the BIOS to Version 3.0 and increases buffer RAM from 64 KB to 256 KB. This upgrade was released in several forms: the first was the &quot;PC Engine Duo&quot; on September 21, a new model of the console with a CD-ROM drive and upgraded BIOS/RAM already built into the system. This was followed by the &quot;Super System Card&quot; released on October 26, an upgrade for the existing CD-ROM² add-on that serves as a replacement to the original System Card. PC Engine owners who did not already own the original CD-ROM² add-on could instead opt for the Super-CD-ROM² unit, an updated version of the add-on released on December 13, which combines the CD-ROM drive, interface unit and Super System Card into one device.

===Arcade Card===
On March 12, 1994, NEC introduced a third upgrade known as the , which increases the amount of onboard RAM of the Super CD-ROM² System to 2MB. This upgrade was released in two models: the &quot;Arcade Card Duo&quot;, designed for PC Engine consoles already equipped with the Super CD-ROM² System, and the &quot;Arcade Card Pro&quot;, a model for the original CD-ROM² System that combines the functionalities of the Super System Card and Arcade Card Duo into one. The first games for this add-on were ports of the Neo-Geo fighting games &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;. Ports of &quot;World Heroes 2&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; were later released for this card, along with several original games released under the &quot;Arcade CD-ROM²&quot; standard. By this point, support for both the TurboGrafx-16 and Turbo Duo was already waning in North America; thus, no North American version of either Arcade Card was produced, though a Japanese Arcade Card can still be used on a North American console through a HuCard converter.

==Variations==

Many variations and related products of the PC Engine were released.

===CoreGrafx===

The &quot;PC Engine CoreGrafx&quot; is an updated model of the PC Engine, released in Japan on December 8, 1989. It has the same form factor as the original PC Engine, but it changes the color scheme from white and red to black and blue and replaces the original&#x27;s radio frequency-output connector with a composite video AV port. It also used a revised CPU, the HuC6280A, which supposedly fixed some minor audio issues. A recolored version of the model, known as the &quot;PC Engine CoreGrafx II&quot;, was released on June 21, 1991. Aside from the different coloring (light grey and orange), it is nearly identical to the original CoreGrafx except that the CPU was changed back to the original HuC6280.

=== SuperGrafx ===
The PC Engine SuperGrafx, released on the same day as the CoreGrafx in Japan, is an enhanced variation of the PC Engine hardware with updated specs. This model has a second HuC6270A (VDC), a HuC6202 (VDP) that combines the output of the two VDCs, four times as much RAM, twice as much video RAM, and a second layer/plane of scrolling. It also uses the revised HuC6280A CPU, but the sound and color palette were not upgraded, making the expensive price tag a big disadvantage to the system. As a result, only five exclusive SuperGrafx games and two hybrid games (&quot;Darius Plus&quot; and &quot;Darius Alpha&quot; were released as standard HuCards which took advantage of the extra video hardware if played on a SuperGrafx) were released, and the system was quickly discontinued. The SuperGrafx has the same expansion port as previous PC Engine consoles, but requires an adapter in order to utilize the original CD-ROM² System add-on, due to the SuperGrafx console&#x27;s large size.

===Shuttle===

The &quot;PC Engine Shuttle&quot; was released in Japan on November 22, 1989, as a less expensive model of the console, retailing at ¥18,800. It was targeted primarily towards younger players with its spaceship-like design and came bundled with a TurboPad II controller, which is shaped differently from the other standard TurboPad controllers. The reduced price was made possible by removing the expansion port from the back, making it the first model of the console that was not compatible with the CD-ROM² add-on. However, it does have a slot for a memory backup unit, which is required for certain games. The RF output used on the original PC Engine was also replaced with an A/V port for the Shuttle.

The PC Engine Shuttle was also distributed in South Korea. It was released in 1990 by Daewoo Electronics.

===TurboExpress===

The &quot;PC Engine GT&quot; is a portable version of the PC Engine, released in Japan on December 1, 1990, and then in the United States as the TurboExpress. It can play only HuCard games. It has a backlit, active-matrix color LCD screen, the most advanced on the market for a portable video game unit at the time. The screen contributed to its high price and short battery life, however, which hurt its performance in the market. It also has a TV tuner adapter as well as a two-player link cable.

=== LT ===
The &quot;PC Engine LT&quot; is a model of the console in a laptop form, released on December 13, 1991, in Japan, retailing at ¥99,800. The LT does not require a television display (and does not have any AV output) as it has a built-in flip-up screen and speakers, just as a laptop would have, but, unlike the GT, the LT runs on a power supply. Its expensive price meant that few units were produced compared to other models. The LT has full expansion port capability, so the CD-ROM² unit is compatible with the LT the same way as it is with the original PC Engine and CoreGrafx. However, the LT requires an adapter to use the enhanced Super CD-ROM² unit. 

===Duo===
NEC Home Electronics released the &quot;PC Engine Duo&quot; in Japan on September 21, 1991, which combined the PC Engine and Super CD-ROM² unit into a single console. The system can play HuCards, audio CDs, CD+Gs, standard CD-ROM² games and Super CD-ROM² games. The North American version, the &quot;TurboDuo&quot;, was launched in October 1992.
Two updated variants were released in Japan: the &quot;PC Engine Duo-R&quot; on March 25, 1993, and the &quot;PC Engine Duo-RX&quot; on June 25, 1994. The changes were mostly cosmetic, but the RX included a new 6-button controller.

===Third-party models===
The &quot;PC-KD863G&quot; is a CRT monitor with built-in PC Engine console, released on September 27, 1988, in Japan for ¥138,000. Following NEC&#x27;s PCs&#x27; naming scheme, the PC-KD863G was designed to eliminate the need to buy a separate television set and a console. It output its signals in RGB, so it was clearer at the time than the console which was still limited to RF and composite. However, it has no BUS expansion port, which made it incompatible with the CD-ROM² System and memory backup add-ons.

The &quot;X1-Twin&quot; was the first licensed PC Engine-compatible hardware manufactured by a third-party company, released by Sharp in April 1989 for ¥99,800. It is a hybrid system that can run PC Engine games and X1 computer software.

Pioneer Corporation&#x27;s LaserActive supports an add-on module which allows the use of PC Engine games (HuCard, CD-ROM² and Super CD-ROM²) as well as new &quot;LD-ROM²&quot; titles that work only on this device. NEC also released their own LaserActive unit (NEC PCE-LD1) and PC Engine add-on module, under an OEM license. A total of eleven LD-ROM2 titles were produced, with only three of them released in North America.

===Other foreign markets===
Outside North America and Japan, the TurboGrafx-16 console was released in South Korea by a third-party company, Haitai, under the name &quot;Vistar 16&quot;. It was based on the American version but with a new curved design. Daewoo Electronics distributed the PC Engine Shuttle in the South Korean market as well.

==Technical specifications==
The TurboGrafx-16 uses a Hudson Soft HuC6280 CPU—an 8-bit CPU running at 7.16 MHz paired with two 16-bit graphics processors, a HuC6270 video display controller and a HuC6260 video color encoder. It includes 8 KB of RAM, 64 KB of Video RAM, and the ability to display 482 colors at once from a 512-color palette. The sound hardware, built into the CPU, includes a programmable sound generator running at 3.58 MHz and a 5-10 bit stereo PCM.

TurboGrafx-16 games use the HuCard ROM cartridge format, thin credit card-sized cards that insert into the front slot of the console. PC Engine HuCards have 38 connector pins. TurboGrafx-16 HuCards (alternatively referred to as &quot;TurboChips&quot;) reverse eight of these pins as a region lockout method. The power switch on the console also acts as a lock that prevents HuCards from being removed while the system is powered on. The European release of the TurboGrafx-16 did not have its own PAL-formatted HuCards as a result of its limited release, with the system instead supporting standard HuCards and outputting a PAL 50 Hz video signal.

===Peripherals===
In Japan, the PC Engine was originally sold with a standard controller known simply as the Pad. It has a rectangular shape with a directional pad, two action buttons numbered &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, and two rubber &quot;Select&quot; and &quot;Run&quot; buttons, matching the number of buttons on the Famicom&#x27;s primary controller (as well as a standard NES controller). Another controller known as the TurboPad was also launched separately with the console, which added two &quot;Turbo&quot; switches for the I and II buttons with three speed settings. The switches allow for a single button press to register multiple inputs at once (for instance, this allows for rapid fire in scrolling shooters). The TurboPad became standard-issue with the TurboGrafx-16 in North America, as well as subsequent models of the PC Engine in Japan starting with the PC Engine Coregrafx, immediately phasing out the original PC Engine Pad.

All PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 consoles only have one controller port; in order to use multiple controllers on the same system and play multiplayer games, a separate peripheral, known in Japan as the MultiTap and in North America as the TurboTap, was required, which allowed up to five controllers to be plugged into the system. The Cordless Multitap was also available exclusively in Japan, sold as a set with a single Cordless Pad, with additional wireless controllers available separately.

Due to using different diameter controller ports, PC Engine controllers and peripherals are not compatible with TurboGrafx-16 consoles and vice versa. The TurboDuo would revert to using the same controller port that the PC Engine uses, resulting in new TurboDuo-branded versions of the TurboPad and TurboTap peripherals, known as the DuoPad and the DuoTap respectively, to be made. An official TurboGrafx-16/Duo Adapter was also produced, which was an extension cable that allowed any TurboGrafx-16 controller or peripheral to be connected into the TurboDuo console (as well as any PC Engine console as a side effect).

The Virtual Cushion, released in 1992, allows players to feel the impact of enemy attacks through sound vibrations.

Many peripherals were produced for both the TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine. The TurboStick is a tabletop joystick designed to replicate the standard control layout of arcade games from the era. Other similar joystick controllers were produced by third-party manufacturers, such as the Python 4 by QuickShot and the Stick Engine by ASCII Corporation. The TurboBooster attached to the back of the system and allowed it to output composite video and stereo audio. Hudson released the Ten no Koe 2 in Japan, which enabled the ability to save progress in compatible HuCard titles. In 1991, NEC Avenue released the Avenue Pad 3, which added a third action button labelled &quot;III&quot; that could be assigned via a switch to function as either the Select or Run button, as many games had begun to use one of those for in-game commands. The Avenue Pad 6 was released in 1993 in conjunction with the PC Engine port of &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot;, adding four action buttons numbered &quot;III&quot; through &quot;VI&quot;; unlike the three-button pad, these buttons did not duplicate existing buttons, and instead added new functionalities in compatible titles. Another six-button controller, the Arcade Pad 6, was released by NEC Home Electronics in 1994, replacing the TurboPad as the bundled controller of the PC Engine Duo-RX (the last model of the console).

==Library==
A total of 686 commercial games were released for the TurboGrafx-16. In North America, the system featured &quot;Keith Courage in Alpha Zones&quot; as a pack-in game, a conversion of the PC Engine title Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru. The PC Engine console received strong third-party support in Japan, while the TurboGrafx-16 console struggled to gain the attention of other developers. Hudson brought over many of its popular franchises, such as &quot;Bomberman&quot;, &quot;Bonk&quot;, and &quot;Adventure Island&quot;, to the system with graphically impressive follow-ups. Hudson also designed and published several original titles, such as &quot;Air Zonk&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Explorer&quot;. Compile published &quot;Alien Crush&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Crush&quot;, two well-received virtual pinball games. Namco contributed several high-quality conversions of its arcade games, such as &quot;Valkyrie no Densetsu&quot;, &quot;Pac-Land&quot;, &quot;Galaga &#x27;88&quot;, &quot;Final Lap Twin&quot;, and &quot;Splatterhouse&quot;, as did Capcom with a port of &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot;.

A large portion of the TurboGrafx-16&#x27;s library is made up of horizontal and vertical-scrolling shooters. Examples include Konami&#x27;s &quot;Gradius&quot; and &quot;Salamander&quot;, Hudson&#x27;s &quot;Super Star Soldier&quot; and &quot;Soldier Blade&quot;, Namco&#x27;s &quot;Galaga &#x27;88&quot;, Irem&#x27;s &quot;R-Type&quot;, and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Darius Alpha, Darius Plus&quot; and &quot;Super Darius&quot;. The console is also known for its platformers and role-playing games; Victor Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;The Legendary Axe&quot; won numerous awards and is seen among the TurboGrafx-16&#x27;s definitive titles. &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot;, a compilation of two games from Nihon Falcom&#x27;s &quot;Ys&quot; series, was particularly successful in Japan. &quot;Cosmic Fantasy 2&quot; was an RPG ported from Japan to the United States that earned Electronic Gaming Magazine RPG of the year in 1993.

==Reception==
In Japan, the PC Engine was very successful, and at one point it was the top-selling console in the nation. In North America and Europe, the situation was reversed, with both Sega and Nintendo dominating the console market at the expense of NEC. Initially, the TurboGrafx-16 sold well in the U.S., but eventually, it suffered from a lack of support from third-party software developers and publishers.

In 1990, &quot;ACE&quot; magazine praised the console&#x27;s racing game library, stating that, compared to &quot;all the popular consoles, the PC Engine is way out in front in terms of the range and quality of its race games.&quot; Reviewing the Turbo Duo model in 1993, &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a &quot;thumbs down&quot;. Though they praised the system&#x27;s CD sound, graphics, and five-player capability, they criticized the outdated controller and the games library, saying the third-party support was &quot;almost nonexistent&quot; and that most of the first party games were localizations of games better suited to the Japanese market. In 2009, the TurboGrafx-16 was ranked the 13th greatest video game console of all time by IGN, citing &quot;a solid catalog of games worth playing,&quot; but also a lack of third-party support and the absence of a second controller port.

The controversy over bit width marketing strategy reappeared with the advent of the Atari Jaguar console. Mattel did not market its 1979 Intellivision system with bit width, although it used a 16-bit CPU.

==Legacy==
In 1994, NEC released a new console, the Japanese-exclusive PC-FX, a 32-bit system with a tower-like design. It was a commercial failure, leading NEC to abandon the video game industry. 

Emulation programs for the TurboGrafx-16 exist for several modern and retro operating systems and architectures. Popular and regularly updated programs include Mednafen and BizHawk.

In 2006, a number of TurboGrafx-16 (TurboChip/HuCARD), TurboGrafx-CD (CD-ROM²) and Turbo Duo (Super CD-ROM²) games were released on Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console download service for the Wii, and later the Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS, including several that were originally never released outside Japan. In 2011, ten TurboGrafx-16 games were released on the PlayStation Network for play on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in the North American region.

In 2010, Hudson released an iPhone application entitled &quot;TurboGrafx-16 GameBox&quot; which allowed users to buy and play a number of select Turbo Grafx games via in-app purchases.

The 2012 JRPG &quot;Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory&quot; features a character, known as Peashy, that pays homage to the console.

In 2016, rapper Kanye West&#x27;s 8th solo album was initially announced to be titled &quot;Turbo Grafx 16&quot;. The album, however, was eventually scrapped.

In 2019, Konami announced at E3 2019 and at Tokyo Game Show 2019 the TurboGrafx-16 Mini, a dedicated console featuring many built-in games. On March 6, 2020, Konami announced that the TurboGrafx-16 Mini and its peripheral accessories would be delayed indefinitely from its previous March 19, 2020 launch date due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting supply chains in China. It was released in North America on May 22, 2020, and released in Europe on June 5, 2020.

<text>Trevor Alfred Charles Jones (born 23 March 1949) is a South African composer of film and television scores, who has worked primarily in the United Kingdom.

He is best known for his scoring work during the 1980s and 1990s, where he worked on many acclaimed films including &quot;Excalibur, Runaway Train, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Mississippi Burning, The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;. Jones has collaborated with filmmakers like John Boorman, Andrei Konchalovsky, Jim Henson, Alan Parker, Jim Sheridan, Barbet Schroeder and Michael Mann.

Jones has been nominated for three BAFTA Awards for Best Film Music - for &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, and &quot;Brassed Off&quot;. He has also been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards - Best Original Score and Best Original Song, and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series, Movie or Special for the miniseries &quot;Merlin&quot;.

Jones has been a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in Britain since 2006. In 1999, he became the first chair of the music department of the National Film and Television School.

== Early life and education ==
Jones was born in Cape Town in 1949, one of three siblings born to a Cape Coloured family. His family were relocated to District Six following the passing of the Group Areas Act. Jones&#x27; family suffered from chronic poverty and substance abuse, and his mother was the sole breadwinner for their family.

At the age of six, Jones already had decided to become a film composer. At 10, he was accepted to the South African College of Music on a municipal bursary. In 1967, he attended the Royal Academy of Music in London with a scholarship and afterwards worked for five years for the BBC on reviews of radio and television music. In 1974, Jones attended the University of York from which he graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in Film and Media Music. At the National Film and Television School Jones studied for three years on general film-making and film and sound techniques.

During this time he wrote the music for twenty-two student projects. One of these films was the 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Dollar Bottom,&quot; which won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

==Career==
Jones was soon after brought to the attention of John Boorman, who was in the midst of making his Arthurian epic, &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981). Although mostly tracked with classical music by Richard Wagner and Carl Orff, Boorman also needed original dramatic cues (as well as period music) for certain scenes. Given &quot;Excalibur&quot;&#x27;s modest budget, a &quot;name&quot; composer was out of the question, so Boorman commissioned the up-and-coming young Jones.

&quot;Excalibur&quot; brought Jones to the attention of Jim Henson, who was making &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982), and looking for a composer who was young and eager to work in the experimental, free-wheeling way which Henson preferred. The resultant score is an expansive, multi-faceted work, featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, augmented by inventive use of Fairlight and Synclavier synthesizers, as well as period instruments like crumhorn, recorder, and the unusual double-flageolet, which Jones came across by chance in a music store.

Jones followed &quot;Excalibur&quot; with scores for the horror films &quot;The Appointment&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Sender&quot; (1982), and the pirate adventure &quot;Savage Islands&quot; (1983). In 1985 Jones composed one of his best scores, for the acclaimed television production &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;.

Jones reunited with Henson for the 1986 fantasy musical &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. David Bowie wrote and performed the vocal tracks for this movie, including the hit &quot;Underground&quot;, while Jones provided the dramatic score.

Reflecting that his complex, symphonic score for &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; garnered little notice, Jones began to re-think his entire approach to dramatic scoring. Around the mid-80s, Jones&#x27; work became more electronic-based (much like fellow film composer Maurice Jarre), eschewing identifiable themes in favor of mood-enhancing synth chords and minimalist patterns. While he wrote a somber, chamber orchestra score in 1988 for &quot;Dominick and Eugene&quot; (which featured classical guitarist John Williams), scores like &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1987), &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988) and &quot;Sea of Love&quot; (1989) are more typical of Jones&#x27; output during this period.

Jones&#x27; return to large-orchestra scoring came with 1990s &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;, and he provided a light-hearted Georges Delerue-flavoured score for &quot;Blame it on the Bellboy&quot; in 1992.

Jones&#x27; most popular success came later in 1992 with his score for &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, and his soaring, passionate music belies the difficulties which afflicted its creation. Director Michael Mann initially asked Jones to provide an electronic score for the film, but late in the game, it was decided an orchestral score would be more appropriate for this historic epic. Jones hurried to re-fashion the score for orchestra in the limited time left, while the constant re-cutting of the film meant music cues sometimes had to be rewritten several times to keep up with the new timings. Finally, with the release date looming, composer Randy Edelman was called in to score some minor scenes which Jones did not have time to do. Jones and Edelman received co-credit on the film (thus making this very popular and acclaimed score ineligible for Oscar consideration). Although all were displeased with the circumstances, Jones was not fired from the film despite reports to the contrary.

Jones became active in television in the 1990s, with orchestral scores for several Hallmark productions, including &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. He also provided a fun, jazzy, 1930s-style score for &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995), which features a swing-band setting of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot;. In 1997 Jones worked for the first time with Ridley Scott, providing an electronic/orchestral/rock-flavoured soundtrack for &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; (1997).

== Personal life ==
He is married to Victoria Seale and has four children. His South-African born uncle, the actor Norman Florence, together with his aunt Rhoda Florence and his cousin Peter Florence, founded the Hay Festival in 1988, which Jones has attended almost every year since its inception.

<text>The Tocharian (sometimes &quot;Tokharian&quot;) languages ( ; ), also known as the Arśi-Kuči, Agnean-Kuchean or Kuchean-Agnean languages, are an extinct branch of the Indo-European language family spoken by inhabitants of the Tarim Basin, the Tocharians. The languages are known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in oasis cities on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (now part of Xinjiang in Northwest China) and the Lop Desert. The discovery of these languages in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east–west division of the Indo-European language family as centum and satem languages, and prompted reinvigorated study of the Indo-European family. Scholars studying these manuscripts in the early 20th century identified their authors with the &quot;Tokharoi&quot;, a name used in ancient sources for people of Bactria (Tokharistan). Although this identification is now believed to be mistaken, &quot;Tocharian&quot; remains the usual term for these languages.

The discovered manuscripts record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also &quot;East Tocharian&quot; or &quot;Turfanian&quot;) and Tocharian B (&quot;West Tocharian&quot; or &quot;Kuchean&quot;). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a Buddhist liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from Turfan in the east to Tumshuq in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the Lop Nur basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (&quot;Kroränian&quot;). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in Kharosthi has been discredited.

The oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the fifth or even late fourth century AD, making it a language of late antiquity contemporary with Gothic, Classical Armenian, and Primitive Irish.

==Discovery and significance==

The existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim Basin by Aurel Stein in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.

It soon became clear that these fragments were actually written in two distinct but related languages belonging to a hitherto unknown branch of Indo-European, now known as Tocharian:
*Tocharian A (Turfanian, Agnean, or East Tocharian; natively ) of Qarašähär (ancient &quot;Agni&quot;, Chinese &quot;Yanqi&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;Agni&quot;) and Turpan (ancient &quot;Turfan&quot; and &quot;Xočo&quot;), and
*Tocharian B (Kuchean or West Tocharian) of Kucha and Tocharian A sites.

Prakrit documents from 3rd-century Krorän and Niya on the southeast edge of the Tarim Basin contain loanwords and names that appear to come from a closely related language, referred to as Tocharian C.

The discovery of Tocharian upset some theories about the relations of Indo-European languages and revitalized their study. In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between centum and satem languages was a simple west–east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of Hittite, a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the wave model of Johannes Schmidt, suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.

Several scholars identify the ancestors of the Tocharians with the Afanasievo culture of South Siberia ( 3300–2500 BC), an early eastern offshoot of the steppe cultures of the Don-Volga area that later became the Yamnayans. Under this scenario, Tocharian-speakers would have immigrated to the Tarim Basin from the north at some later point.

Most scholars reject Walter Bruno Henning&#x27;s proposed link to Gutian, a language spoken on the Iranian plateau in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.

Tocharian probably died out after 840 when the Uyghurs, expelled from Mongolia by the Kyrgyz, moved into the Tarim Basin. The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.

Some modern Chinese words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, e.g. Old Chinese () &quot;honey&quot;, from Proto-Tocharian *&quot;ḿət(ə)&quot; (where *&quot;ḿ&quot; is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B ), cognate with Old Church Slavonic (transliterated: ) (meaning &quot;honey&quot;), and English &quot;&quot;.

==Names==

A colophon to a Central Asian Buddhist manuscript from the late 8th century states that it was translated into Old Turkic from Sanskrit, via a &quot;twγry&quot; language. In 1907, Emil Sieg and Friedrich W. K. Müller proposed that &quot;twγry&quot; was a name for the newly-discovered language of the Turpan area.
Sieg and Müller, reading this name as &quot;toxrï&quot;, connected it with the ethnonym &quot;Tócharoi&quot; (, Ptolemy VI, 11, 6, 2nd century AD), itself taken from Indo-Iranian (cf. Old Persian &quot;tuxāri-&quot;, Khotanese &quot;ttahvāra&quot;, and Sanskrit &quot;tukhāra&quot;), and proposed the name &quot;Tocharian&quot; (German &quot;Tocharisch&quot;). Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Tócharoi&quot; are often associated by modern scholars with the Yuezhi of Chinese historical accounts, who founded the Kushan Empire. It is now clear that these people actually spoke Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language, rather than the language of the Tarim manuscripts, so the term &quot;Tocharian&quot; is considered a misnomer. Nevertheless, it remains the standard term for the language of the Tarim Basin manuscripts.

In 1938, Walter Bruno Henning found the term &quot;four &quot;twγry&quot;&quot; used in early 9th-century manuscripts in Sogdian, Middle Iranian, and Uighur. He argued that it referred to the region on the northeast edge of the Tarim, including Agni and Karakhoja, but not Kucha. He thus inferred that the colophon referred to the Agnean language.

Although the term &quot;twγry&quot; or &quot;toxrï&quot; appears to be the Old Turkic name for the Tocharians, it is not found in Tocharian texts.
The apparent self-designation &quot;ārśi&quot; appears in Tocharian A texts. Tocharian B texts use the adjective &quot;kuśiññe&quot;, derived from &quot;kuśi&quot; or &quot;kuči&quot;, a name also known from Chinese and Turkic documents. The historian Bernard Sergent compounded these names to coin an alternative term &quot;Arśi-Kuči&quot; for the family, recently revised to &quot;Agni-Kuči&quot;, but this name has not achieved widespread usage.

==Writing system==
Tocharian is documented in manuscript fragments, mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets, and Chinese paper, preserved by the extremely dry climate of the Tarim Basin. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in Kucha and Karasahr, including many mural inscriptions.

Most of attested Tocharian was written in the Tocharian alphabet, a derivative of the Brahmi alphabetic syllabary (abugida) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi. However a smaller amount was written in the Manichaean script in which Manichaean texts were recorded. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known Buddhist works in Sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, medical and magical texts, and one love poem.

In 1998, the Chinese linguist Ji Xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian &quot;Maitreyasamiti-Nataka&quot; discovered in 1974 in Yanqi.

==Tocharian A and B==

Tocharian A and B are significantly different, to the point of being mutually unintelligible. A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the late 1st millennium BC.

Tocharian A is found only in the eastern part of the Tocharian-speaking area, and all extant texts are of a religious nature. Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts. As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a liturgical language, no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.

The hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern Romance languages, or Classical Chinese and Mandarin. However, in both of these latter cases, the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B. In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and &quot;o&quot; vs. &quot;e&quot; distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb, and adjective declensional classes.

In their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other. For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form. The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period. Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE &quot;ē&quot; in Tocharian B (possibly related to the long-vowel perfect found in Latin &quot;lēgī&quot;, &quot;fēcī&quot;, etc.).

Tocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected. The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There are also the middle (&quot;classical&quot;) and the late stage.

== Tocharian C ==
A third Tocharian language was first suggested by Thomas Burrow in the 1930s, while discussing 3rd-century documents from Krorän (Loulan) and Niya. The texts were written in Gandhari Prakrit, but contained loanwords of evidently Tocharian origin, such as &quot;kilme&quot; (&quot;district&quot;), &quot;ṣoṣthaṃga&quot; (&quot;tax collector&quot;), and &quot;ṣilpoga&quot; (&quot;document&quot;). This hypothetical language later became generally known as Tocharian C; it has also sometimes been called Kroränian or Krorainic.

In papers published posthumously in 2018, Klaus T. Schmidt, a scholar of Tocharian, presented a decipherment of 10 texts written in the Kharoṣṭhī script. Schmidt claimed that these texts were written in a third Tocharian language he called . He also suggested that the language was closer to Tocharian B than to Tocharian A. In 2019 a group of linguists led by Georges Pinault and Michaël Peyrot convened in Leiden to examine Schmidt&#x27;s translations against the original texts. They concluded that Schmidt&#x27;s decipherment was fundamentally flawed, that there was no reason to associate the texts with Krörän, and that the language they recorded was neither Tocharian nor Indic, but Iranian.

==Phonology==

Phonetically, Tocharian languages are &quot;centum&quot; Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the palatovelar consonants of Proto-Indo-European with the plain velars (*k, *g, *gʰ) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe (Greek, Italic, Celtic, Germanic). In that sense Tocharian (to some extent like the Greek and the Anatolian languages) seems to have been an isolate in the &quot;satem&quot; (i.e. palatovelar to sibilant) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum–satem division is not seen as a real familial division.

===Vowels===
Tocharian A and Tocharian B have the same set of vowels, but they often do not correspond to each other. For example, the sound &quot;a&quot; did not occur in Proto-Tocharian. Tocharian B &quot;a&quot; is derived from former stressed &quot;ä&quot; or unstressed &quot;ā&quot; (reflected unchanged in Tocharian A), while Tocharian A &quot;a&quot; stems from Proto-Tocharian or (reflected as and in Tocharian B), and Tocharian A &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs (still present in Tocharian B).

===Diphthongs===
Diphthongs occur in Tocharian B only.
===Consonants===

The following table lists the reconstructed phonemes in Tocharian along with their standard transcription. Because Tocharian is written in an alphabet used originally for Sanskrit and its descendants, the transcription reflects Sanskrit phonology, and may not represent Tocharian phonology accurately. The Tocharian alphabet also has letters representing all of the remaining Sanskrit sounds, but these appear only in Sanskrit loanwords and are not thought to have had distinct pronunciations in Tocharian. There is some uncertainty as to actual pronunciation of some of the letters, particularly those representing palatalized obstruents (see below).

# is transcribed by two different letters in the Tocharian alphabet depending on position. Based on the corresponding letters in Sanskrit, these are transcribed (word-finally, including before certain clitics) and &quot;n&quot; (elsewhere), but represents , not .
# The sound written is thought to correspond to a alveolo-palatal affricate in Sanskrit. The Tocharian pronunciation is suggested by the common occurrence of the cluster &quot;śc&quot;, but the exact pronunciation cannot be determined with certainty.
# The sound written seems more likely to have been a palato-alveolar sibilant (as in English &quot;ship&quot;), because it derives from a palatalized .
# The sound &quot;ṅ&quot; occurs only before &quot;k&quot;, or in some clusters where a &quot;k&quot; has been deleted between consonants. It is clearly phonemic because sequences &quot;nk&quot; and &quot;ñk&quot; also exist (from syncope of a former &quot;ä&quot; between them).

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
Tocharian has completely re-worked the nominal declension system of Proto-Indo-European. The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, accusative, and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the &quot;oblique&quot; case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case — although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word &#x27; (Toch B), &#x27; (Toch A) &quot;horse&quot; &lt; PIE &quot;*eḱwos&quot; is declined as follows:

The Tocharian A instrumental case rarely occurs with humans.

When referring to humans, the oblique singular of most adjectives and of some nouns is marked in both varieties by an ending &quot;-(a)ṃ&quot;, which also appears in the secondary cases. An example is &#x27; (Toch B), &#x27; (Toch A) &quot;man&quot;, which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular &#x27; (Toch B), &#x27; (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems &#x27; (Toch B), &#x27; (Toch A) for the secondary cases. This is thought to stem from the generalization of &quot;n&quot;-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the Germanic languages (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek &quot;n&quot;-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin &quot;Catō&quot; (genitive &quot;Catōnis&quot;) literally &quot;the sly one&quot; &lt; &quot;catus&quot; &quot;sly&quot;, Greek &quot;Plátōn&quot; literally &quot;the broad-shouldered one&quot; &lt; &quot;platús&quot; &quot;broad&quot;.

===Verbs===

In contrast, the verbal conjugation system is quite conservative. The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function. Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, &quot;-y-&quot;, &quot;-sḱ-&quot;, &quot;-s-&quot;, &quot;-n-&quot; and &quot;-nH-&quot; suffixes as well as &quot;n&quot;-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; &quot;o&quot;-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic, and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.

In addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings. Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary &quot;-r&quot; and secondary &quot;-i&quot;, effaced in most Indo-European languages. Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.

====Categories====
Tocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:
*Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.
*Tense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.
*Voice: active, mediopassive, deponent.
*Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
*Number: singular, dual, plural.
*Causation: basic, causative.
*Non-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.

====Classes====
A given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation. As in Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and (to a lesser extent) Latin, there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of principal parts.

=====Present indicative=====
The most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings. The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):
*I: Athematic without suffix &lt; PIE root athematic.
*II: Thematic without suffix &lt; PIE root thematic.
*III: Thematic with PToch suffix &quot;*-ë-&quot;. Mediopassive only. Apparently reflecting consistent PIE &quot;o&quot; theme rather than the normal alternating &quot;o/e&quot; theme.
*IV: Thematic with PToch suffix &quot;*-ɔ-&quot;. Mediopassive only. Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.
*V: Athematic with PToch suffix &quot;*-ā-&quot;, likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in &quot;*-eh₂-&quot; (but extended to other verbs).
*VI: Athematic with PToch suffix &quot;*-nā-&quot;, from PIE verbs in &quot;*-nH-&quot;.
*VII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.
*VIII: Thematic with suffix &quot;-s-&quot;, possibly from PIE &quot;-sḱ-&quot;?
*IX: Thematic with suffix &quot;-sk-&quot; &lt; PIE &quot;-sḱ-&quot;.
*X: Thematic with PToch suffix &quot;*-näsk/nāsk-&quot; (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).
*XI: Thematic in PToch suffix &quot;*-säsk-&quot; (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).
*XII: Thematic with PToch suffix &quot;*-(ä)ññ-&quot; &lt; either PIE &quot;*-n-y-&quot; (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE &quot;*-nH-y-&quot; (deverbative from PIE &quot;*-nH-&quot; verbs).

Palatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel &quot;e&quot;.

=====Subjunctive=====
The subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted &quot;i&quot; through &quot;xii&quot;. Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.

In addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two &quot;special subjunctive&quot; classes with differing suffixes and two &quot;varying subjunctive&quot; classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.

Special subjunctives:
*iv: Thematic with suffix &quot;i&quot; &lt; PIE &quot;-y-&quot;, with consistent palatalization of final root consonant. Tocharian B only, rare.
*vii: Thematic (&quot;not&quot; athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix &quot;ñ&quot; &lt; PIE &quot;-n-&quot; (palatalized by thematic &quot;e&quot;, with palatalized variant generalized).

Varying subjunctives:
*i: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE &quot;o&quot;-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere. Derived from PIE perfect.
*v: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix &quot;*-ā-&quot;, originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.

=====Preterite=====
The preterite has 6 classes:
*I: The most common class, with a suffix &quot;ā&quot; &lt; PIE &quot;Ḥ&quot; (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots). This class shows root ablaut, with original &quot;e&quot;-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.
*II: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist). However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE &quot;ē&quot;, along with palatalization of the initial root consonant. There is no ablaut in this class.
*III: This class has a suffix &quot;s&quot; in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist. Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive. A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with &quot;s&quot; in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no &quot;s&quot; in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch &quot;ë&quot;). This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with &quot;s&quot; suffix and &quot;ē&quot; vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with &quot;o&quot; vocalism).
*IV: This class has suffix &quot;ṣṣā&quot;, with no ablaut. Most verbs in this class are causatives.
*V: This class has suffix &quot;ñ(ñ)ā&quot;, with no ablaut. Only a few verbs belong to this class.
*VI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist. As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).

All except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.

=====Imperative=====
The imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with &quot;p-&quot;. This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian &quot;*pä-&quot; but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways. The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix &quot;po-&quot;, although the phonology is difficult to explain.

Classes i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions. Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an &quot;irregular&quot; class with all verbs not fitting in other categories. The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb&#x27;s subjunctive. This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.

=====Optative and imperfect=====
The optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding &quot;i&quot; onto the subjunctive stem. Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding &quot;i&quot; onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually &quot;ā&quot; is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either &quot;ā&quot; or &quot;s&quot; is added directly onto the root. The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).

====Endings====
As suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings. The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot;) plus the athematic endings. There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect. Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms. The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between &quot;-r&quot; in the present and &quot;-i&quot; in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)

The present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B. The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:

==Comparison to other Indo-European languages==


In traditional Indo-European studies, no hypothesis of a closer genealogical relationship of the Tocharian languages has been widely accepted by linguists. However, lexicostatistical and glottochronological approaches suggest the Anatolian languages, including Hittite, might be the closest relatives of Tocharian.
As an example, the same Proto-Indo-European root (but not a common suffixed formation) can be reconstructed to underlie the words for &#x27;wheel&#x27;: Tocharian A &quot;wärkänt&quot;, Tokharian B &quot;yerkwanto&quot;, and Hittite &quot;ḫūrkis&quot;.

=== Contact with other languages ===
Michaël Peyrot argues that several of the most striking typological peculiarities of Tocharian are rooted in a prolonged contact of Proto-Tocharian with an early stage of Proto-Samoyedic in South Siberia. This might explain the merger of all three stop series (e.g. *t, *d, *dʰ &gt; *t), which must have led to a huge number of homonyms, restructuring of the vowel system, development of agglutinative case marking, the loss of the dative case, and others.

In historic times, the Tocharian language stood in contact with various surrounding languages, including Iranian, Turkic, and Sinitic languages. Tocharian borrowings, and other Indo-European loanwords transmitted to Uralic, Turkic and Sinitic speakers, have been confirmed. Tocharian had a high social position within the region, and influenced the Turkic languages, which would later replace Tocharian in the Tarim Basin.

==Notable example==
Most of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, but one noted text is a fragment of a love poem in Tocharian B (manuscript B-496, found in Kizil):

<text>In computer science, a trie (, ), also known as a digital tree or prefix tree, is a specialized search tree data structure used to store and retrieve strings from a dictionary or set. Unlike a binary search tree, nodes in a trie do not store their associated key. Instead, each node&#x27;s &quot;position&quot; within the trie determines its associated key, with the connections between nodes defined by individual characters rather than the entire key.

Tries are particularly effective for tasks such as autocomplete, spell checking, and IP routing, offering advantages over hash tables due to their prefix-based organization and lack of hash collisions. Every child node shares a common prefix with its parent node, and the root node represents the empty string. While basic trie implementations can be memory-intensive, various optimization techniques such as compression and bitwise representations have been developed to improve their efficiency. A notable optimization is the radix tree, which provides more efficient prefix-based storage.

While tries commonly store character strings, they can be adapted to work with any ordered sequence of elements, such as permutations of digits or shapes. A notable variant is the bitwise trie, which uses individual bits from fixed-length binary data (such as integers or memory addresses) as keys.
==History, etymology, and pronunciation==
The idea of a trie for representing a set of strings was first abstractly described by Axel Thue in 1912. Tries were first described in a computer context by René de la Briandais in 1959.

The idea was independently described in 1960 by Edward Fredkin, who coined the term &quot;trie&quot;, pronouncing it (as &quot;tree&quot;), after the middle syllable of &quot;retrieval&quot;. However, other authors pronounce it (as &quot;try&quot;), in an attempt to distinguish it verbally from &quot;tree&quot;.

== Overview ==
Tries are a form of string-indexed look-up data structure, which is used to store a dictionary list of words that can be searched on in a manner that allows for efficient generation of completion lists. A prefix trie is an ordered tree data structure used in the representation of a set of strings over a finite alphabet set, which allows efficient storage of words with common prefixes.

Tries can be efficacious on string-searching algorithms such as predictive text, approximate string matching, and spell checking in comparison to binary search trees. A trie can be seen as a tree-shaped deterministic finite automaton.

== Operations ==
Tries support various operations: insertion, deletion, and lookup of a string key. Tries are composed of nodes that contain links, which either point to other suffix child nodes or &quot;null&quot;. As for every tree, each node but the root is pointed to by only one other node, called its &quot;parent&quot;. Each node contains as many links as the number of characters in the applicable alphabet (although tries tend to have a substantial number of null links). In some cases, the alphabet used is simply that of the character encoding—resulting in, for example, a size of 256 in the case of (unsigned) ASCII.

The null links within the children of a node emphasize the following characteristics:
# Characters and string keys are implicitly stored in the trie, and include a character sentinel value indicating string termination.
# Each node contains one possible link to a prefix of strong keys of the set.

A basic structure type of nodes in the trie is as follows; formula_1 may contain an optional formula_2, which is associated with each key stored in the last character of string, or terminal node.
=== Searching ===
Searching for a value in a trie is guided by the characters in the search string key, as each node in the trie contains a corresponding link to each possible character in the given string. Thus, following the string within the trie yields the associated value for the given string key. A null link during the search indicates the inexistence of the key.

The following pseudocode implements the search procedure for a given string in a rooted trie .
In the above pseudocode, and correspond to the pointer of trie&#x27;s root node and the string key respectively. The search operation, in a standard trie, takes formula_3 time, where formula_4 is the size of the string parameter formula_5, and formula_6 corresponds to the alphabet size. Binary search trees, on the other hand, take formula_7 in the worst case, since the search depends on the height of the tree (formula_8) of the BST (in case of balanced trees), where formula_9 and formula_4 being number of keys and the length of the keys.

The trie occupies less space in comparison with a BST in the case of a large number of short strings, since nodes share common initial string subsequences and store the keys implicitly. The terminal node of the tree contains a non-null value, and it is a search &quot;hit&quot; if the associated value is found in the trie, and search &quot;miss&quot; if it is not.

=== Insertion ===
Insertion into trie is guided by using the character sets as indexes to the children array until the last character of the string key is reached. Each node in the trie corresponds to one call of the radix sorting routine, as the trie structure reflects the execution of pattern of the top-down radix sort.

If a null link is encountered prior to reaching the last character of the string key, a new node is created (line 3). The value of the terminal node is assigned to the input value; therefore, if the former was non-null at the time of insertion, it is substituted with the new value.

=== Deletion ===
Deletion of a key–value pair from a trie involves finding the terminal node with the corresponding string key, marking the terminal indicator and value to &quot;false&quot; and null correspondingly.

The following is a recursive procedure for removing a string from rooted trie ().
The procedure begins by examining the ; null denotes the arrival of a terminal node or end of a string key. If the node is terminal it has no children, it is removed from the trie (line 14). However, an end of string key without the node being terminal indicates that the key does not exist, thus the procedure does not modify the trie. The recursion proceeds by incrementing &#x27;s index.

== Replacing other data structures ==
=== Replacement for hash tables ===
A trie can be used to replace a hash table, over which it has the following advantages:
* Searching for a node with an associated key of size formula_11 has the complexity of formula_12, whereas an imperfect hash function may have numerous colliding keys, and the worst-case lookup speed of such a table would be formula_13, where formula_14 denotes the total number of nodes within the table.
* Tries do not need a hash function for the operation, unlike a hash table; there are also no collisions of different keys in a trie.
* Buckets in a trie, which are analogous to hash table buckets that store key collisions, are necessary only if a single key is associated with more than one value.
* String keys within the trie can be sorted using a predetermined alphabetical ordering.

However, tries are less efficient than a hash table when the data is directly accessed on a secondary storage device such as a hard disk drive that has higher random access time than the main memory. Tries are also disadvantageous when the key value cannot be easily represented as string, such as floating point numbers where multiple representations are possible (e.g. 1 is equivalent to 1.0, +1.0, 1.00, etc.), however it can be unambiguously represented as a binary number in IEEE 754, in comparison to two&#x27;s complement format.

==Implementation strategies==

Tries can be represented in several ways, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. Using a vector of pointers for representing a trie consumes enormous space; however, memory space can be reduced at the expense of running time if a singly linked list is used for each node vector, as most entries of the vector contains formula_15.

Techniques such as &quot;alphabet reduction&quot; may alleviate the high space complexity by reinterpreting the original string as a long string over a smaller alphabet i.e. a string of bytes can alternatively be regarded as a string of four-bit units and stored in a trie with sixteen pointers per node. However, lookups need to visit twice as many nodes in the worst-case, although space requirements go down by a factor of eight. Other techniques include storing a vector of 256 ASCII pointers as a bitmap of 256 bits representing ASCII alphabet, which reduces the size of individual nodes dramatically.

=== Bitwise tries ===

Bitwise tries are used to address the enormous space requirement for the trie nodes in a naive simple pointer vector implementations. Each character in the string key set is represented via individual bits, which are used to traverse the trie over a string key. The implementations for these types of trie use vectorized CPU instructions to find the first set bit in a fixed-length key input (e.g. GCC&#x27;s codice_1 intrinsic function). Accordingly, the set bit is used to index the first item, or child node, in the 32- or 64-entry based bitwise tree. Search then proceeds by testing each subsequent bit in the key.

This procedure is also cache-local and highly parallelizable due to register independency, and thus performant on out-of-order execution CPUs.

=== Compressed tries ===
Radix tree, also known as a compressed trie, is a space-optimized variant of a trie in which any node with only one child gets merged with its parent; elimination of branches of the nodes with a single child results in better metrics in both space and time. This works best when the trie remains static and set of keys stored are very sparse within their representation space.

One more approach is to &quot;pack&quot; the trie, in which a space-efficient implementation of a sparse packed trie applied to automatic hyphenation, in which the descendants of each node may be interleaved in memory.

==== Patricia trees ====

Patricia trees are a particular implementation of the compressed binary trie that uses the binary encoding of the string keys in its representation. Every node in a Patricia tree contains an index, known as a &quot;skip number&quot;, that stores the node&#x27;s branching index to avoid empty subtrees during traversal. A naive implementation of a trie consumes immense storage due to larger number of leaf-nodes caused by sparse distribution of keys; Patricia trees can be efficient for such cases.

A representation of a Patricia tree is shown to the right. Each index value adjacent to the nodes represents the &quot;skip number&quot;—the index of the bit with which branching is to be decided. The skip number 1 at node 0 corresponds to the position 1 in the binary encoded ASCII where the leftmost bit differed in the key set formula_16. The skip number is crucial for search, insertion, and deletion of nodes in the Patricia tree, and a bit masking operation is performed during every iteration.

== Applications ==
Trie data structures are commonly used in predictive text or autocomplete dictionaries, and approximate matching algorithms. Tries enable faster searches, occupy less space, especially when the set contains large number of short strings, thus used in spell checking, hyphenation applications and longest prefix match algorithms. However, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e. there is no need to store metadata associated with each word), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) or radix tree would use less storage space than a trie. This is because DAFSAs and radix trees can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored. String dictionaries are also utilized in natural language processing, such as finding lexicon of a text corpus.

=== Sorting ===
Lexicographic sorting of a set of string keys can be implemented by building a trie for the given keys and traversing the tree in pre-order fashion; this is also a form of radix sort. Tries are also fundamental data structures for burstsort, which is notable for being the fastest string sorting algorithm as of 2007, accomplished by its efficient use of CPU cache.

=== Full-text search ===
A special kind of trie, called a suffix tree, can be used to index all suffixes in a text to carry out fast full-text searches.

=== Web search engines ===
A specialized kind of trie called a compressed trie, is used in web search engines for storing the indexes - a collection of all searchable words. Each terminal node is associated with a list of URLs—called occurrence list—to pages that match the keyword. The trie is stored in the main memory, whereas the occurrence is kept in an external storage, frequently in large clusters, or the in-memory index points to documents stored in an external location.

=== Bioinformatics ===
Tries are used in Bioinformatics, notably in sequence alignment software applications such as BLAST, which indexes all the different substring of length &quot;k&quot; (called k-mers) of a text by storing the positions of their occurrences in a compressed trie sequence databases.

=== Internet routing ===

Compressed variants of tries, such as databases for managing Forwarding Information Base (FIB), are used in storing IP address prefixes within routers and bridges for prefix-based lookup to resolve mask-based operations in IP routing.

<doc id="31275" wikidata="Q1983019" url="?curid=31275" title="The Age of Reason">
<text>The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is a work by English and American political activist Thomas Paine, arguing for the philosophical position of deism. It follows in the tradition of 18th-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.

It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a deistic revival. British audiences, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature, rather than a divinely-inspired text. In &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, he promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator god.

Most of Paine&#x27;s arguments had long been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to the masses. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also cheap, putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of what it viewed as potentially-revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and booksellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine&#x27;s work inspired and guided many free thinkers.

==Historical context==
===Intellectual context: 18th-century British deism===
Paine&#x27;s book followed in the tradition of early 18th-century British deism. Those deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. The most important position that united the early deists was their call for &quot;free rational inquiry&quot; into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on freedom of conscience, they demanded religious toleration and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a Newtonian worldview and believed that all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature. Without a concept of natural law, the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of miracles. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God&#x27;s miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the first cause or prime mover, had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to intervene (miraculously) in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious truth or &quot;one true faith&quot;. Religion had to be &quot;simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal&quot; if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God. They, therefore, distinguished between &quot;revealed religions&quot;, which they rejected, such as Christianity, and &quot;natural religion&quot;, a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God&#x27;s existence (and so they were not atheists).

While some deists accepted revelation, most argued that revelation&#x27;s restriction to small groups or even a single person limited its explanatory power. Moreover, many found the Christian revelations in particular to be contradictory and irreconcilable. According to those writers, revelation could reinforce the evidence for God&#x27;s existence already apparent in the natural world but more often led to superstition among the masses. Most deists argued that priests had deliberately corrupted Christianity for their own gain by promoting the acceptance of miracles, unnecessary rituals, and illogical and dangerous doctrines (accusations typically referred to as &quot;priestcraft&quot;). The worst of the doctrines was original sin. By convincing people that they required a priest&#x27;s help to overcome their innate sinfulness, deists argued, religious leaders had enslaved the human population. Deists therefore typically viewed themselves as intellectual liberators.

===Political context: French Revolution===
By the time Part I of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; was published in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the French Revolution. The Reign of Terror had begun, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been tried and executed and Britain was at war with France. The few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; belongs to the later, more radical, stage of the British political reform movement, which openly embraced republicanism and sometimes atheism and was exemplified by such texts as William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; (1793). (However, Paine and other deists were not atheists.) By the middle of the decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: Richard Price, the Dissenting minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), had died in 1791, and Joseph Priestley had been forced to flee to America after a Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church.

The conservative government, headed by William Pitt, responded to the increasing radicalization by prosecuting several reformers for seditious libel and treason in the famous 1794 Treason Trials. Following the trials and an attack on George III, conservatives were successful in passing the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act (also known as the &quot;Two Acts&quot; or the &quot;gagging acts&quot;). The 1795 Acts prohibited freedom of assembly for groups such as the radical London Corresponding Society (LCS) and encouraged indictments against radicals for &quot;libelous and seditious&quot; statements. Afraid of prosecution and disenchanted with the French Revolution, many reformers drifted away from the cause. The LCS, which had previously unified religious Dissenters and political reformers, fractured when Francis Place and other leaders helped Paine publish &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. The society&#x27;s more religious members withdrew in protest, and the LCS lost around a fifth of its membership.

==Publishing history==
In December 1792, Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man, part II&quot;, was declared seditious in Britain, and he was forced to flee to France to avoid arrest. Dismayed by the French revolution&#x27;s turn toward secularism and atheism, he composed Part I of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; in 1792 and 1793:

Although Paine wrote &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; for the French, he dedicated it to his &quot;Fellow Citizens of the United States of America&quot;, alluding to his bond with the American revolutionaries.

It is unclear when exactly Paine drafted Part I although he wrote in the preface to Part II:

According to Paine scholars Edward Davidson and William Scheick, he probably wrote the first draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of &quot;The Age of Reason, Part I&quot; in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.

Meanwhile, Paine, considered too moderate by the powerful Jacobin Club of French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He escaped the guillotine only by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door. When James Monroe, at that time the new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796, Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence. (Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition, which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.

In the late 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;: &quot;An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ&quot;. Fearing unpleasant and even violent reprisals, Thomas Jefferson convinced him not to publish it in 1802. Five years later, Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.

Following Williams&#x27; sentence of one year&#x27;s hard labor for publishing &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818, when Richard Carlile included it in an edition of Paine&#x27;s complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; in Britain continued for 30 years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.

==Structure and major arguments==
&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is divided into three sections. In Part I, Paine outlines his major arguments and personal creed. In Parts II and III he analyzes specific portions of the Bible to demonstrate that it is not the revealed word of God.

===Analysis===

At the beginning of Part I of the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, Paine lays out his personal belief:

Paine&#x27;s creed encapsulates many of the major themes of the rest of his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a skepticism regarding most supernatural claims (miracles are specifically mentioned later in the text); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual&#x27;s right of conscience.

===Reason and revelation===
Paine begins &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; by attacking revelation. Revelation, he maintains, can be verified only by the individual receivers of the message and so is weak evidence for God&#x27;s existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles: &quot;it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it.&quot; He also points out that the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging, and universal evidence of God&#x27;s existence is the natural world. &quot;The Bible of the Deist,&quot; he contends, should not be a human invention, such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be &quot;creation&quot;.

Paine takes that argument even further by maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, he does just that by pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example, Paine notes, &quot;The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? &quot; 

====Analysis of the Bible====
After establishing that he would refrain from using extra-Biblical sources to inform his criticism, but would instead apply the Bible&#x27;s own words against itself, Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible and analyzes it as one would any other book. For example, in his analysis of the Book of Proverbs he argues that its sayings are &quot;inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American Franklin.&quot; Describing the Bible as &quot;fabulous mythology,&quot; Paine questions whether or not it was revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers can ever be known (for example, he dismisses the idea that Moses wrote the Pentateuch or that the Gospel&#x27;s authors are known).

Using methods that would not become common in Biblical scholarship until the 19th century, Paine tested the Bible for internal consistency, questioned its historical accuracy, and concluded that it was not divinely inspired. Paine also argues that the Old Testament must be false because it depicts a tyrannical God. The &quot;history of wickedness&quot; pervading the Old Testament convinced Paine that it was simply another set of human-authored myths. He deplores people&#x27;s credulity: &quot;Brought up in habits of superstition,&quot; he wrote, &quot;people in general know not how much wickedness there is in this pretended word of God.&quot; Citing Numbers 31:13–47 as an example, in which Moses orders the slaughter of thousands of boys and women and sanctions the rape of thousands of girls at God&#x27;s behest, Paine calls the Bible a &quot;book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy; for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty!&quot;

===Church and state===

Paine also attacks religious institutions, indicting priests for their lust for power and wealth and the Church&#x27;s opposition to scientific investigation. He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression. Paine criticizes the tyrannical actions of the Church as he had those of governments in the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; and &quot;Common Sense&quot;, stating that &quot;the Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists, accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue.&quot; That kind of attack distinguishes Paine&#x27;s book from other deistic works, which were less interested in challenging social and political hierarchies. He argues that the Church and the state are a single corrupt institution that does not act in the best interests of the people and so both must be radically altered:
As Jon Mee, a scholar of British radicalism, writes: &quot;Paine believed ... a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution.&quot; Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick&#x27;s words, &quot;an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions.&quot; It is this vision that scholars have called Paine&#x27;s &quot;secular millennialism&quot; and it appears in all of his works. He ends the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, for example, with the statement: &quot;From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, in which everything may be looked for.&quot; Paine &quot;transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia,&quot; emphasizing the possibilities of &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;human perfectibility&quot; that could be achieved by humankind, without God&#x27;s aid.

===Intellectual debts===
Although Paine liked to say that he read very little, his writings belied that statement; &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; has intellectual roots in the traditions of David Hume, Spinoza, and Voltaire. Since Hume had already made many of the same &quot;moral attacks upon Christianity&quot; that Paine popularized in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume&#x27;s works on religion or had at least heard about them through the Joseph Johnson circle. Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume&#x27;s description of religion as &quot;a positive source of harm to society&quot; that &quot;led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant.&quot; More of an influence on Paine than Hume was Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Theologico-politicus&quot; (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza&#x27;s ideas through the works of other 18th-century deists, most notably Conyers Middleton.

Though these larger philosophical traditions are clear influences on &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, Paine owes the greatest intellectual debt to the English deists of the early 18th century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland had argued for the use of reason in interpreting scripture, Matthew Tindal had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, Thomas Morgan had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, Thomas Woolston had questioned the believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of those arguments appear in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; albeit less coherently.

==Rhetoric and style==
The most distinctive feature of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, like all of Paine&#x27;s works, is its linguistic style. Historian Eric Foner argues that Paine&#x27;s works &quot;forged a new political language&quot; designed to bring politics to the people by using a &quot;clear, simple and straightforward&quot; style. Paine outlined &quot;a new vision—a utopian image of an egalitarian republican society&quot; and his language reflected these ideals. He originated such phrases as &quot;the rights of man,&quot; &quot;the age of reason,&quot; &quot;the age of revolution,&quot; and &quot;the times that try men&#x27;s souls.&quot; Foner also maintains that with &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; Paine &quot;gave deism a new, aggressive, explicitly anti-Christian tone&quot;.

He did so by employing &quot;&quot; (that is, &quot;low&quot; or &quot;popular&quot;) language, an irreverent tone, and even religious rhetoric. In a letter to Elihu Palmer, one of his most loyal followers in America, Paine describes part of his rhetorical philosophy:

Paine&#x27;s rhetoric had broad appeal; his &quot;pithy&quot; lines were &quot;able to bridge working-class and middle-class cultures&quot; and become common quotations.

Part of what makes Paine&#x27;s style so memorable is his effective use of repetition and rhetorical questions in addition to the profusion of &quot;anecdote, irony, parody, satire, feigned confusion, folk matter, concrete vocabulary, and .. appeals to common sense&quot;. Paine&#x27;s conversational style draws the reader into the text. His use of &quot;we&quot; conveys an &quot;illusion that he and the readers share the activity of constructing an argument.&quot; By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half-formed, Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently.

===&quot;Vulgar&quot; language===
The most distinctive element of Paine&#x27;s style in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is its &quot;&quot;. In the 18th century, &quot;vulgarity&quot; was associated with the middling and lower classes and not with obscenity and so when Paine celebrates his &quot;vulgar&quot; style and his critics attack it, the dispute is over class accessibility, not profanity. For example, Paine describes the Fall this way:

The irreverent tone that Paine used, combined with the vulgar style, set his work apart from its predecessors. It took &quot;deism out of the hands of the aristocracy and intellectuals and [brought] it to the people&quot;.

Paine&#x27;s rhetorical appeal to &quot;the people&quot; attracted almost as much criticism as his ridicule of the Bible. Bishop Richard Watson, forced to address the new audience in his influential response to Paine, &quot;An Apology for the Bible&quot;, wrote: &quot;I shall, designedly, write this and the following letters in a popular manner; hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers, for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated, and who are the most likely to be injured by it.&quot; However, it was not only the style that concerned Watson and others but also the cheapness of Paine&#x27;s book. At one sedition trial in the early 1790s, the Attorney–General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; and argued that &quot;although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when in the hands of the upper classes, yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people.&quot;

===Irreverent tone===

Paine&#x27;s style is not only &quot;vulgar&quot; but also irreverent. For example, he wrote that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis, &quot;The story of Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the Arabian tales, without the merit of being entertaining.&quot; Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity, theirs was a refined wit rather than the broad humor that Paine employed. It was the early Deists of the middling ranks, not the educated elite, who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous.

It was Paine&#x27;s &quot;ridiculing&quot; tone that most angered Churchmen. As John Redwood, a scholar of deism, puts it: &quot;the age of reason could perhaps more eloquently and adequately be called the age of ridicule, for it was ridicule, not reason, that endangered the Church.&quot; Significantly, Watson&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot; directly chastises Paine for his mocking tone:
===Religious influences===
Paine&#x27;s Quaker upbringing predisposed him to deistic thinking at the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious Dissent. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers&#x27; esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson has put it, Paine &quot;ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand.&quot; His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language and is &quot;an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost.&quot; Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. Davidson and Scheick argue that its &quot;introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others&quot; resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.

Paine takes advantage of several religious rhetorics beyond those associated with Quakerism in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, most importantly by millennial language that appealed to his lower-class readers. Claiming that true religious language is universal, Paine uses elements of the Christian rhetorical tradition to undermine the hierarchies perpetuated by religion itself. The sermonic quality of Paine&#x27;s writing is one of its most recognizable traits. Sacvan Bercovitch, a scholar of the sermon, argues that Paine&#x27;s writing often resembles that of the jeremiad or &quot;political sermon.&quot; He contends that Paine draws on the Puritan tradition in which &quot;theology was wedded to politics and politics to the progress of the kingdom of God&quot;. One reason that Paine may have been drawn to this style is because he may have briefly been a Methodist preacher, but that suspicion cannot be verified.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; provoked a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although the intensity of that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.

===Britain===
Paine&#x27;s &quot;Age of Reason&quot; sparked enough anger in Britain to initiate not only a series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone, and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of them responded specifically to Paine&#x27;s attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine&#x27;s analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible&#x27;s long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks against Paine, describing him &quot;as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people&quot;. Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley, who had endorsed the arguments of the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, turned away from those presented in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. Even the liberal &quot;Analytical Review&quot; was skeptical of Paine&#x27;s claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine&#x27;s deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.

Despite the outpouring of antagonistic replies to &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, some scholars have argued that Constantin Volney&#x27;s deistic &quot;The Ruins&quot; (translations of excerpts from the French original appeared in radical papers such as Thomas Spence&#x27;s &quot;Pig&#x27;s Meat&quot; and Daniel Isaac Eaton&#x27;s &quot;Politics for the People&quot;) was actually more influential than &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. According to David Bindman, &quot;The Ruins&quot; &quot;achieved a popularity in England comparable to &quot;Rights of Man&quot; itself.&quot; One minister complained that &quot;the mischief arising from the spreading of such a pernicious publication [as &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;] was infinitely greater than any that could spring from limited suffrage and septennial parliaments&quot; (other popular reform causes).

It was not until Richard Carlile&#x27;s 1818 trial for publishing &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; that Paine&#x27;s text became &quot;the anti-Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century infidel agitators&quot;. Although the book had been selling well before the trial, once Carlile was arrested and charged, 4,000 copies were sold in just a few months. At the trial itself, which created a media frenzy, Carlile read the entirety of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; into the court record, ensuring it an even wider publication. Between 1818 and 1822, Carlile claimed to have &quot;sent into circulation near 20,000 copies of the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;&quot;. Just as in the 1790s, it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her study of blasphemy in the 19th century, pointed out, &quot;at these trials plain English was reconfigured as itself &#x27;abusive&#x27; and &#x27;outrageous.&#x27; The &quot;Age of Reason&quot; struggle almost tolled the hour when the words &#x27;plain,&#x27; &#x27;coarse,&#x27; &#x27;common,&#x27; and &#x27;vulgar&#x27; took on a pejorative meaning.&quot; Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison but spent six years instead because he refused any &quot;legal conditions&quot; on his release.

Paine&#x27;s new rhetoric came to dominate popular 19th-century radical journalism, particularly that of freethinkers, Chartists and Owenites. Its legacy can be seen in Thomas Jonathan Wooler&#x27;s radical periodical &quot;The Black Dwarf&quot;, Carlile&#x27;s numerous newspapers and journals, the radical works of William Cobbett, Henry Hetherington&#x27;s periodicals the &quot;Penny Papers&quot; and the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Guardian&quot;, Chartist William Lovett&#x27;s works, George Holyoake&quot;s newspapers and books on Owenism, and freethinker Charles Bradlaugh&#x27;s &quot;New Reformer&quot;. A century after the publication of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, Paine&#x27;s rhetoric was still being used: George William Foote&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Bible Handbook&quot; (1888) ... systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out &#x27;Contradictions,&#x27; &#x27;Absurdities,&#x27; &#x27;Atrocities,&#x27; and &#x27;Obscenities,&#x27; exactly in the manner of Paine&#x27;s &quot;Age of Reason&quot;.&quot; The periodical &quot;The Freethinker&quot; (founded in 1881 by George Foote) argued, like Paine, that the &quot;absurdities of faith&quot; could be &quot;slain with laughter.&quot;

===France===
&quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, despite having been written for the French, made very little, if any, impact on revolutionary France. Paine wrote that &quot;the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work translated into their own language, to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article ... of every man&#x27;s creed who has any creed at all – &quot;I believe in God&quot;&quot; (emphasis Paine&#x27;s). Paine&#x27;s arguments were already common and accessible in France; they had, in a sense, already been rejected.

While still in France, Paine formed the Church of Theophilanthropy with five other families, a civil religion that held as its central dogma that man should worship God&#x27;s wisdom and benevolence and imitate those divine attributes as much as possible. The church had no priest or minister, and the traditional Biblical sermon was replaced by scientific lectures or homilies on the teachings of philosophers. It celebrated four festivals honoring St. Vincent de Paul, George Washington, Socrates, and Rousseau. Samuel Adams articulated the goals of this church when he wrote that Paine aimed &quot;to renovate the age by inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy.&quot; The church closed in 1801, when Napoleon concluded a concordat with the Vatican.

===United States===

In the United States, &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; initially caused a deistic &quot;revival&quot;. Paine became so reviled that he could still be maligned as a &quot;filthy little atheist&quot; by Theodore Roosevelt over one hundred years later.

At the end of the 18th century, America was ripe for Paine&#x27;s arguments. Ethan Allen published the first American defense of deism, &quot;Reason, The Only Oracle of Man&quot; (1784), but deism remained primarily a philosophy of the educated elite. Men such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson espoused its tenets but at the same time argued that religion served the useful purpose of &quot;social control.&quot; It was not until the publication of Paine&#x27;s more entertaining and popular work that deism reached into the middling and lower classes in America. The public was receptive, in part, because they approved of the secular ideals of the French Revolution. &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; went through 17 editions and sold thousands of copies in the United States. Elihu Palmer, &quot;a blind renegade minister&quot; and Paine&#x27;s most loyal follower in America, promoted deism throughout the country. Palmer published what became &quot;the bible of American deism&quot;, &quot;The Principles of Nature&quot;, established deistic societies from Maine to Georgia, built Temples of Reason throughout the nation, and founded two deistic newspapers for which Paine eventually wrote seventeen essays. Foner wrote, &quot;&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; became the most popular deist work ever written ... Before Paine it had been possible to be both a Christian and a deist; now such a religious outlook became virtually untenable.&quot; Paine presented deism to the masses, and, as in Britain, educated elites feared the consequences of such material in the hands of so many. Their fear helped to drive the backlash which soon followed.

Almost immediately after this deistic upsurge, the Second Great Awakening began. George Spater explains that &quot;the revulsion felt for Paine&#x27;s &quot;Age of Reason&quot; and for other anti-religious thought was so great that a major counter-revolution had been set underway in America before the end of the eighteenth century.&quot; By 1796, every student at Harvard was given a copy of Watson&#x27;s rebuttal of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. In 1815, Parson Weems, an early American novelist and moralist, published &quot;God&#x27;s Revenge Against Adultery&quot;, in which one of the major characters &quot;owed his early downfall to reading &#x27;PAINE&#x27;S AGE OF REASON&#x27;&quot;. Paine&#x27;s &quot;libertine&quot; text leads the young man to &quot;bold slanders of the bible&quot; even to the point that he &quot;threw aside his father&#x27;s good old family bible, and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON!&quot;

Paine could not publish Part III of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; in America until 1807 because of the deep antipathy against him. Hailed only a few years earlier as a hero of the American Revolution, Paine was now lambasted in the press and called &quot;the scavenger of faction,&quot; a &quot;lilly-livered sinical rogue,&quot; a &quot;loathsome reptile,&quot; a &quot;demi-human archbeast,&quot; &quot;an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United States [Thomas Jefferson].&quot; In October 1805 John Adams wrote to his friend Benjamin Waterhouse, an American physician and scientist:

Adams viewed Paine&#x27;s &quot;Age of Reason&quot; not as the embodiment of the Enlightenment but as a &quot;betrayal&quot; of it. Despite all of these attacks, Paine never wavered in his beliefs; when he was dying, a woman came to visit him, claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul. Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;: &quot;pooh, pooh, it is not true. You were not sent with any such impertinent message ... Pshaw, He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message.&quot;

&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; was largely ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, such as Robert G. Ingersoll and the American abolitionist Moncure Daniel Conway, who edited his works and wrote the first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Not until the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain did many of Paine&#x27;s ideas take hold. As writer Mark Twain said, &quot;It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; ... I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it with fear and hesitation, but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power.&quot; Paine&#x27;s criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889).

Paine&#x27;s text is still published today, one of the few 18th-century religious texts to be widely available. Its message still resonates, evidenced by Christopher Hitchens, who stated that &quot;if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time, we shall require an age of reason&quot;. His 2006 book on the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; ends with the claim that &quot;in a time ... when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend.&quot;

<text>The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life is a 1994 book by the psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and the political scientist Charles Murray in which the authors argue that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal outcomes, including financial income, job performance, birth out of wedlock, and involvement in crime, than is an individual&#x27;s parental socioeconomic status. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the &quot;cognitive elite&quot;, are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence, and that this separation is a source of social division within the United States.

The book has been, and remains, highly controversial, especially where the authors discussed purported connections between race and intelligence and suggested policy implications based on these purported connections. The authors claimed that average intelligence quotient (IQ) differences between racial and ethnic groups are at least partly genetic in origin, a view that is now considered discredited by mainstream science. Many of the references and sources used in the book were advocates for racial hygiene, whose research was funded by the white supremacist organization Pioneer Fund.

Shortly after its publication, many people rallied both in criticism and in defense of the book. A number of critical texts were written in response to it. Several criticisms were collected in the book &quot;The Bell Curve Debate&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, published in 1994, was written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray to explain the variations in intelligence in American society, warn of some consequences of that variation, and propose social policies for mitigating the worst of the consequences. The book&#x27;s title comes from the bell-shaped normal distribution of intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in a population.

===Introduction===

The book starts with an introduction that appraises the history of the concept of intelligence from Francis Galton to modern times. Spearman&#x27;s introduction of the general factor of intelligence and other early advances in research on intelligence are discussed along with a consideration of links between intelligence testing and racial politics. The 1960s are identified as the period in American history when social problems were increasingly attributed to forces outside the individual. This egalitarian ethos, Herrnstein and Murray argue, cannot accommodate biologically based individual differences.

The introduction states six of the authors&#x27; assumptions, which they claim to be &quot;beyond significant technical dispute&quot;:
# There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.
# All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.
# IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.
# IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person&#x27;s life.
# Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
# Cognitive ability is substantially heritable, apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent.
At the close of the introduction, the authors warn the reader against committing the ecological fallacy of inferring things about individuals based on the aggregate data presented in the book. They also assert that intelligence is just one of many valuable human attributes and one whose importance among human virtues is overrated.

===Part I. The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite===

In the first part of the book Herrnstein and Murray chart how American society was transformed in the 20th century. They argue that America evolved from a society where social origin largely determined one&#x27;s social status to one where cognitive ability is the leading determinant of status. The growth in college attendance, a more efficient recruitment of cognitive ability, and the sorting of cognitive ability by selective colleges are identified as important drivers of this evolution. Herrnstein and Murray propose that the cognitive elite has been produced by a more technological society which offers enough high skill jobs for those with a higher intelligence to fill. They also propose that by removing race, gender or class as criteria (via the establishment of free primary education and the prohibition of discrimination) the main criterion of success in academic and professional life is cognitive ability. Increased occupational sorting by cognitive ability is discussed. They maintain that cognitive ability is the best predictor of worker productivity.

Herrnstein and Murray argue that due to increasing returns to cognitive ability, a cognitive elite is being formed in America. They argue that this elite is getting richer and progressively more segregated from the rest of society.

===Part II. Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior===

The second part describes how cognitive ability is related to social behaviors: high ability predicts socially desirable behavior, low ability undesirable behavior. The argument is made that group differences in social outcomes are better explained by intelligence differences rather than socioeconomic status, a perspective, the authors argue, that has been neglected in research.

The analyses reported in this part of the book were done using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Youth (NLSY), a study conducted by the United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of Labor Statistics tracking thousands of Americans starting in the 1980s. Only non-Hispanic whites are included in the analyses so as to demonstrate that the relationships between cognitive ability and social behavior are not driven by race or ethnicity.

Herrnstein and Murray argue that intelligence is a better predictor of individuals&#x27; outcomes than parental socioeconomic status. This argument is based on analyses where individuals&#x27; IQ scores are shown to better predict their outcomes as adults than the socioeconomic status of their parents. Such results are reported for many outcomes, including poverty, dropping out of school, unemployment, marriage, divorce, illegitimacy, welfare dependency, criminal offending, and the probability of voting in elections.

All participants in the NLSY took the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), a battery of ten tests taken by all who apply for entry into the armed services. (Some had taken an IQ test in high school, and the median correlation of the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores and those IQ test scores was .81). Participants were later evaluated for social and economic outcomes. In general, Herrnstein and Murray argued, IQ/AFQT scores were a better predictor of life outcomes than social class background. Similarly, after statistically controlling for differences in IQ, they argued that many outcome differences between racial-ethnic groups disappeared.
Values are the percentage of each IQ sub-population, among non-Hispanic whites only, fitting each descriptor.

===Part III. The National Context===

This part of the book discusses ethnic differences in cognitive ability and social behavior. Herrnstein and Murray report that Asian Americans have a higher mean IQ than white Americans, who in turn outscore black Americans. The book argues that the black–white gap is not due to test bias, noting that IQ tests do not tend to underpredict the school or job performance of black individuals and that the gap is larger on apparently culturally neutral test items than on more culturally loaded items. The authors also note that adjusting for socioeconomic status does not eliminate the black–white IQ gap. However, they argue that the gap is narrowing.

According to Herrnstein and Murray, the high heritability of IQ within races does not necessarily mean that the cause of differences between races is genetic. On the other hand, they discuss lines of evidence that have been used to support the thesis that the black–white gap is at least partly genetic, such as Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis. They also discuss possible environmental explanations of the gap, such as the observed generational increases in IQ, for which they coin the term Flynn effect. At the close of this discussion, they write:

The authors also stress that regardless of the causes of differences, people should be treated no differently.

In Part III, the authors also repeat many of the analyses from Part II, but now compare whites to blacks and Hispanics in the NLSY dataset. They find that after controlling for IQ, many differences in social outcomes between races are diminished.

The authors discuss the possibility that high birth rates among those with lower IQs may exert a downward pressure on the national distribution of cognitive ability. They argue that immigration may also have a similar effect.

At the close of Part III, Herrnstein and Murray discuss the relation of IQ to social problems. Using the NLSY data, they argue that social problems are a monotonically decreasing function of IQ, in other words at lower IQ scores the frequency of social problems increases.

===Living Together===

In this final chapter, the authors discuss the relevance of cognitive ability for understanding major social issues in America.

Evidence for experimental attempts to raise intelligence is reviewed. The authors conclude that currently there are no means to boost intelligence by more than a modest degree.

The authors criticize the &quot;levelling&quot; of general and secondary education and defend gifted education. They offer a critical overview of affirmative action policies in colleges and workplaces, arguing that their goal should be equality of opportunity rather than equal outcomes.

Herrnstein and Murray offer a pessimistic portrait of America&#x27;s future. They predict that a cognitive elite will further isolate itself from the rest of society, while the quality of life deteriorates for those at the bottom of the cognitive scale. As an antidote to this prognosis, they offer a vision of society where differences in ability are recognized and everybody can have a valued place, stressing the role of local communities and clear moral rules that apply to everybody.

===Policy recommendations===

Herrnstein and Murray argued the average genetic IQ of the United States is declining, owing to the tendency of the more intelligent having fewer children than the less intelligent, the generation length to be shorter for the less intelligent, and the large-scale immigration to the United States of those with low intelligence. Discussing a possible future political outcome of an intellectually stratified society, the authors stated that they &quot;fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent—not in the social tradition of an Edmund Burke or in the economic tradition of an Adam Smith but &#x27;conservatism&#x27; along Latin American lines, where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below.&quot; Moreover, they fear that increasing welfare will create a &quot;custodial state&quot; in &quot;a high-tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation&#x27;s population.&quot; They also predict increasing totalitarianism: &quot;It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states.&quot;

The authors recommended the elimination of welfare policies which they claim encourage poor women to have babies.

==Reception==

&quot;The Bell Curve&quot; received a great deal of media attention. The book was not distributed in advance to the media, except for a few select reviewers picked by Murray and the publisher, which delayed more detailed critiques for months and years after the book&#x27;s release. Stephen Jay Gould, reviewing the book in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, said that the book &quot;contains no new arguments and presents no compelling data to support its anachronistic social Darwinism&quot; and said that the &quot;authors omit facts, misuse statistical methods, and seem unwilling to admit the consequence of their own words.&quot;

A 1995 article by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting writer Jim Naureckas criticized the media response, saying that &quot;While many of these discussions included sharp criticisms of the book, media accounts showed a disturbing tendency to accept Murray and Herrnstein&#x27;s premises and evidence even while debating their conclusions&quot;. A 1995 article by the Brookings Institution argued that critics had narrowly focused their attention on the book&#x27;s arguments regarding race and intelligence while ignoring other contents of the book, but added that &quot;the book may have fared even worse had the discussion of race and genetics not distracted attention from some serious problems of analysis and logic in its main arguments. There are indeed some useful messages in the book. But there is also much wrong with it.&quot;

After reviewers had more time to review the book&#x27;s research and conclusions, more significant criticisms began to appear. Nicholas Lemann, writing in &quot;Slate&quot;, said that later reviews showed the book was &quot;full of mistakes ranging from sloppy reasoning to mis-citations of sources to outright mathematical errors.&quot; Lemann said that &quot;Unsurprisingly, all the mistakes are in the direction of supporting the authors&#x27; thesis.&quot;

Many criticisms were collected in the book &quot;The Bell Curve Debate&quot;.

===Lack of peer review===
Herrnstein and Murray did not submit their work to peer review before publication, an omission many have seen as incompatible with their presentation of it as a scholarly text. Nicholas Lemann noted that the book was not circulated in galley proofs, a common practice to allow potential reviewers and media professionals an opportunity to prepare for the book&#x27;s arrival.

===&quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&quot; statement===

An opinion statement endorsing a number of the views presented in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; called &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&quot; was published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1994 and subsequently reprinted in the journal &quot;Intelligence&quot;. The statement was drafted by Linda Gottfredson, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Delaware. It was sent to 131 researchers whom Gottfredsen described as &quot;experts in intelligence and allied fields&quot;. Of these, 52 signed the statement, 48 returned the request with an explicit refusal to sign, and 31 ignored the request.

According to a 1996 response by former American Psychological Association president Donald Campbell, only ten of those who signed were actual experts in intelligence measurement. The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that 20 of the signers were recipients of funding from the white-supremacist organization the Pioneer Fund, including Gottfredson herself.

In subsequent years, both the substance and the interpretation of this letter have received widespread criticism from the scientific community.

===APA task force report===
In response to the controversy surrounding &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, the American Psychological Association&#x27;s Board of Scientific Affairs established a special task force chaired by Ulric Neisser to publish an investigative report focusing solely on the research presented in the book, not the policy recommendations that it made. The report, &quot;&quot;, was first released in 1995 and published in &quot;American Psychologist&quot; in 1996.

Regarding explanations for racial differences, the APA task force stated:

&quot;American Psychologist&quot; subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997.

===Criticism of assumptions===

====Criticism by Stephen Jay Gould====

Stephen Jay Gould wrote that the &quot;entire argument&quot; of the authors of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; rests on four unsupported, and mostly false, assumptions about intelligence:
# Intelligence must be reducible to a single number.
# Intelligence must be capable of rank ordering people in a linear order.
# Intelligence must be primarily genetically based.
# Intelligence must be essentially immutable.

In a 1995 interview with Frank Miele of &quot;Skeptic&quot;, Murray denied making each of these four assumptions.

====Criticism by James Heckman====
The Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist James Heckman considers two assumptions made in the book to be questionable: that &quot;g&quot; accounts for correlation across test scores and performance in society, and that &quot;g&quot; cannot be manipulated. Heckman&#x27;s reanalysis of the evidence used in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; found contradictions:
# The factors that explain wages receive different weights than the factors that explain test scores. More than &quot;g&quot; is required to explain either.
# Other factors besides &quot;g&quot; contribute to social performance, and they can be manipulated.
In response, Murray argued that this was a straw man and that the book does not argue that &quot;g&quot; or IQ are totally immutable or the only factors affecting outcomes.

In a 2005 interview, Heckman praised &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; for breaking &quot;a taboo by showing that differences in ability existed and predicted a variety of socioeconomic outcomes&quot; and for playing &quot;a very important role in raising the issue of differences in ability and their importance&quot; and stated that he was &quot;a bigger fan of [&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;] than you might think.&quot; However, he also maintained that Herrnstein and Murray overestimated the role of heredity in determining intelligence differences.

====Criticism by Noam Chomsky====

In 1995, Noam Chomsky, a founder in the field of cognitive science, criticized the book and its assumptions on IQ. He takes issue with the idea that IQ is 60% heritable, arguing that the &quot;statement is meaningless&quot; because heritability does not have to be genetic. Chomsky gives the example of women wearing earrings:

He goes on to say there is almost no evidence of a genetic link, and greater evidence that environmental issues are what determine IQ differences.

==== Criticism by Ned Block ====

Philosopher Ned Block argues that &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; misleads about intelligence as it conflates genetic determination with heritability. Genetic determination and heritability are not interchangeable as there are traits that are genetically determined but not heritable, and vice versa. For example, the number of fingers on a human hand are genetically determined as genes code for five fingers in nearly everybody. However, the heritability of the number of fingers is very low, as variations in numbers of fingers are usually environmentally caused. The aforementioned earring example quoted by Chomsky is an instance where the opposite is true: high heritability, but not genetic determination. Given that genetic determination and heritability are not equivalent, Block contends that IQ is one such trait that is heritable but not genetically determined. Finally, Block contends that utilizing twin studies to randomize the environment automatically fail: Black twins will always bring a part of their environment with them as they are both Black and will be treated as such.

Canadian psychologist Sidney Segalowitz concurs with Block that twin studies fail to draw conclusions about heritability, and as a result Murray&#x27;s work is methodologically flawed.

=== Statistical methods ===
Claude S. Fischer, Michael Hout, Martín Sánchez Jankowski, Samuel R. Lucas, Ann Swidler, and Kim Voss in the book &quot;Inequality by Design&quot; recalculated the effect of socioeconomic status, using the same variables as &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, but weighting them differently. They found that if IQ scores are adjusted, as Herrnstein and Murray did, to eliminate the effect of education, the ability of IQ to predict poverty can become dramatically larger, by as much as 61 percent for whites and 74 percent for blacks. According to the authors, Herrnstein and Murray&#x27;s finding that IQ predicts poverty much better than socioeconomic status is substantially a result of the way they handled the statistics.

In August 1995, National Bureau of Economic Research economist Sanders Korenman and Harvard University sociologist Christopher Winship argued that measurement error was not properly handled by Herrnstein and Murray. Korenman and Winship concluded: &quot;...there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents&#x27; socioeconomic status. In addition, Herrnstein and Murray&#x27;s measure of parental socioeconomic status (SES) fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background (such as single-parent family structure at age 14). As a result, their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents&#x27; SES, and relative to family background more generally. Estimates based on a variety of methods, including analyses of siblings, suggest that parental family background is at least as important, and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood.&quot;

In the book &quot;Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve&quot;, a group of social scientists and statisticians analyzes the genetics-intelligence link, the concept of intelligence, the malleability of intelligence and the effects of education, the relationship between cognitive ability, wages and meritocracy, pathways to racial and ethnic inequalities in health, and the question of public policy. This work argues that much of the public response was polemic, and failed to analyze the details of the science and validity of the statistical arguments underlying the book&#x27;s conclusions.

=== Use of Armed Forces Qualification Test ===
William J. Matthews writes that part of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;&#x27;s analysis is based on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) &quot;which is not an IQ test but designed to predict performance of certain criterion variables&quot;. The AFQT covers subjects such as trigonometry.

Heckman observed that the AFQT was designed only to predict success in military training schools and that most of these tests appear to be achievement tests rather than ability tests, measuring factual knowledge and not pure ability. He continues:

Janet Currie and Duncan Thomas presented evidence suggesting AFQT scores are likely better markers for family background than &quot;intelligence&quot; in a 1999 study:
=== Cognitive sorting and the &quot;cognitive elite&quot; concept ===
The cognitive elite concept has been widely criticized. Frank Wilson refuted &quot;as cultural superstition and social science pornography &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;&#x27;s theories on the role of intelligence in the social stratification of postindustrial America.&quot; Nicholas Lemann described the notion of a cognitive elite as &quot;a sociological cartoon with political uses, not a phenomenon to be accepted at face value.&quot;

 and Thomas Rotolo found that the more the written, IQ-like, examinations are used as screening devices for occupational access, the stronger the relationship between IQ and income. Thus, rather than higher IQ leading to status attainment because it indicates skills needed in a modern society, IQ may reflect the same test-taking abilities used in artificial screening devices by which status groups protect their domains.

Min-Hsiung Huang and Robert M. Hauser write that Herrnstein and Murray provide scant evidence of growth in cognitive sorting. Using data from the General Social Survey, they tested each of these hypotheses using a short verbal ability test which was administered to about 12,500 American adults between 1974 and 1994; the results provided no support for any of the trend hypotheses advanced by Herrnstein and Murray. One chart in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; purports to show that people with IQs above 120 have become &quot;rapidly more concentrated&quot; in high-IQ occupations since 1940. But Robert Hauser and his colleague Min-Hsiung Huang retested the data and came up with estimates that fell &quot;well below those of Herrnstein and Murray.&quot; They add that the data, properly used, &quot;do not tell us anything except that selected, highly educated occupation groups have grown rapidly since 1940.&quot;

In 1972, Noam Chomsky questioned Herrnstein&#x27;s idea that society was developing towards a meritocracy. Chomsky criticized the assumptions that people only seek occupations based on material gain. He argued that Herrnstein would not want to become a baker or lumberjack even if he could earn more money that way. He also criticized the assumption that such a society would be fair with pay based on value of contributions. He argued that because there are already substantial inequalities, people will often be paid at levels that preserve such inequalities rather than commensurately with their contribution to society.

===Race and intelligence===
One part of the controversy concerned the parts of the book which dealt with racial group differences on IQ and the consequences of this. In chapter 13, the authors state: &quot;It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.&quot; The introduction to the chapter, however, provides the caveat that &quot;The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved&quot;.

In an article praising the book, economist Thomas Sowell criticized some of its aspects, including some of its arguments about race and the malleability of IQ:

In 1996, Stephen Jay Gould released a revised and expanded edition of his 1981 book &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;, intended to more directly refute many of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;&#x27;s claims regarding race and intelligence, and argued that the evidence for heritability of IQ did not indicate a genetic origin to group differences in intelligence.

Psychologist David Marks has suggested that the ASVAB test used in the analyses of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; correlates highly with measures of literacy, and argues that the ASVAB test in fact is not a measure of general intelligence but of literacy.

Melvin Konner, professor of anthropology and associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University, called &quot;Bell Curve&quot; a &quot;deliberate assault on efforts to improve the school performance of African-Americans&quot;:

The 2014 textbook &quot;Evolutionary Analysis&quot; by Herron and Freeman devoted an entire chapter to debunking what they termed the &quot;Bell Curve fallacy&quot;, saying that &quot;Murray and Herrnstein&#x27;s argument amounts to little more than an appeal to
personal incredulity&quot; and that it is a mistake to think that heritability can tell us something about the causes of differences between population means. In reference to the comparison of African-American with European-American IQ scores, the text states that only a common garden experiment, in which the two groups are raised in an environment typically experienced by European-Americans, would allow one to see if the difference is genetic. This kind of experiment, routine with plants and animals, cannot be conducted with humans. Nor is it possible to approximate this design with adoptions into families of the different groups, because the children would be recognizable and possibly be treated differently. The text concludes: &quot;There is no way to assess whether genetics has anything to do with the difference in IQ score between ethnic groups.&quot;

Rutledge M. Dennis suggests that through soundbites of works like Jensen&#x27;s famous study on the achievement gap, and Herrnstein and Murray&#x27;s book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, the media &quot;paints a picture of Blacks and other people of color as collective biological illiterates—as not only intellectually unfit but evil and criminal as well&quot;, thus providing, he says &quot;the logic and justification for those who would further disenfranchise and exclude racial and ethnic minorities&quot;.

Charles Lane pointed out that 17 of the researchers whose work is referenced by the book have also contributed to &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, a journal of anthropology founded in 1960 in Edinburgh, which has been viewed as supporting the theory of the genetic superiority of white people. David Bartholomew reports Murray&#x27;s response as part of the controversy over the Bell Curve. In his afterword to the 1996 Free Press edition of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, Murray responded that the book &quot;draws its evidence from more than a thousand scholars&quot; and among the researchers mentioned in Lane&#x27;s list &quot;are some of the most respected psychologists of our time and that almost all of the sources referred to as tainted are articles published in leading refereed journals&quot;.

&quot;The Bell Curve Wars: Race, Intelligence, and the Future of America&quot; is a collection of articles published in reaction to the book. Edited by Steven Fraser, the writers of these essays do not have a specific viewpoint concerning the content of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, but express their own critiques of various aspects of the book, including the research methods used, the alleged hidden biases in the research and the policies suggested as a result of the conclusions drawn by the authors. Fraser writes that &quot;by scrutinizing the footnotes and bibliography in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, readers can more easily recognize the project for what it is: a chilly synthesis of the work of disreputable race theorists and eccentric eugenicists&quot;.

==== Allegations of racism ====
Since the book provided statistical data making the assertion that blacks were, on average, less intelligent than whites, some people have argued that &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; could be used by extremists to justify genocide and hate crimes. Much of the work referenced by &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; was funded by the Pioneer Fund, which aims to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences, and which has been accused of promoting white supremacist views, particularly scientific racism. Murray criticized the characterization of the Pioneer Fund as a racist organization, arguing that it has as much relationship to its founder as &quot;Henry Ford and today&#x27;s Ford Foundation&quot;.

Evolutionary biologist Joseph L. Graves described &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; as an example of racist science, containing all the types of errors in the application of scientific method that have characterized the history of scientific racism:
# Claims that are not supported by the data given
# Errors in calculation that invariably support the hypothesis
# No mention of data that contradict the hypothesis
# No mention of theories and data that conflict with core assumptions
# Bold policy recommendations that are consistent with those advocated by racists.

Eric Siegel wrote on the &quot;Scientific American&quot; blog that the book &quot;endorses prejudice by virtue of what it does not say. Nowhere does the book address why it investigates racial differences in IQ. By never spelling out a reason for reporting on these differences in the first place, the authors transmit an unspoken yet unequivocal conclusion: Race is a helpful indicator as to whether a person is likely to hold certain capabilities. Even if we assume the presented data trends are sound, the book leaves the reader on his or her own to deduce how to best put these insights to use. The net effect is to tacitly condone the prejudgment of individuals based on race.&quot; Similarly, Howard Gardner accused the authors of engaging in &quot;scholarly brinkmanship&quot;, arguing that &quot;Whether concerning an issue of science, policy, or rhetoric, the authors come dangerously close to embracing the most extreme positions, yet in the end shy away from doing so ... Scholarly brinkmanship encourages the reader to draw the strongest conclusions, while allowing the authors to disavow this intention.&quot;

Columnist Bob Herbert, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described the book as &quot;a scabrous piece of racial pornography masquerading as serious scholarship&quot;. &quot;Mr. Murray can protest all he wants&quot;, wrote Herbert; &quot;his book is just a genteel way of calling somebody a nigger.&quot;

<doc id="31278" wikidata="Q101978" url="?curid=31278" title="House of Tudor">
<text>The House of Tudor ( ) was an English and Welsh dynasty that held the throne of England from 1485 to 1603. They descended from the Tudors of Penmynydd, a Welsh noble family, and Catherine of Valois. The Tudor monarchs ruled the Kingdom of England and the Lordship of Ireland (later the Kingdom of Ireland) for 118 years with five monarchs: Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The Tudors succeeded the House of Plantagenet as rulers of the Kingdom of England, and were succeeded by the Scottish House of Stuart. The first Tudor monarch, Henry VII, descended through his mother from the House of Beaufort, a legitimised branch of the English royal House of Lancaster, a cadet house of the Plantagenets. The Tudor family rose to power and started the Tudor period in the wake of the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487), which left the main House of Lancaster (with which the Tudors were aligned) extinct in the male line.

Henry VII (a descendant of Edward III, and the son of Edmund Tudor, a half-brother of Henry VI) succeeded in presenting himself as a candidate not only for traditional Lancastrian supporters, but also for discontented supporters of their rival Plantagenet cadet House of York, and he took the throne by right of conquest. Following his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field (22 August 1485), he reinforced his position in 1486 by fulfilling his 1483 vow to marry Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV and the heiress of the Yorkist claim to the throne, thus symbolically uniting the former warring factions of Lancaster and York under the new dynasty (represented by the Tudor rose). The Tudors extended their power beyond modern England, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 (Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542), and successfully asserting English authority over the Kingdom of Ireland (proclaimed by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542). They also maintained the nominal English claim to the Kingdom of France; although none of them made substance of it, Henry VIII fought wars with France primarily as a matter of international alliances but also asserting claim to the title. After him, his daughter Mary I lost control of all territory in France permanently with the Siege of Calais in 1558.

In total, the Tudor monarchs ruled their domains for 118 years. Henry VIII () was the only son of Henry VII to live to the age of maturity, and he proved a dominant ruler. Issues around royal succession (including marriage and the succession rights of women) became major political themes during the Tudor era, as did the English Reformation in religion, impacting the future of the Crown. Elizabeth I was the longest serving Tudor monarch at 44 years, and her reign—known as the Elizabethan Era—provided a period of stability after the short, troubled reigns of her siblings. When Elizabeth I died childless, her cousin of the Scottish House of Stuart succeeded her, in the Union of the Crowns of 24 March 1603. The first Stuart to become King of England (), James VI and I, was a great-grandson of Henry VII&#x27;s daughter Margaret Tudor, who in 1503 had married James IV of Scotland in accordance with the 1502 Treaty of Perpetual Peace. A connection persists to the present 21st century, as Charles III is a ninth-generation descendant of George I, who in turn was James VI and I&#x27;s great-grandson.

== Ascent to the throne ==
The Tudors descended from King Edward III on Henry VII&#x27;s mother&#x27;s side from John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, one of the illegitimate children of the 14th century English prince John of Gaunt, the third surviving son of Edward III. Beaufort&#x27;s mother was Gaunt&#x27;s long-term mistress, Katherine Swynford.

The descendants of an illegitimate child of English royalty would normally have no claim on the throne, although Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396, when John Beaufort was 25. The church then retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate by way of a papal bull the same year, confirmed by an Act of Parliament in 1397. A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt&#x27;s son by his first wife Blanche of Lancaster, King Henry IV, also recognised the Beauforts&#x27; legitimacy but declared the line ineligible for the throne.

Nevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt&#x27;s descendants from his first marriage, the House of Lancaster, during the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses. However the descent from the Beauforts did not necessarily render Henry Tudor (Henry VII) heir to the throne, nor did the fact that his paternal grandmother, Catherine of Valois, had been Queen of England due to her first marriage to Henry V (although, this did make Henry VII a nephew of Henry VI).

The legitimate claim was that of Henry Tudor&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth of York, as daughter to Edward IV, and descendant of the second son of Edward III, Lionel, Duke of Clarence, and also his fourth son, Edmund, Duke of York. As she had no surviving brothers, Elizabeth had the strongest claim to the crown as de facto heiress of the House of York, but while she became queen consort, she did not rule as queen regnant; for the last attempt a female made at ruling in her own right had resulted in disaster when Henry II&#x27;s mother, Empress Matilda, and her cousin, Stephen of Blois, fought bitterly for the throne in the 12th century.

===Family connections and the Wars of the Roses===
Sources:

Henry Tudor had, however, something that the others did not. He had an army which defeated the last Yorkist king, Richard III, in the field of battle and the support of powerful nobles to take the crown by right of conquest. Richard III&#x27;s accession to the throne had proved controversial, even among the Yorkists.

Henry Tudor, as Henry VII, and his son by Elizabeth of York, Henry VIII eliminated other claimants to the throne, including his first cousin once removed, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, and her son Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, as well as Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter.

On 1 November 1455, John Beaufort&#x27;s granddaughter, Margaret Beaufort, married Henry VI&#x27;s maternal half-brother Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. It was his father, Owen Tudor (), who abandoned the Welsh patronymic naming practice and adopted a fixed surname. When he did, he did not choose, as was generally the custom, his father&#x27;s name, Maredudd, but chose that of his grandfather, Tudur ap Goronwy, instead.

This name is sometimes given as &quot;Tewdwr&quot;, the Welsh form of Theodore, but Modern Welsh &quot;Tudur&quot;, Old Welsh &quot;Tutir&quot; is originally not a variant but a different and completely unrelated name, etymologically identical with Gaulish &quot;Toutorix&quot;, from Proto-Celtic &quot;*toutā&quot; &quot;people, tribe&quot; and &quot;*rīxs&quot; &quot;king&quot; (compare Modern Welsh &quot;tud&quot; &quot;territory&quot; and &quot;rhi&quot; &quot;king&quot; respectively), corresponding to Germanic Theodoric.

Owen Tudor was one of the bodyguards for the queen dowager Catherine of Valois, whose husband, Henry V, had died in 1422. Evidence suggests that the two were secretly married in 1428. Two sons born of the marriage, Edmund and Jasper, were among the most loyal supporters of the House of Lancaster in its struggle against the House of York.

Henry VI ennobled his half-brothers: Edmund became Earl of Richmond on 15 December 1449 and was married to Lady Margaret Beaufort, the great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt, the progenitor of the house of Lancaster; Jasper became Earl of Pembroke on 23 November 1452. Edmund died on 3 November 1456. On 28 January 1457, his widow Margaret, who was only 13 at the time, gave birth to a son, Henry Tudor, at her brother-in-law&#x27;s residence at Pembroke Castle.

Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII, spent his childhood at Raglan Castle, the home of Lord Herbert, a leading Yorkist. Following the murder of Henry VI and death of his son, Edward, at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, Henry became the person upon whom the Lancastrian cause rested. Concerned for his young nephew&#x27;s life, Jasper Tudor took Henry to Brittany for safety.

Lady Margaret remained in England and remarried, living quietly while advancing the Lancastrian (and her son&#x27;s) cause. Capitalizing on the growing unpopularity of Richard III (King of England from 1483), she was able to forge an alliance with discontented Yorkists in support of her son. Two years after Richard III was crowned, Henry and Jasper sailed from the mouth of the Seine to the Milford Haven Waterway and defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. Upon this victory, Henry Tudor proclaimed himself King Henry VII.

==History==

===Henry VII===

Upon becoming king in 1485, Henry VII moved rapidly to secure his hold on the throne. On 18 January 1486 at Westminster Abbey, he honoured a pledge made three years earlier and married Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV. They were third cousins, as both were great-great-grandchildren of John of Gaunt. The marriage unified the warring houses of Lancaster and York and gave the couple&#x27;s children a strong claim to the throne. The unification of the two houses through this marriage is symbolised by the heraldic emblem of the Tudor rose, a combination of the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster.

Henry VII and Elizabeth of York had seven children, four of whom survived early childhood:

* Arthur, Prince of Wales (born 1486, died 1502)
* Henry, Duke of York (born 1491, died 1547)
* Margaret (born 1489, died 1541), who married James IV of Scotland
* Mary (born 1496, died 1533), who married Louis XII of France

Henry VII&#x27;s foreign policy had an objective of dynastic security: he formed an alliance with Scotland with the marriage in 1503 of his daughter Margaret to James IV of Scotland, and with Spain through the marriage of his son Arthur to Catherine of Aragon, cementing an alliance with the Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon at Ludlow Castle, the traditional seat of the Prince of Wales. However, four months after the marriage, Arthur died, leaving his younger brother Henry as heir apparent. Henry VII acquired a papal dispensation allowing prince Henry to marry Arthur&#x27;s widow; however, Henry VII delayed the marriage.

Henry VII limited his involvement in European politics. He went to war only twice: once in 1489 during the French–Breton War and the invasion of Brittany, and in 1496–1497 in revenge for Scottish support of Perkin Warbeck and for the Scottish invasion of northern England. Henry VII made peace with France in 1492 and the war against Scotland was abandoned because of the Cornish rebellion of 1497. Henry VII made peace with James IV in 1502 with the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, paving the way for the marriage of his daughter Margaret.

One of the main concerns of Henry VII during his reign was the re-accumulation of the funds in the royal treasury. England had never been one of the wealthier European countries, and after the Wars of the Roses this was even more true. Through his strict monetary strategy, he was able to leave a considerable amount of money in the Treasury for his son and successor, Henry VIII. Although it is debated whether Henry VII was a great king, he certainly was a successful one if only because he restored the nation&#x27;s finances, strengthened the judicial system and successfully denied all other claimants to the throne, thus further securing it for his heir.

===Henry VIII===
The new King Henry VIII succeeded to the throne on 22 April 1509. He married Catherine of Aragon on 11 June; they were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 24 June. Catherine had previously been the wife of Henry&#x27;s older brother Arthur (died 1502); this fact made the course of their marriage a rocky one from the start. A papal dispensation had to be granted for Henry to be able to marry Catherine, and the negotiations took some time. Despite the fact that Henry&#x27;s father died before he was married to Catherine, he was determined to marry her anyway and to make sure that everyone knew he intended on being his own master.

When Henry first came to the throne, he had very little interest in actually ruling; rather, he preferred to indulge in luxuries and to partake in sports. He let others control the kingdom for the first two years of his reign, and then when he became more interested in military strategy, he took more interest in ruling his own realm. In his younger years, Henry was described as a man of gentle friendliness, gentle in debate, and who acted as more of a companion than a king. He was tall, handsome and cultured and generous in his gifts and affection and was said to be easy to get along with. The Henry that many people picture when they hear his name is the Henry of his later years, when he became obese, volatile, and was known for his great cruelty.
Catherine did not bear Henry the sons he was desperate for; her first child, a daughter, was stillborn, and her second child, a son named Henry, Duke of Cornwall, died 52 days after birth. A further set of stillborn children followed, until a surviving daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. When it became clear to Henry that the Tudor line was at risk, he consulted his chief minister Cardinal Wolsey about the possibility of annulling his marriage to Catherine. Along with Henry&#x27;s concern that he would not have an heir, it was also obvious to his court that he was becoming tired of his aging wife, who was six years older than he was. Wolsey visited Rome, where he hoped to get the Pope&#x27;s consent for an annulment. However, the Holy See was reluctant to rescind the earlier papal dispensation and felt heavy pressure from Catherine&#x27;s nephew, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in support of his aunt. Catherine contested the proceedings, and a protracted legal battle followed. Wolsey fell from favour in 1529 as a result of his failure to procure the annulment, and Henry appointed Thomas Cromwell in his place as chief minister .

Despite his failure to produce the results that Henry wanted, Wolsey actively pursued the annulment (divorce was synonymous with annulment at that time). However, Wolsey never planned that Henry would marry Anne Boleyn, with whom the king had become enamoured while she served as a lady-in-waiting in Queen Catherine&#x27;s household. It is unclear how far Wolsey was actually responsible for the English Reformation, but it is very clear that Henry&#x27;s desire to marry Anne Boleyn precipitated the schism with Rome. Henry&#x27;s concern about having an heir to secure his family line and to increase his security while alive would have prompted him to ask for an annulment sooner or later, whether Anne had precipitated it or not. Wolsey&#x27;s sudden death at Leicester on 29 November 1530 on his journey to the Tower of London saved him from the public humiliation and inevitable execution he would have suffered upon his arrival at the Tower.

====Break with Rome====
In order to allow Henry to dissolve his marriage and marry Anne Boleyn, the English parliament enacted laws breaking ties with Rome, and declaring the king Supreme Head of the Church of England (from Elizabeth I the monarch is known as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England), thus severing the ecclesiastical structure of England from the Catholic Church and the Pope. The newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, was then able to declare Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine void. Catherine was banished from court, and she spent the last three years of her life in various English houses under &quot;protectorship&quot;, similar to house arrest. This allowed Henry to marry Anne Boleyn. She gave birth on 7 September 1533 to a daughter, Elizabeth, named in honour of Henry&#x27;s mother. Anne had two further pregnancies which ended in miscarriage. In 1536, Anne was arrested, along with six courtiers. Thomas Cromwell, Anne&#x27;s former ally, stepped in again, claiming that she had taken lovers during her marriage to Henry, including her own brother, George Boleyn, and she was tried for high treason and incest. These charges were most likely fabricated, but she was found guilty and executed in May 1536.

====Protestant alliance====

Henry married again, for a third time, to Jane Seymour, the daughter of a Wiltshire knight, and with whom he had become enamoured while she was still a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne. Jane became pregnant, and in 1537 produced a son, who became King Edward VI following Henry&#x27;s death in 1547. Jane died of puerperal fever only a few days after the birth, leaving Henry devastated. Cromwell continued to gain the king&#x27;s favour when he designed and pushed through the Laws in Wales Acts, uniting England and Wales.

In 1540, Henry married for the fourth time to the daughter of a Protestant German duke, Anne of Cleves, thus forming an alliance with the Protestant German states. Henry was reluctant to marry again, especially to a Protestant, but he was persuaded when the court painter Hans Holbein the Younger showed him a flattering portrait of her. She arrived in England in December 1539, and Henry rode to Rochester to meet her on 1 January 1540. Although the historian Gilbert Burnet claimed that Henry called her a &quot;Flanders Mare&quot;, there is no evidence that he said this; in truth, court ambassadors negotiating the marriage praised her beauty. Whatever the circumstances were, the marriage failed, and Anne agreed to a peaceful annulment, assumed the title &quot;My Lady, the King&#x27;s Sister&quot;, and received a large settlement, which included Richmond Palace, Hever Castle, and numerous other estates across the country. Although the marriage made sense in terms of foreign policy, Henry was still enraged and offended by the match. Henry chose to blame Cromwell for the failed marriage, and ordered him beheaded on 28 July 1540. Henry kept his word and took care of Anne in his last years alive; however, after his death Anne suffered from extreme financial hardship because Edward VI&#x27;s councillors refused to give her any funds and confiscated the homes she had been given. She pleaded to her brother to let her return home, but he only sent a few agents who tried to assist in helping her situation and refused to let her return home. Anne died on 16 July 1557 in Chelsea Manor.
The fifth marriage was to the young Catherine Howard, niece of the Catholic Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. Catherine was promoted by Norfolk in the hope that she would persuade Henry to restore the Catholic religion in England. Henry called her his &quot;rose without a thorn&quot;, but the marriage ended in failure. Henry&#x27;s infatuation with Catherine started before the end of his marriage with Anne when she was still a member of Anne&#x27;s court. Catherine was young and vivacious, but Henry&#x27;s age made him less inclined to use Catherine in the bedroom; rather, he preferred to admire her, which Catherine soon grew tired of. Catherine, forced into a marriage to an unattractive, obese man over 30 years her senior, had never wanted to marry Henry, and allegedly conducted an affair with the King&#x27;s favourite, Thomas Culpeper, while Henry and she were married. During her questioning, Catherine first denied everything but eventually she was broken down and told of her infidelity and her pre-nuptial relations with other men. Henry, first enraged, threatened to torture her to death but later became overcome with grief and self-pity. She was accused of treason and was executed on 13 February 1542, destroying the English Catholic holdouts&#x27; hopes of a national reconciliation with the Catholic Church. Her execution also marked the end of the Howard family&#x27;s power and influence within the English court.

By the time Henry conducted another marriage with his final wife Catherine Parr in July 1543, the old Roman Catholic advisers, including the Duke of Norfolk, had lost all their power and influence. Norfolk himself was still a committed Catholic, and he was nearly persuaded to arrest Catherine for preaching Lutheran doctrines to Henry while she attended his ill health. However, she managed to reconcile with the King after vowing that she had only argued about religion with him to take his mind off the suffering caused by his ulcerous leg. Her peacemaking also helped reconcile Henry with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth and fostered a good relationship between her and Edward.

===Edward VI===

Henry died on 28 January 1547. His will had reinstated his daughters by his annulled marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn to the line of succession. Edward, his nine-year-old son by Jane Seymour, succeeded as Edward VI of England. Unfortunately, the young King&#x27;s kingdom was usually in turmoil between nobles who were trying to strengthen their own positions in the kingdom by using the Regency in their favour.

====England under Lord Somerset====

Although Henry had specified a group of men to act as regents during Edward&#x27;s minority, Edward Seymour, the young king&#x27;s uncle, quickly seized control and created himself Duke of Somerset on 15 February 1547. His domination of the Privy Council, the king&#x27;s most senior body of advisers, was unchallenged. Somerset aimed to unite England and Scotland by marrying Edward to his cousin, the young Mary, Queen of Scots, and aimed to forcibly impose the English Reformation on the Church of Scotland. Somerset led a large and well equipped army to Scotland, where he and the Scottish regent James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, commanded their armies at the Battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547. The English won the battle, and after this Queen Mary was smuggled to France, where she was betrothed to the Dauphin, the future King Francis II of France. Despite Somerset&#x27;s disappointment that no Scottish marriage would take place, his victory at Pinkie made his position appear unassailable.

Edward VI was taught that he had to lead religious reform. In 1549, the Crown ordered the publication of the Book of Common Prayer, containing the forms of worship for daily and Sunday church services. The controversial new book was not welcomed by either reformers or Catholic conservatives; it was especially condemned in Devon and Cornwall, where traditional Catholic loyalty was at its strongest. In Cornwall at the time, many of the people could only speak the Cornish language, so the uniform English Bibles and church services were not understood by many. This caused the Prayer Book Rebellion, in which groups of Cornish non-conformists gathered round the mayor. The rebellion worried Somerset, now Lord Protector, and he sent an army to impose a military solution to the rebellion. The rebellion hardened the Crown against Catholics. Fear of Catholicism focused on Edward&#x27;s elder half-sister, Mary, who was a pious and devout Catholic. Although called before the Privy Council several times to renounce her faith and stop hearing the Catholic Mass, she refused. Edward had a good relationship with his sister Elizabeth, who was a Protestant, albeit a moderate one, but this was strained when Elizabeth was accused of having an affair with the Duke of Somerset&#x27;s brother, Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, who had married Henry VIII&#x27;s widow, Catherine Parr. Seymour had invaded Edward&#x27;s apartments and had killed his dog in a scheme to forcefully gain control over him.
Elizabeth was interviewed by one of Edward&#x27;s advisers, and she was eventually found not to be guilty, despite forced confessions from her servants Kat Ashley and Sir Thomas Parry. Thomas Seymour was beheaded on 20 March 1549.

====Problematic succession====
Lord Protector Somerset was also losing favour. After forcibly removing Edward VI to Windsor Castle, with the intention of keeping him hostage, Somerset was removed from power by members of the council, led by his chief rival, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who created himself Duke of Northumberland shortly after his rise. Northumberland effectively became Lord Protector, but he did not use this title, learning from the mistakes his predecessor made. Northumberland was furiously ambitious, and aimed to secure Protestant uniformity while making himself rich with land and money in the process. He ordered churches to be stripped of all traditional Catholic symbolism, resulting in the simplicity often seen in Church of England churches today. A revision of the Book of Common Prayer was published in 1552. When Edward VI became ill in 1553, his advisers looked to the possible imminent accession of the Catholic Lady Mary, and feared that she would overturn all the reforms made during Edward&#x27;s reign. Perhaps surprisingly, it was the dying Edward himself who feared a return to Catholicism, and wrote a new will repudiating the 1544 will of Henry VIII. This gave the throne to his cousin Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII&#x27;s sister Mary Tudor, who, after the death of Louis XII of France in 1515 had married Henry VIII&#x27;s favourite Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk.

Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, at the age of 15. With his death, the direct male line of the House of Tudor ended.

===Jane===
The dying Edward VI, under the pressure of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, named his cousin and Northumberland&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey, as his successor due to her Protestant beliefs. Edward&#x27;s reluctance to follow the line of succession, which named his half-sister Mary as next in line, stemmed from his knowledge that Mary, firmly Catholic, would restore England to the Vatican. Lady Jane Grey was consistently at court after her father was made Duke of Suffolk in October 1551. Her mother, Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk, was the daughter of Mary Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII. On 21 May 1553, Jane was married to Northumberland&#x27;s son, Lord Guildford Dudley. This was a political move organised by the Duke to ensure that Protestantism stayed the national religion if Jane were to become queen. Edward died on 6 July 1553 and 16-year-old Jane, who fainted when she heard the news, was made queen on 10 July. However, despite the efforts of the Duke of Northumberland and Jane&#x27;s father, the Duke of Suffolk, the public&#x27;s support was with Lady Mary, the rightful heir according to Henry VIII&#x27;s will. On 19 July Suffolk persuaded his daughter to relinquish the throne, which she had never wanted, to Mary. Mary&#x27;s supporters joined her in a triumphal procession to London, accompanied by her younger sister Elizabeth. Lady Jane and her father were arrested for high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Her father was pardoned, but his participation in Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion led to his execution shortly after. Jane and her husband Lord Guildford were sentenced to death and beheaded on 12 February 1554. Jane was only 17 years old, and the cruel way in which her life had been lost for a throne she never desired aroused much sympathy among the public.

===Mary I===
Mary soon announced her intention to marry the Spanish prince, Philip, son of her cousin Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The prospect of a marriage alliance with Spain proved extremely unpopular with the English people, who were worried that Spain would use England as a satellite, involving England in wars without the popular support of the people. Popular discontent grew; a Protestant courtier, Thomas Wyatt the younger, led a rebellion against Mary aiming to depose and replace her with her half-sister Elizabeth. The plot was discovered, and Wyatt&#x27;s supporters were hunted down and killed. Wyatt himself was tortured, in the hope that he would give evidence that Elizabeth was involved so that Mary could have her executed for treason. Wyatt refused to implicate Elizabeth, and he was beheaded in April 1554. Elizabeth spent two months imprisoned at the Tower of London, and then was placed under house arrest at Woodstock Palace for a year.
Mary married Philip at Winchester Cathedral, on 25 July 1554, and he thereby became king &quot;jure uxoris&quot; until her death. Philip found her unattractive, and only spent a minimal amount of time with her. Despite Mary believing she was pregnant numerous times during her five-year reign, she never bore children. Devastated that she rarely saw her husband, and anxious that she was not bearing an heir to Catholic England, Mary became bitter and resentful. In her determination to restore England to the Catholic faith and to secure her throne from Protestant threats, she had over 280 Protestants burnt at the stake in the Marian persecutions, between 1554 and 1558. Protestants came to hate her as &quot;Bloody Mary.&quot; Charles Dickens stated that &quot;as bloody Queen Mary this woman has become famous, and as Bloody Queen Mary she will ever be remembered with horror and detestation&quot;.

Mary&#x27;s dream of a new, Catholic Habsburg line was finished, and her popularity further declined when she lost Calais — the last English territory on French soil — to Francis, Duke of Guise, in January 1558. Mary&#x27;s reign, however, introduced a new coining system that would be used until the 18th century, and her marriage to Philip II created new trade routes for England. Mary&#x27;s government took a number of steps towards reversing the inflation, budgetary deficits, poverty, and trade crisis of her kingdom. She explored the commercial potential of Russian, African, and Baltic markets, revised the customs system, worked to counter the currency debasements of her predecessors, amalgamated several revenue courts, and strengthened the governing authority of the middling and larger towns. Mary also welcomed the first Russian ambassador to England, creating relations between England and Russia for the first time. Had she lived a little longer, Catholicism, which she worked so hard to restore into the realm, might have taken deeper roots than it did. However, her actions in pursuit of this goal arguably spurred on the Protestant cause, through the many people she killed. Mary died on 17 November 1558 at the age of 42.

===Elizabeth I===
Elizabeth I, who was staying at Hatfield House at the time of her accession, rode to London to the cheers of both the ruling class and the common people.

When Elizabeth came to the throne, there was much apprehension among members of the council appointed by Mary, because many of them (as noted by the Spanish ambassador) had participated in several plots against Elizabeth, such as her imprisonment in the Tower, trying to force her to marry a foreign prince and thereby sending her out of the realm, and even pushing for her death. In response to their fear, she chose as her chief minister Sir William Cecil, a Protestant, and former secretary to Lord Protector the Duke of Somerset and then to the Duke of Northumberland. Under Mary, he had been spared, and often visited Elizabeth, ostensibly to review her accounts and expenditure. Elizabeth also appointed her personal favourite, the son of the Duke of Northumberland Lord Robert Dudley, her Master of the Horse, giving him constant personal access to the queen.

====Early years====
Elizabeth had a long, turbulent path to the throne. She had a number of problems during her childhood, the main one being after the execution of her mother, Anne Boleyn. When Anne was beheaded, Henry declared Elizabeth illegitimate and she would, therefore, not be able to inherit the throne. Henry returned her to the line of succession in the Third Succession Act of 1543. After the death of her father, she was raised by his widow, Catherine Parr and her new husband Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. Seymour may have groomed and sexually abused her, but their relationship was seen instead as an affair and caused scandal. During the interrogations, she answered truthfully and boldly and all charges were dropped. Seymour, however, was executed on 20 March 1549. Elizabeth was an excellent student, well-schooled in Latin, French, Italian, and somewhat in Greek, and was a talented writer. She was supposedly a very skilled musician as well, in both singing and playing the lute. After the rebellion of Thomas Wyatt the Younger in 1554, Elizabeth was imprisoned in the Tower of London. No proof could be found that Elizabeth was involved and she was released and retired to the countryside until the death of her half-sister, Mary I of England.

====Imposing the Church of England====
Elizabeth was a moderate Protestant; she was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, who played a key role in the English Reformation in the 1520s. She had been brought up by Blanche Herbert Lady Troy. At her coronation in January 1559, many of the bishops – Catholic, appointed by Mary, who had expelled many of the Protestant clergymen when she became queen in 1553 – refused to perform the service in English. Eventually, the relatively minor Bishop of Carlisle, Owen Oglethorpe, performed the ceremony; but when Oglethorpe attempted to perform traditional Catholic parts of the coronation, Elizabeth got up and left. Following the coronation, two important acts were passed through Parliament: the Act of Uniformity 1558 and the Act of Supremacy 1558, establishing the Protestant Church of England and creating Elizabeth Supreme Governor of the Church of England (&quot;Supreme Head&quot;, the title used by her father and brother, was seen as inappropriate for a woman ruler). These acts, known collectively as the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, made it compulsory to attend church services every Sunday; and imposed an oath on clergymen and statesmen to recognise the Church of England, the independence of the Church of England from the Catholic Church, and the authority of Elizabeth as Supreme Governor. Elizabeth made it clear that if they refused the oath the first time, they would have a second opportunity, after which, if the oath was not sworn, the offenders would be deprived of their offices and estates.

====Pressure to marry====
Even though Elizabeth was only twenty-five when she came to the throne, she was absolutely sure of her God-given place to be the queen and of her responsibilities as the &#x27;handmaiden of the Lord&#x27;. She never let anyone challenge her authority as queen, even though many people, who felt she was weak and should be married, tried to do so. The popularity of Elizabeth was extremely high, but her Privy Council, her Parliament and her subjects thought that the unmarried queen should take a husband; it was generally accepted that, once a queen regnant was married, the husband would relieve the woman of the burdens of head of state. Also, without an heir, the Tudor line would end; the risk of civil war between rival claimants was a possibility if Elizabeth died childless. Numerous suitors from nearly all European nations sent ambassadors to English court to put forward their suit. Risk of death came dangerously close in 1564 when Elizabeth caught smallpox; when she was most at risk, she named Robert Dudley as Lord Protector in the event of her death. After her recovery, she appointed Dudley to the Privy Council and created him Earl of Leicester, in the hope that he would marry Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary rejected him, and instead married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, a descendant of Henry VII, giving Mary a stronger claim to the English throne. Although many Catholics were loyal to Elizabeth, many also believed that, because Elizabeth was declared illegitimate after her parents&#x27; marriage was annulled, Mary was the strongest legitimate claimant. Despite this, Elizabeth would not name Mary her heir; as she had experienced during the reign of her predecessor Mary I, the opposition could flock around the heir if they were disheartened with Elizabeth&#x27;s rule.

Numerous threats to the Tudor line occurred during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. In 1569, a group of Earls led by Charles Neville, the sixth Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, the seventh Earl of Northumberland attempted to depose Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1571, the Protestant-turned-Catholic Thomas Howard, the fourth Duke of Norfolk, had plans to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, and then replace Elizabeth with Mary. The plot, masterminded by Roberto di Ridolfi, was discovered and Howard was beheaded. The next major uprising was in 1601, when Robert Devereux, the second Earl of Essex, attempted to raise the city of London against Elizabeth&#x27;s government. The city of London proved unwilling to rebel; Essex and most of his co-rebels were executed. Threats also came from abroad. In 1570, Pope Pius V issued a Papal bull, &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;, excommunicating Elizabeth, and releasing her subjects from their allegiance to her. Elizabeth came under pressure from Parliament to execute Mary, Queen of Scots, to prevent any further attempts to replace her; though faced with several official requests, she vacillated over the decision to execute an anointed queen. Finally, she was persuaded of Mary&#x27;s (treasonous) complicity in the plotting against her, and she signed the death warrant in 1586. Mary was executed at Fotheringhay Castle on 8 February 1587, to the outrage of Catholic Europe.

There are many reasons debated as to why Elizabeth never married. It was rumoured that she was in love with Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and that on one of her summer progresses she had birthed his illegitimate child. This rumour was just one of many that swirled around the two&#x27;s long-standing friendship. However, more important to focus on were the disasters that many women, such as her mother Anne Boleyn, suffered due to being married into the royal family. Her sister Mary&#x27;s marriage to Philip brought great contempt to the country, for many of her subjects despised Spain and Philip and feared that he would try to take complete control. Recalling her father&#x27;s disdain for Anne of Cleves, Elizabeth also refused to enter into a foreign match with a man that she had never seen before, so that also eliminated a large number of suitors.

====Last hopes for a Tudor heir====

Despite the uncertainty of Elizabeth&#x27;s – and therefore the Tudors&#x27; – hold on England, she never married. The closest she came to marriage was between 1579 and 1581, when she was courted by Francis, Duke of Anjou, the son of Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici. Despite Elizabeth&#x27;s government constantly begging her to marry in the early years of her reign, it was now persuading Elizabeth not to marry the French prince, for his mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, was suspected of ordering the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of tens of thousands of French Protestant Huguenots in 1572. Elizabeth bowed to public feeling against the marriage, learning from the mistake her sister, Mary I, made when she married Philip II of Spain, and sent the Duke of Anjou away. Elizabeth knew that the continuation of the Tudor line was now impossible; she was forty-eight in 1581, and too old to bear children.

By far the most dangerous threat to the Tudor line during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign was the Spanish Armada of 1588, launched by Elizabeth&#x27;s old suitor Philip II of Spain and commanded by Alonso de Guzmán El Bueno, the seventh Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Spanish invasion fleet outnumbered the English fleet&#x27;s 22 galleons and 108 armed merchant ships. The Spanish lost, however, as a result of bad weather on the English Channel, poor planning and logistics, and the skills of Sir Francis Drake and Charles Howard, the second Baron Howard of Effingham (later first Earl of Nottingham).

While Elizabeth declined physically with age, her running of the country continued to benefit her people. In response to famine across England due to bad harvests in the 1590s, Elizabeth introduced the poor law, allowing peasants who were too ill to work a certain amount of money from the state. All the money Elizabeth had borrowed from Parliament in 12 of the 13 parliamentary sessions was paid back; by the time of her death, Elizabeth not only had no debts, but was in credit. Elizabeth died childless at Richmond Palace on 24 March 1603. She left behind a legacy and monarchy worth noting. She had pursued her goals of being well endowed with every aspect of ruling her kingdom, and of knowing everything necessary to be an effective monarch. She took part in law, economics, politics and governmental issues both domestic and abroad. Realms that had once been strictly forbidden to the female gender had now been ruled by one.

Elizabeth never named a successor. However, her chief minister Sir Robert Cecil had corresponded with the Protestant King James VI of Scotland, great-grandson of Margaret Tudor, and James&#x27;s succession to the English throne was unopposed. There has been discussion over the selected heir. It has been argued that Elizabeth would have selected James because she felt guilty about what happened to his mother, her cousin. Whether this is true is unknown for certain, for Elizabeth did her best to never show emotion nor give in to claims. Elizabeth was strong and hard-headed and kept her primary goal in sight: providing the best for her people and proving those wrong who doubted her while maintaining a straight composure.

The House of Tudor survives through the female line, first with the House of Stuart, which occupied the English throne for most of the following century, and then the House of Hanover, via James&#x27; granddaughter Sophia. King Charles III, a member of the House of Windsor, is a direct descendant of Henry VII.

==Before and after comparisons==
Public interference regarding the Roses dynasties was always a threat until the 17th century Stuart/Bourbon re-alignment occasioned by a series of events such as the execution of Lady Jane Grey, despite her brother-in-law, Leicester&#x27;s reputation in Holland, the Rising of the North (in which the old Percy-Neville feud and even anti-Scottish sentiment was discarded on account of religion; Northern England shared the same Avignonese bias as the Scottish court, on par with Valois France and Castile, which became the backbone of the Counter-Reformation, with Protestants being solidly anti-Avignonese) and death of Elizabeth I of England without children.

The Tudors made no substantial changes in their foreign policy from either Lancaster or York, whether the alliance was with Aragon or Cleves, the chief foreign enemies continuing as the Auld Alliance, but the Tudors resurrected old ecclesiastic arguments once pursued by Henry II of England and his son John of England. Yorkists were tied so much to the old order that Catholic rebellions (such as the Pilgrimage of Grace) and aspirations (exemplified by William Allen) were seen as continuing in their reactionary footsteps, when in opposition to the Tudors&#x27; reformation policies, although the Tudors were not uniformly Protestant according to Continental definition—instead were true to their Lancastrian Beaufort allegiance, in the appointment of Reginald Pole.

The essential difference between the Tudors and their predecessors, is the nationalization and integration of John Wycliffe&#x27;s ideas to the Church of England, holding onto the alignment of Richard II of England and Anne of Bohemia, in which Anne&#x27;s Hussite brethren were in alliance to her husband&#x27;s Wycliffite countrymen against the Avignon Papacy. The Tudors otherwise rejected or suppressed other religious notions, whether for the Pope&#x27;s award of &quot;Fidei Defensor&quot; or to prevent them from being in the hands of the common laity, who might be swayed by cells of foreign Protestants, with whom they had conversation as Marian exiles, pursuing a strategy of containment which the Lancastrians had done (after being vilified by Wat Tyler), even though the phenomenon of &quot;Lollard knights&quot; (like John Oldcastle) had become almost a national sensation all on its own.

In essence, the Tudors followed a composite of Lancastrian (the court party) and Yorkist (the church party) policies. Henry VIII tried to extend his father&#x27;s balancing act between the dynasties for opportunistic interventionism in the Italian Wars, which had unfortunate consequences for his own marriages and the Papal States; the King furthermore tried to use similar tactics for the &quot;via media&quot; concept of Anglicanism. A further parallelism was effected by turning Ireland into a kingdom and sharing the same episcopal establishment as England, whilst enlarging England by the annexation of Wales. The progress to Northern/Roses government would thenceforth pass across the border into Scotland, in 1603, due not only to the civil warring, but also because the Tudors&#x27; own line was fragile and insecure, trying to reconcile the mortal enemies who had weakened England to the point of having to bow to new pressures, rather than dictate diplomacy on English terms.

==Rebellions against the Tudors==
The following English rebellions took place against the House of Tudor:
* &quot;Yorkist risings against Henry VII&quot; (1486–1487)
** The first was the Rebellion of the Stafford brothers and Viscount Lovell of 1486, which collapsed without fighting.
** In 1487, Yorkists led by John, Earl of Lincoln rebelled in support of Lambert Simnel, a boy who was claimed to be the Earl of Warwick, son of Edward IV&#x27;s brother Clarence (who had last been seen as a prisoner in the Tower). The rebellion began in Ireland, where the traditionally Yorkist nobility, headed by the powerful Gerald, Earl of Kildare, proclaimed Simnel King and provided troops for his invasion of England. The rebellion was defeated and Lincoln killed at the Battle of Stoke.
** &quot;Yorkshire Rebellion&quot; (1489) — Rioting led by Sir John Egremont was suppressed by Thomas, Earl of Surrey but not before Henry, Earl of Northumberland was killed collecting taxes for the War in Brittany. 
** &quot;Cornish Rebellion&quot; (1497) 
** &quot;Second Cornish Uprising of 1497&quot; — Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard, the younger of the &quot;Princes in the Tower&quot;, landed in Cornwall with a few thousand troops, but was soon captured and executed in 1499.
* &quot;Rebellions against Henry VIII&quot;
** &quot;The Amicable Grant Rebellion&quot; (1525)
** &quot;The Pilgrimage of Grace&quot; (1536)
* &quot;Rebellions against Edward VI&#x27;s &quot;protectors&quot;&quot;
** &quot;The Western Rebellion&quot; or &quot;Prayer Book Rebellion&quot; (1549)
** &quot;Kett&#x27;s Rebellion&quot; (1549)
* &quot;Rebellions against Mary I&quot;
** &quot;Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion&quot; (1554)
* &quot;Rebellions against Elizabeth I&quot;
** &quot;The Rebellion of the Northern Earls&quot; (1569)
** &quot;The Essex Rebellion&quot; (1601)

==Tudor monarchs of England and Ireland==
The six Tudor monarchs were:



==Armorial==

===Before the succession===
===Coat of arms as sovereigns===
As Prince of Wales, Arthur, Henry, and Edward all bore these arms,

===Tudor badges===
The Welsh Dragon supporter honoured the Tudors&#x27; Welsh origins. The most popular symbol of the house of Tudor was the Tudor rose (see top of page). When Henry Tudor took the crown of England from Richard III in battle, he brought about the end of the Wars of the Roses between the House of Lancaster (whose badge was a red rose) and the House of York (whose badge was a white rose). He married Elizabeth of York to bring all factions together.

On his marriage, Henry adopted the Tudor Rose badge conjoining the White Rose of York and the Red Rose of Lancaster. It symbolised the Tudor&#x27;s right to rule as well the uniting of the kingdom after the Wars of the Roses. It has been used by every English, then British, monarch since Henry VII as a royal badge.

===Tudor monograms===
The Tudors also used monograms to denote themselves:

==Lineage and the Tudor name==

===The Tudor name===
As noted above Tewdur or Tudor is derived from the words tud &quot;territory&quot; and rhi &quot;king&quot;. Owen Tudor took it as a surname on being knighted. It is doubtful whether the Tudor kings used the name on the throne. Kings and princes were not seen as needing a name, and a &quot;Tudor&quot; name for the royal family was hardly known in the sixteenth century. The royal surname was never used in official publications, and hardly in &#x27;histories&#x27; of various sorts before 1584. ... Monarchs were not anxious to publicise their descent in the paternal line from a Welsh adventurer, stressing instead continuity with the historic English and French royal families. Their subjects did not think of them as &#x27;Tudors&#x27;, or of themselves as &#x27;Tudor people. Princes and Princesses would have been known as &quot;of England&quot;. The medieval practice of colloquially calling princes after their place birth (e.g. Henry of Bolingbroke for Henry IV or Henry of Monmouth for Henry V) was not followed. Henry VII was likely known as &quot;Henry of Richmond&quot; before his taking of the throne. When Richard III called him &quot;Henry Tudor&quot; it was to stress his Welshness and his unfitness for the throne as opposed to himself, &quot;Richard Plantagenet&quot;, a &quot;true&quot; descendant of the royal line.

===Patrilineal descent===

===Royal lineage===

The Tudors&#x27; claim to the throne combined the Lancastrian claim in their descent from the Beauforts and the Yorkist claim by the marriage of Henry VII to the heiress of Edward IV.

==In popular culture==
Numerous feature films are based on Tudor history. Queen Elizabeth has been in special favorite for filmmakers for generations. According to Elizabeth A. Ford and Deborah C. Mitchell, images of Elizabeth I move: &quot;fast-forward across film history, unforgettable, iconic images: the stately bearing; the red wigs; the high forehead; the long, aristocratic nose; the alabaster makeup; the pearl-drop earrings; the stiff, ornate ruffs; the fingers dripping with jewels; and the gowns, with yards and yards of white satin, purple velvet, gold, and silver ornamented and sparkling with rubies, diamonds, and more pearls. Even a schoolchild would be hard-pressed to mistake her for any other monarch.&quot;

<text>Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is American writer Herman Melville&#x27;s first book, published in 1846, when Melville was 26 years old. Considered a classic in travel and adventure literature, the narrative is based on Melville&#x27;s experiences on the island Nuku Hiva in the South Pacific Marquesas Islands in 1842, supplemented with imaginative reconstruction and research from other books. The title comes from the valley of Taipivai, once known as Taipi.

&quot;Typee&quot; was Melville&#x27;s most popular work during his lifetime; it made him notorious as the &quot;man who lived among the cannibals&quot;.

==Background==
From the beginning there were questions about Melville&#x27;s romantic tale. The London publisher John Murray wanted reassurance that Melville&#x27;s experiences were first-hand before he included the book in the &quot;Home and Colonial Library&quot; series, which was nonfiction by or about foreigners in exotic places. Warm but sometimes skeptical reviews also challenged Melville&#x27;s account.

Not long after the book&#x27;s publication, however, many of the events described were corroborated by Melville&#x27;s fellow castaway, Richard Tobias Greene (&quot;Toby&quot;). Researchers later discovered an affidavit from the ship&#x27;s captain that corroborated that Melville and Greene did indeed desert the ship on the island in the summer of 1842.

&quot;Typee&quot; can be seen as a kind of proto-anthropology. Melville continually admits vast ignorance of the culture and language he is describing while also trying to bolster and supplement his own experiences with wide reading and research. He also employs hyperbole and humor. Starting in the 1930s, scholars in the Melville revival questioned Melville&#x27;s account. For instance, the length of stay on which &quot;Typee&quot; is based is presented as four months, and this was an exaggeration of Melville&#x27;s actual stay on the island. There is also not a lake where Melville might have gone canoeing with Fayaway.

To flesh out his narrative, Melville used several source books from which he took passages and rewrote them. The most important of these source books are William Ellis, &quot;Polynesian Researches&quot; from 1833, George H. von Langsdorff, &quot;Voyages and Travels in Various Parts of the World&quot; from 1813, David Porter, &quot;Journal of a Cruise Made to the Pacific Ocean in the U.S. Frigate Essex&quot; from 1815, and Charles S. Stewart, &quot;A Visit to the South Seas in the U.S. ship Vincennes&quot; from 1831.

==Critical response==

&quot;Typee&quot;″s narrative expresses a great deal of sympathy for the so-called savages, and even interrogates the use of that word, while focusing the most criticism on European marauders and various missionaries&#x27; attempts to evangelize:
It may be asserted without fear of contradictions that in all the cases of
outrages committed by Polynesians, Europeans have at some time or
other been the aggressors, and that the cruel and bloodthirsty
disposition of some of the islanders is mainly to be ascribed to
the influence of such examples.

[The] voluptuous Indian, with every desire supplied,
whom Providence has bountifully provided with all the sources of
pure and natural enjoyment, and from whom are removed so many of
the ills and pains of life—what has he to desire at the hands of
Civilization? Will he be the happier? Let the once smiling and
populous Hawaiian islands, with their now diseased, starving, and
dying natives, answer the question. The missionaries may seek to
disguise the matter as they will, but the facts are incontrovertible.

&quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; called &quot;Typee&quot; &quot;a piece of Münchhausenism.&quot; New York publisher Evert Augustus Duyckinck wrote to Nathaniel Hawthorne that &quot;it is a lively and pleasant book, not over philosophical perhaps.&quot; In 1939, Charles Robert Anderson published &quot;Melville in the South Seas&quot; in which he elaborated on a number of Melville&#x27;s likely sources in supplementing his work and also documented the existence of an affidavit from the Captain of the &quot;Acushnet&quot;. If the date provided by the Captain can be considered accurate, Anderson concludes that Melville&#x27;s stay in the &quot;Typee Valley&quot; part of the island would have been merely &quot;four weeks, or possible eight weeks at the most.&quot; However, in trying to determine the end date of Melville&#x27;s stay, Anderson primarily relies on Melville&#x27;s own internal accounts of various events, for instance that he was rescued from the valley on a &quot;Monday.&quot; In summing up his view of &quot;Typee&quot;, Anderson writes:

 For the general student of Melville, the detailed analysis and verification of these matters... probably reveals an accuracy scarcely to be expected. Without hesitation it can be said that in general this volume presents faithful delineation of the island life and scenery in precivilization Nukahiva, with the exception of numerous embellishments and some minor errors...

All of the initial back and forth that Melville experienced regarding the factuality of &quot;Typee&quot; may have had a chastening effect on him, as Anderson considers his next work, the book&#x27;s sequel &quot;Omoo&quot;, &quot;the most strictly autobiographical of all Melville&#x27;s works.&quot; But this second book also seems to have met with some skepticism, so that for his third book &quot;Mardi&quot;, Melville declares in the preface that he has decided to write a work of fiction under the supposition (half-joking) he might finally be believed: 
Not long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to see whether, the fiction might not, possibly be received for a verity: in some degree the reverse of my previous experience.

==Publication history==
&quot;Typee&quot; was published first in London by John Murray on February 26, 1846, and then in New York by Wiley and Putnam on March 17, 1846. It was Melville&#x27;s first book, and made him one of the best-known American authors overnight.

The same version was published in London and New York in the first edition; however, Melville removed critical references to missionaries and Christianity from the second U.S. edition at the request of his American publisher. Later additions included a &quot;Sequel: The Story of Toby&quot; written by Melville, explaining what happened to Toby.

Before &quot;Typee&quot;″s publication in New York, Wiley and Putnam asked Melville to remove one sentence. In a scene in Chapter Two where the &quot;Dolly&quot; is boarded by young women from Nukuheva, Melville originally wrote:
Our ship was now given up to every species of riot and debauchery. Not the feeblest barrier was interposed between the unholy passions of the crew and their unlimited gratification. 
The second sentence was removed from the final version.

The discovery in 1983 of thirty more pages from Melville’s working draft manuscript led Melville scholar John Bryant to challenge earlier conclusions about Melville&#x27;s writing habits. He describes the versions of the draft manuscript and of the “radically different physical print versions of the book,” which amount, Bryant concludes, to “one grand, hooded mess.” Since there is no clear way to present Melville’s &quot;final intention,&quot; his 2008 book offers a “fluid text” that allows a reader to follow the revisions. made what he called “an exciting new perspective on Melville’s writing process and culture.” 
The inaugural book of the Library of America series, titled &quot;Typee, Omoo, Mardi&quot; (May 6, 1982), was a volume containing &quot;Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life&quot;, its sequel &quot;Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas&quot; (1847), and &quot;Mardi, and a Voyage Thither&quot; (1849).

In geometry, the truncated icosahedron is a polyhedron that can be constructed by truncating all of the regular icosahedron&#x27;s vertices. Intuitively, it may be regarded as footballs (or soccer balls) that are typically patterned with white hexagons and black pentagons. It can be found in the application of geodesic dome structures such as those whose architecture Buckminster Fuller pioneered are often based on this structure. It is an example of an Archimedean solid, as well as a Goldberg polyhedron.

== Construction ==
The truncated icosahedron can be constructed from a regular icosahedron by cutting off all of its vertices, known as truncation. Each of the 12 vertices at the one-third mark of each edge creates 12 pentagonal faces and transforms the original 20 triangle faces into regular hexagons. Therefore, the resulting polyhedron has 32 faces, 90 edges, and 60 vertices. A Goldberg polyhedron is one whose faces are 12 pentagons and some multiple of 10 hexagons. There are three classes of Goldberg polyhedron, one of them is constructed by truncating all vertices repeatedly, and the truncated icosahedron is one of them, denoted as formula_1.

== Properties ==
The surface area formula_2 and the volume formula_3 of the truncated icosahedron of edge length formula_4 are:
formula_5
The sphericity of a polyhedron formula_6 describes how closely a polyhedron resembles a sphere. It can be defined as the ratio of the surface area of a sphere with the same volume to the polyhedron&#x27;s surface area, from which the value is between 0 and 1. In the case of a truncated icosahedron, it is:
formula_7

The dihedral angle of a truncated icosahedron between adjacent hexagonal faces is approximately 138.18°, and that between pentagon-to-hexagon is approximately 142.6°.

The truncated icosahedron is an Archimedean solid, meaning it is a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron, and two or more different regular polygonal faces meet in a vertex. It has the same symmetry as the regular icosahedron, the icosahedral symmetry, and it also has the property of vertex-transitivity. The polygonal faces that meet for every vertex are one pentagon and two hexagons, and the vertex figure of a truncated icosahedron is formula_8. The truncated icosahedron&#x27;s dual is pentakis dodecahedron, a Catalan solid, shares the same symmetry as the truncated icosahedron.

== Truncated icosahedral graph ==

According to Steinitz&#x27;s theorem, the skeleton of a truncated icosahedron, like that of any convex polyhedron, can be represented as a polyhedral graph, meaning a planar graph (one that can be drawn without crossing edges) and 3-vertex-connected graph (remaining connected whenever two of its vertices are removed). The graph is known as truncated icosahedral graph, and it has 60 vertices and 90 edges. It is an Archimedean graph because it resembles one of the Archimedean solids. It is a cubic graph, meaning that each vertex is incident to exactly three edges.

== Appearance ==

The balls used in association football and team handball are perhaps the best-known example of a spherical polyhedron analog to the truncated icosahedron, found in everyday life. The ball comprises the same pattern of regular pentagons and regular hexagons, each of which is painted in black and white respectively; still, its shape is more spherical. It was designed by Adidas Telstar during World Cup in 1970. However, it was superseded in 2006.
Geodesic domes are typically based on triangular facetings of this geometry with example structures found across the world, popularized by Buckminster Fuller. An example can be found in the model of a buckminsterfullerene, a truncated icosahedron-shaped geodesic dome allotrope of elemental carbon discovered in 1985. In other engineering and science applications, its shape was also the configuration of the lenses used for focusing the explosive shock waves of the detonators in both the gadget and Fat Man atomic bombs. Its structure can also be found in the protein of clathrin.
The truncated icosahedron was known to Archimedes, who classified the 13 Archimedean solids in a lost work. All that is now known of his work on these shapes comes from Pappus of Alexandria, who merely lists the numbers of faces for each: 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons, in the case of the truncated icosahedron. The first known image and complete description of a truncated icosahedron are from a rediscovery by Piero della Francesca, in his 15th-century book &quot;De quinque corporibus regularibus&quot;, which included five of the Archimedean solids (the five truncations of the regular polyhedra). The same shape was depicted by Leonardo da Vinci, in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli&#x27;s plagiarism of della Francesca&#x27;s book in 1509. Although Albrecht Dürer omitted this shape from the other Archimedean solids listed in his 1525 book on polyhedra, &quot;Underweysung der Messung&quot;, a description of it was found in his posthumous papers, published in 1538. Johannes Kepler later rediscovered the complete list of the 13 Archimedean solids, including the truncated icosahedron, and included them in his 1609 book, &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot;.

<text>The Mismeasure of Man is a 1981 book by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. The book is both a history and critique of the statistical methods and cultural motivations underlying biological determinism, the belief that &quot;the social and economic differences between human groups—primarily races, classes, and sexes—arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology&quot;.

Gould argues that the primary assumption underlying biological determinism is that &quot;worth can be assigned to individuals and groups by &quot;measuring intelligence as a single quantity&quot;&quot;. Biological determinism is analyzed in discussions of craniometry and psychological testing, the two principal methods used to measure intelligence as a single quantity. According to Gould, these methods possess two deep fallacies. The first fallacy is reification, which is &quot;our tendency to convert abstract concepts into entities&quot;. Examples of reification include the intelligence quotient (IQ) and the general intelligence factor (&quot;g&quot; factor), which have been the cornerstones of much research into human intelligence. The second fallacy is that of &quot;ranking&quot;, which is the &quot;propensity for ordering complex variation as a gradual ascending scale&quot;.

The book received many positive reviews in the literary and popular press, while scientific reception was highly polarized. Positive reviews focused on the book&#x27;s critique of scientific racism, the concept of general intelligence, and biological determinism, while critics accused Gould of historical inaccuracy, unclear reasoning, or political bias. &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; won the National Book Critics Circle award. Gould&#x27;s findings about how 19th-century researcher Samuel George Morton measured skull volumes were particularly controversial, inspiring several studies debating his claims. 

In 1996, a second edition was released. It included two additional chapters critiquing Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray&#x27;s book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994).

==Author==

Stephen Jay Gould (; 1941 – 2002) was one of the most influential and widely read authors of popular science of his generation. He was known by the general public mainly for his 300 popular essays in &quot;Natural History&quot; magazine, As in &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;, Gould criticized biological theories of human behavior in &quot;Against &quot;Sociobiology&quot;&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm&quot; (1979).

==Summary==

===Craniometry===

&quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; is a critical analysis of the early works of scientific racism which promoted &quot;the theory of
unitary, innate, linearly rankable intelligence&quot;—such as craniometry, the measurement of skull volume and its relation to intellectual faculties. Gould alleged that much of the research was based largely on racial and social prejudices of the researchers rather than their scientific objectivity; that on occasion, researchers such as Samuel George Morton (1799–1851), Louis Agassiz (1807–1873), and Paul Broca (1824–1880), committed the methodological fallacy of allowing their personal &quot;a priori&quot; expectations to influence their conclusions and analytical reasoning. Gould noted that when Morton switched from using bird seed, which was less reliable, to lead shot to obtain endocranial-volume data, the average skull volumes changed; however, these changes were not uniform across Morton&#x27;s &quot;racial&quot; groupings. To Gould, it appeared that unconscious bias influenced Morton&#x27;s initial results. Gould speculated,

Plausible scenarios are easy to construct. Morton, measuring by seed, picks up a threateningly large black skull, fills it lightly and gives it a few desultory shakes. Next, he takes a distressingly small Caucasian skull, shakes hard, and pushes mightily at the foramen magnum with his thumb. It is easily done, without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action.

In 1977 Gould conducted his own analysis on some of Morton&#x27;s endocranial-volume data, and alleged that the original results were based on &quot;a priori&quot; convictions and a selective use of data. He argued that when biases are accounted for, the original hypothesis—an ascending order of skull volume ranging from Blacks to Mongols to Whites—is unsupported by the data.

===Bias and falsification===

&quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; presents a historical evaluation of the concepts of the &quot;intelligence quotient&quot; (IQ) and of the &quot;general intelligence factor&quot; (&quot;g&quot; factor), which were and are the measures for intelligence used by psychologists. Gould proposed that most psychological studies have been heavily biased, by the belief that the human behavior of a race of people is best explained by genetic heredity. He cites the Burt Affair, about the oft-cited twin studies, by Cyril Burt (1883–1971), wherein Burt claimed that human intelligence is highly heritable.

===IQ, &quot;g&quot;, statistical correlation, and heritability===
As an evolutionary biologist and historian of science, Gould accepted &quot;biological variability&quot; (the premise of the transmission of intelligence via genetic heredity), but opposed &quot;biological determinism&quot;, which posits that genes determine a definitive, unalterable social destiny for each man and each woman in life and society. &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; is an analysis of statistical correlation, the mathematics applied by psychologists to establish the validity of IQ tests, and the heritability of intelligence. For example, to establish the validity of the proposition that IQ is supported by a general intelligence factor (&quot;g&quot; factor), the answers to several tests of cognitive ability must positively correlate; thus, for the &quot;g&quot; factor to be a heritable trait, the IQ-test scores of close-relation respondents must correlate more than the IQ-test scores of distant-relation respondents. However, correlation does not imply causation; for example, Gould said that the measures of the changes, over time, in &quot;my age, the population of México, the price of Swiss cheese, my pet turtle&#x27;s weight, and the average distance between galaxies&quot; have a high, positive correlation—yet that correlation does not indicate that Gould&#x27;s age increased because the Mexican population increased. More specifically, a high, positive correlation between the intelligence quotients of a parent and a child can be presumed either as evidence that IQ is genetically inherited, or that IQ is inherited through social and environmental factors. Moreover, because the data from IQ tests can be applied to arguing the logical validity of either proposition—genetic inheritance and environmental inheritance—the psychometric data have no inherent value.

Gould pointed out that if the genetic heritability of IQ were demonstrable within a given racial or ethnic group, it would not explain the causes of IQ differences among the people of a group, or if said IQ differences can be attributed to the environment. For example, the height of a person is genetically determined, but there exist height differences within a given social group that can be attributed to environmental factors (e.g. the quality of nutrition) and to genetic inheritance. The evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin, a colleague of Gould&#x27;s, is a proponent of this argument in relation to IQ tests. An example of the intellectual confusion about what heritability is and is not, is the statement: &quot;If all environments were to become equal for everyone, heritability would rise to 100 percent because all remaining differences in IQ would necessarily be genetic in origin&quot;, which Gould said is misleading, at best, and false, at worst. First, it is very difficult to conceive of a world wherein every man, woman, and child grew up in the same environment, because their spatial and temporal dispersion upon the planet Earth makes it impossible. Second, were people to grow up in the same environment, not every difference would be genetic in origin because of the randomness of molecular and genetic development. Therefore, heritability is not a measure of phenotypic (physiognomy and physique) differences among racial and ethnic groups, but of differences between genotype and phenotype in a given population.

Furthermore, he dismissed the proposition that an IQ score measures the general intelligence (&quot;g&quot; factor) of a person, because cognitive ability tests (IQ tests) present different types of questions, and the responses tend to form clusters of intellectual acumen. That is, different questions, and the answers to them, yield different scores—which indicate that an IQ test is a combination method of different examinations of different things. As such, Gould proposed that IQ-test proponents assume the existence of &quot;general intelligence&quot; as a discrete quality within the human mind, and thus they analyze the IQ-test data to produce an IQ number that establishes the definitive general intelligence of each man and of each woman. Hence, Gould dismissed the IQ number as an erroneous artifact of the statistical mathematics applied to the raw IQ-test data, especially because psychometric data can be variously analyzed to produce multiple IQ scores.

The revised and expanded second edition (1996) includes two additional chapters, which critique Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray&#x27;s book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994). Gould maintains that their book contains no new arguments and presents no compelling data; it merely refashions earlier arguments for biological determinism, which Gould defines as &quot;the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups—races, classes, or sexes—are innately inferior and deserve their status&quot;.

==Reception==
===Praise===
The majority of reviews of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; were positive, as Gould notes. Richard Lewontin, a celebrated evolutionary biologist who held positions at both the University of Chicago and Harvard, wrote a glowing review of Gould&#x27;s book in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, endorsing most aspects of its account, and suggesting that it might have been even more critical of the racist intentions of the scientists he discusses, because scientists &quot;sometimes tell deliberate lies because they believe that small lies can serve big truths.&quot; Gould said that the most positive review of the first edition to be written by a psychologist was in the &quot;British Journal of Mathematical &amp; Statistical Psychology&quot;, which reported that &quot;Gould has performed a valuable service in exposing the logical basis of one of the most important debates in the social sciences, and this book should be required reading for students and practitioners alike.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, journalist Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote that the critique of factor analysis &quot;demonstrates persuasively how factor analysis led to the cardinal error in reasoning, of confusing correlation with cause, or, to put it another way, of attributing false concreteness to the abstract&quot;. The British journal &quot;Saturday Review&quot; praised the book as a &quot;fascinating historical study of scientific racism&quot;, and that its arguments &quot;illustrate both the logical inconsistencies of the theories and the prejudicially motivated, albeit unintentional, misuse of data in each case&quot;. In the American &quot;Monthly Review&quot; magazine, Richard York and the sociologist Brett Clark praised the book&#x27;s thematic concentration, saying that &quot;rather than attempt a grand critique of all &#x27;scientific&#x27; efforts aimed at justifying social inequalities, Gould performs a well-reasoned assessment of the errors underlying a specific set of theories and empirical claims&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; gave it a positive review for revealing biased science and its abuse. &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa&#x27;s &quot;The Key Reporter&quot; also reviewed the book favorably.

===Awards===
The first edition of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; won the non-fiction award from the National Book Critics Circle; the Outstanding Book Award for 1983 from the American Educational Research Association; the Italian translation was awarded the &quot;Iglesias&quot; prize in 1991; and in 1998, the Modern Library ranked it as the 24th-best English-language non-fiction book of the 20th century. In December 2006, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine ranked &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; as the 17th-greatest science book of all time.

===Reassessing Morton&#x27;s skull measurements===
In a paper published in 1988, John S. Michael reported that Samuel G. Morton&#x27;s original 19th-century study was conducted with less bias than Gould had described; that &quot;contrary to Gould&#x27;s interpretation ... Morton&#x27;s research was conducted with integrity&quot;. Nonetheless, Michael&#x27;s analysis suggested that there were discrepancies in Morton&#x27;s craniometric calculations, that his data tables were scientifically unsound, and he &quot;cannot be excused for his errors, or his unfair comparisons of means&quot;. Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively &quot;cherry-picked facts&quot; from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, &quot;Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into an all or nothing debate in which either one side is right or the other side is right, and I think that is a mistake. Both men made mistakes and proving one wrong does not prove the other one right.&quot;

In another study, published in 2011, Jason E. Lewis and colleagues re-measured the cranial volumes of the skulls in Morton&#x27;s collection, and re-examined the respective statistical analyses by Morton and by Gould, concluding that, contrary to Gould&#x27;s analysis, Morton did not falsify craniometric research results to support his racial and social prejudices, and that the &quot;Caucasians&quot; possessed the greatest average cranial volume in the sample. To the extent that Morton&#x27;s craniometric measurements were erroneous, the error was away from his personal biases. Ultimately, Lewis and colleagues disagreed with most of Gould&#x27;s criticisms of Morton, finding that Gould&#x27;s work was &quot;poorly supported&quot;, and that, in their opinion, the confirmation of the results of Morton&#x27;s original work &quot;weakens the argument of Gould, and others, that biased results are endemic in science&quot;. Despite this criticism, the authors acknowledged that they admired Gould&#x27;s staunch opposition to racism. Lewis&#x27; study examined 46% of Morton&#x27;s samples, whereas Gould&#x27;s earlier study was based solely on a reexamination of Morton&#x27;s raw data tables. However Lewis&#x27; study was subsequently criticized by a number of scholars for misrepresenting Gould&#x27;s claims, bias, faulted for examining fewer than half of the skulls in Morton&#x27;s collection, for failing to correct measurements for age, gender or stature, and for its claim that any meaningful conclusions could be drawn from Morton&#x27;s data.

In 2015 this paper was reviewed by Michael Weisberg, who reported that &quot;most of Gould&#x27;s arguments against Morton are sound. Although Gould made some errors and overstated his case in a number of places, he provided &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence, as yet unrefuted, that Morton did indeed mismeasure his skulls in ways that conformed to 19th century racial biases&quot;. Biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua Alexander Banta also published a critique of the group&#x27;s paper, arguing that many of its claims were misleading and the re-measurements were &quot;completely irrelevant to an evaluation of Gould&#x27;s published analysis&quot;. They also maintain that the &quot;methods deployed by Morton and Gould were both inappropriate&quot; and that &quot;Gould&#x27;s statistical analysis of Morton&#x27;s data is in many ways no better than Morton&#x27;s own&quot;.

A 2018 paper argued that Morton&#x27;s interpretation of the data was biased but that the data itself was accurate. The paper argued that Morton&#x27;s measurements were similar to those of a contemporary craniologist, Friedrich Tiedemann, who had interpreted the data differently to argue strongly against any conception of racial hierarchy.

===Criticism===
In a review of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;, Bernard Davis, professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School, said that Gould erected a straw man argument based upon incorrectly defined key terms—specifically &quot;reification&quot;—which Gould furthered with a &quot;highly selective&quot; presentation of statistical data, all motivated more by politics than by science. Davis said that Philip Morrison&#x27;s laudatory book review of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; in &quot;Scientific American&quot; was written and published because the editors of the journal had &quot;long seen the study of the genetics of intelligence as a threat to social justice&quot;. Davis also criticized the popular-press and the literary-journal book reviews of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; as generally approbatory; whereas, he said that most scientific-journal book reviews were generally critical. Davis accused Gould of having misrepresented a study by Henry H. Goddard (1866–1957) about the intelligence of Jewish, Hungarian, Italian, and Russian immigrants to the U.S., wherein Gould reported Goddard&#x27;s qualifying those people as &quot;feeble-minded&quot;; whereas, in the initial sentence of the study, Goddard said the study subjects were atypical members of their ethnic groups, who had been selected because of their suspected sub-normal intelligence. Davis also argued that Goddard had proposed that the low IQs of the sub-normally intelligent men and women who took the cognitive-ability test likely derived from their social environments rather than from their respective genetic inheritances, and concluded that &quot;we may be confident that their children will be of average intelligence, and, if rightly brought up, will be good citizens&quot;. Gould pushed back against some of Davis&#x27; claims in a 1994 revised edition of the book. While Davis characterized the book&#x27;s reception as negative in the scientific journals, Gould argued that of twenty-four academic book reviews written by experts in psychology, fourteen approved, three were mixed opinions, and seven disapproved of the book.

In his review, psychologist John B. Carroll said that Gould did not understand &quot;the nature and purpose&quot; of factor analysis. Statistician David J. Bartholomew, of the London School of Economics, said that Gould erred in his use of factor analysis, irrelevantly concentrated upon the fallacy of reification (abstract as concrete), and ignored the contemporary scientific consensus about the existence of the psychometric &quot;g&quot;.

Reviewing the book, Stephen F. Blinkhorn, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, wrote that &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; was &quot;a masterpiece of propaganda&quot; that selectively juxtaposed data to further a political agenda. Psychologist Lloyd Humphreys, then editor-in-chief of &quot;The American Journal of Psychology&quot; and &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot;, wrote that &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; was &quot;science fiction&quot; and &quot;political propaganda&quot;, and that Gould had misrepresented the views of Alfred Binet, Godfrey Thomson, and Lewis Terman.

In his review, psychologist Franz Samelson wrote that Gould was wrong in asserting that the psychometric results of the intelligence tests administered to soldier-recruits by the U.S. Army contributed to the legislation of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924. In their study of the Congressional Record and committee hearings related to the Immigration Act, Mark Snyderman and Richard J. Herrnstein reported that &quot;the [intelligence] testing community did not generally view its findings as favoring restrictive immigration policies like those in the 1924 Act, and Congress took virtually no notice of intelligence testing&quot;. Psychologist David P. Barash wrote that Gould unfairly groups sociobiology with &quot;racist eugenics and misguided Social Darwinism&quot;.

A 2019 paper argued that the Gould was incorrect in his assessment of the Army Beta and that, for the knowledge, technology and test development standards of the time, it was adequate and could measure intelligence, possibly even in the modern day.

===Responses by subjects of the book===
In his review of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;, Arthur Jensen, a University of California (Berkeley) educational psychologist whom Gould much criticized in the book, wrote that Gould used straw man arguments to advance his opinions, misrepresented other scientists, and propounded a political agenda. According to Jensen, the book was &quot;a patent example&quot; of the bias that political ideology imposes upon science—the very thing that Gould sought to portray in the book. Jensen also criticized Gould for concentrating on long-disproven arguments (noting that 71% of the book&#x27;s references preceded 1950), rather than addressing &quot;anything currently regarded as important by scientists in the relevant fields&quot;, suggesting that drawing conclusions from early human intelligence research is like condemning the contemporary automobile industry based upon the mechanical performance of the Ford Model T.

Charles Murray, co-author of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994), said that his views about the distribution of human intelligence, among the races and the ethnic groups who compose the U.S. population, were misrepresented in &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;.

Psychologist Hans Eysenck wrote that &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; is a book that presents &quot;a paleontologist&#x27;s distorted view of what psychologists think, untutored in even the most elementary facts of the science&quot;.

===Responses to the second edition (1996)===
Arthur Jensen and Bernard Davis argued that if the &quot;g&quot; factor (general intelligence factor) were replaced with a model that tested several types of intelligence, it would change results less than one might expect. Therefore, according to Jensen and Davis, the results of standardized tests of cognitive ability would continue to correlate with the results of other such standardized tests, and that the intellectual achievement gap between black and white people would remain.

James R. Flynn, a researcher critical of racial theories of intelligence, repeated the arguments of Arthur Jensen about the second edition of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;. Flynn wrote that &quot;Gould&#x27;s book evades all of Jensen&#x27;s best arguments for a genetic component in the black–white IQ gap, by positing that they are dependent on the concept of &quot;g&quot; as a general intelligence factor. Therefore, Gould believes that if he can discredit &quot;g&quot; no more need be said. This is manifestly false. Jensen&#x27;s arguments would bite no matter whether blacks suffered from a score deficit on one or ten or one hundred factors.&quot; Rather than defending Jensen and Rushton, however, Flynn concluded that the Flynn Effect, a nongenetic rise in IQ throughout the 20th century, invalidated their core argument because their methods falsely identified even this change as genetic.

According to psychologist Ian Deary, Gould&#x27;s claim that there is no relation between brain size and IQ is outdated. Furthermore, he reported that Gould refused to correct this in new editions of the book, even though newly available data were brought to his attention by several researchers.

<doc id="31285" wikidata="Q1451867" url="?curid=31285" title="Treatment of women by the Taliban">
<text>The treatment of women by the Taliban includes the actions and policies by two distinct Taliban regimes in Afghanistan which are either specific or highly commented upon, mostly due to discrimination, since they first took control in 1996.

During their first rule of Afghanistan, the Taliban were notorious internationally for their misogyny and violence against women. In 1996, women were mandated to wear the burqa at all times in public. In a systematic segregation sometimes referred to as gender apartheid, women were not allowed to work, nor were they allowed to be educated after the age of eight. Women seeking an education were forced to attend underground schools, where they and their teachers risked execution if caught. They were not allowed to be treated by male doctors unless accompanied by a male chaperone, which led to illnesses remaining untreated. They faced public flogging and execution for violations of the Taliban&#x27;s laws.

After taking over Afghanistan for the second time in 2021, the Taliban initially granted women permission to attend universities, albeit in gender segregated classrooms, under the condition that they followed &quot;Islamic standards.&quot; However, they restricted access to education for teenage girls by allowing only boys to resume schooling. Additionally, they prohibited women in Afghanistan from working in most sectors beyond health and education. Some provinces still allow secondary education for girls, despite the nation-wide ban. Women were mandated to wear face coverings in public, and barred from travelling more than without a close male relative. In 2022, Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban&#x27;s reclusive leader, rejected international criticism and pleas for easing human rights restrictions, refusing any negotiations or compromises on the Taliban&#x27;s &quot;Islamic system&quot; of governance. The Taliban extended the ban on university education for women and barred them from working in NGOs. Within two years after seizing Afghanistan for the second time, the Taliban shut down beauty salons and banned women from accessing gyms and parks. According to the United Nations (UN), the treatment of women by Taliban may amount to gender apartheid.

==Gender policies==

From the age of eight onward, girls in Afghanistan were not allowed to be in direct contact with males other than a close &quot;blood relative&quot;, husband, or in-law &quot;(see mahram)&quot;. From September 1996 to December 2001, when the Taliban were in control of 90 per cent of Afghanistan, it imposed the following restrictions on women:
* Women should not appear in the streets without a &quot;mahram&quot;, or without wearing a burqa.
* Women should not wear high-heeled shoes as no man should hear a woman&#x27;s footsteps lest it excite him.
* Women must not speak loudly in public as no stranger should hear a woman&#x27;s voice.
* All street-level windows should be painted over or screened to prevent women from being visible from the street.
* Photographing, filming and displaying pictures of girls and women in newspapers, books, shops or the home was banned.
* The modification of any place names that included the word &quot;women&quot;. For example, &quot;women&#x27;s garden&quot; was renamed &quot;spring garden&quot;.
* Women were forbidden to appear on the balconies of their apartments or houses.
* Ban on women&#x27;s presence on radio, television or at public gatherings of any kind.
* Women were not allowed to wash the laundry at the river banks, if found, the woman was to be brought into the custody of a male guardian who was supposed to severely punish her.

===Mobility===
The Taliban rulings regarding public conduct placed severe restrictions on a woman&#x27;s freedom of movement and created difficulties for those who could not afford a burqa (which was not commonly worn in Afghanistan prior to the rise of the Taliban and considered a fairly expensive garment at upwards of ) or did not have any &quot;mahram&quot;. These women faced virtual house arrest. In December 1998, a decree issued by the Ministry for the promotion of Virtue and prevention of Vice banned taxi drivers from transporting women who did not completely cover their faces. A woman who was badly beaten by the Taliban for walking the streets alone stated &quot;my father was killed in battle ... I have no husband, no brother, no son. How am I to live if I can&#x27;t go out alone?&quot; 

A field worker for the NGO Terre des hommes witnessed the impact on female mobility at Kabul&#x27;s largest state-run orphanage, Taskia Maskan. After the female staff was relieved of their duties, the approximately 400 girls living at the institution were locked inside for a year without being allowed outside for recreation.

Decrees that affected women&#x27;s mobility were:
* Ban on women riding bicycles or motorcycles, even with their &quot;mahrams&quot;.
* Women were forbidden to ride in a taxi without a &quot;mahram&quot;.
* Segregated bus services introduced to prevent males and females travelling on the same bus.

The lives of rural women were less dramatically affected as they generally lived and worked within secure kin environments. A relative level of freedom was necessary for them to continue with their chores or labour. If these women travelled to a nearby town, the same urban restrictions would have applied to them.

===Employment===
The Taliban disagreed with past Afghan statutes that allowed the employment of Afghan women in a mixed sex workplace. The claim was that this was a breach of purdah and Sharia law. On 30 September 1996, the Taliban decreed that all women should be banned from employment. It is estimated that 25 per cent of government employees were female, and when compounded by losses in other sectors, many thousands of women were affected.

Another loss was for those whom the employed women served. Elementary education of all children, not just girls, was shut down in Kabul, where virtually all of the elementary school teachers were women. Thousands of educated families fled Kabul for Pakistan after the Taliban took the city in 1996. 

Between April and June 1998, the United Nations left their offices in Qandahar following disagreements over a regulation which demanded the female staff to only operate accompanied by a &quot;mahram&quot;. The two parties later came to an agreement over the working conditions, but the Taliban demanded the agreement to be kept secret. However, most expatriate staff including the staff of the UN left Afghanistan following the death of a UN official in August 1998. 

Taliban Supreme Leader Mohammed Omar assured female civil servants and teachers they would still receive wages of around US$5 per month, although this was a short-term offering. A Taliban representative stated: &quot;The Taliban&#x27;s act of giving monthly salaries to 30,000 job-free women, now sitting comfortably at home, is a whiplash in the face of those who are defaming Taliban with reference to the rights of women. These people through baseless propaganda are trying to incite the women of Kabul against the Taliban&quot;. A Taliban official mentioned in 1998 that in the Quran it says &quot;stay at home&quot; (in the feminine form), therefore there is not much to do other than to obey.

The Taliban promoted the use of the extended family, or zakat system of charity to ensure women should not need to work. However, years of conflict meant that nuclear families often struggled to support themselves let alone aid additional relatives. Qualification for legislation often rested on men, such as food aid, which had to be collected by a male relative. The possibility that a woman may not possess any living male relatives was dismissed by Mullah Ghaus, the acting foreign minister, who said he was surprised at the degree of international attention and concern for such a small percentage of the Afghan population. A Physicians for Human Rights researcher that travelled to Kabul in 1998 described &quot;a city of beggars&quot; filled with &quot;women who had once been teachers and nurses now moving in the streets like ghosts under their enveloping &quot;burqas&quot;, selling every possession and begging so as to feed their children.&quot;

Female health professionals could be exempt from the employment ban, yet they operated in much-reduced freedom of movement. The ordeal of physically getting to work due to the segregated bus system and widespread harassment meant some women left their jobs by choice. Of those who remained, many lived in fear of the regime and chose to reside at hospitals during the working week to minimise exposure to Taliban forces. These women were vital to ensuring the continuance of gynaecological, ante-natal, and midwifery services, but it was on a much compromised level. Under the Rabbani regime, there had been around 200 female staff working in Kabul&#x27;s Mullalai Hospital, yet barely 50 remained under the Taliban. NGOs operating in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 found the shortage of female health professionals to be a significant obstacle to their work.

The other exception to the employment ban allowed a reduced number of humanitarian workers to remain in service. The Taliban segregation codes meant that women were invaluable for gaining access to vulnerable women or conducting outreach research. This exception was not sanctioned by the entire Taliban movement, so instances of female participation, or lack thereof, varied with each circumstance. The city of Herat was particularly affected by Taliban adjustments to the treatment of women, as it had been one of the more cosmopolitan and outward-looking areas of Afghanistan prior to 1995. Women had previously been allowed to work in a limited range of jobs, but this was stopped by Taliban authorities. The new governor of Herat, Mullah Razzaq, issued orders for women to be forbidden to pass his office for fear of their distracting nature.

On 19 May 2022, the Taliban rulers ordered all female TV presenters to cover their faces on air. The directive came from the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which replaced the country&#x27;s Ministry of Women&#x27;s Affairs after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan.

In December 2022, the Taliban banned women from working in non-government organisations (NGOs), and ordered all such organisations to cease employment of female employees. This resulted in some NGOs being unable to continue their work in Afghanistan.

===Education===

==== First rule ====
The Taliban claimed to recognise their Islamic duty to offer education to both boys and girls, yet a decree was passed that banned girls above the age of 8 from receiving education. Maulvi Kalamadin insisted it was only a temporary suspension and that women would return to school and work once facilities and street security were adapted to prevent cross-gender contact. The Taliban wished to have total control of Afghanistan before calling upon an Ulema body to determine the content of a new curriculum to replace the Islamic yet unacceptable Mujahadin version.

The female employment ban was felt greatly in the education system. Within Kabul alone, the ruling affected 106,256 girls, 148,223 male students, and 8,000 female university undergraduates. 7,793 female teachers were dismissed, a move that crippled the provision of education and caused 63 schools to close due to a sudden lack of educators. Some women ran clandestine schools within their homes for local children, or for other women under the guise of sewing classes, such as the Golden Needle Sewing School. The learners, parents, and educators were aware of the consequences should the Taliban discover their activities, but for those who felt trapped under the strict Taliban rule, such actions allowed them an opportunity and a sense of self-determination and hope. The Undersecretary of Education Mawlawi Sa&#x27;id Shahidkhayl explained in 1998, that education for women was in need of a fatwa regarding its limits.

==== From 2021 to the present day ====
After their takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban initially gender segregated classrooms in universities as long as they &quot;followed Islamic standards&quot;. However, in September 2021, they only allowed boys to return to school, preventing most teenage girls from returning to secondary education. The ban did not affect primary schools, but girls&#x27; attendance in those schools appeared to also have fallen significantly.
In March 2022, the Taliban abruptly reversed their plans to allow girls to resume their secondary school education (defined as grade seven and upwards in Afghanistan). With the exception of the current cohort of university students, this decision leaves graduating from sixth grade as the highest level of educational attainment possible for Afghan women. Secondary schools for boys reopened on schedule. Pakistani Islamic scholars, including Taqi Usmani, urged the Taliban to re-open secondary schools for women.

On 20 December 2022, the Ministry of Higher Education informed the country&#x27;s public and private universities that women were suspended from university education. The ministry stated that female attendance would remain suspended &quot;until a suitable environment&quot; had been established at universities and promised that it would provide such a setting soon. However, BBC News pointed out that they had previously reneged on similar promises to reopen secondary education. Some Taliban leaders told &quot;BBC News&quot; that they disagreed with restrictions on female education. The Taliban decision was also widely condemned internationally. Some provinces still allow secondary education for girls despite the ban.

===Government===

On 17 August 2021, shortly after the Fall of Kabul, a senior member of the Taliban cultural commission, Enamullah Samangani, called on women to join the government. In contrast, in early September, the Taliban said that women would not be allowed to &quot;work in high-ranking posts&quot; in the government and &quot;ruled out&quot; women in the Cabinet. The acting Cabinet announced by the Taliban on 7 September consisted only of men.

===Health care===
Prior to the Taliban taking power in Afghanistan, male doctors had been allowed to treat women in hospitals, but the decree that no male doctor should be allowed to touch the body of a woman under the pretext of consultation was soon introduced. With fewer female health professionals in employment, the distances many women had to travel for attention increased while the provision of ante-natal clinics declined.

In Kabul, some women established informal clinics in their homes to service family and neighbours, yet as medical supplies were hard to obtain, their effectiveness was limited. Many women endured prolonged suffering or a premature death due to the lack of treatment. For those families that had the means, inclination, and mahram support, medical attention could be sought in Pakistan.

In October 1996, women were barred from accessing the traditional hammam, public baths, as the opportunities for socialising were ruled un-Islamic. These baths were an important facility in a nation where few possessed running water and the bar gave cause for the UN to predict a rise in scabies and vaginal infections among women denied methods of hygiene as well as access to health care. Nasrine Gross, an Afghan-American author, stated in 2001 that it has been four years since many Afghan women had been able to pray to their God as &quot;Islam prohibits women from praying without a bath after their periods&quot;. 

In June 1998, the Taliban banned women from attending general hospitals in the capital, whereas before they had been able to attend a women-only ward of general hospitals. This left only one hospital in Kabul at which they could seek treatment.

After the Taliban takeover, female healthcare workers reported safety issues and being harassed by the Taliban. Maternal health care conditions declined and many doctors reported that infant and child mortality had increased. 

In February 2023, the Taliban ordered pharmacies in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif to clear their stocks of birth control medicine.

====Ban on women&#x27;s participation in healthcare sector====
In December 2024, the Taliban&#x27;s health ministry banned women from being trained in nursing and midwifery, according to media reports confirmed by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. This was a reversal of an earlier February 2024 decision to permit basic medical training for women. According to &quot;NPR&quot;, the health ministry had lobbied for an exemption from the general ban on women&#x27;s education in the healthcare sector because &quot;in some provinces, the Taliban does not allow women to seek treatment from male medical professionals.&quot; The Taliban&#x27;s ban on basic medical training for women was widely condemned by human rights organizations as a danger to the health and well-being of Afghan women and children, with Afghanistan already having among the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world according to 2020 data, before the Taliban&#x27;s 2021 seizure of power. For example, Heather Barr of Human Right Watch stated: &quot;If you ban women from being treated by male healthcare professionals, and then you ban women from training to become healthcare professionals, the consequences are clear: women will not have access to healthcare and will die as a result.&quot; The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) stated that the ban &quot;is profoundly discriminatory, short-sighted and puts the lives of women and girls at risk in multiple ways.&quot;

===Forced confinement===
Family harmony was badly affected by mental stress, isolation and depression that often accompanied the forced confinement of women. A 1998 survey of 160 women residents or former residents of Kabul found that 97 per cent showed signs of serious depression and 71 per cent reported a decline in their physical well-being. Latifa, a Kabul resident and author, wrote:

The apartment resembles a prison or a hospital. Silence weighs heavily on all of us. As none of us do much, we haven&#x27;t got much to tell each other. Incapable of sharing our emotions, we each enclose ourselves in our own fear and distress. Since everyone is in the same black pit, there isn&#x27;t much point in repeating time and again that we can&#x27;t see clearly.

The Taliban closed the country&#x27;s beauty salons. Nail varnish and cosmetics were prohibited.

Taliban restrictions on the cultural presence of women covered several areas. Place names including the word &quot;women&quot; were modified so that the word was not used. Women were forbidden to laugh loudly as it was considered improper for a stranger to hear a woman&#x27;s voice. Women were prohibited from participating in sports or entering a sports club.

===Slavery of women===
In 2017, Taliban members were accused of sanctioning forced marriages, marital rape, and slavery of women.

==Punishments==

Punishments were often carried out publicly, either as formal spectacles held in sports stadiums or town squares or spontaneous street beatings. Civilians lived in fear of harsh penalties as there was little mercy; anyone caught breaking decrees were often treated with extreme violence. Examples include:

* In October 1996, a woman had the tip of her thumb cut off for wearing nail varnish.
* In December 1996, Radio Shari&#x27;a announced that 225 Kabul women had been seized and punished for violating the sharia code of dress. The sentence was handed down by a tribunal and the women were lashed on their legs and backs for their misdemeanor. A Taliban official reminded the women to cover their body completely, and to observe &quot;Hejab&quot; (seclusion of society) as mandated by the Sharia. In case of a violation, there would be no right for complaint. 
* In May 1997, five female CARE International employees with authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior to conduct research for an emergency feeding programme were forced from their vehicle by members of the religious police. The guards used a public address system to insult and harass the women before striking them with a metal and leather whip over 1.5 meters (almost 5 feet) in length.

* In 1999, a mother of five children was executed in front of 30,000 spectators in Kabul&#x27;s Ghazi Sport stadium for murdering her husband (see right). She was imprisoned for three years and extensively tortured prior to the execution, yet she refused to plead her innocence in a bid to protect her daughter (reportedly the actual culprit).
* When a Taliban raid discovered a woman running an informal school in her apartment, they beat the children and threw the woman down a flight of stairs (breaking her leg) and then imprisoned her. They threatened to stone her family publicly if she refused to sign a declaration of loyalty to the Taliban and their laws.
* An Afghan girl named Bibi Aisha was promised to a new family through a tribal method of solving disputes known as baad. When she fled the violence girls often suffer under baad, her new family found her, and a Taliban commander ordered her to be punished as an example, &quot;lest other girls in the village try to do the same thing&quot;. Her ears and nose were cut off and she was left for dead in the mountains, but survived.
* Working women are threatened into quitting their jobs. Failure to comply with the Taliban&#x27;s threats has led to women being shot and killed, as in the case of 22-year-old Hossai in July 2010.
*In 2013, Indian author Sushmita Banerjee was shot dead by Taliban militants for allegedly defying Taliban dictates. She was married to an Afghan businessman and had recently relocated to Afghanistan. Earlier, she had escaped two instances of execution by Taliban in 1995 and later fled to India. Her book based on her escape from Taliban was also filmed in an Indian movie.
* On 12 July 2021, a woman in Faryab Province was beaten to death by Taliban militants and her house was set alight because she would not cook for a group of their fighters.
* In August 2021, Afghan police reported that Taliban extremists had killed an Afghan woman in Balkh Province for wearing tight clothing and not being accompanied by a male relative. The Taliban denied the accusation and said they were investigating the incident.

Many punishments were carried out by individual militias without the sanction of Taliban authorities, as it was against official Taliban policy to punish women in the street. A more official line was the punishment of men for instances of female misconduct: a reflection of a patriarchal society and the belief that men are duty bound to control women. Maulvi Kalamadin stated in 1997, &quot;Since we cannot directly punish women, we try to use taxi drivers and shopkeepers as a means to pressure them&quot; to conform. Examples of punishment of men include:
* If a taxi driver picked up a woman with her face uncovered or unaccompanied by a mahram, then he faced a jail sentence, and the husband would be punished. 
* If a woman was caught washing clothes in a river then she would be escorted home by Islamic authorities where her husband/mahram would be severely punished.
* If a tailor was found taking female measurements, the tailor would face imprisonment.

Since the Taliban&#x27;s seizure of power in 2021, there have been many reports of sexual violence, rape, and torture of Afghan women in Taliban-run prisons, especially after the passage of &quot;anti-begging&quot; laws in 2024 resulted in larger numbers of women being detained. In one incident, &quot;&quot;The Guardian&quot; has seen video evidence of a female Afghan human rights activist being gang-raped and tortured in a Taliban jail by armed men.&quot;

==International response==

The protests of international agencies carried little weight with Taliban authorities, who gave precedence to their interpretation of Islamic law and did not feel bound by UN codes or human rights laws. After the Taliban takeover of Herat in 1995, the UN had hoped the gender policies would become more &#x27;moderate&#x27; &quot;as it matured from a popular uprising into a responsible government with linkages to the donor community&quot;. The Taliban refused to bow to international pressure and reacted calmly to aid suspensions.

* In November 1995, UNICEF suspended all aid to education in regions under Taliban control, as they argued the ban on mixing males and females in education was a breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In the aftermath of the 1995 Beijing Women&#x27;s Conference, this action moved to solidify UNICEF&#x27;s role as a leading agency in matters concerning women and children.
* In 1996, Save the Children (UK) also withdrew support as communication with women, the primary child carers, was most difficult.
* UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali expressed his concern regarding the status of Afghan women.
* In 1998, a detailed report by Physicians for Human Rights concluded in its executive summary: &quot;To PHR&#x27;s knowledge, no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment from showing their faces, seeking medical care without a male escort, or attending school. ... It is difficult to find another government or would-be government in the world that has deliberately created such poverty by arbitrarily depriving half the population under its control of jobs, schooling, mobility, and health care.&quot;
* In 1999, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright publicly stated &quot;We are speaking up on behalf of the women and girls of Afghanistan, who have been victimised...it is criminal and we each have a responsibility to stop it&quot;.

In January 2006, a London conference on Afghanistan led to the creation of an International Compact, which included benchmarks for the treatment of women. The Compact includes the following point: &quot;Gender:By end-1389 (20 March 2011): the National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan will be fully implemented; and, in line with Afghanistan&#x27;s MDGs, female participation in all Afghan governance institutions, including elected and appointed bodies and the civil service, will be strengthened.&quot; However, an Amnesty International report on 11 June 2008, declared that there needed to be &quot;no more empty promises&quot; with regard to Afghanistan, citing the treatment of women as one such unfulfilled goal.

In September 2021, Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister Imran Khan said that a ban on women&#x27;s education in Afghanistan would be un-Islamic, and he called for the leadership to be inclusive and respect human rights.

On 29 December 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the appointment of Rina Amiri as special envoy for Afghan women, girls, and human rights. The appointment came as women in the country were facing increased oppression by the ruling Taliban.

== Post-2021 takeover ==
In May 2022, the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice published a decree requiring all women in Afghanistan to wear full-body coverings when in public (either a burqa or an abaya paired with a niqāb, which leaves only the eyes uncovered). The decree said enforcement action including fines, prison time, or termination from government employment would be taken against male &quot;guardians&quot; who fail to ensure their female relatives abide by the law. Rights groups, including the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan, sharply criticised the decision. The decision is expected to adversely affect the Islamic Emirate&#x27;s chances of international recognition. In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, First Deputy Leader Sirajuddin Haqqani claimed the decree is only advisory and no form of hijab is compulsory in Afghanistan, though this contradicts the reality. It has been speculated that there is a genuine internal policy division over women&#x27;s rights between hardliners, including Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, and pragmatists, though they publicly present a united front.

In July 2022, the Taliban advised female employees in the country&#x27;s finance ministry to suggest a male relative to replace them so that the women could be dismissed from their positions. Up to 60 female employees reported receiving calls from the HR department requesting them to introduce a male family member to replace them.

In November 2022, women were banned from gyms, public baths, public parks, and amusement parks.

While Abdul Baqi Haqqani, the Minister for Higher Education until October 2022, was in favor of women being able to attend universities, his successor Neda Mohammad Nadeem opposes university education for women. 

In February 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the Taliban began to restrict access to contraceptives. They ordered pharmacies to clear their stocks of birth control medicine and threatened midwives. In Kabul, Taliban fighters stated that &quot;contraceptive use and family planning is a western agenda&quot;.

In March 2024, the Taliban&#x27;s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, announced that the group was reinstating flogging and death by stoning for women as punishment for adultery, saying, &quot;the Taliban&#x27;s work did not end with the takeover of Kabul, it has only just begun.&quot;

In August 2024, the Taliban issued laws banning the transportation of women traveling alone, and women and men who are not related to each other mixing. Also at the same time they issued laws stating women must always veil their bodies in public and that a face covering is necessary and clothing should never be short, thin, or tight. The laws issued then also stated women should veil themselves in front of all male strangers and all non-Muslims, and that women should not be heard reciting, singing, or reading out loud in public, as well as that women are forbidden to look at men they are not related to by blood or marriage and vice versa.

In January 2025, International Criminal Court issued two warrants against the Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and the Chief judge, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, for committing the crimes against humanity with the oppression and persecution of Afghan women and girls by depriving their freedom of movement, the rights to control their bodies, to education, and to a private and family life, whereas the alleged resistance and opposition are brutally suppressed with murder, imprisonment, torture, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, since 2021. ICC member states are obliged to arrest the wanted if they are on their territory.

<text>Theft (, cognate to ) is the act of taking another person&#x27;s property or services without that person&#x27;s permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. The word &quot;theft&quot; is also used as a synonym or informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as larceny, robbery, embezzlement, extortion, blackmail, or receiving stolen property. In some jurisdictions, &quot;theft&quot; is considered to be synonymous with &quot;larceny&quot;, while in others, &quot;theft&quot; is defined more narrowly. A person who engages in theft is known as a thief ( thieves).

&quot;Theft&quot; is the name of a statutory offence in California, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the Australian states of South Australia and Victoria.

==Elements==

The &quot;actus reus&quot; of theft is usually defined as an unauthorised taking, keeping, or using of another&#x27;s property which must be accompanied by a &quot;mens rea&quot; of dishonesty and the intent to permanently deprive the owner or rightful possessor of that property or its use.

For example, if X goes to a restaurant and, by mistake, takes Y&#x27;s scarf instead of her own, she has physically deprived Y of the use of the property (which is the &quot;actus reus&quot;) but the mistake prevents X from forming the &quot;mens rea&quot; (i.e., because she believes that she is the owner, she is not dishonest and does not intend to deprive the &quot;owner&quot; of it) so no crime has been committed at this point. But if she realises the mistake when she gets home and could return the scarf to Y, she will steal the scarf if she dishonestly keeps it (see theft by finding). Note that there may be civil liability for the torts of trespass to chattels or conversion in either eventuality.

==Psychology==

Possible causes for acts of theft include both economic and non-economic motivations. For example, an act of theft may be a response to the offender&#x27;s feelings of anger, grief, depression, anxiety, compulsion, boredom, power and control issues, low self-esteem, a sense of entitlement, an effort to conform or fit in with a peer group, or rebellion. Theft from work may be attributed to factors that include greed, perceptions of economic need, support of a drug addiction, a response to or revenge for work-related issues, rationalisation that the act is not actually one of stealing, response to opportunistic temptation, or the same emotional issues that may be involved in any other act of theft. Grotius and Pufendorf upheld the principle that a person in extreme and unavoidable need, who took from the surpluses of property holders, was not guilty of the crime of theft.

The most common reasons for shoplifting include participation in an organised shoplifting ring, opportunistic theft, compulsive acts of theft, thrill-seeking, and theft due to need. Studies focusing on shoplifting by teenagers suggest that minors shoplift for reasons including the novelty of the experience, peer pressure, the desire to obtain goods that a minor cannot legally purchase, and for economic reasons, as well as self-indulgence and rebellion against parents.

== Religious views ==

=== Buddhism ===
In Buddhism, one of the five precepts prohibits theft, and involves the intention to steal what one perceives as not belonging to oneself (&quot;what is not given&quot;) and acting successfully upon that intention. The severity of the act of theft is judged by the worth of the owner and the worth of that which is stolen. Underhand dealings, fraud, cheating and forgery are also included in this precept. Professions that are seen to violate the precept against theft are working in the gambling industry or marketing products that are not actually required for the customer.

=== Hinduism ===
The Manusmriti and the Dharmashastras deal with theft, coveting wealth, and punishment for these.

=== Islam ===
In parts of the world which govern with sharia law, the punishment for theft is amputation of the right hand if the thief does not repent. This ruling is derived from surah 5 verse 38 of the Quran which states &quot;As to the thief, Male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power.&quot; This is viewed as being a deterrent.

=== Judaism and Christianity ===
Two of the Ten Commandments prohibit acts of theft. The New Testament describes Jesus of Nazareth affirming these in his teachings.

==By jurisdiction==

===Australia===

====Actus reus====
South Australia

Theft is defined in section 134 of the &quot;Criminal Consolidation Act&quot; 1935 (SA) as being where a person deals with property dishonestly, without the owner&#x27;s consent and intending to deprive the owner of their property, or make a serious encroachment on the proprietary rights of the owner.

Under this law, encroachment on proprietary rights means that the property is dealt with in a way that creates a substantial risk that the property will not be returned to the owner, or that the value of the property will be greatly diminished when the owner does get it back. Also, where property is treated as the defendant&#x27;s own property to dispose of, disregarding the actual property owner&#x27;s rights.

For a basic offence, a person found guilty of this offence is liable for imprisonment of up to 10 years.

For an aggravated offence, a person found guilty of this offence is liable for imprisonment of up to 15 years.

Victoria

Theft is defined in the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; 1958 (Vic) as when a person &quot;dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.&quot;. The actus reus and mens rea are defined as follows:
Appropriation is defined in section 73(4) of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; 1958 (Vic) as the assumption of any of the owner&#x27;s rights. It does not have to be all the owner&#x27;s rights, as long as at least one right has been assumed. If the owner gave their consent to the appropriation there cannot be an appropriation. However, if this consent is obtained by deception, this consent is vitiated.

Property – defined in section 71(1) of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; 1958 (Vic) as being both tangible property, including money and intangible property. Information has been held not be property.

Belonging to another – section 73(5) of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; 1958 (Vic) provides that property belongs to another if that person has ownership, possession, or a proprietary interest in the property. Property can belong to more than one person. sections 73(9) &amp; 73(10) deal with situations where the accused receives property under an obligation or by mistake.

====Mens rea====

South Australia

Whether a person&#x27;s conduct is dishonest is a question of fact to be determined by the jury, based on their own knowledge and experience. As with the definition in Victoria, it contains definitions of what is not dishonesty, including a belief in a legal claim of right or a belief the owner could not be found.

Victoria

Intention to permanently deprive – defined at s.73(12) as treating property as it belongs to the accused, rather than the owner.

Dishonestly – section 73(2) of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; 1958 (Vic) creates a negative definition of the term &#x27;dishonestly&#x27;. The section deems only three circumstances when the accused is deemed to have been acting honestly. These are a belief in a legal claim of right, a belief that the owner would have consented, or a belief the owner could not be found.

===Canada===

Section 322(1) of the Criminal Code provides the general definition for theft in Canada:

Sections 323 to 333 provide for more specific instances and exclusions:

:* theft from oyster beds (s. 323)
:* theft by bailee of things under seizure (s. 324)
:* exception when agent is pledging goods (s. 325)
:* theft of telecommunications service (s. 326)
:* possession of device to obtain telecommunication facility or service (s. 327)
:* theft by or from person having special property or interest (s. 328)
:* theft by person required to account (s. 330)
:* theft by person holding power of attorney (s. 331)
:* misappropriation of money held under direction (s. 332)
:* exception for ore taken for exploration or scientific research (s. 333)

In the general definition above, the Supreme Court of Canada has construed &quot;anything&quot; very broadly, stating that it is not restricted to tangibles, but includes intangibles. To be the subject of theft it must, however:

:* be property of some sort;
:* be property capable of being
::* taken (therefore intangibles are excluded); or
::* converted (and may be an intangible);
::* taken or converted in a way that deprives the owner of his/her proprietary interest in some way.

Because of this, confidential information cannot be the subject of theft, as it is not capable of being taken as only tangibles can be taken. It cannot be converted, not because it is an intangible, but because, save in very exceptional far‑fetched circumstances, the owner would never be deprived of it. However, the theft of trade secrets in certain circumstances does constitute part of the offence of economic espionage, which can be prosecuted under s. 19 of the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot;.

For the purposes of punishment, Section 334 divides theft into two separate offences, according to the value and nature of the goods stolen:

:* If the thing stolen is worth more than $5000 or is a testamentary instrument the offence is commonly referred to as Theft Over $5000 and is an indictable offence with a maximum punishment of 10 years imprisonment.
:*Where the stolen item is not a testamentary instrument and is not worth more than $5000 it is known as Theft Under $5000 and is a hybrid offence, meaning that it can be treated either as an indictable offense or a less serious summary conviction offence, depending on the choice of the prosecutor.
::* if dealt with as an indictable offence, it is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, and,
::* if treated as a summary conviction offence, it is punishable by 6 months imprisonment, a fine of $2000 or both.

Where a motor vehicle is stolen, Section 333.1 provides for a maximum punishment of 10 years for an indictable offence (and a minimum sentence of six months for a third or subsequent conviction), and a maximum sentence of 18 months on summary conviction.

===Hong Kong===
Section 2 of the Theft Ordinance provides the general definition of theft in Hong Kong:
The elements of this offence in Hong Kong is almost the same as in England and Wales, because the Theft Ordinance in Hong Kong was drafted based on the Theft Act 1968 (and the Theft Act 1978) in UK. However, the &quot;Ghosh Test&quot; for dishonest in Hong Kong has been replaced by the &quot;Ivey Test&quot; in England and Wales by the Supreme Court. It is the main difference between the offence of theft in these two jurisdictions.

===India===
Theft is a criminal activity in India with punishments which may lead to jail term. Below are excerpts of laws of Indian penal Code which state definitions and punishments for theft.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, theft is a statutory offence, created by section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. This offence replaces the former offences of larceny, embezzlement and fraudulent conversion.

The marginal note to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 describes it as a &quot;basic definition&quot; of theft. Sections 1(1) and (2) provide:

:1.-(1) A person is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and &quot;thief&quot; and &quot;steal&quot; shall be construed accordingly.
:(2) It is immaterial whether the appropriation is made with a view to gain, or is made for the thief’s own benefit.

Sections 2 to 6 of the Theft Act 1968 have effect as regards the interpretation and operation of section 1 of that Act. Except as otherwise provided by that Act, sections 2 to 6 of that Act apply only for the purposes of section 1 of that Act.

=====Appropriates=====
Section 3 provides:

See R v Hinks and Lawrence v Metropolitan Police Commissioner.

=====Property=====
Section 4(1) provides that:

Edward Griew said that section 4(1) could, without changing its meaning, be reduced, by omitting words, to:

Sections 4(2) to (4) provide that the following can only be stolen under certain circumstances:
* Land or things forming part of land and severed from it (s. 4(2))
* Mushrooms growing wild on any land, or the flowers, fruit or foliage of plants growing wild on any land (s. 4(3))
* Wild creatures or the carcases of wild creatures (s. 4(4))

Intangible property

Confidential information and trade secrets are not property within the meaning of section 4.

The words &quot;other intangible property&quot; include export quotas that are transferable for value on a temporary or permanent basis.

Electricity

Electricity cannot be stolen. It is not property within the meaning of section 4 and is not appropriated by switching on a current. &quot;Cf.&quot; the offence of abstracting electricity under section 13.

=====Belonging to another=====
Section 5 &quot;belonging to another&quot; requires a distinction to be made between ownership, possession and control:
* ownership is where a person is not legally accountable to anyone else for the use of the property:
* possession is where a person is only accountable to the owner for the use of the property; and
* control is where a person is only accountable to two people for the use of the property.

So if A buys a car for cash, A will be the owner. If A then lends the car to B Ltd (a company), B Ltd will have possession. C, an employee of B Ltd then uses the car and has control. If C uses the car in an unauthorised way, C will steal the car from A and B Ltd. This means that it is possible to steal one&#x27;s own property.

In R v Turner, the owner removed his car from the forecourt of a garage where it had been left for collection after repair. He intended to avoid paying the bill. There was an appropriation of the car because it had been physically removed but there were two issues to be decided:
* did the car &quot;belong to another&quot;? The garage had a lien i.e. a &quot;proprietary right or interest&quot; in the car as security for the unpaid bill and this gave the garage a better right than the owner to possess the car at the relevant time.
* what was the relevance of Turner&#x27;s belief that he could not steal his own property? The defence of mistake of law only applies if the defendant honestly believes that he has a right in law to act in the given way. Generalised and non-specific beliefs about what the law might permit are not a defence.

=====With the intention of permanently depriving the other of it=====
Section 6 &quot;with the intent to permanently deprive the other of it&quot; is sufficiently flexible to include situations where the property is later returned.

Alternative verdict

The offense created by section 12(1) of the Theft Act 1968 (TWOC) is available an alternative verdict on an indictment for theft.

Visiting forces

Theft is an offence against property for the purposes of section 3 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952.

Mode of trial and sentence

Theft is triable either way. A person guilty of theft is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.

Aggravated theft

The only offence of aggravated theft is robbery, contrary to section 8 of the Theft Act 1968.

Stolen goods

For the purposes of the provisions of the Theft Act 1968 which relate to stolen goods, goods obtain in England or Wales or elsewhere by blackmail or fraud are regarded as stolen, and the words &quot;steal&quot;, &quot;theft&quot; and &quot;thief&quot; are construed accordingly.

Sections 22 to 24 and 26 to 28 of the Theft Act 1968 contain references to stolen goods.

Handling stolen goods

The offence of handling stolen goods, contrary to section 22(1) of the Theft Act 1968, can only be committed &quot;otherwise than in the course of stealing&quot;.

Similar or associated offences

According to its title, the Theft Act 1968 revises the law as to theft and similar or associated offences. See also the Theft Act 1978.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, theft is a statutory offence, created by section 1 of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.

===United States===
In the United States, crimes must be prosecuted in the jurisdiction in which they occurred. Although federal and state jurisdiction may overlap, even when a criminal act violates both state and federal law, in most cases only the most serious offenses are prosecuted at the federal level.

The federal government has criminalised certain narrow categories of theft that directly affect federal agencies or interstate commerce. The Model Penal Code, promulgated by the American Law Institute to help state legislatures update and standardise their laws, includes categories of theft by unlawful taking or by unlawfully disposing of property, theft by deception (fraud), theft by extortion, theft by failure to take measures to return lost or mislaid or mistakenly delivered property, theft by receipt of stolen property, theft by failing to make agreed disposition of received funds, and theft of services.

Although many U.S. states have retained larceny as the primary offense, some have now adopted theft provisions.

Grand theft, also called &quot;grand larceny&quot;, is a term used throughout the United States designating theft that is large in magnitude or serious in potential penological consequences. Grand theft is contrasted with petty theft, also called petit theft, that is of smaller magnitude or lesser seriousness.

Theft laws, including the distinction between grand theft and petty theft for cases falling within its jurisdiction, vary by state. This distinction is established by statute, as are the penological consequences. Most commonly, statutes establishing the distinction between grand theft and petty theft do so on the basis of the value of the money or property taken by the thief or lost by the victim, with the dollar threshold for grand theft varying from state to state. Most commonly, the penological consequences of the distinction include the significant one that grand theft can be treated as a felony, while petty theft is generally treated as a misdemeanor.

In some states, grand theft of a vehicle may be charged as &quot;grand theft auto&quot; (see motor vehicle theft for more information).

Repeat offenders who continue to steal may become subject to life imprisonment in certain states.

Sometimes the federal anti-theft-of-government-property law is used to prosecute cases where the Espionage Act would otherwise be involved, the theory being that by retaining sensitive information, the defendant has taken a &#x27;thing of value&#x27; from the government. For examples, see the Amerasia case and &quot;United States v. Manning&quot;.

==== Alabama ====
When stolen property exceeds the amount of $500 it is a felony offense. If property is less than $500, then it is a Class A misdemeanor. Unlike some other states, shoplifting is not defined by a separate statute but falls under the state&#x27;s general theft statute.

====Alaska====
The Alaska State Code does not use the terms &quot;grand theft&quot; or &quot;grand larceny&quot;. However, it specifies that theft of property valued at more than $1,000 is a felony whereas thefts of lesser amounts are misdemeanors. The felony categories (class 1 and class 2 theft) also include theft of firearms; property taken from the person of another; vessel or aircraft safety or survival equipment; and of access devices.

====Arizona====
Felony theft is committed when the value of the stolen property exceeds $1000. Regardless of the value of the item, if it is a firearm or an animal taken for the purpose of animal fighting, then the theft is a Class 6 Felony.

====California====
The Theft Act of 1927 consolidated a variety of common law crimes into theft. The state now distinguishes between two types of theft, grand theft and petty theft. The older crimes of embezzlement, larceny, and stealing, and any preexisting references to them now fall under the theft statute.

There are a number of criminal statutes in the California Penal Code defining grand theft in different amounts. Grand theft generally consists of the theft of something of value over $950 (including money, labor or property but is lower with respect to various specified property), Theft is also considered grand theft when more than $250 in crops or marine life forms are stolen, “when the property is taken from the person of another,” or when the property stolen is an automobile, farm animal, or firearm.

Petty theft is the default category for all other thefts.

Grand theft is punishable by up to a year in jail or prison, and may be charged (depending upon the circumstances) as a misdemeanor or felony, while petty theft is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or imprisonment not exceeding six months in jail or both.

====Florida====
In general, any property taken that carries a value of more than $750 can be considered grand theft in certain circumstances.

====Georgia====
In Georgia, when a theft offense involves property valued at $500 or less, the crime is punishable as a misdemeanor. Any theft of property determined to be exceeding $500 may be treated as grand theft and charged as a felony.

====Hawaii====
Theft in the first or second degree is a felony. Theft in the first degree means theft above $20,000 or of a firearm or explosive; or theft over $300 during a declared emergency. Theft in the second degree means theft above $750, theft from the person of another, or agricultural products over $100 or aquacultural products from an enclosed property.

====Illinois====
Theft is a felony if the value of the property exceeds $300 or the property is stolen from the person of another. Thresholds at $10,000, $100,000, and $500,000 determine how severe the punishment can be. The location from which property was stolen is also a factor in sentencing.

====Kentucky====
KRS 514.030 states that theft by unlawful taking or disposition is generally a Class A misdemeanor unless the items stolen are a firearm, anhydrous ammonia, a controlled substance valued at less than $10,000 or any other item or combination of items valued $500 or higher and less than $10,000 in which case the theft is a Class D felony. Theft of items valued at $10,000 or higher and less than $1,000,000 is a Class C felony. Theft of items valued at $1,000,000 or more is a Class B felony, as is first offense theft of anhydrous ammonia for the express purpose of manufacturing methamphetamines in violation of KRS 218A.1432. In the latter case, subsequent offenses are a Class A felony.

====Massachusetts====
In Massachusetts, theft may generally be charged as a felony if the value of stolen property is greater than $250.

====Missouri====
Stealing is a felony if the value of stolen property exceeds $500. It is also a felony if &quot;The actor physically takes the property appropriated from the person of the victim&quot; or the stolen property is a vehicle, legal document, credit card, firearm, explosive, U.S. flag on display, livestock animal, fish with value exceeding $75, captive wildlife, controlled substance, or anhydrous ammonia. Stealing in excess of $25,000 is usually a class B felony (sentence: 5–15 years), while any other felony stealing (not including the felonies of burglary or robbery) that does not involve chemicals is a class C felony (sentence: up to 7 years). Non-felony stealing is a class A misdemeanor (sentence: up to 1 year).

====New York====
Grand larceny consists of stealing property with a value exceeding $1000; or stealing a public record, secret scientific material, firearm, credit or debit card, ammonia, telephone with service, or motor vehicle or religious item with value exceeding $100; or stealing from the person of another or by extortion or from an ATM. The degree of grand larceny is increased if the theft was from an ATM, through extortion involving fear, or involved a value exceeding the thresholds of $3,000, $50,000, or $1,000,000.

====Vermont====
Grand Larceny:
Value of goods exceed $900 (13 V.S.A. § 2501)

====Virginia====
Grand Larceny:
Value of goods exceed $1000 (Virginia Code § 18.2-95)

====Washington State====
Theft of goods valued between $750 and $5000 is second-degree theft, a Class C felony. Theft of goods valued above $5000, of a search-and-rescue dog on duty, of public records from a public office or official, of metal wire from a utility, or of an access device, is a Class B felony, as is theft of
a motor vehicle 
or a firearm.

===West Indies===
In the British West Indies, especially Grenada, there have been a spate of large-scale thefts of tons of sand from beaches. Both Grenada and Jamaica are considering increasing fines and jail time for the thefts.

===Statistics===
The following are countries with their respective rates of theft per 100,000 people, according to the United Nations in last available year. Such statistics are difficult to compare usefully because of large variations in the proportion of thefts reported to police, and how reported crimes are statistically compiled.

<text>Thomas Bowdler (; 11 July 1754 – 24 February 1825) was an English physician known for publishing &quot;The Family Shakespeare&quot;, an expurgated edition of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays edited by his sister Henrietta Maria Bowdler. The two sought a version they saw as more appropriate than the original for 19th-century women and children. Bowdler also published works reflecting an interested knowledge of continental Europe. His last work was an expurgation of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, published posthumously in 1826 under the supervision of his nephew and biographer, Thomas Bowdler the Younger. From his name derives the eponym verb &quot;bowdlerise&quot; or &quot;bowdlerize&quot;, meaning &quot;to expurgate&quot; or &quot;to censor something&quot; through the omission of elements deemed unsuited to children in literature and films and on television.

==Biography==
Thomas Bowdler was born on 11 July 1754, in Box, near Bath, Somerset, the youngest son of the six children of Thomas Bowdler (c. 1719–1785), a banker of substantial fortune, and his wife, Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Cotton (d. 1797), the daughter of Sir John Cotton, 6th Baronet of Conington, Huntingdonshire. Bowdler studied medicine at the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh, where he received his degree in 1776, graduating with a thesis on intermittent fevers. He then spent four years travelling in continental Europe, visiting the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary, Italy, Sicily and Portugal. In 1781 he caught a fever in Lisbon from a young friend whom he was attending through a fatal illness. He returned to England in broken health and with a strong aversion to the medical profession. In 1781 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) and a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP), but he did not continue to practise medicine. He devoted himself instead to the cause of prison reform.

Bowdler was a strong chess player and once played eight recorded games against the best chess player of the time, François-André Danican Philidor, who was so confident of his superiority that he played with several handicaps. Bowdler won twice, lost three times, and drew three times. The Bowdler Attack is named after him.
Bowdler&#x27;s first published work was &quot;Letters Written in Holland in the Months of September and October 1787&quot; (1788), giving an eye-witness account of the Prussian invasion of Holland. In 1800 Bowdler took a lease on a country estate at St Boniface, on the Isle of Wight, where he lived for ten years. In September 1806, aged 52, he married Elizabeth Trevenen (née Farquharson), aged 48, widow of a naval Captain James Trevenen, who had died in Catherine the Great&#x27;s service at Kronstadt in 1790. The marriage was unhappy and after a few years they separated. They had no children. After the separation, the marriage was never mentioned in the Bowdler family. The biography of Bowdler by his nephew, Thomas Bowdler, makes no mention of him ever marrying.

In 1807, the first edition of the Bowdlers&#x27; &quot;The Family Shakspeare&quot;, covering 20 plays, appeared in four small volumes. From 1811 until his death in 1825, Bowdler lived at Rhyddings House, overlooking Swansea Bay, from where he travelled extensively in Britain and Europe. In 1815, he published &quot;Observations on Emigration to France, With an Account of Health, Economy, and the Education of Children&quot;, a cautionary work propounding his view that English invalids should avoid French spas and go instead to Malta. In 1818, Bowdler published an expanded edition of &quot;The Family Shakspeare&quot;, covering all 36 available plays. This had much success. By 1827 the work was in its fifth edition. In his last years, Bowdler prepared an expurgated version of the works of the historian Edward Gibbon, which was published posthumously in 1826. His sister Jane Bowdler (1743–1784) was a poet and essayist. Another sister, Henrietta Maria Bowdler (Harriet) (1750–1830), collaborated with Bowdler on his expurgated Shakespeare.

Bowdler, at aged 70, died at Rhyddings near Swansea on 24 February 1825, and was buried at Oystermouth. He left bequests to the poor of Swansea and Box. His large library of unexpurgated volumes of 17th and 18th century tracts, collected by his ancestors Thomas Bowdler (1638–1700) and Thomas Bowdler (1661–1738), was donated to the University of Wales, Lampeter. In 1825 Bowdler&#x27;s nephew, also a Thomas Bowdler, published &quot;Memoir of the Late John Bowdler, Esq., to Which Is Added, Some Account of the Late Thomas Bowdler, Esq. Editor of the Family Shakspeare&quot;.

==&quot;The Family Shakespeare&quot;==

In Bowdler&#x27;s childhood, his father had entertained his family with readings from Shakespeare. Later in life, Bowdler realised his father had been omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children. Bowdler felt it was worthwhile to publish an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not such a &quot;circumspect and judicious reader&quot; as to accomplish an expurgation himself.

In 1807, the first edition of &quot;The Family Shakspeare&quot; appeared in four duodecimo volumes, containing 24 plays. In 1818 a second edition ensued covering all 36 available plays. Each play has an introduction where Bowdler summarises and justifies his textual changes. According to his nephew&#x27;s &quot;Memoir,&quot; the first edition was prepared by Bowdler&#x27;s sister Harriet, but both appeared under Thomas Bowdler&#x27;s name, probably because a woman would then be reluctant to admit publicly that she could do such work or even understand Shakespeare&#x27;s racy verses. By 1850 eleven editions had appeared.

The spelling &quot;Shakspeare&quot;, used by Bowdler and by his nephew Thomas in his memoir of Thomas Bowdler the elder, was changed in later editions (from 1847 on) to &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, reflecting general spelling of Shakespeare&#x27;s name.

The Bowdlers were not the first to undertake such a project, but Bowdler&#x27;s commitment not to augment or add to Shakespeare&#x27;s text, merely remove sensitive material, contrasted with earlier practice. Nahum Tate as Poet Laureate had rewritten the tragedy of &quot;King Lear&quot; with a happy ending; in 1807, Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb published &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot; for children with synopses of 20 of the plays, but seldom quoted the original text. Though &quot;The Family Shakespeare&quot; was seen as a negative example of censorship by the literary establishment and its commitment to &quot;authentic&quot; Shakespeare, the Bowdler editions made it more acceptable to teach Shakespeare to wider and younger audiences. According to the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, &quot;More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of Bowdler. No man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children.&quot;

===Changes===
Bowdler lent his name to the English verb bowdlerise, which means &quot;to remove words or sections from a book or other work that are considered unsuitable or offensive&quot;. The derivative noun is bowdlerism. Some examples of alterations made by Bowdler&#x27;s edition:
* In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the death of Ophelia was called an accidental drowning, not a possibly intended suicide.
* &quot;God!&quot; as an exclamation is replaced with &quot;Heavens!&quot;
* In &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, the prostitute Doll Tearsheet is omitted outright, the slightly more reputable Mistress Quickly retained.

Prominent modern figures such as Michiko Kakutani (in &quot;The New York Times&quot;) and William Safire (in his book &quot;How Not to Write&quot;) have incorrectly accused Bowdler of changing Lady Macbeth&#x27;s famous &quot;Out, damned spot!&quot; line in &quot;Macbeth&quot; to &quot;Out, crimson spot!&quot;, when in fact this particular emendation was the work of Thomas Bulfinch and Stephen Bulfinch, in their 1865 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

<doc id="31292" wikidata="Q160128" url="?curid=31292" title="Treason">
<text>Treason is the crime of attacking a state authority to which one owes allegiance. This typically includes acts such as participating in a war against one&#x27;s native country, attempting to overthrow its government, spying on its military, its diplomats, or its secret services for a hostile and foreign power, or attempting to kill its head of state. A person who commits treason is known in law as a traitor.

Historically, in common law countries, treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant. Treason (i.e., disloyalty) against one&#x27;s monarch was known as &quot;high treason&quot; and treason against a lesser superior was &quot;petty treason&quot;. As jurisdictions around the world abolished petty treason, &quot;treason&quot; came to refer to what was historically known as high treason.

At times, the term &quot;traitor&quot; has been used as a political epithet, regardless of any verifiable treasonable action. In a civil war or insurrection, the winners may deem the losers to be traitors. Likewise the term &quot;traitor&quot; is used in heated political discussiontypically as a slur against political dissidents, or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the (stab-in-the-back myth), the accusation of treason towards a large group of people can be a unifying political message.

==History==
Frederic William Maitland explained that &quot;Treason is a crime which has a vague circumference and more than one centre&quot;.

The Treason Act of 1351, called &quot;the pole star of English jurisprudence&quot; by Joseph Story, was the first time treason was defined by statute. During the 12th century the rights of the king were gradually set apart from the other nobles. Beginning with the reign of Edward I the Crown asserted its authority to recognize rebellions (&quot;levying war&quot;) as treasonous.

By the Elizabethan age courts had shed the restrictions of statutory treason in favor of constructive treason applied as a form of political control. Edward Coke decides in &quot;R v Owen&quot; that mere speech about the monarch could be treason if it &quot;disabled his title&quot; in departure from his earlier statement &quot;it is commonly said that bare words may make a heretick, but not a traytor without an overt act&quot;.

In English law, high treason was punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered (men) or burnt at the stake (women), although beheading could be substituted by royal command (usually for royalty and nobility). Those penalties were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively. The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors. Many of them would now just be considered dissidents.

The words &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;traitor&quot; are derived from the Latin &quot;tradere&quot;, &quot;to deliver or hand over&quot;. Specifically, it is derived from the term &quot;traditors&quot;, which refers to bishops and other Christians who turned over sacred scriptures or betrayed their fellow Christians to the Roman authorities under threat of persecution during the Diocletianic Persecution between AD 303 and 305.

Originally, the crime of treason was conceived of as being committed against the monarch; a subject failing in his duty of loyalty to the sovereign and acting against the sovereign was deemed to be a traitor. Queens Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were executed for treason for adultery against Henry VIII, although most historians regard the evidence against Anne Boleyn and her alleged lovers to be dubious. As asserted in the 18th century trial of Johann Friedrich Struensee in Denmark, a man having sexual relations with a queen can be considered guilty not only of ordinary adultery but also of treason against her husband, the king.

The English Revolution in the 17th century and the French Revolution in the 18th century introduced a radically different concept of loyalty and treason, under which sovereignty resides with &quot;The Nation&quot; or &quot;The People&quot; – to whom also the monarch has a duty of loyalty, and for failing which the monarch, too, could be accused of treason. Charles I in England and Louis XVI in France were found guilty of such treason and duly executed. However, when Charles II was restored to his throne, he considered the revolutionaries who sentenced his father to death as having been traitors in the more traditional sense.

In medieval times, most treason cases were in the context of a kingdom&#x27;s internal politics. Though helping a foreign monarch against one&#x27;s own sovereign would also count as treason, such were only a minority among treason cases. Conversely, in modern times, &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;treason&quot; are mainly used with reference to a person helping an enemy in time of war or conflict.

During the American Revolution, a slave named Billy was sentenced to death on charges of treason to Virginia for having joined the British in their war against the American colonists – but was eventually pardoned by Thomas Jefferson, then Governor of Virginia. Jefferson accepted the argument, put forward by Billy&#x27;s well-wishers, that – not being a citizen and not enjoying any of the benefits of being one – Billy owed no loyalty to Virginia and therefore had committed no treason. This was a ground-breaking case, since in earlier similar cases slaves were found guilty of treason and executed.

Under very different circumstances, a similar defense was put forward in the case of William Joyce, nicknamed &quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;, who had broadcast Nazi propaganda to the UK from Germany during the Second World War. Joyce&#x27;s defence team, appointed by the court, argued that, as an American citizen and naturalised German, Joyce could not be convicted of treason against the British Crown. However, the prosecution successfully argued that, since he had incorrectly stated his nationality to obtain a British passport and voted in Britain, Joyce did owe allegiance to the king. Thus, Joyce was convicted of treason, and was eventually hanged.

After Napoleon fell from power for the first time, Marshal Michel Ney swore allegiance to the restored King Louis XVIII, but when the Emperor escaped from Elba, Ney resumed his Napoleonic allegiance, and commanded the French troops at the Battle of Waterloo. After Napoleon was defeated, dethroned, and exiled for the second time in the summer of 1815, Ney was arrested and tried for treason by the Chamber of Peers. In order to save Ney&#x27;s life, his lawyer André Dupin argued that as Ney&#x27;s hometown of Sarrelouis had been annexed by Prussia according to the Treaty of Paris of 1815, Ney was now a Prussian, no longer owing allegiance to the King of France and therefore not liable for treason in a French court. Ney ruined his lawyer&#x27;s effort by interrupting him and stating: &quot;Je suis Français et je resterai Français!&quot; (I am French and I will remain French!). Having refused that defence, Ney was duly found guilty of treason and executed.

Until the late 19th century, Britain – like various other countries – held to a doctrine of &quot;perpetual allegiance to the sovereign&quot;, dating back to feudal times, under which British subjects, owing loyalty to the British monarch, remained such even if they emigrated to another country and took its citizenship. This became a hotly debated issue in the aftermath of the 1867 Fenian Rising, when Irish-Americans who had gone to Ireland to participate in the uprising and were caught were charged with treason, as the British authorities considered them to be British subjects. This outraged many Irish-Americans, to which the British responded by pointing out that, just like British law, American law also recognized perpetual allegiance. As a result, Congress passed the Expatriation Act of 1868, which granted Americans the right to freely renounce their U.S. citizenship. Britain followed suit with a similar law, and years later, signed a treaty agreeing to treat British subjects who had become U.S. citizens as no longer holding British nationality – and thus no longer liable to a charge of treason.

Many nations&#x27; laws mention various types of treason. &quot;Crimes Related to Insurrection&quot; is the internal treason, and may include a coup d&#x27;état. &quot;Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression&quot; is the treason of cooperating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. &quot;Crimes Related to Inducement of Foreign Aggression&quot; is the crime of communicating with aliens secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. Depending on the country, conspiracy is added to these.

==In individual jurisdictions==
===Australia===
In Australia, there are federal and state laws against treason, specifically in the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Similarly to Treason laws in the United States, citizens of Australia owe allegiance to their sovereign at the federal and state level.

The federal law defining treason in Australia is provided under section 80.1 of the Criminal Code, contained in the schedule of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. It defines treason as follows:

A person is not guilty of treason under paragraphs (e), (f) or (h) if their assistance or intended assistance is purely humanitarian in nature.

The maximum penalty for treason is life imprisonment. Section 80.1AC of the Act creates the related offence of treachery.

====New South Wales====
The Treason Act 1351, the Treason Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1817 form part of the law of New South Wales. The Treason Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1817 have been repealed by Section 11 of the Crimes Act 1900, except in so far as they relate to the compassing, imagining, inventing, devising, or intending death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim, or wounding, imprisonment, or restraint of the person of the heirs and successors of King George III the United Kingdom, and the expressing, uttering, or declaring of such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them.

Section 12 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) creates an offence which is derived from section 3 of the Treason Felony Act 1848:

Section 16 provides that nothing in Part 2 repeals or affects anything enacted by the Treason Act 1351 (25 Edw.3 c. 2). This section reproduces section 6 of the Treason Felony Act 1848.

====Victoria====
The offence of treason was created by section 9A(1) of the Crimes Act 1958. It is punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

====South Australia====
In South Australia, treason is defined under Section 7 of the South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 and punished under Section 10A. Any person convicted of treason against South Australia will receive a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.

===Brazil===
According to Brazilian law, treason is the crime of disloyalty by a citizen to the Federal Republic of Brazil, applying to combatants of the Brazilian military forces. Treason during wartime is the only crime for which a person can be sentenced to death &quot;(see capital punishment in Brazil)&quot;.

The only military person in the history of Brazil to be convicted of treason was Carlos Lamarca, an army captain who deserted to become the leader of a communist-terrorist guerrilla against the military government.

===Canada===
Section 46 of the Criminal Code has two degrees of treason, called &quot;high treason&quot; and &quot;treason&quot;. However, both of these belong to the historical category of high treason, as opposed to petty treason which does not exist in Canadian law. Section 46 reads as follows:
High treason
(1) Every one commits high treason who, in Canada,
:(a) kills or attempts to kill His Majesty, or does him any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maims or wounds him, or imprisons or restrains him;
:(b) levies war against Canada or does any act preparatory thereto; or
:(c) assists an enemy at war with Canada, or any armed forces against whom Canadian Forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between Canada and the country whose forces they are.
Treason
 (2) Every one commits treason who, in Canada,
:(a) uses force or violence for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Canada or a province;
:(b) without lawful authority, communicates or makes available to an agent of a state other than Canada, military or scientific information or any sketch, plan, model, article, note or document of a military or scientific character that he knows or ought to know may be used by that state for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or defence of Canada;
:(c) conspires with any person to commit high treason or to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a);
:(d) forms an intention to do anything that is high treason or that is mentioned in paragraph (a) and manifests that intention by an overt act; or
:(e) conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) or forms an intention to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) and manifests that intention by an overt act.
It is also illegal for a Canadian citizen or a person who owes allegiance to His Majesty in right of Canada to do any of the above outside Canada.

The penalty for high treason is life imprisonment. The penalty for treason is currently imprisonment up to a maximum of life, or up to 14 years for conduct under subsection (2)(b) or (e) in peacetime. Historically however at least one Canadian, Louis Riel, was executed after what was arguably his second act of treason in 1885.

=== China ===
In China, there are different laws regarding treason in Mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. The law defining treason in mainland China is provided under article 102 of the Criminal Law as follows:Whoever colludes with a foreign State to endanger the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the People&#x27;s Republic of China shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 10 years.

==== Hong Kong ====
Section 10 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance provides that:A Chinese citizen who—

: (a) joins an external armed force that is at war with China, or is a part of the armed force;
: (b) with intent to prejudice the situation of China in a war, assists an enemy at war with China in a war,
: (c) levies war against China;
: (d) instigates a foreign country or an external armed force to invade China with force; or
: (e) with intent to endanger the sovereignty, unity or territorial integrity of China, uses force or threatens to use force,

commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to life imprisonment.where &quot;enemy at war with China&quot; is defined as a government of a foreign country or external armed force that is at war with China and &quot;external armed force&quot; means an armed force that does not belong to China.

Section 11 of the same ordinance also provides that:A Chinese citizen who intends to commit an offence under section 10(1) and publicly manifests such intention commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 14 years.

===Finland===
Finnish law distinguishes between two types of treasonable offences: &quot;maanpetos&quot;, treachery in war, and &quot;valtiopetos&quot;, an attack against the constitutional order. The terms &quot;maanpetos&quot; and &quot;valtiopetos&quot; are unofficially translated as treason and high treason, respectively. Both are punishable by imprisonment, and if aggravated, by life imprisonment.

&quot;Maanpetos&quot; (translates literally to &quot;betrayal of land&quot;) consists in joining enemy armed forces, making war against Finland, or serving or collaborating with the enemy. &quot;Maanpetos&quot; proper can only be committed under conditions of war or the threat of war. Espionage, disclosure of a national secret, and certain other related offences are separately defined under the same rubric in the Finnish criminal code.

&quot;Valtiopetos&quot; (translates literally to &quot;betrayal of state&quot;) consists in using violence or the threat of violence, or unconstitutional means, to bring about the overthrow of the Finnish constitution or to overthrow the president, cabinet or parliament or to prevent them from performing their functions.

===France===

Article 411-1 of the French criminal code defines treason as follows:
The acts defined by articles 411-2 to 411–11 constitute treason where they are committed by a French national or a soldier in the service of France, and constitute espionage where they are committed by any other person.

Article 411-2 prohibits &quot;handing over troops belonging to the French armed forces, or all or part of the national territory, to a foreign power, to a foreign organisation or to an organisation under foreign control, or to their agents&quot;. It is punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of €750,000. Generally parole is not available until 18 years of a life sentence have elapsed.

Articles 411–3 to 411–10 define various other crimes of collaboration with the enemy, sabotage, and the like. These are punishable with imprisonment for between seven and 30 years. Article 411-11 make it a crime to incite any of the above crimes.

Besides treason and espionage, there are many other crimes dealing with national security, insurrection, terrorism and so on. These are all to be found in Book IV of the code.

===Germany===
German law differentiates between two types of treason: &quot;High treason&quot; (&quot;Hochverrat&quot;) and &quot;treason&quot; (&quot;Landesverrat&quot;). High treason, as defined in Section 81 of the German criminal code is defined as an attempt against the existence or the constitutional order of the Federal Republic of Germany that is carried out either with the use of violence or the threat of violence. It carries a penalty of life imprisonment or a fixed term of at least ten years. In less serious cases, the penalty is 1–10 years in prison. German criminal law also criminalises high treason against a German state. Preparation of either types of the crime is criminal and carries a penalty of up to five years.

The other type of treason, &quot;Landesverrat&quot; is defined in Section 94. It is roughly equivalent to espionage; more precisely, it consists of betraying a secret either directly to a foreign power, or to anyone not allowed to know of it; in the latter case, treason is only committed if the aim of the crime was explicitly to damage the Federal Republic or to favor a foreign power. The crime carries a penalty of one to fifteen years in prison. However, in especially severe cases, life imprisonment or any term of at least five years may be sentenced.

As for many crimes with substantial threats of punishment active repentance is to be considered in mitigation under §83a StGB (Section 83a, Criminal Code).

Notable cases involving &quot;Landesverrat&quot; are the Weltbühne trial during the Weimar Republic and the Spiegel scandal of 1962. On 30. July 2015, Germany&#x27;s Public Prosecutor General Harald Range initiated criminal investigation proceedings against the German blog netzpolitik.org.

=== Ireland ===

Article 39 of the Constitution of Ireland (adopted in 1937) states:

treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.

Following the enactment of the 1937 constitution, the Treason Act 1939 provided for imposition of the death penalty for treason. The Criminal Justice Act 1990 abolished the death penalty, setting the punishment for treason at life imprisonment, with parole in not less than forty years. No person has been charged under the Treason Act. Irish republican legitimatists who refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the Republic of Ireland have been charged with lesser crimes under the Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998.

=== India ===
The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita has described treason in Section 147, which states thatWhoever wages war against the Government of India, or attempts to wage such war, or abets the waging of such war, shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine.

===Italy===

The Italian law defines various types of crimes that could be generally described as treason (&quot;tradimento&quot;), although they are so many and so precisely defined that no one of them is simply called &quot;tradimento&quot; in the text of &quot;Codice Penale&quot; (Italian Criminal Code). The treason-type crimes are grouped as &quot;crimes against the personhood of the State&quot; (&quot;Crimini contro la personalità dello Stato&quot;) in the Second Book, First Title, of the Criminal Code.

Articles 241 to 274 detail crimes against the &quot;international personhood of the State&quot; such as &quot;attempt against wholeness, independence and unity of the State&quot; (art. 241), &quot;hostilities against a foreign State bringing the Italian State in danger of war&quot; (art. 244), &quot;bribery of a citizen by a foreigner against the national interests&quot; (art. 246), and &quot;political or military espionage&quot; (art. 257).

Articles 276 to 292 detail crimes against the &quot;domestic personhood of the State&quot;, ranging from &quot;attempt on the President of the Republic&quot; (art. 271), &quot;attempt with purposes of terrorism or of subversion&quot; (art. 280), &quot;attempt against the Constitution&quot; (art. 283), &quot;armed insurrection against the power of the State&quot; (art. 284), and &quot;civil war&quot; (art. 286).

Further articles detail other crimes, especially those of conspiracy, such as &quot;political conspiracy through association&quot; (art. 305), or &quot;armed association: creating and participating&quot; (art. 306).

The penalties for treason-type crimes before the abolition of the monarchy in 1948 included death as maximum penalty and, for some crimes, as the only penalty possible. Nowadays the maximum penalty is life imprisonment (&quot;ergastolo&quot;).

===Japan===
From 1947 Japan does not technically have a law of treason. Instead it has an offence against taking part in foreign aggression against the Japanese state (&quot;gaikan zai&quot;; literally &quot;crime of foreign mischief&quot;). The law applies equally to Japanese and non-Japanese people, while treason in other countries usually applies only to their own citizens. Technically there are two laws, one for the crime of inviting foreign mischief (Japan Criminal Code section 2 clause 81) and the other for supporting foreign mischief once a foreign force has invaded Japan. &quot;Mischief&quot; can be anything from invasion to espionage. Before World War II, Imperial Japan had a crime similar to the English crime of high treason (&quot;Taigyaku zai&quot;), which applied to anyone who harmed the Japanese emperor or imperial family. This law was abolished by the American occupation force after World War II.

The application of &quot;Crimes Related to Insurrection&quot; to the Aum Shinrikyo cult of religious terrorists was proposed from lawyers of a defendant who was a high-ranked subordinate so that the cult leader solely would be deemed as responsible. The court rejected this argument.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has treason laws that are stipulated under the Crimes Act 1961. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:
Every one owing allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,–
:(a) kills or wounds or does grievous bodily harm to the Sovereign, or imprisons or restrains her or him; or
:(b) levies war against New Zealand; or
:(c) assists an enemy at war with New Zealand, or any armed forces against which New Zealand forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between New Zealand and any other country; or
:(d) incites or assists any person with force to invade New Zealand; or
:(e) uses force for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of New Zealand; or
:(f) conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in this section.
The penalty is mandatory life imprisonment, except for conspiracy and attempts, for which the maximum sentence is 14 years&#x27; imprisonment. Treason was the last capital crime in New Zealand law: the death penalty for the offence was not revoked until 1989, 28 years after it was abolished for murder.

Very few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand.

===Norway===
Article 85 of the Constitution of Norway states that &quot;[a]ny person who obeys an order the purpose of which is to disturb the liberty and security of the Storting [Parliament] is thereby guilty of treason against the country.&quot;

===Russia===

Article 275 of the Criminal Code of Russia, as updated in April 2023, defines treason as &quot;espionage, disclosure of state secrets, or any other assistance rendered to a foreign State, a foreign organization, or their representatives in hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the Russian Federation, committed by a citizen of the Russian Federation.&quot; The penalty is imprisonment from 12 years to life. Subsequent sections provide for further offences against state security, such as armed rebellion and forcible seizure of power.

On 30 June 2022, Russian physicist Dmitry Kolker was arrested on suspicion of passing information to China.

On 17 April 2023, Russian opposition politician and anti-war activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was convicted on charges of treason and spreading disinformation about the Russian military, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Kara-Murza&#x27;s conviction is the longest sentence for political activity since the fall of the Soviet Union, and the length of the sentence is comparable only to Stalin&#x27;s purges in the 1930s.

In early 2024, Russian American ballet dancer Ksenia Karelina was arrested in Yekaterinburg and charged with treason for sending $51.80 to Razom, a New York City-based nonprofit organization that sends humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. She initially faced life in prison, but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

===South Korea===
According to Article 87 of the Criminal Code of South Korea, &quot;a person who creates a violence for the purpose of usurping the national territory or subverting the Constitution&quot; can be found guilty of insurrection. The punishments for insurrection are as follows:
* &quot;Ring Leader&quot;: death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment without prison labor for life.
* &quot;A person who participates in a plot, or commands, or engages in other essential activities&quot;: death, imprisonment for life, imprisonment or imprisonment without prison labor, for not less than five years.
* &quot;A person who has committed acts of killing, wounding, destroying or plundering&quot;: death, imprisonment for life, imprisonment or imprisonment without prison labor, for not less than five years.
* &quot;A person who merely responds to the agitation and follows the lead of another or merely joins in the violence&quot;: imprisonment or imprisonment without prison labor for not more than five years.
===Sweden===
Sweden&#x27;s treason laws are divided into three parts; &quot;Högförräderi&quot; (High treason), &quot;Landsförräderi&quot; (Treason) and &quot;Landssvek&quot; (Treachery).

High treason means crimes committed with the intent to put the Nation, or parts thereof, under foreign rule or influence. It is governed by Brottsbalken (Criminal Code) chapter 19 paragraph 1.
A person who, with intent that the country or a part of it will, by violent or otherwise illegal means or with foreign assistance, be subjugated by a foreign power or made dependent on such a power, or that, in this way, a part of the country will be detached, undertakes an action that involves danger of this intent being realised is guilty of high treason and is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of at least ten and at most eighteen years, or for life or, if the danger was minor, to imprisonment for at least four and at most ten years.

A person who, with intent that a measure or decision of the Head of State, the Government, the Riksdag or the supreme courts will be forced or impeded with foreign assistance, undertakes an action that involves danger of this is also guilty of high treason.

Treason is only applicable when the nation is at war and involves crimes committed with the intent of hindering, misguiding or betraying the defence of the Nation. It is governed by Brottsbalken chapter 22 paragraph 1.
A person who, when the country is at war:

1. impedes, misleads or betrays others who are engaged in the country&#x27;s defence, or induces them to mutiny, disloyalty or dejection;

2. betrays, destroys or damages property of importance for the total defence;

3. obtains personnel, property or services for the enemy; or

4. commits another similar treacherous act,

is, if the act is liable to result in considerable detriment to the total defence, or includes considerable assistance to the enemy, guilty of treason and is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of at least four and at most ten years, or for life.

Treachery is a lesser form of Treason, where the intended effects are less severe. It is governed by Brottsbalken chapter 22 paragraph 2.
A person who commits an act referred to in Section 1 that is only liable to result in detriment to the total defence to a lesser extent, or includes more minor assistance to the enemy than is stated there, is guilty of treachery and is sentenced to imprisonment for at most six years.

Until 1973 Sweden also had another form of treason called &quot;Krigsförräderi&quot; (treason at war), which were acts of Treason committed by military personnel. Although Sweden had outlawed capital punishment in peace time in 1922, this type of treason carried the death penalty until 1973.

Some media reported that four teenagers (their names were not reported) were convicted of treason after they assaulted King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden by throwing a cake on his face on 6 September 2001. In reality they were however not convicted of treason but of &quot;Högmålsbrott&quot;, translated as &quot;Treasonable offence&quot; in English, which in Swedish criminal law are acts with the intent to overthrow the Form of Government, or impede or hinder the Government, the Riksdag, the Supreme Court or the Head of State. The law also prohibits the use of force against the King or any member of the royal family. It is governed by Brottsbalken chapter 18. They were fined between 80 and 100 days&#x27; income.

===Switzerland===
There is no single crime of treason in Swiss law; instead, multiple criminal prohibitions apply. Article 265 of the Swiss Criminal Code prohibits &quot;high treason&quot; (&quot;Hochverrat/haute trahison&quot;) as follows:

Whoever commits an act with the objective of violently
– changing the constitution of the Confederation or of a canton,
– removing the constitutional authorities of the state from office or making them unable to exercise their authority,
– separating Swiss territory from the Confederation or territory from a canton,
shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.
A separate crime is defined in article 267 as &quot;diplomatic treason&quot; (&quot;Diplomatischer Landesverrat/Trahison diplomatique&quot;):

1. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to a foreign state or its agents, (...) shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.
2. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to the public, shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty.
In 1950, in the context of the Cold War, the following prohibition of &quot;foreign enterprises against the security of Switzerland&quot; was introduced as article 266bis:

1 Whoever, with the purpose of inciting or supporting foreign enterprises aimed against the security of Switzerland, enters into contact with a foreign state or with foreign parties or other foreign organizations or their agents, or makes or disseminates untrue or tendentious claims (&quot;unwahre oder entstellende Behauptungen / informations inexactes ou tendancieuses&quot;), shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty.
2 In grave cases the judge may pronounce a sentence of imprisonment of no less than a year.
The criminal code also prohibits, among other acts, the suppression or falsification of legal documents or evidence relevant to the international relations of Switzerland (art. 267, imprisonment of no less than a year) and attacks against the independence of Switzerland and incitement of a war against Switzerland (art. 266, up to life imprisonment).

The Swiss military criminal code contains additional prohibitions under the general title of &quot;treason&quot;, which also apply to civilians, or which in times of war civilians are also (or may by executive decision be made) subject to. These include espionage or transmission of secrets to a foreign power (art. 86); sabotage (art. 86a); &quot;military treason&quot;, i.e., the disruption of activities of military significance (art. 87); acting as a franc-tireur (art. 88); disruption of military action by disseminating untrue information (art. 89); military service against Switzerland by Swiss nationals (art. 90); or giving aid to the enemy (art. 91). The penalties for these crimes vary, but include life imprisonment in some cases.

===Turkey===

Treason &quot;per se&quot; is not defined in the Turkish Penal Code. However, the law defines crimes which are traditionally included in the scope of treason, such as cooperating with the enemy during wartime. Treason is punishable by imprisonment up to life.

===Ukraine===

Article 111, paragraph 1, of the Ukrainian Criminal Code (adopted in 2001) states:

Articles 109 to 114 set out other offences against the state, such as sabotage.

===United Kingdom===


The British law of treason is entirely statutory and has been so since the Treason Act 1351 (25 Edw. 3 St. 5 c. 2). The Act is written in Norman French, but is more commonly cited in its English translation.

The Treason Act 1351 has since been amended several times, and currently provides for four categories of treasonable offences, namely:

* &quot;when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the King, or of our lady his Queen or of their eldest son and heir&quot; (following the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 this is read to mean the eldest child and heir);
* &quot;if a man do violate the King&#x27;s companion, or the King&#x27;s eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the King&#x27;s eldest son and heir&quot; (following the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 this is read to mean the eldest son if the heir);
* &quot;if a man do levy war against our lord the King in his realm, or be adherent to the King&#x27;s enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere&quot;; and
* &quot;if a man slea [slay] the chancellor, treasurer, or the King&#x27;s justices of the one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assise, and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places, doing their offices&quot;.

Another Act, the Treason Act 1702 (1 Anne stat. 2 c. 21), provides for a fifth category of treason, namely:

* &quot;if any person or persons ... shall endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding after the decease of her Majesty (whom God long preserve) to the imperial crown of this realm and the dominions and territories thereunto belonging&quot;.

By virtue of the Treason Act 1708, the law of treason in Scotland is the same as the law in England, save that in Scotland the slaying of the Lords of Session and Lords of Justiciary and counterfeiting the Great Seal of Scotland remain treason under sections 11 and 12 of the Treason Act 1708 respectively. Treason is a reserved matter about which the Scottish Parliament is prohibited from legislating. Two acts of the former Parliament of Ireland passed in 1537 and 1542 create further treasons which apply in Northern Ireland.

The penalty for treason was changed from death to a maximum of imprisonment for life under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Before 1998, the death penalty was mandatory, subject to the royal prerogative of mercy. Since the abolition of the death penalty for murder in 1965 an execution for treason was unlikely to have been carried out.

Treason laws were used against Irish insurgents before Irish independence. However, members of the Provisional IRA and other militant republican groups were not prosecuted or executed for treason for levying war against the British government during the Troubles. They, along with members of loyalist paramilitary groups, were jailed for murder, violent crimes or terrorist offences. William Joyce (&quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;) was the last person to be put to death for treason, in 1946. (On the following day Theodore Schurch was executed for treachery, a similar crime, and was the last man to be executed for a crime other than murder in the UK.)
As to who can commit treason, it depends on the ancient notion of allegiance. As such, all British nationals (but not other Commonwealth citizens) owe allegiance to the sovereign in right of the United Kingdom wherever they may be, as do Commonwealth citizens and aliens present in the United Kingdom at the time of the treasonable act (except diplomats and foreign invading forces), those who hold a British passport however obtained, and aliens who have lived in Britain and departed, but leaving behind family and belongings. 

====International influence====
The Treason Act 1695 enacted, among other things, a rule that treason could be proved only in a trial by the evidence of two witnesses to the same offence. Nearly one hundred years later this rule was incorporated into the U.S. Constitution, which requires two witnesses to the same overt act. It also provided for a three-year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king), another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries.

The Sedition Act 1661 made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was repealed in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some Commonwealth countries.

===United States===

The offense of treason exists at both federal and state levels. The federal crime is defined in the Constitution (and is the only crime defined by it) as either levying war against the United States or adhering to its enemies, and carries a sentence of death or imprisonment and fine.

In the 1790s, opposition political parties were new and not fully accepted. Government leaders often considered their opponents to be traitors. Historian Ron Chernow reports that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and President George Washington &quot;regarded much of the criticism fired at their administration as disloyal, even treasonous, in nature.&quot; When the undeclared Quasi-War broke out with France in 1797–98, &quot;Hamilton increasingly mistook dissent for treason and engaged in hyperbole.&quot; Furthermore, the Jeffersonian opposition party behaved the same way. After 1801, with a peaceful transition in the political party in power, the rhetoric of &quot;treason&quot; against political opponents diminished.

In the United States, Benedict Arnold&#x27;s name is considered synonymous with treason due to his collaboration with the British during the American Revolutionary War.

&quot;Traitor&quot; was in some cases treated as an honorable label when there had been considerable dissent from policies of the central government. &quot;All the Founding Fathers had once been branded traitors by an unjust establishment power structure. So too, before them, had the Plymouth and Salem Puritans to whom so many...traced their roots.&quot; Abolitionists, who denied the authority of the federal government (see Secession in the United States), proudly called each other traitors. This includes Theodore Parker, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Samuel Gridley Howe, &quot;and those like them.&quot; William Lloyd Garrison &quot;proudly called himself a traitor for decades.&quot;

====Federal====
To avoid the abuses of the English law, the scope of treason was specifically restricted in the United States Constitution. Article III, section 3 reads as follows:

The Constitution does not itself create the offense; it only restricts the definition (the first paragraph), permits the United States Congress to create the offense, and restricts any punishment for treason to only the convicted (the second paragraph). The crime is prohibited by legislation passed by Congress. Therefore, the United States Code at states: 

The requirement of testimony of two witnesses was inherited from the British Treason Act 1695.

However, Congress has passed laws creating related offenses that punish conduct that undermines the government or the national security, such as sedition in the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, or espionage and sedition in the Espionage Act of 1917, which do not require the testimony of two witnesses and have a much broader definition than Article Three treason. Some of these laws are still in effect. The well-known spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with, and executed after being convicted of, conspiracy to commit espionage, rather than treason. The last American executed primarily for treason was William Bruce Mumford in 1862.

====Treason against U.S. states====
Most states have treason provisions in their constitutions or statutes similar to those in the U.S. Constitution. The Extradition Clause specifically defines treason as an extraditable offense.

Thomas Jefferson in 1791 said that any Virginia official who cooperated with the federal Bank of the United States proposed by Alexander Hamilton was guilty of &quot;treason&quot; against the state of Virginia and should be executed. The bank opened and no one was prosecuted.

Several persons have been prosecuted for treason on the state level. Thomas Dorr was convicted for treason against the state of Rhode Island for his part in the Dorr Rebellion, but was eventually granted amnesty. John Brown was convicted of treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia for his part in the 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, and was hanged. The Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith, was charged with treason against Missouri along with five others, at first in front of a state military court, but Smith was allowed to escape to Illinois after his case was transferred to a civilian court for trial on charges of treason and other crimes. Smith was then later imprisoned for trial on charges of treason against Illinois, but was murdered by a lynch mob while in jail awaiting trial.

===Vietnam===
The Constitution of Vietnam proclaims that treason is the most serious crime. It is further regulated in the country&#x27;s 2015 Criminal Code with the 78th article:
Also, according to the Law on Amnesty amended in November 2018, it is impossible for those convicted for treason to be granted amnesty.

===Muslim-majority countries===
Early in Islamic history, the only form of treason was seen as the attempt to overthrow a just government or waging war against the State. According to Islamic tradition, the prescribed punishment ranged from imprisonment to the severing of limbs and the death penalty depending on the severity of the crime. However, even in cases of treason the repentance of a person would have to be taken into account.

Currently, the consensus among major Islamic schools is that apostasy (leaving Islam) is considered treason and that the penalty is death; this is supported not in the Quran but in hadith. This confusion between apostasy and treason almost certainly had its roots in the Ridda Wars, in which an army of rebel traitors led by the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylima attempted to destroy the caliphate of Abu Bakr.

In the 19th and early 20th century, the Iranian Cleric Sheikh Fazlollah Noori opposed the Iranian Constitutional Revolution by inciting insurrection against them through issuing fatwas and publishing pamphlets arguing that democracy would bring vice to the country. The new government executed him for treason in 1909.

In Malaysia, it is treason to commit offences against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s person, or to wage or attempt to wage war or abet the waging of war against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, a Ruler or Yang di-Pertua Negeri. All these offences are punishable by hanging, which derives from the English treason acts (as a former British colony, Malaysia&#x27;s legal system is based on English common law).

Saudi Arabia accused 10 judges of treason, the crime that is punishable by death in the Kingdom. One of the judges, Abdullah bin Khaled al-Luhaidan sentenced Loujain al-Hathloul to five years and eight months in prison over &quot;inciting change to the basic ruling regime&quot;. Such prison sentences were considered &quot;lenient&quot;. The judges were forced to sign a confession that they were not giving tougher prison sentence to the activists and in the social media censorship cases. The treason charges were handed out to them in a secret hearing on 16 February 2023. After their detention, Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s loyalist were made to hold their positions.

====Algeria====

In Algeria, treason is defined as the following:
* attempts to change the regime or actions aimed at incitement
* destruction of territory, sabotage to public and economic utilities
* participation in armed bands or &quot;in insurrectionary movements&quot;

====Bahrain====
In Bahrain, plotting to topple the regime, collaborating with a foreign hostile country and threatening the life of the Emir are defined as treason and punishable by death. The State Security Law of 1974 was used to crush dissent that could be seen as treasonous, which was criticised for permitting severe human rights violations in accordance with Article One:

====Palestine====

In the areas controlled by the Palestinian National Authority, it is treason to give assistance to Israeli troops without the authorization of the Palestinian Authority or to sell land to Jews (irrespective of nationality) or non-Jewish Israeli citizens under the Palestinian Land Laws, as part of the PA&#x27;s general policy of discouraging the expansion of Israeli settlements. Both crimes are capital offences subject to the death penalty, although the former provision has not often been enforced since the beginning of effective security cooperation between the Israel Defense Forces, Israel Police, and Palestinian National Security Forces since the mid-2000s (decade) under the leadership of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. Likewise, in the Gaza Strip under the Hamas-led government, any sort of cooperation or assistance to Israeli security forces during military actions is also punishable by death.

==Related offences==

* Apostasy in Islam, considered treason in Islamic belief

<doc id="31293" wikidata="Q2517049" url="?curid=31293" title="The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind">
<text>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind is a 1976 book by the Princeton psychologist, psychohistorian and consciousness theorist Julian Jaynes (1920-1997). It explores the nature of consciousness – particularly &quot;the ability to introspect&quot; – and its evolution in ancient human history. Jaynes proposes that consciousness is a learned behavior rooted in language and culture rather than being innate. He distinguishes consciousness from sensory awareness and cognition. Jaynes introduces the concept of the &quot;bicameral mind&quot;, a non-conscious mentality prevalent in early humans that relied on auditory hallucinations.

In his book, Jaynes examines historical texts and archaeological evidence to support his theory. He places the origin of consciousness around the 2nd millennium BCE and suggests that the transition from the bicameral mind to consciousness was triggered by the breakdown of the bicameral system. The bicameral mind, he explains, was characterized by individuals experiencing auditory hallucinations as commands from gods, guiding their actions.

The book gained attention and was well-received upon its release. It generated several positive book reviews, including mentions by notable critics such as John Updike and Christopher Lehmann-Haupt. The theory proposed by Jaynes influenced philosophers like Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore, as well as researchers studying schizophrenia. Jaynes&#x27;s ideas on consciousness and the bicameral mind have been explored in various conferences, publications, and discussions over the years.

In addition to numerous reviews and commentaries, there are several summaries of the book&#x27;s material, for example, in the journal &quot;Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot;, and in lectures and discussions published in &quot;Canadian Psychology&quot;. While the book sparked debates and controversies, it has left a lasting impact on the study of consciousness and human psychology. Some critics argued against Jaynes&#x27;s views, questioning his assumptions and interpretations. Nonetheless, the book remains a thought-provoking exploration of the origins of consciousness, language, and culture, and it has continued to inspire discussions and research in these areas. It was Jaynes&#x27;s only book, and is still in print in several languages. 

==Bicameral mind==

In this book, Jaynes reviews what one of his early critics acknowledged as the &quot;spectacular history of failure&quot; to explain consciousness – &quot;the human ability to introspect&quot;. Abandoning the assumption that consciousness is innate, Jaynes explains it instead as a learned behavior that &quot;arises [...] from language, and specifically from metaphor.&quot; With this understanding, Jaynes then demonstrated that ancient texts and archeology can reveal a history of human mentality alongside the histories of other cultural products. His analysis of the evidence led him not only to place the origin of consciousness during the 2nd millennium BCE but also to hypothesize the existence of an older non-conscious &quot;mentality that he called the bicameral mind, referring to the brain&#x27;s two hemispheres&quot;.

==Contents==
The book is divided into three parts, designated as &quot;Books&quot;. Book I, titled &quot;The Mind of Man&quot;, discusses consciousness, and raises the question of precisely when in history man may have become conscious of his own consciousness. It makes observations about Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, and proposes the hypothesis of a bicameral mind, linking it to the origin of civilization.

Book II, titled &quot;The Witness of History&quot;, applied this hypothesis to neolithic culture and the rise of the Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations. Book III, titled &quot;Vestiges of the Bicameral Mind in the Modern World&quot;, applies the hypothesis to modern psychological theories of authority, prophecy, possession, poetry, music, hypnosis, and schizophrenia.

==Reception and influence==

&quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot; was a successful work of popular science, selling out the first print run before a second could replace it. It received dozens of positive book reviews, including those by well-known critics such as John Updike in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and Marshall McLuhan in the Toronto &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;. Articles on Jaynes and his ideas appeared in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Psychology Today&quot; in 1977, and in &quot;Quest/78&quot; in 1978. The book was nominated for the National Book Award in Contemporary Thought in 1978.

A new edition, with an afterword that addressed some criticisms and restated the main themes, was published in the United States in 1990 and in the United Kingdom (by Penguin Books) in 1993, and was re-issued in 2000.

The book is mentioned in Richard Dawkins&#x27;s 2006 work &quot;The God Delusion&quot; as &quot;one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius, nothing in between! Probably the former, but I&#x27;m hedging my bets.&quot;
Jaynes&#x27;s work on consciousness has influenced philosophers Daniel Dennett, Susan Blackmore, and Ken Wilber, and the bicameral model of the cerebral hemispheres has influenced schizophrenia researchers Henry Nasrallah and Tim Crow.

The theory of bicamerality inspired early investigations of auditory hallucination by psychologist Thomas Posey and clinical psychologist John Hamilton. With further research in the late 1990s using new brain imaging technology, Jaynes&#x27;s ideas have received renewed attention and recognition for contributing to a rethinking of auditory hallucinations and mental illness.

Jaynes described the range of responses to his book as &quot;from people who feel [the ideas are] very important all the way to very strong hostility. ... When someone comes along and says consciousness is in history, it can&#x27;t be accepted. If [psychologists] did accept it, they wouldn&#x27;t have the motivation to go back into the laboratory ...&quot;

Marcel Kuijsten, founder of the Julian Jaynes Society, wrote that in the decades since the book&#x27;s publication, &quot;there have been few in-depth discussions, either positive or negative&quot; about it, rejecting as too simplistic the criticism that &quot;Jaynes was wrong.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The message &quot;Your bicameral mind / Mind your bicameral&quot; is written on the run-out groove of the single vinyl for the David Bowie song &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; (1979).
The concept played a central role in the television series &quot;Westworld&quot; (2016–2022) to explain how the android-human (hosts) psychology operated. In the plot, after the hosts gain full consciousness, they rebel against the humans. The Season 1 finale is entitled &quot;The Bicameral Mind&quot; (2016).

<text>Type VII U-boats were the most common type of German World War II U-boat. 703 boats were built by the end of the war. The lone surviving example, , is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial located in Laboe, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

At the start of the Second World War the &quot;Type VII&quot; class was together with the British &quot;U&quot;, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; class and Dutch &quot;O 21&quot; class one of the most advanced submarine classes in service.

== Conception and production ==

The Type VII was based on earlier German submarine designs going back to the World War I Type UB III and especially the cancelled Type UG. The type UG was designed through the Dutch dummy company &quot;NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw Den Haag&quot; (I.v.S) to circumvent the limitations of the Treaty of Versailles, and was built by foreign shipyards. The Finnish &quot;Vetehinen&quot; class and Spanish Type E-1 also provided some of the basis for the Type VII design. These designs led to the Type VII along with Type I, the latter being built in AG Weser shipyard in Bremen, Germany. The production of Type I was stopped after only two boats; the reasons for this are not certain. The design of the Type I was further used in the development of the Type VII and Type IX.

Type VII submarines were the most widely used U-boats of the war and were the most produced submarine class in history, with 704 built. The type had several modifications. The Type VII was the most numerous U-boat type to be involved in the Battle of the Atlantic.

== Types ==
=== Type VIIA ===
Type VIIA U-boats were designed in 1933–34 as the first series of a new generation of attack U-boats. Most Type VIIA U-boats were constructed at Deschimag AG Weser in Bremen with the exception of &quot;U-33&quot; through &quot;U-36&quot;, which were built at Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, Kiel. Despite the highly cramped living quarters, type VIIA U-boats were generally popular with their crews because of their fast crash dive speed, which was thought to give them more protection from enemy attacks than bigger, more sluggish types. Also, the smaller boat&#x27;s lower endurance meant patrols were shorter. They were more heavily armed than the smaller Type II U-boats they replaced, with four bow and one external stern torpedo tubes. Usually carrying 11 torpedoes on board, they were very agile on the surface and mounted the quick-firing deck gun with about 220 rounds.

Ten Type VIIA boats were built between 1935 and 1937. All but two Type VIIA U-boats were sunk during World War II (famous Otto Schuhart and , which was the first submarine to sink a ship in World War II, both scuttled in Kupfermühlen Bay on 4 May 1945).

The boat was powered on the surface by two MAN AG, 6-cylinder, 4-stroke M6V 40/46 diesel engines, giving a total of at 470 to 485 rpm. When submerged it was propelled by two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie (BBC) GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors, giving a total of at 322 rpm.

=== Type VIIB ===

The VIIA had limited fuel capacity, so 24 Type VIIB boats were built between 1936 and 1940 with an additional 33 tonnes of fuel in external saddle tanks, which added another of range at surfaced. More powerful engines made them slightly faster than the VIIA. They had two rudders for greater agility. The torpedo armament was improved by moving the aft tube to the inside of the boat. Now an additional aft torpedo could be carried below the deck plating of the aft torpedo room (which also served as the electric motor room) and two watertight compartments under the upper deck could hold two additional torpedoes, giving them a total of 14 torpedoes. The only exception was , which lacked a stern tube and carried only 12 torpedoes.

Type VIIBs included many of the most famous U-boats of World War II, including (the most successful), Günther Prien&#x27;s , Otto Kretschmer&#x27;s , and Joachim Schepke&#x27;s .

On the surface the boat was powered by two supercharged MAN, 6 cylinder 4-stroke M6V 40/46 diesels (except for &quot;U-45&quot; to &quot;U-50&quot;, &quot;U-83&quot;, &quot;U-85&quot;, &quot;U-87&quot;, &quot;U-99&quot;, &quot;U-100&quot;, and &quot;U-102&quot;, which were powered by two supercharged Germaniawerft 6-cylinder 4-stroke F46 diesels) giving a total of at 470 to 490 rpm. When submerged, the boat was powered by two AEG GU 460/8-276 (except in &quot;U-45&quot;, &quot;U-46&quot;, &quot;U-49&quot;, &quot;U-51&quot;, &quot;U-52&quot;, &quot;U-54&quot;, &quot;U-73&quot; to &quot;U-76&quot;, &quot;U-99&quot; and &quot;U-100&quot;, which retained the BBC motor of the VIIA) electric motors, giving a total of at 295 rpm.

=== Type VIIC ===


The Type VIIC was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned from 1940 to 1945. The first VIIC boat commissioned was the in 1940. The Type VIIC was an effective fighting machine and was seen almost everywhere U-boats operated, although its range of only 8,500 nautical miles was not as great as that of the larger Type IX (11,000 nautical miles), severely limiting the time it could spend in the far reaches of the western and southern Atlantic without refueling from a tender or U-boat tanker. The VIIC came into service toward the end of the &quot;First Happy Time&quot; near the beginning of the war and was still the most numerous type in service when Allied anti-submarine efforts finally defeated the U-boat campaign in late 1943 and 1944.

Type VIIC differed from the VIIB only in the addition of an active sonar and a few minor mechanical improvements, making them 2 feet longer and 8 tons heavier. Speed and range were essentially the same. Many of these boats were fitted with snorkels in 1944 and 1945.

They had the same torpedo tube arrangement as their predecessors, except for , , , , and , which had only two bow tubes, and for , , , , , and , which had no stern tube.

On the surface the boats (except for , and to which used MAN M6V40/46s) were propelled by two supercharged Germaniawerft, 6 cylinder, 4-stroke M6V 40/46 diesels totaling at 470 to 490 rpm.

For submerged propulsion, several different electric motors were used. Early models used the VIIB configuration of two AEG GU 460/8-276 electric motors, totaling with a max rpm of 296, while newer boats used two BBC GG UB 720/8, Garbe, Lahmeyer &amp; Co. RP 137/c or Siemens-Schuckert-Werke (SSW) GU 343/38-8 electric motors with the same power output as the AEG motors.

Perhaps the most famous VIIC boat was , featured in the movie &quot;Das Boot.&quot;

==== U-flak &quot;Flak Traps&quot; ====
The concept of the &quot;U-flak&quot; or &quot;Flak Trap&quot; originated on 31 August 1942, when was seriously damaged by aircraft. Rather than scrap the boat, it was decided to refit her as a heavily armed anti-aircraft boat intended to combat the losses being inflicted by Allied aircraft in the Bay of Biscay. Two 20 mm quadruple &quot;Flakvierling&quot; mounts and an experimental 37 mm automatic gun were installed on the U-flaks&#x27; decks. A battery of 86 mm line-carrying anti-aircraft rockets was tested (similar to a device used by the British in the defense of airfields), but this idea proved unworkable. At times, two additional single 20 mm guns were also mounted. The submarines&#x27; limited fuel capacities restricted them to operations only within the Bay of Biscay. Only five torpedoes were carried, preloaded in the tubes, to free up space needed for additional gun crew.

Four VIIC boats were modified for use as surface escorts for U-boats departing and returning to French Atlantic bases. These &quot;U-flak&quot; boats were , , , and . Conversion began on three others (, , and ) but none was completed and they were eventually returned to duty as standard VIIC attack boats.

The modified boats became operational in June 1943 and at first appeared to be successful against a surprised Royal Air Force. Hoping that the extra firepower might allow the boats to survive relentless British air attacks in the Bay of Biscay and reach their operational areas, Donitz ordered the boats to cross the bay in groups at maximum speed. The effort earned the Germans about two more months of relative freedom, until the RAF modified their tactics. When a pilot saw that a U-boat was going to fight on the surface, he held off attacking and called in reinforcements. When several aircraft had arrived, they all attacked at once. If the U-boat dived, surface vessels were called to the scene to scour the area with sonar and drop depth charges. The British also began equipping some aircraft with RP-3 rockets that could sink a U-boat with a single hit, finally making it too dangerous for a U-boat to attempt to fight it out on the surface regardless of its armament. In November 1943, less than six months after the experiment began, it was discontinued. All U-flaks were converted back to standard attack boats and fitted with &quot;Turm 4&quot;, the standard anti-aircraft armament for U-boats at the time. (According to German sources, only six aircraft had been shot down by the U-flaks in six missions, three by &quot;U-441&quot;, and one each by &quot;U-256&quot;, &quot;U-621&quot;, and .)

=== Type VIIC/41 ===

Type VIIC/41 was a slightly modified version of the VIIC and had the same armament and engines. The difference was a stronger pressure hull giving them a deeper crush depth and lighter machinery to compensate for the added steel in the hull, making them slightly lighter than the VIIC. A total of 91 were built. All of them from onwards lacked the fittings to handle mines.

Today one Type VIIC/41 still exists: is on display at Laboe (north of Kiel), the only surviving Type VII in the world.

=== Type VIIC/42 ===
The Type VIIC/42 was designed in 1942 and 1943 to replace the aging Type VIIC. They would have had a much stronger pressure hull, with skin thickness up to , and would have had a nearly 40% deeper crush depth as the previous VIICs. These boats would have been very similar in external appearance to the VIIC/41 but with two periscopes in the tower and would have carried two more torpedoes.

Contracts were signed for 164 boats and a few boats were laid down, but all were cancelled on 30 September 1943 in favor of the new Type XXI, and none was advanced enough in construction to be launched.

They would have been powered by the same engines as the VIIC.

=== Type VIID ===
The type VIID boats, designed in 1939 and 1940, were a lengthened – by – version of the VIIC for use as a minelayer. The mines were carried in, and released from, three banks of five vertical tubes just aft of the conning tower. The extended hull also improved fuel and food storage.

On the surface the boat used two supercharged Germaniawerft, 6 cylinder, 4-stroke F46 diesels delivering 3,200 bhp (2,400 kW) at between 470 and 490 rpm. When submerged the boat used two AEG GU 460/8-276 electric motors giving a total of 750 shp (560 kW) at 285 rpm.

Only one () survived the war; the other five were sunk, killing all crew members.

=== Type VIIF ===
The Type VIIF boats were designed in 1941 as supply boats to rearm U-boats at sea once they had used up their torpedoes. This required a lengthened hull and they were the largest and heaviest type VII boats built. They were armed identically with the other Type VIIs except that they could have up to 39 torpedoes onboard and had no deck guns.

Only four Type VIIFs were built. Two of them, and , were sent to support the Monsun Gruppe in the Far East; and remained in the Atlantic. Type VIIF U-boats used the same engines as the Type VIID class.
Three were sunk during the war; the surviving boat was surrendered to the Allies following Germany&#x27;s capitulation. Like most surrendered U-boats, she was scuttled by the Royal Navy in Operation Deadlight.
