<text>Vicente Fox Quesada (; born 2 July 1942) is a Mexican businessman and politician who served as the 62nd president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006. After campaigning as a right-wing populist, Fox was elected president on the National Action Party (PAN) ticket in the 2000 election. He became the first president not from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since 1929, and the first elected from an opposition party since Francisco I. Madero in 1911. Fox won the election with 43 percent of the vote.

As president, Fox continued the neoliberal economic policies his predecessors from the PRI had adopted since the 1980s. The first half of his administration saw a further shift of the federal government to the right, strong relations with the United States and George W. Bush, unsuccessful attempts to introduce a value-added tax to medicines and build an airport in Texcoco, and a diplomatic conflict with Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The murder of human rights lawyer Digna Ochoa in 2001 called into question the Fox administration&#x27;s commitment to breaking with the authoritarian past of the PRI era.

The second half of his administration was marked by his conflict with Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the Mayor of Mexico City. The PAN and Fox administration unsuccessfully attempted to remove López Obrador from office and prevent him from participating in the 2006 presidential elections. The Fox administration also became embroiled with diplomatic conflicts with Venezuela and Bolivia after supporting the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which was opposed by those two countries. His last year in office oversaw the controversial 2006 elections, where PAN candidate Felipe Calderón was declared winner by a narrow margin over López Obrador, who claimed the elections had been fraudulent and refused to recognize the results, calling for protests across the country. In the same year, there was civil unrest in Oaxaca, where a teacher&#x27;s strike culminated into protests and violent clashes asking for the resignation of governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz, and in the State of Mexico during the San Salvador Atenco riots, where the state and federal governments were later found guilty by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights of human rights violations during the violent repression. On the other hand, Fox was credited with maintaining economic growth and reducing the poverty rate from 43.7% in 2000 to 35.6% in 2006.

After his presidency, Fox returned to his home state of Guanajuato. He has been involved in public speaking and the development of the Vicente Fox Center of Studies, Library and Museum. He is currently the co-president of the Centrist Democrat International, an international organization of centre-right political parties. Fox was expelled from the PAN in 2013, after having endorsed the PRI presidential candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto, in the 2012 elections. In the 2018 election, Fox endorsed the PRI candidate, José Antonio Meade.

== Early years ==
Vicente Fox Quesada was born on 2 July 1942 in Mexico City, the second of nine children. His father, José Luis Fox Pont, was a native-born Mexican of German-American descent. His mother, Mercedes Quesada Etxaide, was a Spanish Basque immigrant from San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa. Fox&#x27;s family name was originally &quot;Fuchs&quot;, but was anglicized to &quot;Fox&quot; at some point. His paternal grandfather, Joseph Louis Fuchs, was born in Cincinnati in 1865, attended Woodward High School and moved to Mexico at age 32.

Fox spent his childhood and adolescence at the family ranch in San Francisco del Rincón in Guanajuato. Fox has polydactyly, having six toes on each foot.

He spent a year at Campion High School in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin where he learned English. Upon reaching college age, Fox moved to Mexico City to attend the Universidad Iberoamericana and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration in 1964. Then in 1974, Fox received a certificate in management skills from Harvard Business School.

===Business career===
In 1964, Fox was hired by the Coca-Cola Company as a route supervisor and drove a delivery truck. After nine years, he had risen to the top, serving as the President and Chief Executive of Coca-Cola Mexico; after six years in this role, he was invited to lead all of Coca-Cola&#x27;s operations in Latin America, but Fox declined and later resigned from Coca-Cola in 1979. It was during the Fox&#x27;s leadership of Coca-Cola Mexico that Coke became Mexico&#x27;s top-selling soft drink, increasing Coca-Cola&#x27;s sales by almost 50%.

After retiring from Coca-Cola, Fox began to participate in various public activities in Guanajuato, where he created the &quot;Patronato de la Casa Cuna Amigo Daniel&quot;, an orphanage. He was also the president of the Patronato Loyola, a sponsor of the León campus of the Universidad Iberoamericana and of the Lux Institute.

===Family life===
In 1969, Fox married Lilian de la Concha, a receptionist at Coca-Cola. They had four children, Ana Cristina, Vicente, Paulina and Rodrigo. In 1990, after 20 years of marriage, Lilian filed for and was granted a divorce.

Fox remarried on 2 July 2001, while serving as President of Mexico, to Marta María Sahagún Jiménez (until then his spokesperson). The wedding date was the first anniversary of his presidential election and his 59th birthday. For both Fox and Sahagún Jiménez, it was their second marriage.

==Early political career==

With the support of Manuel Clouthier, Vicente Fox joined the Partido Acción Nacional on 1 March 1988. That same year, he was elected to the federal Chamber of Deputies, representing the Third Federal District in León, Guanajuato.

===Governor of Guanajuato===
In 1991, after serving in the Chamber of Deputies, Fox sought the governorship in Guanajuato, but lost the disputed election to Ramón Aguirre Velázquez of the PRI. Following the election, local discontent over allegations of fraud surrounding Aguirre Velázquez&#x27;s victory led the PRI candidate to decline to take office. The state congress appointed Carlos Medina Plascencia of the PAN as interim governor. 

In the 1995 Guanajuato state election, Fox ran again, and was elected governor with over 58% of the vote. As governor, Fox promoted government efficiency and transparency. He was one of the first state governors of Mexico to give a clear, public and timely account of the finances of his state.

Fox also pushed for the consolidation of small firms, promoted the overseas sales of goods manufactured in Guanajuato, and created an extensive system of small loans to allow the poor to open a &quot;changarro&quot; (a small shop) and buy a car and a television. Under Fox, Guanajuato became the fifth most important Mexican state economy.

===Campaign for president===
On 7 July 1997, after the opposition parties first won a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, Vicente Fox decided to run for President of Mexico. In spite of opposition within his political party, Fox secured his candidacy representing the Alliance for Change, a political coalition formed by the National Action Party and the Green Ecological Party of Mexico on 14 November 1999.

During the course of his campaign, a presidential debate was organized, but the three main contenders (Fox, Francisco Labastida of the PRI, and Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas of the PRD) disagreed on the details. One notable disagreement, which was broadcast on national television, was whether the presidential debate should be held that same day or on the following Friday.

During the nationally televised presidential debate, Fox&#x27;s main opponent, Francisco Labastida, claimed that Fox had repeatedly called him a &quot;sissy&quot; and a &quot;cross-dresser&quot; (&quot;la vestida&quot;, a pun on his last name). Fox&#x27;s campaign slogans were &quot;¡Ya!&quot; (&quot;Right now!&quot;), &quot;Ya ganamos&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;ve already won&quot;), and &quot;Vota Alianza por el Cambio&quot; (&quot;Vote for Alliance for Change&quot;).

In addition to some debate controversies, Fox also faced some controversy due to &quot;Amigos de Fox&quot; (Friends of Fox), a nonprofit fundraising group established by Denise Montaño. The group was instrumental in getting Vicente Fox elected President of Mexico, and the phrase &quot;Amigos de Fox&quot; was used as a campaign slogan referring to the millions of people supporting Fox in the 2000 presidential election.

In 2003, money-laundering charges were lodged against &quot;Amigos de Fox&quot;, but were dropped shortly before the July 2003 midterm elections.

====Election results====

On 2 July 2000, his 58th birthday, Fox won the presidential election with 43% (15,989,636 votes) of the popular vote, followed by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Francisco Labastida with 36% (13,579,718 votes), and Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) with 17% (6,256,780 votes). Fox declared victory that same night, a victory that was ratified by then-President Zedillo. After the final results were announced, President-elect Fox addressed thousands of supporters and celebrated his victory with them at the Angel of Independence monument in Mexico City. His opponents conceded the election later that night.

After securing the election, Fox received substantial media coverage, as well as numerous congratulatory messages and phone calls from world leaders, including then-President of the United States Bill Clinton. He took office on 1 December 2000, the first time since 1917 that an opposition candidate had taken power from the long-reigning Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

==Presidency==

===Public image===
During his campaign for president, Vicente Fox became well known for his cowboy style and quirkiness. As a speaker, Fox usually attracted big crowds in the early years of his presidency. At , Fox easily stood out in most crowds, and is believed to be one of the tallest presidents in Mexico&#x27;s history. After his inauguration, President Fox usually wore suits for formal occasions, but opted to wear his signature boots and jeans during his many visits around Mexico.

Fox spread his image as one of peace and welcomed many to his own ranch in Guanajuato, Mexico. When Fox welcomed U.S. President George W. Bush to the ranch, both presidents were wearing Fox&#x27;s signature black cowboy boots, prompting &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to call it &quot;The Boot Summit&quot;.
====Approval ratings====

When Fox took office on 1 December 2000, his approval rating neared 80%. During the rest of his presidency, his average approval rating was of 53%, while his average disapproval rating was of 40%.

As seen in the graphic, after taking office the particularly high points of his approval ratings were: 
* August 2002 (58% approval, 39% disapproval, 3% unsure), after Fox suspended the construction of a new airport in the State of Mexico following months of protests by local residents who had resisted their displacement.
* May 2003 (57% approval, 37% disapproval, 6% unsure), after Fox announced that Mexico would not support the US invasion of Iraq.
*Throughout 2006, his average approval rating was 58% and his average disapproval rating was 37%, as Fox was in his last year as president and the public focus was on the Presidential elections of that year. The popularity enjoyed by Fox during this period, however, didn&#x27;t seem to largely benefit the Presidential candidate of his party (PAN) Felipe Calderón, who was controversially declared winner with only 35.9% of the votes, against Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the PRD who officially obtained 35.3% of the votes and claimed that the election had been fraudulent.

While the lowest points of his approval ratings were:
*March 2002 (39% approval, 52% disapproval, 9% unsure), in the wake of the &quot;Comes y te vas&quot; (&quot;Eat and then leave&quot;) scandal: during the United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development, which took place between 18 and 22 March 2002 in the city of Monterrey and was hosted by Fox, a diplomatic incident occurred when on the night of the 19th Fox received a letter from Cuban leader Fidel Castro informing him that Castro intended to attend the event on the 21st, as he had been invited by the United Nations. Hours after receiving the letter, Fox made a telephone call to Castro in which he expressed his surprise at Castro&#x27;s intention to attend the conference and scolded him for not telling him earlier. During the call, Fox suggested to Castro that he and the Cuban delegation arrive on the 21st as scheduled to make their presentation, and finally attend a lunch with the other leaders, after which they would return to Cuba. Fox was apparently worried that US President George W. Bush, who was also scheduled to arrive on the 21st, would be offended by Castro&#x27;s presence at the conference, which is why Fox suggested Castro to leave after the lunch. Castro was outraged at the proposal, and told Fox that in response, he would make the contents of the call which he was secretly taping public, which he indeed did. The media quickly caught onto the incident, dubbing it &quot;Comes y te vas&quot; (&quot;Eat and then leave&quot;) after Fox&#x27;s suggestion towards Castro to leave the conference after the aforementioned lunch. The scandal badly hurt the Fox administration, as it made him seem subservient to the United States and it also broke with the Mexican diplomatic tradition of neutrality towards Cuba.
*February 2004 (42% approval, 48% disapproval, 10% unsure), in the midst of scandals surrounding the First Lady Marta Sahagún, who was accused by an article in the Financial Times of using public funds to run her &quot;Vamos México&quot; foundation. In the same month, Sahagún announced that she intended to become the PAN candidate for the 2006 Presidential elections, an announcement that was deeply unpopular within the party.
*Throughout the rest of 2004 and 2005, Fox&#x27;s approval rating on average was 45% and his average disapproval rate was of 49%. His generalized descent in popularity during this period is attributed to the highly controversial process of Desafuero against Andrés Manuel López Obrador beginning in May 2004, when the Attorney General of the Republic, supported by the Federal Government, accused López Obrador, then Mayor of Mexico City, of disobeying a federal judge&#x27;s order regarding an expropriation case, and requested both the removal (&quot;desafuero&quot;) of López Obrador&#x27;s constitutional legal immunity and his dismissal as Mayor of Mexico City. Due to López Obrador&#x27;s very high approval ratings in Mexico City and the fact that Fox himself had harshly criticized his administration on previous occasions, López Obrador&#x27;s supporters protested the &quot;desafuero&quot; process and accused Fox of trying to prevent López Obrador from participating in the 2006 presidential elections (given that if he was officially charged, López Obrador would have lost all of his civil rights, including the right to run for the Presidency in 2006, unless he was either quickly acquitted of all charges or managed to serve his sentence before the electoral registration deadline). The process went on for 12 months, and was nearly unanimously criticized by national and foreign media, climaxing in April 2005. On 7 April, the Chamber of Deputies voted by 360 to 127 (with two abstentions) to lift López Obrador&#x27;s constitutional immunity; nonetheless, after a massive rally in support of López Obrador took place in Mexico City on 24 April 2005, with an attendance exceeding one million people (at the time, the biggest political manifestation in recent Mexican history) Fox decided to stop the judicial process against López Obrador. 
*May 2005 registered the lowest approval rating for Fox (35% approval, 59% disapproval, 6% unsure) in the aftermath of both the chaotic Desafuero process and the controversial comments made by Fox regarding African Americans that same month.

====Controversial comments====
* In March 2002, two days prior to the International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Fox called Cuban President Fidel Castro and instructed him to limit his comments about the United States and suggested that Castro leave Mexico after he delivered his speech and ate his meal. Castro later called this a &quot;despicable betrayal.&quot;
* In May 2005, a controversy arose over comments Fox made during a meeting with Texas business people in which he said, &quot;There is no doubt that Mexicans, filled with dignity, willingness and ability to work, are doing jobs that not even blacks want to do there in the United States.&quot; This angered African-Americans in the United States, prompting many black leaders to demand an apology from Fox. Reverend Al Sharpton requested a formal apology from Fox to the African-American community and called for an economic boycott of Mexican products until an apology was received. Sharpton, along with many African-Americans felt that Fox&#x27;s comments were insensitive and racist. Reverend Jesse Jackson, during a news conference concerning Fox&#x27;s statement about African-Americans, said that he felt that the comments were, &quot;unwitting, unnecessary and inappropriate,&quot; and added that &quot;[Fox&#x27;s] statement had the impact of being inciting and divisive.&quot;
* Fox was also known to have mispronounced the name of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges as &quot;José Luis Borgues&quot; in the Royal Congress of the Spanish Language. This error sparked accusations of an &quot;uncultured&quot; President.
* On 30 May 2005, President Fox told reporters that the majority of the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez had been resolved and the perpetrators placed behind bars. He went on to criticize the media for &quot;rehashing&quot; the same 300 or 400 murders, and said matters needed to be seen in their &quot;proper dimension.&quot;
* In 2006, after Bolivian President Evo Morales refused to sell natural gas, Fox said, &quot;Well, they&#x27;ll either have to consume it all themselves or they&#x27;re going to have to eat it.&quot;
* On 8 March 2006, in the wake of the murder of Canadians Domenico and Nancy Ianiero at a resort in Cancún, Fox said there was evidence that pointed to Canadian suspects from Thunder Bay, in an apparent attempt to portray Cancún as a safe vacation resort. Fox&#x27;s comments were criticized by the Ianieros&#x27; lawyer Edward Greenspan for compromising the investigation, which the Canadian press characterized as mishandled by Mexican authorities. Thereafter, attorney general Bello Melchor Rodríguez later stated that Canadians were never considered as suspects.
* In November 2006, the TV network Telemundo released a video of a previously recorded interview with President Fox in which he stated: &quot;Ya hoy hablo libre, ya digo cualquier tontería, ya no importa, ya total, yo ya me voy&quot; which means &quot;Now, I speak freely. Now, I say whatever nonsense. It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. Anyway, I&#x27;m already leaving.&quot; Then, during the interview he talked about the violent situation in Oaxaca. The President&#x27;s office complained about the release of this footage and said he was not aware of the camera and microphones being turned on. News agency EFE accused Telemundo of acting unethically, because the video was EFE&#x27;s intellectual property.
* In 2006, Fox decided to cancel the parade commemorating the 96th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution which was scheduled to take place on 20 November, arguing it was an obsolete celebration that nobody wanted to participate in any more. Some commentators considered that this was a response to Andrés Manuel López Obrador&#x27;s assumption of an alternative presidency to take place the same day. Others considered Fox&#x27;s move a smart decision, while others viewed it as a sign of political weakness.
* In a lecture in the United States, in which he was a keynote speaker, he identified Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa as a Colombian Nobel laureate (Spanish by naturalization). At the time, however, Vargas Llosa was not a Nobel Laureate. Later, in October 2010, Fox congratulated Vargas Llosa on Twitter for winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he incorrectly attributed the Nobel Prize to Jorge Luis Borges.

===Legacy and assessment===

Although Fox&#x27;s victory in the 2000 election and the end of seven decades of PRI rule raised great expectations of change among the Mexican people, his administration was criticized for failing to fulfill those expectations, as little progress was made in fighting corruption, crime, poverty, unemployment and inequality. Few key reforms were implemented during the Fox administration, which became characterised by a growing sense of power vacuum as Fox was increasingly perceived by Mexican society and political actors as a &quot;lame duck&quot; incapable of pushing the ambitious reform agenda that swept him into power in 2000. Alejandro Cacho points out that &quot;Fox incarnated the hope of alternancy [...] and he managed to kick the PRI out of Los Pinos, but his government was a disappointment. Corruption persisted; in fact, his sons-in-law (the Bribiesca-Sahagún brothers) became rich quickly and without explanation. The economy wasn&#x27;t much better than it had been under Ernesto Zedillo, the wages didn&#x27;t increase significantly, neither did jobs. His &quot;super cabinet&quot; [&quot;gabinetazo&quot;, as Fox himself referred to it] created more controversy than it did good results. His wife, Marta Sahagún, had a big influence in the presidential decisions&quot;.

Having assumed office with an approval rating of 80%, by the time he left office in 2006 his public image had become exhausted by the controversial presidential elections of that year and the few reforms implemented.

In terms of the significance of Fox&#x27;s presidency, historian Philip Russell asserts that, &quot;Marketed on television, Fox made a far better candidate than he did president.
He failed to take charge and provide cabinet leadership, failed to set priorities, and turned a blind eye to alliance building.&quot; Fox himself asserted in 2001 (one year into his administration) that he much preferred his experience as candidate than actually being president.

Russell also pointed to 2006 comments by political scientist Soledad Loaeza, who noted, &quot;The eager candidate became a reluctant president who avoided tough choices and appeared hesitant and unable to hide the weariness caused by the responsibilities and constraints of the office.&quot; Russell also asserted that Fox &quot;had little success in fighting crime. Even though he maintained the macroeconomic stability inherited from his predecessor, economic growth barely exceeded the rate of population increase. Similarly, the lack of fiscal reform left tax collection at a rate similar to that of Haiti . . . .&quot; Finally, Russell noted that &quot;during Fox&#x27;s administration, only 1.4 million formal-sector jobs were created, leading to massive immigration to the United States and an explosive increase in informal employment.&quot; Ultimately, however, Russell concluded that Fox will be viewed by history as a transitional figure who was able to defeat one of Mexico&#x27;s long-entrenched political parties.

In a national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Excelsior regarding former presidents, 32% of the respondents considered that the Fox administration was &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, 25% responded that it was an &quot;average&quot; administration, and 42% responded that it was a &quot;very bad&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; administration.

==Post-presidential life==

===Public speaking and advocacy===
Since leaving office in December 2006, Fox has maintained himself in the public eye by speaking in countries such as Nigeria, Ireland, Canada, and the United States about topics such as the controversial 2006 election and the Iraq War. In Mexico, Fox has been criticized by some for his busy post-presidency since former Mexican presidents are traditionally expected to stay out of the political spotlight. In response, Fox has stated, &quot;There is no reason to hold to the anti-democratic rules of those who still live in the authoritarian past . . . now that Mexico is a democracy, every citizen has the right to express himself, even a former president.&quot;

Vicente Fox joined four other Latin American presidents at the One Young World Summit 2014 in Dublin, Ireland, to discuss the Telefónica Millennial Survey. He told those in the audience that eradicating corruption &quot;has to start with education&quot; and that his focus is now on promoting leadership.

Vicente Fox is a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that offers, discreetly and confidentially, a range of experienced advisors to political leaders facing difficult situations.
In 2013, Fox discussed why the West has pursued a moral crusade against drugs at HowTheLightGetsIn festival in Hay-on-Wye. with Chris Bryant and John Ralston Saul. The three debated whether it is hypocritical to ban certain drugs while continuing to export others such as alcohol and tobacco, and whether to follow the lead of Washington and Colorado states in the U.S. and allow the free trading of drugs.

Vicente Fox gave a video interview in July 2013 to &quot;High Times&quot;, in which he discussed the failure of drug prohibition, and cited Portugal&#x27;s decriminalization policies as &quot;working splendid(ly).&quot; He said he supports drug legalization despite not being a user himself, just as he said he also &quot;fully respects&quot; same-sex marriage although he does not personally agree with it.

In February 2014, Fox wrote an opinion piece that was published in Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in which he stated that, &quot;Legalization of not just marijuana, but all drugs, is the right thing to do.&quot; He also said that &quot;we must be given the very freedom to decide our own behaviour and to act responsibly, as long as we do not detrimentally affect the rights of others&quot;.

In 2016, Fox co-signed a letter to Ban Ki-moon calling for a more humane drug policy.

In July 2017, Fox was an international observer to the unofficial Venezuelan referendum held by the opposition. During the trip, Fox gave a speech that compared the referendum to the 2000 Mexican elections. He said that &quot;this battle has been won&quot; and &quot;step by step, vote by vote, the dictator will leave.&quot; He was subsequently declared a persona non grata by the Venezuelan government. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Samuel Moncada said that Fox had taken advantage of the country&#x27;s hospitality and &quot;was paid to come to Venezuela to promote violence and the intervention of foreign powers.&quot; Moncado said the ban came from Maduro and criticized Fox and the other former Latin American leaders invited as observers (Andrés Pastrana, Jorge Quiroga, Laura Chinchilla and Miguel Ángel Rodríguez) as &quot;political sicarios,&quot; &quot;clowns&quot; and &quot;mercenaries&quot; that &quot;sell themselves to the highest bidder to go to various destinations and repeat what they are told.&quot; Fox said he was not surprised by the ban and that the vote would weaken Maduro.

In 2018, Fox joined the &quot;High Times&quot; board of directors. He left the board in 2020 over concerns surrounding the company&#x27;s stock offering.

He supported Javier Milei in 2023 Argentine general election.

===Criticism of Donald Trump===

Fox has been an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, beginning with Trump&#x27;s bid for the Republican candidacy in the 2016 presidential election.

In an interview with Univision&#x27;s Jorge Ramos in February 2016, Fox responded to then-candidate Trump&#x27;s proposal to build a wall at the border between the United States and Mexico at Mexico&#x27;s expense, declaring in English, &quot;I am not going to pay for that fucking wall. He should pay for it. He&#x27;s got the money.&quot; Fox went on to call Trump a &quot;crazy guy&quot; and a &quot;false prophet,&quot; and questioned the claim that Trump received 44% of the Hispanic vote in the Republican caucus in Nevada. Trump took to Twitter in response, demanding that Fox apologize for using &quot;the F word while discussing the wall.&quot; Fox eventually apologized for the remark, while also asking for Trump to apologize for his remarks about Mexicans and inviting Trump to visit Mexico.

Despite his apology, Fox continued to criticize Trump to the international media and troll Trump on Twitter, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m committed to be Donald Trump&#x27;s shadow until he is done with politics.&quot; Fox would later go on to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden and his victory in the 2020 United States presidential election, defeating Trump. When Trump visited Mexico on 31 August 2016 upon President Enrique Peña Nieto&#x27;s invitation, Fox slammed the visit, calling it a &quot;desperate move&quot; on the part of Peña Nieto and stating, &quot;He is not welcome in Mexico. We don&#x27;t like him. We don&#x27;t want him. We reject his visit.&quot; Trump responded by pointing out Fox&#x27;s previous invitation, to which Fox clarified that he invited Trump to Mexico on the condition that he used the visit to apologize to the Mexican people. He directly addressed the American people the next day on CNN, where he described Trump as a &quot;false prophet&quot; who is &quot;absolutely crazy&quot; and warned that they need to &quot;wake up&quot; and realize the harm that Trump&#x27;s immigration and economic policies would inflict on the United States.

Later in September 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Fox had received multiple emails from Trump&#x27;s campaign soliciting donations throughout the month. Fox received the first email on 9 September, which he posted on Twitter and responded, &quot;Donald Trump, I won&#x27;t pay for that fucking wall! Also, campaigning in Mexico? Running out of money and friends?&quot; Fox received two additional emails on 24 and 27 September, both of which he also posted on Twitter and mocked as being &quot;desperate&quot; and &quot;begging.&quot; The revelation of the emails has raised concern, as accepting campaign donations from foreign nationals is illegal in the United States.

During a September 2016 appearance on the radio show &quot;El Show de Piolín&quot;, Fox smashed a Trump piñata hanging on the streets of Los Angeles while loudly singing the traditional Piñata song. Upon breaking it open, Fox noted its lack of contents and remarked, &quot;Empty. Totally Empty. He doesn&#x27;t have any brains.&quot; Discussing the event during a subsequent interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, Fox expanded, &quot;I had such a joy in my heart by doing that, because in Mexico, piñatas are very meaningful. Piñatas are a celebration. Piñatas let you send messages. And the message is: Trump is empty inside. He&#x27;s empty in his head. That&#x27;s why I put my hand into his head. There was no brain there. That&#x27;s what he is, an empty person.&quot;

The day after Trump won the election, Fox wrote an editorial on the &quot;International Business Times&quot; website where he lamented Trump&#x27;s victory and explored what Mexico could do in response. &quot;Even though Trump is not the prettiest person in the room, we still have to dance with him. Now, we ought to look out for ourselves and find a way to work with the most powerful economy in the world, which is now led by an authoritarian racist[...]Donald Trump&#x27;s promises have an expiration date. When the time comes to truly deliver to the American people, his &quot;billion dollar show&quot; will finally crumble beneath his feet,&quot; Fox wrote, concluding his editorial with, &quot;I find quite sad that America, formerly the most open and cutting edge nation, has chosen to lock itself down inside concrete walls. It&#x27;s tragic that fear, anger and wrath took over and pierced the hearts of their people. It will be hard to recover from this wound; but we better start working to heal as quickly as possible – and bring down the walls that blinded us in the beginning.&quot;
Fox has continued criticizing Trump on Twitter after the election. In a series of tweets in January 2017, Fox again criticized Trump&#x27;s proposed Mexican border wall, calling it a &quot;racist monument&quot; and insisted that Mexico will never fund it, calling on Trump to &quot;be honest with US taxpayers&quot; about that fact. Following the release of a U.S. government intelligence report that accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election to ensure Trump&#x27;s victory, Fox tweeted, &quot;Sr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating. Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?&quot; Fox further criticized Trump&#x27;s response to the intelligence report, calling him a &quot;bully&quot; and a &quot;bluff&quot; and stating that Trump is &quot;bringing in a new era of dictatorship.&quot; Though on 12 January, Fox broke with his criticism of Trump and simply tweeted, &quot;America Will Survive.&quot;

In an interview with Anderson Cooper on 25 January 2017, and during an appearance on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s late night talk show on 1 March 2017, Fox again asserted that Mexico should not have to pay for the wall.

In September 2017, Fox was once again in the news after President Trump announced he would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in six months if the U.S. congress failed to pass legislation to address the issue. In response, Fox tweeted to President Trump&#x27;s Twitter account, &quot;Ending DACA is on the top of the vilest acts you’ve pulled off. You’re destroying the legacy of greater men before you.&quot; In another tweet, Fox suggested that President Trump&#x27;s DACA decision was a result of him compensating for earlier failures to pass healthcare legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act. Fox then went on to post a video in which he claimed that President Trump had &quot;failed America&quot; and stated that &quot;[t]his measure is cruel and heartless, worse than any machine. You’re cancelling the future of 800,000 children and young people.&quot;

As Fox frequently uses Twitter (in English) to respond to tweets by President Trump, he has attracted more than 1 million followers on his Twitter account.

Since May 2017, Fox has appeared in a series of humorous videos seriously denouncing Donald Trump, including &quot;Vicente Fox is Running for President of the United States&quot; (fake announcement for the candidacy) which was released in September.

===Autobiography===

Fox&#x27;s autobiography, entitled &quot;Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith and Dreams of a Mexican President&quot;, was released in September 2007. To promote its release, Fox toured many U.S. cities to do book-signings and interviews with U.S. media. During his tour, however, he faced protests from Mexican immigrants who accused him of actions that forced them to emigrate and find jobs in the United States. He faced the subject several times during interviews, such as one held with Fox News&#x27;s Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who questioned him about the massive illegal immigration problem of Mexicans into the United States. Finally, during an interview with Telemundo&#x27;s Rubén Luengas, the interviewer asked Fox about allegations concerning some properties of Vicente Fox&#x27;s wife, Marta Sahagún. After Fox explained the situation, he asked the interviewer not to make false accusations and to prove what he was saying. Luengas said, &quot;I&#x27;m telling you in your face, I&#x27;m not a liar.&quot; After this, Fox walked out of the studio, calling the interviewer a &quot;liar,&quot; &quot;vulgar,&quot; and &quot;stupid.&quot;

Upon the book&#x27;s release, some readers viewed several excerpts as being highly critical of U.S. President George W. Bush, considered by many to be a close friend. For example, Fox wrote that Bush was &quot;the cockiest guy I have ever met in my life,&quot; and claimed that he was surprised that Bush had ever made it to the White House. Later, in an interview with Larry King, Fox explained that this was a misunderstanding and that what he meant by calling George W. Bush &quot;cocky&quot; was to say he was &quot;confident.&quot; Fox also referred to Bush in his autobiography as a &quot;windshield cowboy,&quot; due to Bush&#x27;s apparent fear of a horse Fox offered him to ride.

===Fox Center of Studies, Library and Museum===

:&quot;See: Vicente Fox Center of Studies, Library and Museum&quot;
On 12 January 2007, over a month after he left office, Fox announced the construction of a center of studies, library and museum that was labeled by the U.S. press as Mexico&#x27;s first presidential library. The project will be a library, museum, a center for the advancement of democracy, a study center and a hotel, and it will be completely privately funded. It is expected to be a genuine U.S.-style presidential library. It will be built in Fox&#x27;s home state of Guanajuato, in his home town of San Francisco del Rincón.

While museums are abundant throughout the country, there is nothing comparable to a presidential library where personal documents, records, and gifts amassed by the country&#x27;s leader are open to the public. Fox&#x27;s library will be modeled after the Bill Clinton Library in Little Rock, Arkansas, which, according to the former president, will allow Mexicans to enjoy, for the first time in Mexico&#x27;s history, a library in which to review the documents, images and records that made up his six years as president.

According to the official website, the construction of the center is in progress and advancing. Final completion of the library was expected by late 2007.

In 2015, Fox was interviewed by Peter High for Forbes at the library, which is called &quot;Centro Fox&quot; (the Fox Center). During the interview, Fox remarked that the guiding principle behind the library is that &quot;[w]e are a Latin American center that is geared around ideas, leadership, and strategies. We do it through, number one, young kids. The middle-upper class and the rest have access to the best universities. But the broader constituency does not receive any messages or aspirations of happiness in life at home.&quot;

In addition to the library&#x27;s completion, there has been some indications that Centro Fox was joining hands with UST Global to transform Mexico into a world-class technological economy. Fox stated in a press release that &quot;UST Global is partnering Centro Fox to help accomplish nothing less than the transformation of my country into a world-class technology economy . . . . Together, we will establish Mexico at the forefront of the information technology revolution in the region.&quot; These efforts appear to be ongoing.

===Centrist Democratic International===
On 20 September 2007, Fox was elected co-president of the Centrist Democratic International (along with the re-elected Pier Ferdinando Casini) at its leaders&#x27; meeting in Rome. The CDI is the international organization of political parties that counts Fox&#x27;s party, the National Action Party, as a member.

===Statue controversy===
In October 2007, an announcement was made in the municipality of Boca del Río, Veracruz, that a 3-meter (10 ft) statue of Vicente Fox was to be erected to honor the former president. This aroused criticism from the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution towards Boca del Río&#x27;s mayor, who was affiliated with the same political party (PAN) as Fox.

The statue was put in place amidst protests on the dawn of 13 October 2007. The inauguration was to have been held on 14 October. Some hours after the statue was erected, a crowd of about 100 people (many of whom were members of the PRI, the political party opposed to Fox and which Fox had defeated in the 2000 election) brought the statue down by putting a rope around the statue&#x27;s neck and pulling it down, damaging it. The statue was put back in place for the inauguration, then taken away for repairs.

PAN members accused Veracruz&#x27;s governor, Fidel Herrera Beltrán, of &quot;ordering the attack on the statue,&quot; and Fox called the governor intolerant. Others in the media argued that the installation of the statue was inappropriate, since former President Fox was facing allegations relating to an illicit enrichment scandal at the time.

===Health===
On 7 August 2021, it was reported and confirmed that Vicente Fox and his wife Martha Sahagún were preventively admitted to a hospital in León, Guanajuato after being infected with COVID-19 during the pandemic in Mexico, but without serious symptoms.

===2023 xenophobia controversy===
Fox stirred controversy in July 2023 when he shared an image on his Twitter account criticizing some of the Morena contenders for the 2024 presidential elections and supporting the PAN pre-candidate Xóchitl Gálvez. The image, which made reference to the contenders&#x27; ancestries, read: &quot;Sheinbaum is a Bulgarian Jew, Marcelo is a French &quot;&quot;, Noroña is an alien and Adán Augusto is from Transylvania. The only one who&#x27;s Mexican is Xóchitl!&quot;. Fox was immediately criticized and accused of being antisemitic and xenophobic by social media users and politicians, even from those belonging to the PAN and the opposition to Morena, who noted that the former President himself was of German and Spanish ancestry. Eventually Xóchitl Gálvez herself condemned the tweet. Fox later deleted the image and on July 23 he apologized to the Jewish community, stating that he had not created the image and had merely retweeted it, and affirming that he had a &quot;profound respect for the Jewish community&quot;.

<text>Vincent Ward (born 16 February 1956) is a New Zealand film director, screenwriter and artist.

==Life and career==
Vincent Ward was born on 16 February 1956 near Greytown, New Zealand. He attended Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand where he received a Diploma in Fine Arts (with Honours) in 1981. In 2014 the University of Canterbury awarded him an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts and an adjunct professorship.

In 1978, at the age of 21, he shot &quot;A State of Siege&quot;, his debut short-feature film, which adapted a novel by Janet Frame. It was released theatrically and reviewed by The Los Angeles Times who described it as, ‘Rigorously constructed with one exquisitely composed image following another ... film becomes poetry’. The film won a Special Jury Prize at the Miami Film Festival 1978 and a Golden Hugo Award at the Chicago Film Festival that same year.

In 1978–81, Ward lived in remote Te Urewera with a Tūhoe woman named Puhi and her adult schizophrenic son Niki. He made a documentary about them called &quot;In Spring One Plants Alone&quot;, which won the 1982 Grand Prix at Cinéma du Réel (Paris), and a Silver Hugo at the Chicago Film Festival.

Ward&#x27;s next three films, &quot;Vigil&quot; (1984), &quot;The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey&quot; (1988) and &quot;Map of the Human Heart&quot; (1993) were the first films by a New Zealander to be officially selected ‘in competition’ at the Cannes Film Festival. Between them they garnered close to 30 national and international awards (including the Grand Prix at festivals in Italy, Spain, Germany, France and the United States).

&quot;Vigil&quot; (1984), follows an imaginative, solitary child living on a remote farm and is partly inspired by Ward&#x27;s own rural upbringing in the Wairarapa. It was produced by John Maynard and shot in Taranaki. Child actor Fiona Kay played the central role.

Ward&#x27;s second feature, a fantasy-adventure film, &quot;The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey&quot; (1988), was inspired by an experience he had in Germany. He recounts attempting to cross the autobahn on foot and ending up dodging traffic. The experience made such an impression on him, it was the key image that sparked the idea for the film. The Navigator follows a group of 14th-century Cumbrian villagers who tunnel through the earth, and find themselves in modern-day Auckland. Ward says “what I wanted to do was look at the 20th Century through medieval eyes, its as if the demons of our contemporary world, our technological monsters of destruction, could be foreseen in the nightmares of medieval men”. Rolling Stone&#x27;s review hailed it as “A visionary film of rare courage and imperishable heart.” The film won the Grand Prix at four film festivals including; Sitges Film Festival, Fanta Film Festival, and Oporto Film Festival 1998/89. And took home Best Film and Best Director at both the Australian and New Zealand film industry awards in 1989.

In 1990, Ward wrote a treatment for &quot;Alien 3&quot;, and was originally slated to direct it before being replaced by David Fincher, while part of his treatment was used in the film, thus receiving a &quot;story by&quot; credit in the end. The heart of his original script, known as ‘the monks in space’ version, was however not captured in the final film and has since been recognised by the London Times Online, who in 2008 gave it the top spot on their list of &#x27;greatest sci-fi movies never made’.

Ward&#x27;s next film &quot;Map of the Human Heart&quot; (1993) charts a relationship between an Inuk boy, a Métis girl and a visiting British cartographer. Ward and his co-writer Louis Nowra spent time travelling and researching the project together in Canada and Vincent went on to travel extensively in the Arctic before they began writing the script. Ward suffered minor frostbite whilst location scouting in the Arctic that was still visible throughout the shoot. The film stars Jason Scott Lee, Anne Parillaud and Patrick Bergin, and features John Cusack in a minor role. It was produced by Tim Bevan and Ward, and it was screened as a work in progress at Cannes Film Festival in 1992, it was later nominated for best film at the Australian Film Institute Awards. American critic Roger Ebert praised its unpredictability and sense of adventure.

In the 1990s Ward spent several years in and out of Hollywood, where he developed multiple projects before he signed on to direct &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998) a screenplay adapted by Ronald Bass from Richard Matheson&#x27;s 1978 novel. What Dreams May Come was released in the United States on 2,600 screens and starred Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max von Sydow. It reached US$71 million in theatrical sales and performed strongly in the video market. The film was nominated for Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects at the 1999 Academy Awards and won an Oscar for visual effects. It continues to be popular with audiences scoring 84% on Rotten Tomatoes.

The 2003 epic, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; was based on a project Ward spent four years developing with the film&#x27;s producers. Eventually, after Ward approached several directors, including Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Weir, he got Edward Zwick to helm the film. Ward was an executive producer of the film.

During his time in Hollywood, Ward became interested in acting and trained under acting coach Penny Allen. He had a small part in Mike Figgis’ film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995), and a larger role in Figgis’ next film &quot;One Night Stand&quot; (1997). He was given one of the leading role in a US independent feature film &quot;The Shot&quot; (1996), and a role in Geoff Murphy&#x27;s film &quot;Spooked&quot; (2004).

In 2005, he returned to New Zealand and made &quot;River Queen&quot;. Starring Samantha Morton, Kiefer Sutherland, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and Cliff Curtis.

&quot;Rain of the Children&quot; followed in 2008, wherein Ward retells the story of Puhi, the elderly Tuhoe woman who was the subject of his earlier documentary &quot;In Spring One Plants Alone&quot;. &quot;Rain of the Children&quot; won the Grand Prix at Era New Horizons Film Festival. The film was nominated for best director and won best composer at the Qantas Film and TV Awards in New Zealand. Vincent Ward was also nominated for best director at the Australian Directors Guild Awards.

Ward has had 2 full retrospectives of his films. In 1984 at Germany&#x27;s Hof International Film Festival and in 2008 at Poland&#x27;s Era New Horizons Film Festival.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; has called Vincent Ward &quot;one of film&#x27;s great image makers&quot;, while Roger Ebert, one of America&#x27;s foremost film critics, hailed him as &quot;a true visionary.&quot;

In October 2020, filming began in Ukraine on Ward&#x27;s new feature &quot;Storm School&quot; with further shooting planned in China, UK and Australia. It is based on a script cowritten by Ward and long-term collaborator Louis Nowra.

== Painting and photography ==

Since 2010 Ward has launched a second career as a painter and video artist. In 2012 he had his first major solo show, &quot;Breath&quot;, at New Zealand&#x27;s cutting edge public gallery, the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery/Len Lye Centre in New Plymouth. This was followed by two other public gallery showings in Auckland and a solo pavilion at the 9th Shanghai Biennale 2012.

Ward received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from the University of Canterbury (2014) and an adjunct professorship. In 2015 he had a guest professorship at the China Academy of Art, in Hanzhou, as well as a residency at the Shanghai University School of Fine Arts.

Ward is represented in New Zealand by Trish Clark Gallery.

Art writer and reviewer Anthony Byrt (Art Forum) described the work as “intense... stunning... virtuosic” and said “Ward has never shied away from the truth: he digs and digs until he gets somewhere other filmmakers and artists don&#x27;t often visit: a psychic space where violence, memory, myth, sex and religion mingle in a landscape scarred by history.”.

Rhana Devenport, director Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, wrote in her catalog for the exhibition: Ward&#x27;s ongoing concerns with metamorphosis, falling, light, fear, memory, darkness and the transformative moment have led him to create a series of vast, physically imposing works that delve into other-worldly landscapes and transcendent states, to evocations of loss, redemption and unconscious realms.

<text>A wiki ( ) is a form of hypertext publication on the internet which is collaboratively edited and managed by its audience directly through a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages that can either be edited by the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base.

Wikis are powered by wiki software, also known as wiki engines. Being a form of content management system, these differ from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader. Wikis have little inherent structure, allowing one to emerge according to the needs of the users. Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a lightweight markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Further rules may be imposed to organize content. In addition to hosting user-authored content, wikis allow those users to interact, hold discussions, and collaborate.

There are hundreds of thousands of wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis functioning as knowledge management resources, note-taking tools, community websites, and intranets. Ward Cunningham, the developer of the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally described wiki as &quot;the simplest online database that could possibly work&quot;. &quot;&quot; (pronounced ) is a Hawaiian word meaning &quot;quick&quot;.

The online encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most popular wiki-based website, as well being one of the internet&#x27;s most popular websites, having been ranked consistently as such since at least 2007. Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one pertaining to a specific language. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection of articles, standing at as of 2025.

== Characteristics ==

In their 2001 book &quot;The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web&quot;, Cunningham and co-author Bo Leuf described the essence of the wiki concept:
* &quot;A wiki invites all users—not just experts—to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki website, using only a standard &#x27;plain-vanilla&#x27; Web browser without any extra add-ons.&quot;
* &quot;Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not.&quot;
* &quot;A wiki is &quot;not&quot; a carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers and designed for casual visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape.&quot;

=== Editing ===

==== Source editing ====

Some wikis will present users with an edit button or link directly on the page being viewed. This will open an interface for writing, formatting, and structuring page content. The interface may be a source editor, which is text-based and employs a lightweight markup language (also known as &quot;wikitext&quot;, &quot;wiki markup&quot;, or &quot;wikicode&quot;), or a visual editor. For example, in a source editor, starting lines of text with asterisks could create a bulleted list.

The syntax and features of wiki markup languages for denoting style and structure can vary greatly among implementations. Some allow the use of and , while others prevent the use of these to foster uniformity in appearance.

==== Example of syntax ====

A short section of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; rendered in wiki markup:

==== Visual editing ====

While wiki engines have traditionally offered source editing to users, in recent years some implementations have added a rich text editing mode. This is usually implemented, using JavaScript, as an interface which translates formatting instructions chosen from a toolbar into the corresponding wiki markup or HTML. This is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding users from the technical detail of markup editing and making it easier for them to change the content of pages. An example of such an interface is the VisualEditor in MediaWiki, the wiki engine used by Wikipedia. WYSIWYG editors may not provide all the features available in wiki markup, and some users prefer not to use them, so a source editor will often be available simultaneously.

==== Version history ====

Some wiki implementations keep a record of changes made to wiki pages, and may store every version of the page permanently. This allows authors to revert a page to an older version to rectify a mistake, or counteract a malicious or inappropriate edit to its content.

These stores are typically presented for each page in a list, called a &quot;log&quot; or &quot;edit history&quot;, available from the page via a link in the interface. The list displays metadata for each revision to the page, such as the time and date of when it was stored, and the name of the person who created it, alongside a link to view that specific revision. A diff (short for &quot;difference&quot;) feature may be available, which highlights the changes between any two revisions.

==== Edit summaries ====
The edit history view in many wiki implementations will include &quot;edit summaries&quot; written by users when submitting changes to a page. Similar to the function of a log message in a revision control system, an edit summary is a short piece of text which summarizes and perhaps explains the change, for example &quot;Corrected grammar&quot; or &quot;Fixed table formatting to not extend past page width&quot;. It is not inserted into the article&#x27;s main text.

=== Navigation ===

Traditionally, wikis offer free navigation between their pages via hypertext links in page text, rather than requiring users to follow a formal or structured navigation scheme. Users may also create indexes or table of contents pages, hierarchical categorization via a taxonomy, or other forms of ad hoc content organization. Wiki implementations can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages, such as a backlink feature which displays all pages that link to a given page. Adding categories or tags to a page makes it easier for other users to find it.

Most wikis allow the titles of pages to be searched amongst, and some offer full text search of all stored content.

==== Navigation between wikis ====


Some wiki communities have established navigational networks between each other using a system called &quot;WikiNodes&quot;. A WikiNode is a page on a wiki which describes and links to other, related wikis. Some wikis operate a structure of &quot;neighbors&quot; and &quot;delegates&quot;, wherein a neighbor wiki is one which discusses similar content or is otherwise of interest, and a delegate wiki is one which has agreed to have certain content delegated to it. WikiNode networks act as webrings which may be navigated from one node to another to find a wiki which addresses a specific subject.

=== Linking to and naming pages ===

The syntax used to create internal hyperlinks varies between wiki implementations. Beginning with the WikiWikiWeb in 1995, most wikis used camel case to name pages, which is when words in a phrase are capitalized and the spaces between them removed. In this system, the phrase &quot;camel case&quot; would be rendered as &quot;CamelCase&quot;. In early wiki engines, when a page was displayed, any instance of a camel case phrase would be transformed into a link to another page named with the same phrase.

While this system made it easy to link to pages, it had the downside of requiring pages to be named in a form deviating from standard spelling, and titles of a single word required abnormally capitalizing one of the letters (e.g. &quot;WiKi&quot; instead of &quot;Wiki&quot;). Some wiki implementations attempt to improve the display of camel case page titles and links by reinserting spaces and possibly also reverting to lower case, but this simplistic method is not able to correctly present titles of mixed capitalization. For example, &quot;Kingdom of France&quot; as a page title would be written as &quot;KingdomOfFrance&quot;, and displayed as &quot;Kingdom Of France&quot;.

To avoid this problem, the syntax of wiki markup gained &quot;free links&quot;, wherein a term in natural language could be wrapped in special characters to turn it into a link without modifying it. The concept was given the name in its first implementation, in UseModWiki in February 2001. In that implementation, link terms were wrapped in a double set of square brackets, for example Kingdom of France. This syntax was adopted by a number of later wiki engines.

It is typically possible for users of a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite the creation of those pages. Such links are usually differentiated visually in some fashion, such as being colored red instead of the default blue, which was the case in the original WikiWikiWeb, or by appearing as a question mark next to the linked words.

== History ==

WikiWikiWeb was the first wiki. Ward Cunningham started developing it in 1994, and installed it on the Internet domain c2.com on March 25, 1995. Cunningham gave it the name after remembering a Honolulu International Airport counter employee telling him to take the &quot;Wiki Wiki Shuttle&quot; bus that runs between the airport&#x27;s terminals, later observing that &quot;I chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for &#x27;quick&#x27; and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web.&quot;

Cunningham&#x27;s system was inspired by his having used Apple&#x27;s hypertext software HyperCard, which allowed users to create interlinked &quot;stacks&quot; of virtual cards. HyperCard, however, was single-user, and Cunningham was inspired to build upon the ideas of Vannevar Bush, the inventor of hypertext, by allowing users to &quot;comment on and change one another&#x27;s text.&quot; Cunningham says his goals were to link together people&#x27;s experiences to create a new literature to document programming patterns, and to harness people&#x27;s natural desire to talk and tell stories with a technology that would feel comfortable to those not used to &quot;authoring&quot;.

Wikipedia became the most famous wiki site, launched in January 2001 and entering the top ten most popular websites in 2007. In the early 2000s, wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software. Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some companies use wikis as their collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance group learning. On March 15, 2007, the word &quot;wiki&quot; was listed in the online &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

== Alternative definitions ==

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the word &quot;wiki&quot; was used to refer to both user-editable websites and the software that powers them, and the latter definition is still occasionally in use.

By 2014, Ward Cunningham&#x27;s thinking on the nature of wikis had evolved, leading him to write that the word &quot;wiki&quot; should not be used to refer to a single website, but rather to a mass of user-editable pages or sites so that a single website is not &quot;a wiki&quot; but &quot;an instance of wiki&quot;. In this concept of wiki federation, in which the same content can be hosted and edited in more than one location in a manner similar to distributed version control, the idea of a single discrete &quot;wiki&quot; no longer made sense.

== Implementations ==
The software which powers a wiki may be implemented as a series of scripts which operate an existing web server, a standalone application server that runs on one or more web servers, or in the case of personal wikis, run as a standalone application on a single computer. Some wikis use flat file databases to store page content, while others use a relational database, as indexed database access is faster on large wikis, particularly for searching.

== Hosting ==
Wikis can also be created on wiki hosting services (also known as &quot;wiki farms&quot;), where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner, and may do so at no charge in exchange for advertisements being displayed on the wiki&#x27;s pages. Some hosting services offer private, password-protected wikis requiring authentication to access. Free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page.

== Trust and security ==

=== Access control ===

The four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators and system administrators. System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server. Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions (including, for example, preventing edits to pages, deleting pages, changing users&#x27; access rights, or blocking them from editing).

=== Controlling changes ===

Wikis are generally designed with a &quot;soft security&quot; philosophy in which it is easy to correct mistakes or harmful changes, rather than attempting to prevent them from happening in the first place. This allows them to be very open while providing a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. Most wikis offer a &quot;recent changes&quot; page which shows recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame. Some wikis can filter the list to remove edits flagged by users as &quot;minor&quot; and automated edits. The version history feature allows harmful changes to be reverted quickly and easily.

Some wiki engines provide additional content control, allowing remote monitoring and management of a page or set of pages to maintain quality. A person willing to maintain pages will be alerted of modifications to them, allowing them to verify the validity of new editions quickly. Such a feature is often called a &quot;watchlist&quot;.

Some wikis also implement &quot;patrolled revisions&quot;, in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark edits as being legitimate. A &quot;flagged revisions&quot; system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed.

Wikis may allow any person on the web to edit their content without having to register an account on the site first (&quot;anonymous editing&quot;), or require registration as a condition of participation. On implementations where an administrator is able to restrict editing of a page or group of pages to a specific group of users, they may have the option to prevent anonymous editing while allowing it for registered users.

=== Trustworthiness and reliability of content ===

Critics of publicly editable wikis argue that they could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals, or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content. Proponents maintain that these issues will be caught and rectified by a wiki&#x27;s community of users. High editorial standards in medicine and health sciences articles, in which users typically use peer-reviewed journals or university textbooks as sources, have led to the idea of expert-moderated wikis. Wiki implementations retaining and allowing access to specific versions of articles has been useful to the scientific community, by allowing expert peer reviewers to provide links to trusted version of articles which they have analyzed.

=== Security ===

Trolling and cybervandalism on wikis, where content is changed to something deliberately incorrect or a hoax, offensive material or nonsense is added, or content is maliciously removed, can be a major problem. On larger wiki sites it is possible for such changes to go unnoticed for a long period.

In addition to using the approach of soft security for protecting themselves, larger wikis may employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism. For example, on Wikipedia, the bot &quot;ClueBot NG&quot; uses machine learning to identify likely harmful changes, and reverts these changes within minutes or even seconds.

Disagreements between users over the content or appearance of pages may cause &quot;edit wars&quot;, where competing users repetitively change a page back to a version that they favor. Some wiki software allows administrators to prevent pages from being editable until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate.

Some wikis may be subject to external structures of governance which address the behavior of persons with access to the system, for example in academic contexts.

==== Harmful external links ====

As most wikis allow the creation of hyperlinks to other sites and services, the addition of malicious hyperlinks, such as sites infected with malware, can also be a problem. For example, in 2006 a German Wikipedia article about the Blaster Worm was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website, and users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link had their systems infected with the worm. Some wiki engines offer a blacklist feature which prevents users from adding hyperlinks to specific sites that have been placed on the list by the wiki&#x27;s administrators.

== Communities ==

=== Applications ===
The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic. Other large wikis include the WikiWikiWeb, Memory Alpha, Wikivoyage, and previously Susning.nu, a Swedish-language knowledge base. Medical and health-related wiki examples include Ganfyd, an online collaborative medical reference that is edited by medical professionals and invited non-medical experts. Many wiki communities are private, particularly within enterprises. They are often used as internal documentation for in-house systems and applications. Some companies use wikis to allow customers to help produce software documentation. A study of corporate wiki users found that they could be divided into &quot;synthesizers&quot; and &quot;adders&quot; of content. Synthesizers&#x27; frequency of contribution was affected more by their impact on other wiki users, while adders&#x27; contribution frequency was affected more by being able to accomplish their immediate work. From a study of thousands of wiki deployments, Jonathan Grudin concluded careful stakeholder analysis and education are crucial to successful wiki deployment.

In 2005, the Gartner Group, noting the increasing popularity of wikis, estimated that they would become mainstream collaboration tools in at least 50% of companies by 2009. Wikis can be used for project management. Wikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries. In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work. In the mid-2000s, the increasing trend among industries toward collaboration placed a heavier impetus upon educators to make students proficient in collaborative work, inspiring even greater interest in wikis being used in the classroom.

Wikis have found some use within the legal profession and within the government. Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Intellipedia, designed to share and collect intelligence assessments, DKosopedia, which was used by the American Civil Liberties Union to assist with review of documents about the internment of detainees in Guantánamo Bay; and the wiki of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, used to post court rules and allow practitioners to comment and ask questions. The United States Patent and Trademark Office operates Peer-to-Patent, a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to the examination of pending patent applications. Queens, New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park. Cornell Law School founded a wiki-based legal dictionary called Wex, whose growth has been hampered by restrictions on who can edit.

In academic contexts, wikis have also been used as project collaboration and research support systems.

==== City wikis ====

A &quot;city wiki&quot; or &quot;local wiki&quot; is a wiki used as a knowledge base and social network for a specific geographical locale. The term city wiki is sometimes also used for wikis that cover not just a city, but a small town or an entire region. Such a wiki contains information about specific instances of things, ideas, people and places. Such highly localized information might be appropriate for a wiki targeted at local viewers, and could include:
* Details of public establishments such as public houses, bars, accommodation or social centers
* Owner name, opening hours and statistics for a specific shop
* Statistical information about a specific road in a city
* Flavors of ice cream served at a local ice cream parlor
* A biography of a local mayor and other persons

=== Growth factors ===

A study of several hundred wikis in 2008 showed that a relatively high number of administrators for a given content size is likely to reduce growth; access controls restricting editing to registered users tends to reduce growth; a lack of such access controls tends to fuel new user registration; and that a higher ratio of administrators to regular users has no significant effect on content or population growth.

== Legal environment ==

Joint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, can also cause editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, making it impossible to republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing. Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an open content license. Version 2 of the GNU Free Documentation License includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing, and Creative Commons licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of business necessity and the inherent nature of a wiki.

Wikis and their users can be held liable for certain activities that occur on the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that they could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, they may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains a direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities. In the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects sites that engage in &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing. It has also been argued that a wiki&#x27;s enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks. When defamation occurs on a wiki, theoretically, all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the &quot;publication&quot;. It remains to be seen whether wikis will be regarded as more akin to an internet service provider, which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications&#x27; contents, than a publisher. It has been recommended that trademark owners monitor what information is presented about their trademarks on wikis, since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions, and they can edit entries to rectify misinformation.

<text>The WikiWikiWeb is the first wiki, or user-editable website. It was launched on 25 March 1995 by programmer Ward Cunningham and it has been a read-only archive since 2015. The name &quot;WikiWikiWeb&quot; originally also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, which was later renamed to &quot;WikiBase&quot;.

== Description ==
WikiWikiWeb is the first wiki, or user-editable website. The site was launched on 25 March 1995 by programmer Ward Cunningham to accompany the Portland Pattern Repository website discussing software design patterns.

The name &quot;WikiWikiWeb&quot; originally also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, written in the Perl programming language and later renamed to &quot;WikiBase&quot;.

Hyperlinks between pages on WikiWikiWeb are created by joining capitalized words together, a technique referred to as camel case. This convention of wiki markup formatting is still followed by some more recent wiki software, whereas others, such as the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, allow links without camel case.

== History ==
The software and website were developed in 1994 by Cunningham in order to make the exchange of ideas between programmers easier. This concept was based on the ideas developed in HyperCard stacks that Cunningham built in the late 1980s. On March 25, 1995, he installed the software on his company&#x27;s (Cunningham &amp; Cunningham) website: c2.com. The site was frequently referred to by its users as simply &quot;Wiki&quot;; users of the early network of wiki sites that followed in the 1990s and 2000s followed a convention that using the word with a capitalized &quot;W&quot; referred exclusively to WikiWikiWeb.

In December 2014, WikiWikiWeb came under the attack of vandals, and had to be put into a read-only state. On February 1, 2015, Cunningham announced that the Wiki had been rewritten as a single-page application and migrated to the new Federated Wiki.

When moved to read-only, the WikiWikiWeb&#x27;s &quot;WelcomeVisitors&quot; page contained the following description in the first two paragraphs:

== Etymology ==
Cunningham came up with the name WikiWikiWeb because he remembered a Honolulu International Airport counter employee who told him to take the Wiki Wiki Shuttle, a shuttle bus line that runs between the airport&#x27;s terminals. &quot;Wiki Wiki&quot; is a reduplication of &quot;wiki&quot;, a Hawaiian language word for &quot;quick&quot;. Cunningham&#x27;s idea was to make WikiWikiWeb&#x27;s pages quickly editable by its users, so he initially thought about calling it &quot;QuickWeb&quot;, but later changed his mind and dubbed it &quot;WikiWikiWeb&quot;.

<text>Warez is a common computing and broader cultural term referring to pirated software (i.e. illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the Internet. Warez is used most commonly as a noun, a plural form of &quot;ware&quot; (short for computer software), and is intended to be pronounced like the word . The circumvention of copy protection (cracking) is an essential step in generating warez, and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games. The global array of warez groups has been referred to as &quot;The Scene&quot;, deriving from its earlier description as &quot;the warez scene&quot;. Distribution and trade of copyrighted works without payment of fees or royalties generally violates national and international copyright laws and agreements. The term warez covers supported as well as unsupported (abandonware) items, and legal prohibitions governing creation and distribution of warez cover both profit-driven and &quot;enthusiast&quot; generators and distributors of such items.

==Terminology==

Warez, and its leetspeak form &quot;W4r3z&quot;, are plural representations of the word &quot;ware&quot; (short for computer software), and are terms used to refer to &quot;[p]irated software distributed over the Internet,&quot; that is, &quot;[s]oftware that has been illegally copied and made available&quot; e.g., after having &quot;protection codes de-activated&quot;. &quot;Cracking&quot;, or circumventing copy protection, is an essential part of the warez process,&quot; and via this commonality, the definition focused on computer software has been extended to include other forms of material under copyright protection, especially movies. As Aaron Schwabach notes, the term covers both supported and unsupported materials (the latter unsupported, termed abandonware), and legal recourses aimed at stemming the creation and distribution of warez are designed to cover both profit-driven and &quot;enthusiast&quot; practitioners. Hence, the term refers to copyrighted works that are distributed without fees or royalties and so traded in general violation of copyright law.

The term &quot;warez,&quot; which is intended to be pronounced like the word &quot;wares&quot; (/ˈwɛərz/), was coined in the 1990s; its origin is with an unknown member of an underground computing circle, but has since become commonplace among Internet users and the mass media. It is used most commonly as a noun: &quot;My neighbour downloaded 10 gigabytes of warez yesterday&quot;; but has also been used as a verb: &quot;The new Windows was warezed a month before the company officially released it&quot;. The global collection of warez groups has been referred to as &quot;The Warez Scene,&quot; or more ambiguously &quot;The Scene.&quot;

While the term &#x27;piracy&#x27; is commonly used to describe a significant range of activities, most of which are unlawful, the relatively neutral meaning in this context is &quot;...mak[ing] use of or reproduc[ing] the work of another without authorization&quot;. Some groups (including the GNU project of the Free Software Foundation, FSF) object to the use of this and other words such as &quot;theft&quot; because they represent an attempt to create a particular impression in the reader:The FSF advocates the use of terms like &quot;prohibited copying&quot; or &quot;unauthorized copying&quot;, or &quot;sharing information with your neighbor.&quot; Hence, the term &quot;software pirate&quot; is controversial; FSF derides its use, while many self-described pirates take pride in the term, and some groups (e.g., Pirates with Attitudes) fully embrace it.

&quot;Direct download [DDL] sites&quot; are web locations that index links to locations where files can be directly downloaded to the user&#x27;s computer; many such sites link to free file hosting services, for the hosting of materials. DDL sites do not directly host the material and can avoid the fees that normally accompany large file hosting.

==Motivations and arguments==

The production and/or distribution of warez is illegal in most countries due to the protections provided in the TRIPS Agreement. Software infringers generally exploit the international nature of the copyright issue to avoid law enforcement in specific countries. Violations are typically overlooked in poorer third world countries, and other countries with weak or non-existent protection for intellectual property. Additionally, some first world countries have loopholes in legislation that allow the warez to continue.

There is also a movement, exemplified by groups like The Pirate Party and scholars at The Mises Institute, that the very idea of intellectual property is an anathema to free society. This is in contrast to some of the more traditional open source advocates such as Lawrence Lessig, who advocate for middle ground between freedom and intellectual property.

==Legality==
Generally, there are four elements of criminal copyright infringement: the existence of a valid copyright, that copyright was infringed, the infringement was willful, and the infringement was either substantial, or for commercial gain (at levels often set by statute). Offering warez is generally understood to be a form of copyright infringement that is punishable as either a civil wrong or a crime.

Often, sites hosting torrent files claim that they are not breaking any laws because they are not offering the actual data; rather, the sites only offer a link to other places or peers that contain the infringing material. However, many prosecution cases and convictions argue to the contrary. For instance, Dimitri Mader, the French national who operates a movie distribution warez site, Wawa-Mania, was fined 20,000 € and sentenced, in absentia, to a year in jail by a European court (after fleeing France for the Philippines), for his role in managing the site. In the U.S., through 2004, more than 80 individuals had been prosecuted and convicted for trade in warez products (under the NET Act and other statutes), for movie and software pirating in particular, with a number of individuals being imprisoned, including some enthusiast traders.

However, laws and their application to warez activities may vary greatly from country to country; for instance, while Wawa-Mania is under sanction in France, it remains in operation via a host in Moldova, and through use of an Ecuadorian top-level domain. Hence, while high-profile web hosts and domain providers generally do not permit the hosting of warez, and delete sites found to be hosting them, private endeavours and small commercial entities continue to allow the trade in warez to continue. And, in some countries, and at some times, software &quot;piracy&quot; has been encouraged, and international and usual national legal protections ignored. A dispute between Iran and United States over membership in WTO and subsequent U.S. block of Iran&#x27;s attempts at full-membership has led Iran to encourage the copying of U.S. software; hence, there has been a subsequent surge in Iranian &quot;warez&quot; and &quot;crackz&quot; websites (as Iranian laws do not forbid hosting them inside Iran). The same policy has been adopted by Antigua, and others.

==Distribution==
Warez are often distributed outside of The Scene (a collection of warez groups) by torrents (files including tracker info, piece size, uncompressed file size, comments, and vary in size from 1 k, to 400 k.) uploaded to a popular P2P website by an associate or friend of the cracker or cracking crew. An nfo or FILE ID.DIZ is often made to promote who created the release. It is then leeched (downloaded) by users of the tracker and spread to other sharing sites using P2P, or other sources such as newsgroups. From there, it can be downloaded by millions of users all over the world. Often, one release is duplicated, renamed, then re-uploaded to different sites so that eventually, it can become impossible to trace the original file. Another increasingly popular method of distributing Warez is via one-click hosting websites. In the early 1990s, warez were often published on bulletin boards that had a warez section.

===Rise of software infringement===

Unauthorized copying has been an ongoing phenomenon that started when high quality, commercially produced software was released for sale. Whether the medium was cassette tape or floppy disk, cracking enthusiasts found a way to duplicate the software and spread it without the permission of the maker. Bootlegging communities were built around the Apple II, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, Atari ST and other systems. Entire networks of BBSes sprang up to traffic illegal software from one user to the next. Machines like the Amiga and the Commodore 64 had an international network, through which software not available on one continent would eventually make its way to every region via bulletin board systems.

It was also common in the 1980s to use physical floppy disks and the postal service for spreading software, in an activity known as &quot;mail trading&quot;. Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the floppy disc to be in the drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could install it onto their computer and mail the disk to the next person, who could do the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading cracker groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the Eastern bloc countries to receive new Western software for their computers.
Copy-protection schemes for the early systems were designed to defeat casual duplication attempts, as &quot;crackers&quot; would typically release a copied game to the &quot;pirate&quot; community the day they were earmarked for market.

A famous event in the history of software copyright policy was an open letter written by Bill Gates of Microsoft, dated February 3, 1976, in which he argued that the quality of available software would increase if &quot;software piracy&quot; were less prevalent. However, until the early 1990s, software copyright infringement was not yet considered a serious problem by most people. In 1992, the Software Publishers Association began to battle against this phenomenon, with its promotional video &quot;Don&#x27;t Copy That Floppy&quot;. It and the Business Software Alliance have remained the most active anti-infringement organizations worldwide, although to compensate for extensive growth in recent years, they have gained the assistance of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), as well as American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).

Today most warez files are distributed to the public via bittorrent and One-click hosting sites. Some of the most popular software companies that are being targeted are Adobe, Microsoft, Nero, Apple, DreamWorks, and Autodesk, to name a few. To reduce the spread of illegal copying, some companies have hired people to release &quot;fake&quot; torrents (known as Torrent poisoning), which look real and are meant to be downloaded, but while downloading the individual does not realize that the company that owns the software has received their IP address. They will then contact their ISP, and further legal action may be taken by the company/ISP.
===Causes that have accelerated its growth===

Similar to televisions and telephones, computers have become a necessity to every person in the information age. As the use of computers increased, so had software and cyber crimes.

In the mid-1990s, the average Internet user was still on dial-up, with average speed ranging between 28.8 and 33.6 kbit/s. If one wished to download a piece of software, which could run about 200 MB, the download time could be longer than one day, depending on network traffic, the Internet Service Provider, and the server. Around 1997, broadband began to gain popularity due to its greatly increased network speeds. As &quot;large-sized file transfer&quot; problems became less severe, warez became more widespread and began to affect large software files like animations and movies.

In the past, files were distributed by point-to-point technology: with a central uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, a large number of downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for peer-to-peer networking; the &quot;more&quot; downloaders the &quot;faster&quot; the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.

===Distribution via compromised FTP servers===
Prior to the development of modern peer-to-peer sharing systems and home broadband service, sharing warez sometimes involved warez groups scanning the Internet for weakly secured computer systems with high-speed connections. These weakly secured systems would be compromised by exploiting the poor FTP security, creating a special directory on the server with an unassuming name to contain the illegal content.

A common mistake of early FTP administrators was to permit a directory named /incoming that allows full read and write access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in and go to a location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.

Hackers would also use known software bugs to illicitly gain full administrative remote control over a computer, and install a hidden FTP service to host their wares. This FTP service was usually running on an unusual port number, or with a non-anonymous login name like &quot;login: warez / Password: warez&quot; to help prevent discovery by legitimate users; information about this compromised system would then be distributed to a select group of people who were part of the warez scene.

It was important for warez group members to regulate who had access to these compromised FTP servers, to keep the network bandwidth usage low. A site that suddenly became very popular would be noticed by the real owners of the equipment, as their business systems became slow or low on disk space; investigation of system usage would then inevitably result in discovery and removal of the warez, and tightening of the site security.

===Automated warez distribution via IRC bots===
As the ability to compromise and attain full remote control of business servers became more developed, the warez groups would hack a server and install an IRC bot on the compromised systems alongside the FTP service, or the IRC bot would provide file sharing directly by itself. This software would intelligently regulate access to the illicit data by using file queues to limit bandwidth usage, or by only running during off-hours overnight when the business owning the compromised hardware was closed for the day.

In order to advertise the existence of the compromised site, the IRC software would join public IRC &quot;warez&quot; channels as a &quot;bot&quot; and post into the channel with occasional status messages every few minutes, providing information about how many people are logged into the warez host, how many files are currently being downloaded, what the upload/download ratio is (to force users into contributing data of their own before they can download), which warez distributor is running the bot, and other status information.

This functionality still exists and can still be found on IRC &quot;warez&quot; channels, as an alternative to the modern and streamlined P2P distribution systems. The opportunity to find and compromise poorly secured systems on which to create an illicit warez distribution site has only increased with the popular use of broadband service by home users who may not fully understand the security implications of having their home computer always turned on and connected to the Internet

==Types==

There is generally a distinction made between different sub-types of warez. The unusual spellings shown here were commonly used as directory names within a compromised server, to organize the files rather than having them all thrown together in a single random collection.

* Apps – Applications: Generally a retail version of a software package.
* Cracks – Cracked applications: A modified executable or more (usually one) and/or a library (usually one) or more and/or a patch designed to turn a trial version of a software package into the full version and/or bypass copy protections.
* Dox – Video game add-ons: These include NoCDs, cracks, trainers, cheat codes etc.
* EBook – E-books: These include unlicensed copies of e-books, scanned books, scanned comics, etc.
* Games – Video games: This scene concentrates on both computer and console games, often released as ISO or other format disk image.
* Hacks – Simplified/Specific Hacking Tools: Programs designed to perform specific hacks at the click of a button, typically with a limited scope, such as AOHell and AOL4Free.
* Keygens – Keygen software are tools that replicate the registration/activation process of a genuine software product and generate the necessary keys to activate the software.
* Movies – Movies: Unauthorized copies of movies, can be released while still in theaters or from CDs/DVDs/Blu-ray prior to the actual retail date.
* MP3s – MP3 audio: Audio from albums, singles, or other sources usually obtained by ripping a CD or a radio broadcast and released in the compressed audio format MP3.
* MVs/MVids – Music videos – Can be ripped from TV, HDTV, DVDs or VCDs.
* NoCD, NoDVD, FixedExe – A file modification that allows an installed program to be run without inserting the CD or DVD into the drive.
* RIP – A game that doesn&#x27;t have to be installed; any required registry entry can be included as a .reg file. RIP games can be ripped of music and/or video files, or, for video games, ROMs, thus decreasing the size of the download. RIPs with nothing ripped out sometimes are referred to as DP (direct play).
* Portables – Portable applications: Similar to RIPs, but in this case they&#x27;re software applications instead of video games. The point of portable software is the fact that it can be placed on removable media (or any place on the local hard drive) and doesn&#x27;t need installing; usually it is compressed into one executable file, by using software like VMware ThinApp or MoleBox.
* Scripts – Scripts: These include unlicensed copies of commercial scripts (such as vBulletin, Invision Power Board, etc.) coded by companies in PHP, ASP, and other languages.
* Subs – Subtitles: can be integrated in a TV-Rip or Movie.
* Serials – Refers to a collection of product keys such as serial numbers made available for the purpose of activating trial software, without payment.
* Templates – Web templates: These include leaked commercial website templates coded by companies.
* TV-Rips – Television programs: Television shows or movies, usually with commercials edited out. Commonly released within a few hours after airing. DVD Rips of television series fall under this sub-type.
* XXX – Pornography: These can be imagesets, paysite videos or retail movies.
* Zero-day or 0-day – Any copyrighted work that has been released the same day as the original product, or sometimes even before. It is considered a mark of skill among warez distribution groups to crack and distribute a program on the same day as its commercial release.

==Movie infringement==
Movie copyright infringement was looked upon as impossible by the major studios. When dial-up was common in early and mid-1990s, movies distributed on the Internet tended to be small. The technique that was usually used to make them small was to use compression software, thus lowering the video quality significantly. At that time, the largest copyright violation threat was software.

However, along with the rise in broadband internet connections beginning around 1998, higher quality movies began to see widespread distribution – with the release of DeCSS, ISO images copied directly from the original DVDs were slowly becoming a feasible distribution method. Today, movie sharing has become so common that it has caused major concern amongst movie studios and their representative organizations. Because of this the MPAA is often running campaigns during movie trailers where it tries to discourage people from copying material without permission. Unlike the music industry, which has had online music stores available for several years, the movie industry moved to online distribution only in 2006, after the launch of Amazon Unbox.

Because of this, cameras are sometimes forbidden in movie theaters.

==File formats==
A CD software release can contain up to 700 megabytes of data, which presented challenges when sending over the Internet, particularly in the late 1990s when broadband was unavailable to most home consumers. These challenges apply to an even greater extent for a single-layer DVD release, which can contain up to 4.7 GB of data. The warez scene made it standard practice to split releases up into many separate pieces, called disks, using several file compression formats: (historical TAR, LZH, ACE, UHA, ARJ), ZIP, and most commonly RAR. The original purpose of these &quot;disks&quot; was so that each .rar file could fit on a single 1.44 MB 3½ inch floppy disk. With the growing size of games, this is no longer feasible, as hundreds of disks would need to be used. The average size of disks released by groups today are 50 megabytes or 100 megabytes, however it is common to find disks up to 200 megabytes.

This method has many advantages over sending a single large file:
*The two-layer compression could sometimes achieve almost a tenfold improvement over the original DVD/CD image. The overall file size is cut down and lessens the transfer time and bandwidth required.
*If there is a problem during the file transfer and data was corrupted, it is only necessary to resend the few corrupted RAR files instead of resending the entire large file.
*This method also allows the possibility of downloading separate ‘disks’ from different sources, as an early attempt at modern segmented downloading.
**In the case of One-click hosting websites, downloading multiple files from one or several sources can significantly increase download speeds. This is because even if the source(s) provides slow download speeds on individual disks, downloading several disks simultaneously will allow the user to achieve much greater download rates.

Despite the fact that many modern ftp programs support segmented downloading, the compression via RAR, ZIP, and breaking up of files has not changed.

Releases of software titles often come in two forms. The full form is a full version of a game or application, generally released as CD or DVD-writable disk images (BIN or ISO files). A rip is a cut-down version of the title in which additions included on the legitimate DVD/CD (generally PDF manuals, help files, tutorials, and audio/video media) are omitted. In a game rip, generally all game video is removed, and the audio is compressed to MP3 or Vorbis, which must then be decoded to its original form before playing. These rips are very rare today, as most modern broadband connections can easily handle the full files, and the audio is usually already compressed by the original producer in some fashion.

==Warez and malware==
There is a common perception that warez sites represent high risk in terms of malware. In addition, there are several papers showing there is indeed correlation between warez/file sharing sites and malware. In particular, one study shows that out of all domains the study classified as &quot;pirate&quot;, 7.1% are infected (while out of &quot;random&quot; domains only 0.4% were infected); another study maintains that &#x27;&quot;maliciousness&quot; of the content for sites they classified as &quot;pirate&quot; (which specifically included &quot;warez&quot; sites) is the highest among all the researched site categories. Domains related to anti-copy protection tools are among the most malicious sites. Another study specifically targeted anti-copy protection tools such as cracks and key generators. They conclude that the majority of these programs aim to infect the user&#x27;s computer with one or more types of malware. The chance of the end-user being exposed to malicious code when dealing with cracked applications or games is more than 50%.

Infected warez directly from the warez scene on the other hand, is a very unusual occurrence. The malicious content is usually added at a later stage by third parties.

==Demographics==

Warez traders share many similarities to both hackers and crackers. Primary warez distribution groups include a single cracker that renders all copy protected technologies in a warez inoperable. Unlike the typical age of a hacker and cracker, the general age and demographics of a warez trader are older and married IT professionals. The need for attention is another similarity between the groups as well as the belief that digital property should be free.

<text>A wedding is a ceremony in which two people are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnicities, races, religions, denominations, countries, social classes, and sexual orientations. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by a couple; a presentation of a gift (e.g., an offering, rings, a symbolic item, flowers, money, or a dress); and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. Music, poetry, prayers, or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony, as well as superstitious customs.

==Common elements across cultures==


Some cultures have adopted the traditional Western custom of the white wedding, in which a bride wears a white wedding dress and veil. This tradition was popularized through the marriage of Queen Victoria. Some say Queen Victoria&#x27;s choice of a white gown may have simply been a sign of extravagance, but may have also been influenced by the values she held which emphasized sexual purity.

The use of a wedding ring has long been part of religious weddings in Indian sub-continent, Europe and America, but the origin of the tradition is unclear. One possibility is the Roman belief in the Vena amoris, which was believed to be a blood vessel that ran from the fourth finger (ring finger) directly to the heart. Thus, when a couple wore rings on this finger, their hearts were connected. Historian Vicki Howard points out that the belief in the &quot;ancient&quot; quality of the practice is most likely a modern invention. In the United States of America, a groom&#x27;s wedding band has not appeared until the early 20th century, while in Europe it has been part of the tradition since the ancient Romans, as witnessed by the jurist Gaius.

The exit from the wedding ceremony is also called the &quot;send off&quot; and often includes traditional practices; for instance, in Ethiopian weddings, newlyweds and the rest of the wedding party bow and kiss the elders&#x27; knees. In most of the Western world, as well as in countries such as India and Malaysia, the send off often includes the practice of throwing rice (a symbol of prosperity and fertility) or other seeds at the newlyweds. Despite popular belief, using uncooked rice for this purpose is not harmful to birds. In several cultures, people toss shoes instead of rice.
The wedding ceremony is often followed by a wedding reception or wedding breakfast, in which the rituals may include speeches from a groom, best man, father of a bride and possibly a bride, the newlyweds&#x27; first dance as a couple, and the cutting of an elegant wedding cake. In recent years traditions have changed to include a father-daughter dance for a bride and her father, and sometimes also a mother-son dance for a groom and his mother.

==Locations==
In some countries there are restrictions on where a wedding may take place, for example before the Marriage Act 1994, marriages in England and Wales could only take place in authorized religious buildings or civil register offices, but the Act extended the options available to allow weddings in other &quot;approved premises&quot;. Cretney identified a wide range of venues which sought approval after the implementation of this legal change, including funeral homes, hotels, stately homes, football grounds, beaches, and former warships. Related outdoor locations could also be approved for weddings after the Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Approved Premises) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 were adopted.

==Traditional wedding attire==

==Wedding music==

===Western weddings===
Music played at Western weddings includes a processional song (e.g., the Wedding March) for walking down the aisle, either before or after the marriage service. An example of such use is reported in the 1878 wedding of Nora Robinson and Alexander Kirkman Finlay.

The &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; from &quot;Lohengrin&quot; by Richard Wagner, commonly known as &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot;, is often used as the processional. Wagner is said to have been anti-Semitic, and as a result, the Bridal Chorus is normally not used at Jewish weddings. UK law forbids music with any religious connotations to be used in a civil ceremony.

Johann Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon in D is an alternative processional. Other alternatives include various contemporary melodies, such as Bob Marley&#x27;s One Love, which is sometimes performed by a steel drum band. The music used in modern weddings is usually left completely up to the bride and groom, and it is becoming increasingly popular for couples to add their own twist to the song they walk down the aisle to. Many brides and grooms use songs that hold special value for them.

In the United States, approximately 2 million people get married each year, and close to 70 million people attend a wedding and spend more than $100 on a gift.

In the United Kingdom, according to a survey, the average minimum amount spent on a wedding gift is £24.70, and the average maximum amount spent is £111.46. Eighty-five percent of people said that they were more likely to spend more money on a person if they had a good relationship with him or her.

==Customs associated with various religions and cultures==
===Christian customs===

Most Christian churches give some form of blessing to a marriage, which is seen as a sacred institution in some sense, although terminology and associated theological meanings vary widely from one denomination to another (e.g., &quot;holy matrimony&quot;, &quot;sacrament of marriage&quot;, &quot;holy ordinance of marriage&quot;, or &quot;holy union&quot;).

A celebration of Holy Matrimony typically includes mutual vows or solemn promises of lifelong love and fidelity by the couple, and may include some sort of pledge by the community to support the couple&#x27;s relationship. A &quot;church wedding&quot; is a ceremony held in a church and presided over by a Christian pastor. Traditionally, Christian weddings occur in a church, as Christian marriage ideally begins where one started his or her faith journey. (Christians receive the sacrament of baptism in church in the presence of their congregation.) Catholic Christian weddings must &quot;take place in a church building&quot;, as holy matrimony is a sacrament; sacraments normatively occur in the presence of Christ in the house of God, and &quot;members of the faith community [should be] present to witness the event and provide support and encouragement for those celebrating the sacrament.&quot; Bishops never grant permission &quot;to those requesting to be married in a garden, on the beach, or some other place outside of the church&quot; and a dispensation is only granted &quot;in extraordinary circumstances (for example, if a bride or groom is ill or disabled and unable to come to the church).&quot; Marriage in the church, for Christians, is seen as contributing to the fruit of the newlywed couple regularly attending church each Lord&#x27;s Day and raising children in the faith.

Wedding ceremonies typically contain prayers and readings from the Holy Bible and reflect the church&#x27;s teachings about the spiritual significance of marriage, as well as its purpose and obligations. The wedding service often includes the reception of Holy Communion, especially in the context of Mass (as with Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism). In some traditional weddings of Western Christianity (especially Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism), a &quot;care cloth&quot; or &quot;nuptial veil&quot; (&quot;velatio nuptialis&quot;) &quot;signifying a marriage yoke joining the bride and groom together&quot; may be held over the kneeling couple during the nuptial blessing given by the priest.

Pre-marital counseling may be recommended or required for an engaged couple. In some Christian countries or denominations, a betrothal rite, as well as the reading of banns of marriage may also be required before the wedding date.

In the Roman Catholic Church, Holy Matrimony is considered to be one of the seven sacraments, in this case, one that the spouses bestow upon each other in front of a priest and members of the community as witnesses. As with all sacraments, it is seen as having been instituted by Jesus himself (see Gospel of Matthew 19:1–2, Catechism of the Catholic Church §1614–1615). In the Eastern Orthodox Church, it is one of the Mysteries and is seen as an ordination and a martyrdom. The Christian wedding ceremony of Saint Thomas Christians, an ethnoreligious group of Christians in India, incorporates elements from local Indian traditions. Protestant weddings may be elaborate (as with Lutheranism and Anglicanism) or simple (as with Baptists). For example, in the United Methodist Church, the Service of Christian Marriage (Rite I) includes the elements found in a typical Sunday service, such as hymns, prayers, and readings from the Bible, as well as other elements unique to a wedding, including taking marriage vows and an optional exchange of wedding rings, as well as a special benediction for the couple. Holy Communion may be part of the wedding service in liturgical Protestant churches (e.g., Lutheran, Anglican, or Methodist), but is rarely, if ever, found in weddings of other low-church Protestant denominations (e.g., Baptists).

A Quaker wedding ceremony in a Friends meeting is similar to any other meeting for worship, and therefore often very different from the experience expected by non-Friends.

In some Western countries, a separate and secular civil wedding ceremony is required for recognition by the state, while in other Western countries, couples must merely obtain a marriage license from a local government authority and can be married by Christian or other clergy authorized by law to do so.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, same-sex couples have been allowed to marry civilly in many countries, and some Christian churches in those countries allow religious marriages of same-sex couples, though some forbid it. See the article Same-sex marriage.

===Hindu customs===

Hindu ceremonies are usually conducted totally or at least partially in Sanskrit, the language of the Hindu scriptures. The wedding celebrations may last for several days and they can be extremely diverse, depending upon the region, denomination, and community. Mehendi ceremony is a traditional ritual in Hindu weddings, where Henna application takes place on the bride&#x27;s hands and legs, before the wedding. On the wedding day, the bride and the bridegroom garland each other in front of the guests. Most guests witness only this short ceremony and then socialize, have food, and leave. The religious part (if applicable) comes hours later, witnessed by close friends and relatives. In cases where a religious ceremony is present, a Brahmin (Hindu priest) arranges a sacred &quot;yajna&quot; (fire-sacrifice), and the sacred fire (Agni) is considered the prime witness (&quot;sākshī&quot;) of the marriage. He chants mantras from the Vedas and subsidiary texts while the couple is seated before the fire. The most important step is &quot;saptapadi&quot; or &quot;saat phere&quot;, wherein the bride and the groom, hand-in-hand, encircle the sacred fire seven times, each circle representing a matrimonial vow. Then the groom marks the bride&#x27;s hair parting with vermilion (&quot;sindoor&quot;) and puts a gold necklace (&quot;mangalsutra&quot;) around her neck. Or a yellow thread applied with turmeric is knotted around the bride&#x27;s neck 3 times at marriage. The first knot represents her obedience and respect to her husband, the second one to his parents and the third represents her respect to God. Several other rituals may precede or follow these afore-mentioned rites. Then the bride formally departs from her blood-relatives to join the groom&#x27;s family.

===Jewish customs===
A traditional Jewish wedding usually follows this format:
* Before the ceremony, the couple formalize a written ketubah (marriage contract), specifying the obligations of husband to the wife and contingencies in case of divorce. The ketubah is signed by two witnesses and later read under the chuppah (wedding canopy).
* The couple is married under the chuppah signifying their new home together. The chuppah can be made from a piece of cloth or other material attached to four poles, or a giant tallit (prayer shawl) held over the couple by four family members or friends.
* The wedding couple is accompanied by both sets of parents and they join the wedding couple under the chuppah.
** In Orthodox Jewish weddings, the bride is accompanied to the chuppah by both mothers, and the groom is accompanied to the chuppah by both fathers.
* Seven blessings are recited, blessing the bride and groom and their new home.
* The couple sip a glass of wine from a Kiddush cup.
* The groom will smash a wine glass with his right foot, ostensibly in remembrance of the destruction of the Second Temple. The shattered cup also symbolizes the &#x27;broken&#x27; world, and the lifelong process of finding the pieces and putting them back together.
** In Reform Jewish weddings, the bride and groom can smash the wine glass together.
* At some weddings, the couple may declare that each is sanctified to the other, repeat other vows and exchange rings.
** In Orthodox Jewish weddings, the bride does not speak under the chuppah and only she receives a ring. The groom recites &quot;Harei at mekudeshet li k&#x27;dat Moshe V&#x27;Yisrael&quot;- &quot;behold you are [thus] sanctified to me by the law of Moses and Israel&quot; as he places the ring on the bride&#x27;s right index finger. The bride&#x27;s silence and acceptance of the ring signify her agreement to the marriage. This part of the ceremony is called kiddushin. The groom&#x27;s giving an object of value to the bride is necessary for the wedding to be valid.
** In more egalitarian weddings, the bride responds verbally, often giving the groom a ring in return. A common response is &quot;ani l&#x27;dodi, v&#x27;dodi li&quot; (I am my beloved&#x27;s, my beloved is mine)
* In some Orthodox weddings, the groom then says:
:&quot;If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.&quot;
:&quot;May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth.&quot;
:&quot;If I do not remember you,&quot;
:&quot;if I do not consider Jerusalem in my highest joy.&quot;
* The ceremony ends with the groom breaking a glass underfoot.
* The couple spend their first moments as husband and wife in seclusion (apart from the wedding guests, and with no other person present). This &quot;cheder yichud&quot; – &quot;the room of seclusion (or &#x27;oneness&#x27;)&quot; halachically strengthens the marriage bond since Orthodox Jews are forbidden to be secluded with an unrelated person of the opposite sex.
* The ceremony is followed by a &quot;seudat mitzvah&quot;, the wedding meal, as well as music and dancing.
* At the conclusion of the wedding meal, &quot;Birkat Hamazon&quot; (Grace After Meals) is recited, as well as the seven wedding blessings.

In more observant communities, the couple will celebrate for seven more days, called the &quot;Sheva Brachot&quot; (seven blessings) during which the seven wedding blessings are recited at every large gathering during this time.

=== Islamic customs ===

A wedding is typically a happy time for families to celebrate. In the Middle East, there are colorful, cultural variations from place to place.

Two male witnesses who are the members of the family in most cases are required for Nikah. According to the Quran, in a married Muslim couple, both husband and wife act as each other&#x27;s protector and comforter and therefore only meant &quot;for each other&quot;.

All Muslim marriages have to be declared publicly and are never to be undertaken in secret. For many Muslims, it is the ceremony that counts as the actual wedding alongside a confirmation of that wedding in a registry office according to &quot;fiqh&quot;. In Islam a wedding is also viewed as a legal contract particularly in Islamic jurisprudences. However, most Muslim cultures separate both the institutions of the mosque and marriage; no religious official is necessary, but very often an Imam presides and performs the ceremony, he may deliver a short sermon. Celebrations may differ from country to country depending on their culture but the main ceremony is followed by a Walima (the marriage banquet).

In Islam, polygyny is allowed with certain religious restrictions. Despite that, an overwhelming majority of Muslims traditionally practice monogamy.

It is forbidden in Islam for parents or anyone else: to force, coerce, or trick either man or woman into a marriage that is contrary to the individual will of any one of the couples. It is also necessary for all marriages to commence with the best of intentions.

===Chinese customs===

At traditional Chinese weddings, the tea ceremony is the equivalent of an exchange of vows at a Western wedding ceremony. This ritual is still practiced widely among rural Chinese; however, young people in larger cities, as well as in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore, tend to practice a combination of Western style of marriage together with the tea ceremony.

When the bride leaves her home with the groom to his house, a &quot;Good Luck Woman&quot; will hold a red umbrella over her head, meaning, &quot;Raise the bark, spread the leaves.&quot; This &quot;Good Luck Woman&quot; should be someone who is blessed with a good marriage, healthy children, and husband and living parents. Other relatives will scatter rice, red beans, and green beans in front of her. The red umbrella protects the bride from evil spirits, and the rice and beans are to attract the attention of the gold chicken.

The newlyweds kneel in front of parents presenting tea. A Good Luck Woman making the tea says auspicious phrases to bless the newlyweds and their families. The newlyweds also present tea to each other, raising the tea cups high to show respect before presenting the tea to each other.

The attendants receiving the tea usually give the bride gifts such as jewelry or a red envelope.

The tea ceremony is an official ritual to introduce the newlyweds to each other&#x27;s family, and a way for newlyweds to show respect and appreciation to their parents. The newlyweds kneel in front of their parents, serving tea to both sides of parents, as well as elder close relatives. Parents give their words of blessing and gifts to the newlyweds.

=== Welsh customs ===
Prior to the 19th century, first recorded in the 13th century in the Book of Aneirin, a custom known as a &#x27;Neithior&#x27; or &#x27;Neithor&#x27; was observed by the Welsh, it consisted of a great feast being held the following Sunday after the Wedding at the bride&#x27;s parental home, the guests would pay for the meals and entertainments so that the new couple could afford a new home.

=== Humanist weddings ===
While many wedding traditions and rituals have origins in religions and are still performed by religious leaders, some marriage traditions are cultural and predate the prevalent religions in those regions. Non-religious people will often want to have a wedding that is secular (not religious) in content. In order to meet this demand, secular ceremonies carried out by humanist celebrants first developed in the 19th century. Humanists UK members pioneered humanist weddings in the 1890s, and its weddings continue to be popular with couples across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, Humanist Society Scotland (HSS) has carried out secular ceremonies in the country since the 1980s. These have been legally recognized since 2005, and became more numerous than church weddings in 2018.

Humanist wedding ceremonies are carried out in a variety of countries like the U.S., Canada and recently Brazil, having legal status in only a few of these countries. Humanist celebrants are able to perform valid civil marriages and civil partnerships in the Republic of Ireland. Secular weddings are becoming more popular in Ireland due to a declining influence of the Catholic Church. Since 2015, Irish humanists have conducted more weddings than the Church of Ireland.
==Types==
There are many ways to categorize weddings, such as by the size or cultural traditions. A wedding may fall into several categories, such as a destination microwedding, or a civil elopement.

===White wedding===
A white wedding is a term for a traditional formal or semi-formal Western wedding. This term refers to the color of the wedding dress, which became popular after Queen Victoria wore a pure white gown when she married Prince Albert and many were quick to copy her choice. At the time, the color white symbolized both extravagance and virginal purity to many and had become the color for use by young women being formally presented to the royal court. White weddings often take place in a place of worship, such as a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place of worship.

===Civil wedding===
A civil wedding is a ceremony presided over by a local civil authority, such as an elected or appointed judge, Justice of the peace or the mayor of a locality. Civil wedding ceremonies may use references to God or a deity (except in U.K law where readings and music are also restricted), but generally no references to a particular religion or denomination.

Civil weddings allow partners of different faiths to marry without one partner converting to the other partner&#x27;s religion.

They can be either elaborate or simple. Many civil wedding ceremonies take place in local town or city halls, courthouses in judges&#x27; chambers, in attorneys offices, in the mayor&#x27;s office, or in the governor&#x27;s office.

The relevance of civil weddings varies greatly from country to country. Some countries do not provide any form of civil wedding at all (Israel and many Islamic countries), while in others it is the only legally recognized form of marriage (most countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia and The Pacific). In this case civil weddings are typically either a mandatory prerequisite for any religious ceremony or religious weddings have no legal significance at all. See Civil marriage.

===Destination wedding===

Not to be confused with an elopement, a &quot;destination wedding&quot; is one in which a wedding is hosted, often in a vacation-like setting, at a location to which most of the invited guests must travel and often stay for several days. This type of ceremony could be held on a beach, in a metropolitan resort, a hotel, a banquet hall, a mountain, or at the home of a geographically distant friend or relative. During the recession of 2009, destination weddings continued to see growth compared to traditional weddings, as the typically smaller size results in lower costs.

Destination weddings are prohibited in certain denominations of Christianity, such as the Catholic Church, which teach that Christian marriages should take place in the presence of God at church, where Christians began their journey of faith in the sacrament of baptism.

===Double wedding===
A double wedding is a double ceremony where two affianced couples rendezvous for two simultaneous or consecutive weddings. Typically, a fiancé with a sibling or cousin who is also engaged, or four close friends in which both couples within the friendship are engaged might plan a double wedding where both couples legally marry.

===Elopement===
Elopement is the act of getting married, often unexpectedly, without inviting guests to the wedding. In some cases, a small group of family or friends may be present, while in others, the engaged couple may marry without the consent or knowledge of parents or others. While the couple may or may not be widely known to be engaged prior to the elopement, the wedding itself is generally a surprise to those who are later informed of its occurrence.

===Handfasting===
A handfasting is an old pagan custom, dating back to the time of the ancient Celts. A handfasting was originally more like an engagement period, where two people would declare a binding union between themselves for a year and a day. The original handfasting was a trial marriage.

===Highland or Scottish wedding===

A Highland or Scottish wedding has the groom, with some or all of the groom&#x27;s men wear a kilt. The bride may wear a sash or other tartan clothing. The Scottish basket sword is used for any Saber Arch.

===Mass wedding===
A collective or mass wedding is a single ceremony where numerous couples are married simultaneously.

===Microwedding===
A microwedding or minimony is defined by the small number of friends and family members present. The number of guests is usually understood to be no more than 10 or 15 people including family members, although some sources will use this label for a small wedding with up to 50 guests. Compared to an elopement or a civil wedding with no guests, a microwedding is planned and announced in advance and may incorporate whatever traditions and activities the family wants to maintain, such as a wedding cake, photographs, or religious ceremonies. Although the cost per guest may be higher, the overall cost of a microwedding is usually significantly less than a large wedding. 

Microweddings gained attention during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to have a wedding event in compliance with public health restrictions. After pandemic restrictions were lifted, they remained popular, with couples particularly appreciating their significantly lower costs.

===Military wedding===
A military wedding is a ceremony conducted in a military chapel and may involve a Saber Arch. In most military weddings one or both of the people getting married will wear a military dress uniform in lieu of civilian formal wear. Some retired military personnel who marry after their service has ended may opt for a military wedding.

=== Peasant wedding ===
A peasant wedding is a Dutch carnival custom.

Not everywhere in Limburg and Brabant is a &quot;boerenbruiloft&quot; (peasant&#x27;s wedding) part of the carnival. Especially in the northern and central part of Limburg and eastern part of North Brabant is the &quot;boerenbruiloft&quot; very often held during the carnival and is an important part of the carnival culture. Each carnival association has its own tradition concerning choosing the spouse for a wedding. Often the bride and groom are chosen by the council of eleven or by the couple that was married the year before. It is not necessary that the newlyweds are a couple in real life. It is also not necessary that the bride and groom are single. Both the bride and groom, however, should be in love during the carnival and they need to transfer their love to all the people who celebrate their wedding along with them. The highlight of the festival of the peasant wedding is the wedding and feast of the &quot;onecht&quot; (not-marriage) of the bride and groom. There are many aspects that can be found in a real-life marriage. First the engagement will be announced just as if it would be an official marriage. And both the families should learn to know each other very well in organizing the party and the ceremony, like a normal wedding. The two families prepare a piece of entertainment for the wedding. And just like a real wedding, a reception and a feast is organized where guests are asked to wear appropriate clothing. The bride and groom will often dress in wedding clothing from before 1940. The bride, for example, will often wear a poffer, which is a traditional Brabantian headdress.

===Same-sex wedding===

A same-sex wedding is a wedding between two people of the same sex.

===Shotgun wedding===
A shotgun wedding is a wedding in which the groom is reluctant to marry the bride but is strongly encouraged to do so to avoid family, social or legal repercussions. In many cases, the bride is pregnant before the wedding and the family of the bride, most commonly her father, insists that the groom marry the bride before the pregnancy becomes obvious.

===Vow renewal wedding===
A wedding vow renewal is a ceremony in which a married couple renews or reaffirms their wedding vows. Typically, this ceremony is held to commemorate a milestone wedding anniversary. It may also be held to recreate the marriage ceremony in the presence of family and friends, especially in the case of an earlier elopement.

===Weekend wedding===
A weekend wedding is a wedding in which couples and their guests celebrate over the course of an entire weekend. Special activities, such as spa treatments and golf tournaments may be scheduled into the wedding itinerary. Lodging usually is at the same facility as the wedding and couples often host a Sunday brunch for the weekend&#x27;s finale.

=== Black wedding ===
A black wedding, also known as &quot;shvartse khasene&quot; in Yiddish, or a plague wedding, referred to as &quot;mageyfe khasene&quot; in Yiddish, is a Jewish tradition where a wedding takes place in times of crisis, particularly during epidemics. In this custom, the bride and groom, often impoverished orphans, beggars, or individuals with disabilities, are united in marriage as a means to fend off diseases.

==Wedding ceremony participants==


Wedding ceremony participants also referred to as the wedding party, are the people that participate directly in the wedding ceremony itself.

Depending on the location, religion, and style of the wedding, this group may include only the individual people that are marrying, or it may include one or more &quot;brides&quot;, &quot;grooms&quot; (or &quot;bridegrooms&quot;), &quot;persons of honor&quot;, &quot;bridespersons&quot;, &quot;best persons&quot;, &quot;groomsmen&quot;, &quot;flower girls&quot;, &quot;pages&quot;, and &quot;ring bearers&quot;.

A &quot;bride&#x27;s party&quot; consists of those chosen to participate from her family or friends, while a &quot;groom&#x27;s party&quot; consists of those from his family or friends.
* Bride: A woman about to be married.
* Bridegroom or groom: A man about to be married.
* Marriage officiant: The person who officiates at the wedding, validating the wedding from a legal and/or religious standpoint. This person may be a civil celebrant, judge, justice of the peace, or a member of the clergy. In Hindu marriages, the marriage officiant is called a pandit or Brahmin.
* Best Man, Woman, or Person: The chief assistant to a groom at a wedding, typically a sibling, cousin, or friend of special significance in his life. Often holds the wedding rings until their exchange.
* Mothers of a Bride or Groom
* Fathers of a Bride or Groom
* Maid, Matron, Man, or Person of Honor: the title and position held by a bride&#x27;s chief attendant, typically her closest friend or sibling.
* Bridesmaids: the female attendants to a bride. Males in this role may be called honor attendants or sometimes bridesmen.
* Groomsmen or Ushers: The attendants, usually male, to a bridegroom in a wedding ceremony. Female attendants, such as a sister of the groom, are typically called honor attendants or sometimes groomswomen or groomsmaids.
* Pages: Young attendants may carry a bride&#x27;s train. In a formal wedding, the ring bearer is a special page that carries the rings down the aisle. The coin bearer is a similar page that marches on the wedding aisle to bring the wedding coins.
* Flower girls: In some traditions, one or more children carry bouquets or drop flower petals in front of a bride in the wedding procession.

==Wedding industry==
The global wedding industry was worth $300 billion as of 2016. The United States wedding industry alone was estimated to be worth $60 billion as of the same year. In the United States, the wedding industry employs over one million people throughout 600,000 businesses and grows 2% each year. The industry has undergone a transition due to the increased use of technology. Bridal websites, blogs, and social media accounts have driven spending up and created new trends and traditions.

, the average cost of a wedding in the US was $29,858 ($ in current dollars). Extravagant spending on weddings is associated with debt stress and short-lived marriages that end in divorce. Couples who spent less than US$10,000 on all wedding-related expenses, who went on a honeymoon trip, and who had a relatively large number of guests in attendance, were the least likely to divorce. (The cost of the honeymoon itself had no effect.) Couples who start their marriage in debt are more likely to have fights early on their marriage which can lead to divorce. The best way to avoid disagreement is to have open communication with families and plan based on means. Even if the wedding goes well and the couple is happy to be married, the stress of putting on the event can lead to post-wedding anxiety or depression.

A &quot;wedding tax&quot; is the concept of goods or services being purchased for a wedding being more expensive when compared to other events such as a family reunion or anniversary. It is also known as a &quot;wedding markup&quot;. In 2016, an article published by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; identified that 28% of secret shoppers who queried vendors would be charged a wedding markup. Vendors may charge more because they perceive wedding clients as more demanding or willing to spend more. Weddings can also be more time- and labour-intensive events for the vendor (e.g., lengthy planning discussions or ongoing touch-ups for makeup), require additional liability insurance or different materials (e.g., products that can keep the bride&#x27;s hair in place during many hours of activity). Wedding clients may also receive a markup simply because they are more likely to pay compared to other consumers. Clients are also less likely to understand what a baseline price for these products are given that they are not commonplace purchases.

== By country ==
=== Vietnam ===
In the past, the Vietnamese called this ceremony the &quot;bride-fetching ceremony&quot;. Nowadays, it is commonly referred to as the &quot;wedding ceremony&quot; or &quot;nuptial ceremony&quot;. It is a celebration to honor the happiness of the bride, groom, and their two families. This ceremony is also considered important in some societies and is usually only held after the couple has obtained a marriage certificate from the government. Vietnamese weddings often require choosing an auspicious date for the ceremony and the bride&#x27;s arrival at the groom&#x27;s house.

<text>The waltz ( , meaning &quot;to roll or revolve&quot;) is a ballroom and folk dance, in triple (time), performed primarily in closed position. Along with the ländler and allemande, the waltz was sometimes referred to by the generic term German Dance in publications during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

== History ==
There are many references to a sliding or gliding dance, including &quot;volte&quot;, that would evolve into the waltz that date from 16th-century Europe, including the representations of the printmaker Hans Sebald Beham. The French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote of a dance he saw in 1580 in Augsburg, where the dancers held each other so closely that their faces touched. Kunz Haas (of approximately the same period) wrote, &quot;Now they are dancing the godless &quot;Weller&quot; or &quot;Spinner&quot;.&quot; &quot;The vigorous peasant dancer, following an instinctive knowledge of the weight of fall, uses his surplus energy to press all his strength into the proper beat of the bar, thus intensifying his personal enjoyment in dancing.&quot; Around 1750, the lower classes in the regions of Bavaria, Tyrol, and Styria began dancing a couples dance called &quot;Walzer&quot;. The &quot;Ländler&quot;, also known as the &quot;Schleifer&quot;, a country dance in time, was popular in Bohemia, Austria, and Bavaria, and spread from the countryside to the suburbs of the city. While the eighteenth-century upper classes continued to dance the minuets (such as those by Mozart, Haydn and Handel), bored noblemen slipped away to the balls of their servants.

In the 1771 German novel &quot;Geschichte des Fräuleins von Sternheim&quot; by Sophie von La Roche, a high-minded character complains about the newly introduced waltz among aristocrats thus: &quot;But when he put his arm around her, pressed her to his breast, cavorted with her in the shameless, indecent whirling-dance of the Germans and engaged in a familiarity that broke all the bounds of good breeding—then my silent misery turned into burning rage.&quot;

Describing life in Vienna (dated at either 1776 or 1786), Don Curzio wrote, &quot;The people were dancing mad ... The ladies of Vienna are particularly celebrated for their grace and movements of waltzing of which they never tire.&quot; There is a waltz in the second act finale of the 1786 opera &quot;Una Cosa Rara&quot; by Martin y Soler. Soler&#x27;s waltz was marked &quot;andante con moto&quot;, or &quot;at a walking pace with motion&quot;, but the flow of the dance was sped-up in Vienna leading to the &quot;Geschwindwalzer&quot;, and the &quot;Galloppwalzer&quot;.

In the 19th century, the word primarily indicated that the dance was a turning one; one would &quot;waltz&quot; in the polka to indicate rotating rather than going straight forward without turning.

Shocking many when it was first introduced, the waltz became fashionable in Vienna around the 1780s, spreading to many other countries in the years to follow. According to contemporary singer Michael Kelly, it reached England in 1791. During the Napoleonic Wars, infantry soldiers of the King&#x27;s German Legion introduced the dance to the people of Bexhill, Sussex, from 1804.

It became fashionable in Britain during the Regency period, having been made respectable by the endorsement of Dorothea Lieven, wife of the Russian ambassador. Diarist Thomas Raikes later recounted that &quot;No event ever produced so great a sensation in English society as the introduction of the waltz in 1813.&quot; In the same year, a sardonic tribute to the dance by Lord Byron was anonymously published (written the previous autumn). Influential dance master and author of instruction manuals, Thomas Wilson published &quot;A Description of the Correct Method of Waltzing&quot; in 1816. Almack&#x27;s, the most exclusive club in London, permitted the waltz, though the entry in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; shows that it was considered &quot;riotous and indecent&quot; as late as 1825. In &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, by Anne Brontë, in a scene set in 1827, the local vicar Reverend Milward tolerates quadrilles and country dances but intervenes decisively when a waltz is called for, declaring &quot;No, no, I don&#x27;t allow that! Come, it&#x27;s time to be going home.&quot;

The waltz, especially its closed position, became the example for the creation of many other ballroom dances. Subsequently, new types of waltz have developed, including many folk and several ballroom dances.

== Variants ==


In the 19th and early 20th century, numerous different waltz forms existed, including versions performed in , or (sauteuse), and time ( waltz, half and half).

In the 1910s, a form called the Hesitation Waltz was introduced by Vernon and Irene Castle. It incorporated &quot;hesitations&quot; and was danced to fast music. A hesitation is basically a halt on the standing foot during the full waltz bar, with the moving foot suspended in the air or slowly dragged. Similar figures (Hesitation Change, Drag Hesitation, and Cross Hesitation) are incorporated in the International Standard Waltz Syllabus.

The Country Western Waltz is mostly progressive, moving counter clock wise around the dance floor. Both the posture and frame are relaxed, with posture bordering on a slouch. The exaggerated hand and arm gestures of some ballroom styles are not part of this style. Couples may frequently dance in the promenade position, depending on local preferences. Within Country Western waltz, there is the Spanish Waltz and the more modern (for the late 1930s- early 1950s) Pursuit Waltz. At one time it was considered ill treatment for a man to make the woman walk backwards in some locations.

In California, the waltz was banned by Mission priests until 1834 because of the &quot;closed&quot; dance position. Thereafter a Spanish Waltz was danced. This Spanish Waltz was a combination of dancing around the room in closed position, and a &quot;formation&quot; dance of two couples facing each other and performing a sequence of steps. &quot;Valse a Trois Temps&quot; was the &quot;earliest&quot; waltz step, and the Rye Waltz was preferred as a couple dance.
* In contemporary ballroom dance, the fast versions of the waltz are called Viennese waltz as opposed to the Slow waltz.
* In traditional Irish music, the waltz was taught by travelling dancing masters to those who could afford their lessons during the 19th century. By the end of that century, the dance spread to the middle and lower classes of Irish society and traditional triple-tune tunes and songs were altered to fit the waltz rhythm. During the 20th century, the waltz found a distinctively Irish playing style in the hands of Céilidh musicians at dances.
* International Standard Waltz has only closed figures; that is, the couple never breaks the embrace.
* The American Style Waltz, part of the American Smooth ballroom dance syllabus, in contrast to the International Standard Waltz, involves breaking contact almost entirely in some figures. For example, the Syncopated Side-by-Side with Spin includes a free spin for both partners. Open rolls are another good example of an open dance figure, in which the follower alternates between the lead&#x27;s left and right sides, with the lead&#x27;s left or right arm (alone) providing the lead. Waltzes were the staple of many American musicals and films, including &quot;Waltz in Swing Time&quot; sung by Fred Astaire.
* The Scandinavian Waltz, performed as a part of Scandinavian folk dance, can be fast or slow, but the dancers are always rotating.
*The Peruvian Waltz is called and recognised in Peru as &quot;vals criollo&quot;.
* The Mexican Waltz (&quot;vals mexicano&quot;) follows the same basic rhythmic pattern as the standard waltz, but the melodies reflect a strong Spanish influence. Mexico&#x27;s Juventino Rosas wrote &quot;Sobre las Olas&quot; or &quot;Over the Waves&quot;.
* The Cajun Waltz is danced progressively around the floor, and is characterised by the subtle swaying of the hips and step very close to ordinary walking. It is danced entirely in the closed position.
* The Cuban (or Tropical) Waltz follows the pattern of the standard waltz throughout the song.
* The Venezuelan waltz provided a basis for distinctive regional musical composition.
* The Contra Waltz (Freeform Waltz), included in most contra dance evenings, uses both open and closed positions, and incorporates moves from other dances such as swing, modern jive and salsa. Basically the dancers progress around the dance floor with a waltz step, but with no constraints on what moves they can use.
* The Valse Musette, a form of waltz popular in France, started in the late 19th century.
* The cross-step waltz (French Valse Boston) developed in France in the early 20th century and is popular in social waltz groups today.
* In folk dance from the Alsace region, waltzes in odd metres such as , and are found. In modern bal folk, waltzes in even higher metres are played and danced.
* Estonian folk dance Labajalavalss (flat of the foot waltz) performed in time.
*Sama&#x27;i (also known as usul semai) is a vocal piece of Ottoman Turkish music composed in metres. This form and metre (usul in Turkish) is often confused with the completely different Saz Semaisi, an instrumental form consisting of three to four sections, in 10/8 metre, or usul aksak semai (broken semai in Turkish). Semai is one of the most important forms in Ottoman Turkish Sufi music.
*The Tsamikos (, &quot;Tsamikos&quot;) or Kleftikos () is a popular traditional folk dance of Greece, done to music of  metre.

<text>William Shakespeare ( 23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&#x27;s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England&#x27;s national poet and the &quot;Bard of Avon&quot; (or simply &quot;the Bard&quot;). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.

Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (&quot;sharer&quot;) of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, later known as the King&#x27;s Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare&#x27;s private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.

Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and collaborated with other playwrights.

Many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare&#x27;s, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: &quot;not of an age, but for all time&quot;.

==Life==

===Early life===

Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George&#x27;s Day. This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.

Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King&#x27;s New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.

At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway&#x27;s neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.

After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the &quot;complaints bill&quot; of a law case before the Queen&#x27;s Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589. Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;lost years&quot;. Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare&#x27;s first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London. John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain &quot;William Shakeshafte&quot; in his will. Little evidence substantiates such stories other than collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.

===London and theatrical career===
It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his &quot;Groats-Worth of Wit&quot; from that year:

... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his &quot;Tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in a Player&#x27;s hide&quot;, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute &quot;Johannes factotum&quot;, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.

Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene&#x27;s words, but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called &quot;University Wits&quot;). The italicised phrase parodying the line &quot;Oh, tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in a woman&#x27;s hide&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, along with the pun &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene&#x27;s target. As used here, &quot;Johannes Factotum&quot; (&quot;Jack of all trades&quot;) refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common &quot;universal genius&quot;.

Greene&#x27;s attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare&#x27;s work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene&#x27;s remarks. After 1594, Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were performed at The Theatre, in Shoreditch, only by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King&#x27;s Men.

In 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare&#x27;s property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.

Some of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; names him on the cast lists for &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; (1598) and &quot;Sejanus His Fall&quot; (1603). The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot; is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of &quot;the Principal Actors in all these Plays&quot;, some of which were first staged after &quot;Volpone&quot;, although one cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that &quot;good Will&quot; played &quot;kingly&quot; roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and the Chorus in &quot;Henry V&quot;, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.

Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helen&#x27;s, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there. By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women&#x27;s wigs and other headgear.

===Later years and death===
Nicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford &quot;some years before his death&quot;. He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers&#x27; petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King&#x27;s Men &quot;placed men players&quot; there, &quot;which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.&quot;. However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in &quot;Bellott v Mountjoy&quot;, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy&#x27;s daughter, Mary. In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall. After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King&#x27;s Men. He retired in 1613, before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of &quot;Henry VIII&quot; on 29 June.

Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52. He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in &quot;perfect health&quot;. No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: &quot;Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted&quot;, not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: &quot;We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went&#x27;st so soon / From the world&#x27;s stage to the grave&#x27;s tiring room.&quot;

He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607, and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare&#x27;s death. Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, Thomas Quiney, his new son-in-law, was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, both of whom had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.

Shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to &quot;the first son of her body&quot;. The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying. The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare&#x27;s direct line. Shakespeare&#x27;s will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically. He did make a point, however, of leaving her &quot;my second best bed&quot;, a bequest that has led to much speculation. Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.

Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death. The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:

Some time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil. In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published. Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey.

==Plays==

Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.

The first recorded works of Shakespeare are &quot;Richard III&quot; and the three parts of &quot;Henry VI&quot;, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew,&quot; and &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; may also belong to Shakespeare&#x27;s earliest period. His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot;, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; was also based on classical models, but no source for &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; has been found, though it has an identical plot but different wording as another play with a similar name. Like &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the &quot;Shrew&quot;″s story of the taming of a woman&#x27;s independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.

Shakespeare&#x27;s early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies. &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes. Shakespeare&#x27;s next comedy, the equally romantic &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. The wit and wordplay of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, the charming rural setting of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and the lively merrymaking of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; complete Shakespeare&#x27;s sequence of great comedies. After the lyrical &quot;Richard II&quot;, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;. &quot;Henry IV&quot; features Falstaff, rogue, wit and friend of Prince Hal. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;—based on Sir Thomas North&#x27;s 1579 translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;—which introduced a new kind of drama. According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare&#x27;s own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other&quot;.

In the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called &quot;problem plays&quot; &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; and a number of his best known tragedies. Many critics believe that Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies represent the peak of his art. Hamlet has probably been analysed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins &quot;To be or not to be; that is the question&quot;. Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, Othello and Lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement. The plots of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. In &quot;Othello&quot;, Iago stokes Othello&#x27;s sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. In &quot;King Lear&quot;, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear&#x27;s youngest daughter, Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, &quot;the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty&quot;. In &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn. In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, contain some of Shakespeare&#x27;s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot. Eliot wrote, &quot;Shakespeare acquired more essential history from Plutarch than most men could from the whole British Museum.&quot;

In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, as well as the collaboration, &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare&#x27;s part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, &quot;Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, probably with John Fletcher.

===Classification===

Shakespeare&#x27;s works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies. Two plays not included in the First Folio, &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; and &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today&#x27;s scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio, partly because the collection was compiled by men of theatre.

In the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them &quot;tragicomedies&quot;, Dowden&#x27;s term is often used. In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term &quot;problem plays&quot; to describe four plays: &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida,&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. &quot;Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies&quot;, he wrote. &quot;We may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare&#x27;s problem plays.&quot; The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though &quot;Hamlet&quot; is definitively classed as a tragedy.

===Performances===
It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. After the plagues of 1592–93, Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of &quot;Henry IV&quot;, Leonard Digges recording, &quot;Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room&quot;. When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark. The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Othello,&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;.
After the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men were renamed the King&#x27;s Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King&#x27;s Men performed seven of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, for example, Jupiter descends &quot;in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees.&quot;

The actors in Shakespeare&#x27;s company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, and &quot;King Lear&quot;. The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and Dogberry in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, among other characters. He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in &quot;As You Like It&quot; and the fool in &quot;King Lear&quot;. In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that &quot;Henry VIII&quot; &quot;was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony&quot;. On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.
===Textual sources===

In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare&#x27;s friends from the King&#x27;s Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time. The others had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as &quot;stol&#x27;n and surreptitious copies&quot;.

Alfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as &quot;bad quartos&quot; because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the others. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare&#x27;s own papers. In some cases, for example, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida,&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of &quot;King Lear&quot;, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot; prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.

==Poems==
In 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime. A third narrative poem, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the &quot;Sonnets&quot; in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. &quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot;, printed in Robert Chester&#x27;s 1601 &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot;, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;, published under Shakespeare&#x27;s name but without his permission.

===Sonnets===

Published in 1609, the &quot;Sonnets&quot; were the last of Shakespeare&#x27;s non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership. Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;sugred Sonnets among his private friends&quot;. Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare&#x27;s intended sequence. He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the &quot;dark lady&quot;), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the &quot;fair youth&quot;). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial &quot;I&quot; who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets &quot;Shakespeare unlocked his heart&quot;.

The 1609 edition was dedicated to a &quot;Mr. W.H.&quot;, credited as &quot;the only begetter&quot; of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication. Critics praise the &quot;Sonnets&quot; as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.

==Style==
Shakespeare&#x27;s first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; has been described as stilted.

However, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of &quot;Richard III&quot; has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard&#x27;s vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare&#x27;s mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Richard II&quot;, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.

Shakespeare&#x27;s standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony. Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet&#x27;s mind:

After &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as &quot;more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical&quot;. In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. In &quot;Macbeth&quot;, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: &quot;was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?&quot; (1.7.35–38); &quot;... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven&#x27;s cherubim, hors&#x27;d/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...&quot; (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.

Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare&#x27;s mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare&#x27;s late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.

===Influence===

Shakespeare&#x27;s work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre. Until &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters&#x27; minds. His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as &quot;feeble variations on Shakespearean themes&quot;. John Milton, considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare, wrote in tribute: &quot;Thou in our wonder and astonishment/ Hast built thyself a live-long monument.&quot;

Shakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville&#x27;s soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is a classic tragic hero, inspired by &quot;King Lear&quot;. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare&#x27;s works, including Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s overture and incidental music for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. His work has inspired several operas, among them Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot;, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites, while William Hogarth&#x27;s 1745 painting of actor David Garrick playing Richard III was decisive in establishing the genre of theatrical portraiture in Britain. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated &quot;Macbeth&quot; into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature. Shakespeare has been a rich source for filmmakers; Akira Kurosawa adapted &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot; as &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; and &quot;Ran&quot;, respectively. Other examples of Shakespeare on film include Max Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Al Pacino&#x27;s documentary &quot;Looking For Richard&quot;. Orson Welles, a lifelong lover of Shakespeare, directed and starred in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;, in which he plays John Falstaff, which Welles himself called his best work.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s day, English grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now, and his use of language helped shape modern English. Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, the first serious work of its type. Expressions such as &quot;with bated breath&quot; (&quot;Merchant of Venice&quot;) and &quot;a foregone conclusion&quot; (&quot;Othello&quot;) have found their way into everyday English speech.

Shakespeare&#x27;s influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany, and gradually became a &quot;classic of the German Weimar era;&quot; Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in any language. Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes, &quot;this master, this titan, this genius, so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal, each different culture – German, Italian, Russian – was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part, they embraced it, and him, with joyous abandon, as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English, and non-European. He is that unique writer: he has something for everyone.&quot;

According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Shakespeare remains the world&#x27;s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history.

===Critical reputation===

Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise. In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English playwrights as &quot;the most excellent&quot; in both comedy and tragedy. The authors of the &quot;Parnassus&quot; plays at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, numbered him with Chaucer, Gower, and Spenser. In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the &quot;Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage&quot;, although he had remarked elsewhere that &quot;Shakespeare wanted art&quot; (lacked skill).

Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson. Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, &quot;I admire him, but I love Shakespeare&quot;. He also famously remarked that Shakespeare &quot;was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards, and found her there.&quot; For several decades, Rymer&#x27;s view held sway. But during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and, like Dryden, to acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation. By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet, and described as the &quot;Bard of Avon&quot; (or simply &quot;the Bard&quot;). In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.

During the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism. In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s genius often bordered on adulation. &quot;This King Shakespeare,&quot; the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, &quot;does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible&quot;. The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale. The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as &quot;bardolatry&quot;, claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen&#x27;s plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.

The modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T. S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;primitiveness&quot; in fact made him truly modern. Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare&#x27;s imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for post-modern studies of Shakespeare. Comparing Shakespeare&#x27;s accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology, Harold Bloom wrote, &quot;Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He &quot;encloses&quot; us because we &quot;see&quot; with his fundamental perceptions.&quot;

==Speculation==
===Authorship===
Around 230 years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him. Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Several &quot;group theories&quot; have also been proposed. All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution, but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.

===Religion===

Shakespeare conformed to the official state religion, but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. Shakespeare&#x27;s will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. 

Some scholars are of the view that members of Shakespeare&#x27;s family were Catholics, at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law. Shakespeare&#x27;s mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church &quot;for fear of process for debt&quot;, a common Catholic excuse. In 1606, the name of William&#x27;s daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. 

Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare&#x27;s religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare&#x27;s Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.

===Sexuality===

Few details of Shakespeare&#x27;s sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love. The 26 so-called &quot;Dark Lady&quot; sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.

===Portraiture===

No written contemporary description of Shakespeare&#x27;s physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, re-paintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people. 

Some scholars suggest that the Droeshout portrait, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness, and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. Of the claimed paintings, art historian Tarnya Cooper concluded that the Chandos portrait had &quot;the strongest claim of any of the known contenders to be a true portrait of Shakespeare&quot;. After a three-year study supported by the National Portrait Gallery, London, the portrait&#x27;s owners, Cooper contended that its composition date, contemporary with Shakespeare, its subsequent provenance, and the sitter&#x27;s attire, all supported the attribution.

<text>William Kennedy Laurie Dickson (3 August 1860 – 28 September 1935) was a British-American inventor who devised an early motion picture camera under the employment of Thomas Edison.

==Early life==
William Kennedy Dickson was born on 3 August 1860 in Le Minihic-sur-Rance, Brittany, France. His mother, Elizabeth Kennedy-Laurie (1823–1879) was American, born in Virginia. His father was James Waite Dickson, a Scottish artist, astronomer and linguist. James Dickson claimed direct lineage from the painter William Hogarth, and from Judge John Waite, the man who sentenced King Charles I to death.

==Inventor and film innovator==
At age 19 in 1879, William Dickson wrote a letter to American inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison seeking employment. He was turned down. That same year Dickson, his mother, and two sisters moved from Britain to Virginia. In 1883 he was finally hired to work at Edison&#x27;s laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. In 1888, Edison conceived of a device that would do &quot;for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear&quot;. In October, Edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office; outlining his plans for the device, subsequently named the Kinetoscope. Dickson, then the Edison company&#x27;s official photographer, was assigned to turn the concept into a reality.

Initial attempts were focused on recording micro-photographs on a cylinder. In late 1889, inspired by a recent encounter with Étienne-Jules Marey, Edison came up with a fourth caveat and ordered the team to change direction to work with rolls of film. William Dickson collaborated with the Eastman company to develop a practical celluloid film for this application. Initially using 19mm film, fed horizontally, shooting circular images, Dickson eventually settled on 35 mm film with a 1.33:1 picture ratio, a standard format which is still in use to this day in cinema.

William Dickson and his team, at the Edison lab, simultaneously worked on the development of the Kinetoscope viewing machine. The first working prototype, using the 19mm film, was unveiled in May 1891 to a meeting of the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, hosted by his wife. The 35mm camera was essentially finalised by the fall of 1892. The completed version of the 35mm Kinetoscope was unveiled at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on 9 May 1893. It was a peep show machine showing a continuous loop of film, lit by a small lamp, viewed individually through the window of a cabinet housing its components.

William Dickson and his team created the illusion of movement by continuously moving the strip of perforated film, bearing sequential images, whilst illuminating it by brief flashes of light through the slit in a rotating shutter. They also devised the Kinetograph, a motion picture camera to photograph films for in-house experiments and eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations, at speeds of up to 46 frames per second. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.

In late 1894 or early 1895, William Dickson became an ad hoc advisor to the motion picture operation of the Latham brothers, Otway and Grey, who ran one of the leading Kinetoscope exhibition companies, and their father, Woodville Latham who had lectured in science. Seeking to develop a movie projector system, they hired former Edison employee Eugene Lauste, probably at Dickson&#x27;s suggestion. In April 1895, Dickson left Edison&#x27;s employ and provided some assistance to the Latham outfit. Alongside Lauste, he may have devised what would become known as the Latham loop, allowing the photography and exhibition of much longer filmstrips than had previously been possible. This idea had first been made public in 1890 in descriptions of the moving picture camera of William Friese-Greene. These former Edison associates helped to design the Eidoloscope projector system and a widescreen camera to film with, which would be used in the first commercial movie screening in world history on 20 May 1895. But Dickson soon parted company with them, to become part of the group that formed the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, returning permanently to work in the United Kingdom in 1897 for the British side of the company. William Dickson was the first person to make a film of the Pope, and at the time his Biograph camera was blessed by Pope Leo XIII.

The Mutoscope machines produced moving images by means of a revolving drum of photographs/frames, similar in concept to flip-books, taken from an actual piece of film. They were often featured at seaside locations, showing (usually) sequences of women undressing or acting as an artist&#x27;s model. In Britain, they became known as &quot;What the butler saw&quot; machines, taking the name from one of the first and most famous softcore reels.

==Death==
His association with Biograph ended inexplicably in 1911. Dickson spent his last years quietly in his house in Twickenham, England. He died on 28 September 1935, at the age of 75. He died without being given credit for his contributions to the history of modern filmography. This omission was corrected by the exhaustive research of Gordon Hendricks and Paul Spehr who revealed the full extent of his contributions to many moving picture projects.

==Legacy==
Dickson was the first to direct and likely star in a film with live recording. In 1894, he directed &quot;The Dickson Experimental Sound Film&quot;. A man (likely Dickson) played &quot;The Song of the Cabin Boy&quot; on the violin into a megaphone used for a partially off-camera phonograph. The film was the first to use the Kinetophone, the first device used in the earliest sound films.

<doc id="32899" wikidata="Q125879" url="?curid=32899" title="William Alston">
<text>William Payne Alston (November 29, 1921 – September 13, 2009) was an American philosopher. He is widely considered to be one of the most important epistemologists and philosophers of religion of the twentieth century, and is also known for his work in metaphysics and the philosophy of language. His views on foundationalism, internalism and externalism, speech acts, and the epistemic value of mystical experience, among many other topics, have been very influential. He earned his PhD from the University of Chicago and taught at the University of Michigan, Rutgers University, University of Illinois, and Syracuse University.

== Early life and education ==
Alston was born to Eunice Schoolfield and William Alston on November 29, 1921, in Shreveport, Louisiana. He graduated from high school when he was 15 and went on to Centenary College of Louisiana, graduating in 1942 with a Bachelor of Music in piano. During World War II, he played clarinet and bass drum in a military band in California. During this time, he became interested in philosophy, sparked by W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s book &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, and read the works of well-known philosophers such as Jacques Maritain, Mortimer J. Adler, Francis Bacon, Plato, René Descartes, and John Locke. Alston was honorably discharged from the US army in 1946, going on to enter a graduate program for philosophy at the University of Chicago, even though he had never formally taken a class on the subject. While he was there, he learned more about philosophy from Richard McKeon and Charles Hartshorne, and he received his PhD in 1951. His dissertation was on the subject of the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead.

== Career ==
From 1949 until 1971, Alston was a professor at the University of Michigan, and he became professor of philosophy in 1961. He then taught at Rutgers University for five years, followed by the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1976 to 1980 and then Syracuse University from 1980 to 1992. Alston&#x27;s early work was on the philosophy of language, later going on to focus on epistemology and the philosophy of religion from the early 1970s onwards.

Together with Alvin Plantinga, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Robert Adams, and Michael L. Peterson, Alston helped to found the journal &quot;Faith and Philosophy&quot;. With Plantinga, Wolterstorff, and others, Alston was also responsible for the development of &quot;Reformed epistemology&quot; (a term that Alston, an Episcopalian, never fully endorsed), one of the most important contributions to Christian thought in the twentieth century. Alston was president of the Western Division (now the Central Division) of the American Philosophical Association in 1979, the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and the Society of Christian Philosophers, which he co-founded. He was widely recognized as one of the core figures in the late twentieth-century revival of the philosophy of religion. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.

== Death ==
Alston died in a nursing home in Jamesville, New York, on September 13, 2009, at the age of 87.

<doc id="32901" wikidata="Q25089" url="?curid=32901" title="Woody Allen">
<text>Heywood Allen (born Allan Stewart Konigsberg; November 30, 1935) is an American filmmaker, actor, and comedian whose career spans more than six decades. Allen has received many accolades, including the most nominations (16) for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He has won four Academy Awards, ten BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards and a Grammy Award, as well as nominations for a Emmy Award and a Tony Award. Allen was awarded an Honorary Golden Lion in 1995, the BAFTA Fellowship in 1997, an Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or in 2002, and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2014. Two of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

Allen began his career writing material for television in the 1950s, alongside Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart, and Neil Simon. He also published several books of short stories and wrote humor pieces for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In the early 1960s, he performed as a stand-up comedian in Greenwich Village, where he developed a monologue style (rather than traditional jokes) and the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful . During this time, he released three comedy albums, earning a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album nomination for the self-titled &quot;Woody Allen&quot; (1964). 

After writing, directing, and starring in a string of slapstick comedies, such as &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; (1969), &quot;Bananas&quot; (1971), &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973), and &quot;Love and Death&quot; (1975), he directed &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), a romantic comedy-drama featuring Allen and his frequent collaborator Diane Keaton. The film won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actress for Keaton. Allen has directed many films set in New York City, including &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), and &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989).

Allen continued to garner acclaim, making a film almost every year, and is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of auteur filmmakers whose work has been influenced by European art cinema. His films include &quot;Interiors&quot; (1978), &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980), &quot;Zelig&quot; (1983), &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot; (1984), &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987), &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992), &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994), &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005), &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot; (2008), &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011), and &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; (2013).

In 1980, Allen began a professional and personal relationship with actress Mia Farrow. Over a decade-long period, they collaborated on 13 films. The couple separated after Allen began a relationship in 1991 with Mia&#x27;s and Andre Previn&#x27;s 21-year-old adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. Allen married Previn in 1997. They have two adopted daughters. In 1992, Farrow publicly accused Allen of sexually abusing their adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow. The allegation gained substantial media attention, but two judicial investigations did not find it credible. Allen was never charged or prosecuted, and has vehemently denied the allegation.

== Early life and education ==

Allen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg at Mount Eden Hospital in Bronx, New York City, on November 30, 1935, to Nettie (&quot;née&quot; Cherry; 1906–2002), a bookkeeper at her family&#x27;s delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (1900–2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Austria and Panevėžys, Lithuania. They spoke German, Hebrew, and Yiddish. He and his younger sister, film producer Letty Aronson, were raised in Brooklyn&#x27;s Midwood neighborhood. Both their parents were born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Allen&#x27;s parents did not get along, and he had an estranged relationship with his mother. He spoke German in his early years. While attending Hebrew school for eight years, he also attended Public School 99, now the Isaac Asimov School for Science and Literature, and then Midwood High School, from which he graduated in 1953. Unlike his comic persona, he was more interested in baseball than school and was picked first for teams. He impressed students with his talent for cards and magic tricks.

At age 17, he legally changed his name to Heywood Allen and later began to call himself Woody. According to Allen, his first published joke read: &quot;Woody Allen says he ate at a restaurant that had O.P.S. prices—over people&#x27;s salaries.&quot; He was soon earning more than both of his parents combined. After high school, he attended New York University, studying communication and film in 1953, before dropping out after failing the course &quot;Motion Picture Production&quot;. He briefly attended City College of New York in 1954, dropping out during his first semester. He taught himself rather than studying in the classroom. He later taught at The New School and studied with writing teacher Lajos Egri.

== Career ==

Note: For a list of Allen&#x27;s films, see Woody Allen filmography.

=== 1955–1959: Comedy writer and television work ===
Allen began writing short jokes when he was 15, and the next year began offering them to various Broadway writers for sale. One of them, Abe Burrows, co-author of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, wrote, &quot;Wow! His stuff was dazzling.&quot; Burrows wrote Allen letters of introduction to Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, and Peter Lind Hayes, who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples. As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer&#x27;s Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on &quot;The NBC Comedy Hour&quot; in Los Angeles, then a job as a full-time writer for humorist Herb Shriner, initially earning $25 a week. He began writing scripts for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, specials for Sid Caesar post-&quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1954–1957), and other television shows. By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week. He worked alongside Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart, and Neil Simon. He also worked with Danny Simon, whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style. In 2021, Brooks said of working with Allen, &quot;Woody was so young then. I was about 24 when I started, but Woody must have been 19, but so wise, so smart. He had this tricky little mind and he&#x27;d surprise you, which is the trick of being a good comedy writer.&quot; In 1962 alone, he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics. Allen also wrote for &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and appeared in several episodes.

He wrote jokes for the Buddy Hackett sitcom &quot;Stanley&quot; and &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom,&quot; and in 1958 he co-wrote a few Sid Caesar specials with Larry Gelbart. Composer Mary Rodgers said he was gaining a reputation. When given an assignment for a show, he would leave and come back the next day with &quot;reams of paper&quot;, according to producer Max Liebman. Similarly, after he wrote for Bob Hope, Hope called him &quot;half a genius&quot;. Dick Cavett said: &quot;He can go to a typewriter after breakfast and sit there until the sun sets and his head is pounding, interrupting work only for coffee and a brief walk, and then spend the whole evening working.&quot; Allen once estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing. He enjoyed writing, despite the work: &quot;Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper. And I can&#x27;t wait to fill it!&quot;

Allen started writing short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; he was inspired by the tradition of &quot;New Yorker&quot; humorists S. J. Perelman, George S. Kaufman, Robert Benchley, and Max Shulman, whose material he modernized. His collections of short pieces include &quot;Getting Even&quot;, &quot;Without Feathers&quot;, &quot;Side Effects&quot;, and &quot;Mere Anarchy&quot;. In 2010 Allen released audio versions of his books in which he read 73 selections entitled, &quot;The Woody Allen Collection&quot;. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

=== 1960–1969: Stand-up comedian ===
From 1960 to 1969 Allen performed as a comedian in various places around Greenwich Village, including The Bitter End and Cafe Au Go Go, alongside such contemporaries as Lenny Bruce, the team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Joan Rivers, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Dick Cavett, Bill Cosby and Mort Sahl (his personal favorite), as well as such other artists of the day as Bob Dylan and Barbra Streisand. Comedian Milton Berle claims to have suggested to Allen to go into standup comedy and even introduced him at the Village Vanguard. Comedy historian Gerald Nachman writes, &quot;He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.&quot;

Allen&#x27;s new manager, Jack Rollins, suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. &quot;I&#x27;d never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.&quot; Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian Shelley Berman introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.

In his early stand-up shows, Allen did not improvise: &quot;I put very little premium on improvisation&quot;, he told Studs Terkel. His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: &quot;I don&#x27;t think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.&quot; And although he was described as a &quot;classic nebbish&quot;, he did not tell the standard Jewish jokes of the period. Comedy screenwriter Larry Gelbart compared Allen&#x27;s style to Elaine May&#x27;s: &quot;He just styled himself completely after her&quot;.

Cavett recalled seeing the Blue Angel audience mostly ignore Allen&#x27;s monologue: &quot;I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.&quot; It was his subdued stage presence that eventually became one of Allen&#x27;s strongest traits, Nachman argues: &quot;The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.&quot; Allen brought innovation to the comedy monologue genre.
Allen first appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on November 1, 1963, and over nine years his guest appearances included 17 in the host&#x27;s chair. He subsequently released three LP albums of live nightclub recordings: the self-titled &quot;Woody Allen&quot; (1964), &quot;Volume 2&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Third Woody Allen Album&quot; (1968), recorded at a fund-raiser for Senator Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s presidential run. In 1965, Allen filmed a half-hour standup special in England for Granada Television, titled &quot;The Woody Allen Show&quot; in the U.K. and &quot;Woody Allen: Standup Comic&quot; in the U.S. It is the only complete standup show of Allen&#x27;s on film. The same year, Allen, along with Nichols and May, Barbra Streisand, Carol Channing, Harry Belafonte, Julie Andrews, Carol Burnett, and Alfred Hitchcock, took part in Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s inaugural gala in Washington, D.C., on January 18, 1965. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson described Allen and the event in her published diary, &quot;A White House Diary&quot;, writing in part, &quot;Woody Allen, that forlorn, undernourished little comedian, stopped shooting a movie in Paris and flew across the Atlantic for about five minutes of jokes&quot;.

In 1966, Allen wrote an hour-long musical comedy television special for CBS, &quot;Gene Kelly in New York City&quot;. It focused on Gene Kelly in a musical tour around Manhattan, dancing along such landmarks as Rockefeller Center, the Plaza Hotel and the Museum of Modern Art, which serve as backdrops for the show&#x27;s production numbers. Guest stars included choreographer Gower Champion, British musical comedy star Tommy Steele, and singer Damita Jo DeBlanc. In 1967, Allen hosted a TV special for NBC, &quot;Woody Allen Looks at 1967&quot;. It featured Liza Minnelli, who acted alongside Allen in some skits; Aretha Franklin, the musical guest; and conservative writer William F. Buckley, the featured guest. In 1969, Allen hosted his first American special for CBS television, &quot;The Woody Allen Special&quot;, which included skits with Candice Bergen, a musical performance by the 5th Dimension, and an interview between Allen and Billy Graham.

Allen also performed standup comedy on other series, including &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; and &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, where he interacted with other guests and occasionally sang. In 1971, he hosted one of his final &quot;Tonight Shows&quot;, with guests Bob Hope and James Coco. Hope praised Allen on the show, calling him &quot;one of the finest young talents in show business and a great delight&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; magazine put Allen on the cover of its March 21, 1969, issue.

=== 1965–1976: Broadway debut and early films ===

Allen&#x27;s first movie was the Charles K. Feldman production &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965) Allen was disappointed with the final product, which led him to direct every film he wrote thereafter except &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;. Allen&#x27;s first directorial effort was &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot; (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose). That same year, Allen wrote the play &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot;, starring Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette, and Allen&#x27;s future movie co-star Tony Roberts. In 1994 Allen directed and starred in a second version for television, with Michael J. Fox and Mayim Bialik.

The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;, which opened on February 12, 1969, starring Allen, Diane Keaton and Roberts. The play received a positive review from Clive Barnes of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who wrote, &quot;Not only are Mr. Allen&#x27;s jokes—with their follow-ups, asides, and twists—audaciously brilliant (only Neil Simon and Elaine May can equal him in this season&#x27;s theater) but he has a great sense of character&quot;. The play was significant to Keaton&#x27;s budding career, and she has said she was in &quot;awe&quot; of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him. In 2013, Keaton said that she &quot;fell in love with him right away&quot;, adding, &quot;I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it.&quot; For her performance she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent film version of &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;, she acted in seven more of his films. including &quot;Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Love and Death&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Interiors&quot;, and &quot;Manhattan&quot;. Keaton said of their collaboration: &quot;He showed me the ropes and I followed his lead. He is the most disciplined person I know. He works very hard&quot;.
In 1969, Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote with Mickey Rose the mockumentary crime comedy &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, in which he plays the low-level thief Virgil Starkwell. The film received positive reviews; critic Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Allen has made a movie that is, in effect, a feature-length, two-reel comedy—something very special and eccentric and funny.&quot; In 1971, Allen wrote and directed the slapstick comedy film &quot;Bananas&quot;, in which he plays Fielding Mellish, a bumbling New Yorker who becomes involved in a revolution in a country in Latin America. The film also starred Louise Lasser as his romantic interest. In an interview with Roger Ebert, Allen said, &quot;The big, broad laugh comedy is a form that&#x27;s rarely made these days and sometimes I think it&#x27;s the hardest kind of movie to make...with a comedy like &quot;Bananas&quot;, if they&#x27;re not laughing, you&#x27;re dead, because laughs are all you have.&quot;

The next year, Allen made the film &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;, starring Allen, Gene Wilder, Lou Jacobi, Anthony Quayle, Tony Randall, and Burt Reynolds, which received mixed reviews. &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;the jokes are well-worn, and good, manic ideas are congealing into formulas&quot;. Allen reunited with Keaton in &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973), the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and Marshall Brickman.

Allen collaborated again with Keaton in the comedy &quot;Love and Death&quot; (1975), set during the Napoleonic era and a satire of Russian literature and film. At the time of its release, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film Allen&#x27;s &quot;grandest work&quot;. In 1976, Allen starred as cashier Howard Prince in the Hollywood blacklist comedy-drama &quot;The Front,&quot; directed by Martin Ritt and co-starring Zero Mostel.

===1977–1989: Established career ===
In 1977 Allen wrote, directed, and starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, which became his seminal and most personal work. He played Alvy Singer, a comic evaluating his past relationship with Annie Hall, portrayed by Diane Keaton. Critic Roger Ebert praised the film, saying Allen had &quot;developed...into a much more thoughtful and...more mature director&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Allen&#x27;s direction, specifically citing his hiring of actors in the film such as Shelley Duvall, Paul Simon, Carol Kane, Colleen Dewhurst, and Christopher Walken. In an interview with journalist Katie Couric, Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for and about her. The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Keaton, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Director for Allen. It was ranked 35th on the &quot;American Film Institute&quot; &quot;100 Best Movies&quot; and fourth on the AFI list of the &quot;100 Best Comedies&quot;. The screenplay was also named the funniest ever written by the Writers Guild of America in its list of the &quot;101 Funniest Screenplays&quot;. In 1992, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 1979, Allen paid tribute at the Film Society at Lincoln Center to one of his comedy idols, Bob Hope, who said of the honor: &quot;It&#x27;s great to have your past spring up in front of your eyes, especially when it&#x27;s done by Woody Allen, because he&#x27;s a near genius. Not a whole genius, but a near genius&quot;. With &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), Allen directed a comic homage to New York City, focused on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), co-starring Keaton and Meryl Streep. Keaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, &quot;He just has a mind like nobody else. He&#x27;s bold. He&#x27;s got a lot of strength, a lot of courage in terms of his work. And that is what it takes to do something really unique.&quot;

&quot;Stardust Memories&quot; was based on &quot;8½&quot;, which it parodies, and &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;. Allen&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; was adapted from &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;. &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, &quot;Another Woman&quot; and &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; have elements reminiscent of &quot;Wild Strawberries.&quot; In &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980), Allen&#x27;s character says, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make funny movies anymore&quot; and a running gag has various people (including visiting space aliens) telling him that they appreciate his films, &quot;especially the early, funny ones&quot;. Allen considers it one of his best films. In 1981, Allen&#x27;s play &quot;The Floating Light Bulb&quot;, starring Danny Aiello and Bea Arthur, premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Frank Rich gave the play a mild review, writing, &quot;there are a few laughs, a few well-wrought characters, and, in Act II, a beautifully written scene that leads to a moving final curtain&quot;. Allen has written several off-Broadway one-act plays, including &quot;Riverside Drive&quot;, &quot;Old Saybrook&quot; (at the Atlantic Theater Company), and &quot;A Second Hand Memory&quot; (at the Variety Arts Theatre).

&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982) was the first movie Allen made with Mia Farrow, who stepped into Diane Keaton&#x27;s role when Keaton was shooting &quot;Reds&quot;. He next directed &quot;Zelig&quot;, in which he starred as a man whose appearance transforms to match that of those around him. &quot;Radio Days&quot;, a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio, co-starred Farrow in a part Allen wrote for her. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; one of the 100 best films of all time. Allen has called it one of his three best films, with &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; and &quot;Match Point&quot;. In 1989, Allen and directors Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese made &quot;New York Stories&quot;, an anthology film about New Yorkers. Vincent Canby called Allen&#x27;s contribution, &quot;Oedipus Wrecks&quot;, &quot;priceless&quot;.

=== 1990–2004: Continued work ===
Allen&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; is a black-and-white homage to the German expressionists and features the music of Kurt Weill. Allen then made his critically acclaimed comedy-drama &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Judy Davis and Best Original Screenplay for Allen. &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of Diane Keaton, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.

He returned to lighter fare such as the showbiz comedy involving mobsters &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; are similar to musicals starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The comedy &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Mira Sorvino. Allen&#x27;s 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Sean Penn (Best Actor) and Samantha Morton (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997) and &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998).
On March 8, 1995, Allen&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Central Park West&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;concordtheatricals/12825&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; opened&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1995/urban-neuroses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; off-Broadway as a part of a larger piece titled &quot;Death Defying Acts&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;concordtheatricals/2909&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with two other one-act plays, one by David Mamet and one by Elaine May. Critics described Allen&#x27;s contribution as &quot;the longest and most substantial of the evening&quot;. During this decade Allen also starred in the television film &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1995), based on the Neil Simon play of the same name, and made a sitcom &quot;appearance&quot; via telephone in a 1997 episode, &quot;My Dinner with Woody&quot;, of &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; that paid tribute to several of his films. He provided the voice of Z in DreamWorks&#x27; first animated film, &quot;Antz&quot; (1998), which featured many actors he had worked with; Allen&#x27;s character was similar to his earlier roles.

&quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000) was Allen&#x27;s first film with the DreamWorks studio and represented a change in direction: he began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. The film is similar to the 1942 film &quot;Larceny, Inc.&quot; (from a play by S. J. Perelman). Allen never commented on whether this was deliberate or if his film was in any way inspired by it. &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically, but Allen&#x27;s next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen&#x27;s most costly film, &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot; (with a budget of $26 million). &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot;, &quot;Anything Else&quot;, and &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; have &quot;rotten&quot; ratings on film-review website Rotten Tomatoes and each earned less than $4 million domestically. Some critics claimed that Allen&#x27;s early 2000s films were subpar and expressed concern that his best years were behind him. Others were less harsh; reviewing the little-liked &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;I cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous film, if each new one was Woody&#x27;s Sundance debut, it would get a better reception. His reputation is not a dead shark but an albatross, which with admirable economy Allen has arranged for the critics to carry around their own necks.&quot;

=== 2005–2014: Career resurgence ===

&quot;In the United States things have changed a lot, and it&#x27;s hard to make good small films now&quot;, Allen said in a 2004 interview. &quot;The avaricious studios couldn&#x27;t care less about good films—if they get a good film they&#x27;re twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million.&quot; Allen traveled to London, where he made &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005), one of his most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews. Set in London, it starred Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson. It is markedly darker than Allen&#x27;s first four films with DreamWorks SKG. In &quot;Match Point&quot; Allen shifts focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London. The film earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in international box office sales. It earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing – Original Screenplay, with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987. In a 2006 interview with &quot;Premiere Magazine&quot; he said it was the best film he had ever made.

Allen reached an agreement to film &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot; in Avilés, Barcelona, and Oviedo, Spain, where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie featured Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Hall and Penélope Cruz. The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival to rapturous reviews, and became a box office success. &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot; won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe awards. Cruz received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In April 2008 he began filming &quot;Whatever Works&quot;, a film aimed more toward older audiences, starring Larry David, Patricia Clarkson, and Evan Rachel Wood. Released in 2009 and described as a dark comedy, it follows the story of a botched suicide attempt turned messy love triangle. Allen wrote &quot;Whatever Works&quot; in the 1970s, and David&#x27;s character was written for Zero Mostel, who died the year &quot;Annie Hall&quot; came out. Allen was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. &quot;You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger&quot;, filmed in London, stars Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, Anupam Kher, Freida Pinto and Naomi Watts. Filming started in July 2009. It was released theatrically in the U.S. on September 23, 2010, following a Cannes debut in May 2010, and a screening at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2010.

Allen announced that his next film would be titled &quot;Midnight in Paris,&quot; starring Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen, Corey Stoll, Allison Pill, Tom Hiddleston, Adrien Brody, Kathy Bates, and Carla Bruni, the First Lady of France at the time of production. The film follows a young engaged couple in Paris who see their lives transformed. It debuted at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 2011. Allen said he wanted to &quot;show the city emotionally&quot; during the press conference. &quot;I just wanted it to be the way I saw Paris—Paris through my eyes&quot;, he said. The film was almost universally praised, receiving a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and became his highest-grossing film, making $151 million worldwide on a $17 million budget.

On October 20, 2011, Allen&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Honeymoon Motel&quot; opened on Broadway as part of a larger piece titled &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;, with two other one-act plays by Ethan Coen and Elaine May. In February 2012, Allen appeared on a panel at the 92nd Street Y in New York City with moderators Dick Cavett and Annette Insdorf, discussing his films and career. His next film, &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; (2012), is a Rome-set comedy starring Jesse Eisenberg, Elliot Page, Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz, Greta Gerwig, and Judy Davis. The film is structured in four vignettes featuring dialogue in both Italian and English. It marked Allen&#x27;s return to acting since his last role in &quot;Scoop&quot;. Bob Mondello gave it a mixed review, writing, &quot;&quot;To Rome with Love&quot; is just froth—a romantic sampler with some decent jokes and gorgeous Roman backdrops. It goes down easily, but I have to say it&#x27;s interesting less for what it is than for how it is.&quot;

Allen&#x27;s next film, &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot;, debuted in July 2013. The film is set in San Francisco and New York, and stars Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Louis C.K., Andrew Dice Clay, Sally Hawkins, and Peter Sarsgaard. It opened to critical acclaim, with Eric Kohn of &quot;IndieWire&quot; calling it &quot;his most significant movie in years&quot;. The film earned Allen another Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, and Blanchett received the Academy Award for Best Actress. Allen co-starred with John Turturro in &quot;Fading Gigolo,&quot; written and directed by Turturro, which premiered in September 2013. Also in 2013, Allen shot the romantic comedy &quot;Magic in the Moonlight&quot; with Emma Stone and Colin Firth in Nice, France. The film is set in the 1920s on the French Riviera. It was a modest financial success, earning $51 million on a $16 million budget. For the BBC, Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;Magic in the Moonlight&quot; is Allen&#x27;s most gratifyingly airy concoction in a while, but it&#x27;s also a comedy that insists, in the end, on making an overly rational case for the power of the irrational.&quot;

On March 11, 2014, Allen&#x27;s musical &quot;Bullets over Broadway&quot; opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre. It was directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman and starred Zach Braff, Nick Cordero, and Betsy Wolfe. The production received mixed reviews, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; writing, &quot;this frothy show does provide dazzling art direction and performances, as well as effervescent ensemble numbers.&quot; Allen received a Tony Award nomination for Best Book of a Musical. The show received six Tony nominations.

In July and August 2014, Allen filmed the mystery drama &quot;Irrational Man&quot; in Newport, Rhode Island, with Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Parker Posey and Jamie Blackley. Allen said that this film, as well as the next three he had planned, had the financing and full support of Sony Pictures Classics. Jonathan Romney of &quot;Film Comment&quot; gave the film a mixed review, praising Stone&#x27;s performance but calling the film &quot;disconcertingly impersonal—all the more so as it overtly carries certain traditional marks of his patented brand, being a light-highbrow comedy of manners, peppered with bookish in-jokes.&quot;

=== 2015–2019 ===

On January 14, 2015, Amazon Studios announced a full-season order for a half-hour Amazon Prime Instant Video series that Allen would write and direct, marking the first time he has developed a television show. Allen said of the series, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I&#x27;m not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price [the head of Amazon Studios] will regret this.&quot; At the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, Allen said of his upcoming Amazon show: &quot;It was a catastrophic mistake. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m floundering. I expect this to be a cosmic embarrassment.&quot; On September 30, 2016, Amazon Video debuted Allen&#x27;s first television series production, &quot;Crisis in Six Scenes&quot;. The series is a comedy set during the 1960s. It focuses on the life of a suburban family after a surprise visitor creates chaos among them. It stars Allen, Elaine May, and Miley Cyrus, with the latter playing a radical hippie fugitive who sells marijuana.

Allen&#x27;s next film, &quot;Café Society&quot;, starred an ensemble cast, including Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, and Blake Lively. Bruce Willis was set to co-star, but was replaced by Steve Carell during filming. The film is distributed by Amazon Studios, and opened the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 11, 2016, the third time Allen has opened the festival. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film a positive review, writing, &quot;The film looks ravishing, with shots of New York which recall images in Allen&#x27;s great work, Manhattan, but however wonderfully composed, there is something almost touristy in both them, and in his evocation of golden age Tinseltown, like his homages to Paris and Rome. Allen brings it all together in his closing moments which conjure something unexpectedly melancholy and shrewdly judged. It has entertainment and charm.&quot;
In September 2016 Allen started filming the drama film &quot;Wonder Wheel&quot;, set in the 1950s in Coney Island, and starring Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, Juno Temple, and Jim Belushi. The film served as the closing night selection at the 55th New York Film Festival on October 15, 2017, and was theatrically released on December 1, 2017, as the first movie self-distributed to theaters by Amazon Studios. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising Winslet&#x27;s leading performance. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Wonder Wheel&quot; isn&#x27;t a comedy—on the contrary, it often feels like the most earnest kitchen-sink drama that Clifford Odets never wrote. It may or may not turn out to be an awards picture, but it&#x27;s a good night out, and that&#x27;s not nothing.&quot; In 2017, Allen received a standing ovation when he made a rare public appearance at the 45th Annual Life Achievement Tribute award ceremony for Diane Keaton. Before presenting her with the award he spoke about their longtime collaboration and friendship, saying, &quot;From the minute I met her, she was a great, great inspiration to me. Much of what I have accomplished in my life I owe for sure to her&quot;.

Allen returned to filming in New York City with the romantic film &quot;A Rainy Day in New York&quot;, starring Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez, Elle Fanning, Jude Law, Diego Luna, Liev Schreiber and Rebecca Hall. The production in New York began in September 2017. During the film&#x27;s release, Chalamet, Gomez, and Hall announced, in the light of the Me Too movement, that they would donate their salaries to various charities. The film received mixed reviews but earned praise for its performances. In February 2019 it was announced that Amazon Studios had dropped &quot;A Rainy Day in New York&quot; and would no longer finance, produce, or distribute films with Allen. He filed a lawsuit for $68 million, alleging Amazon gave &quot;vague reasons&quot; to terminate the contract, dropped the film over &quot;a 25-year old, baseless allegation&quot;, and did not make payments. The case was later settled and dismissed. It was released throughout Europe beginning in July 2019, receiving mixed reviews and grossing $20 million. After over a year&#x27;s delay, the film was released in the U.S. on October 9, 2020, by MPI Media Group and Signature Entertainment.

In May 2019, it was announced that Allen&#x27;s next film would be titled &quot;Rifkin&#x27;s Festival&quot;, and &quot;Variety magazine&quot; confirmed that its cast would include Christoph Waltz, Elena Anaya, Louis Garrel, Gina Gershon, Sergi López, and Wallace Shawn, and that it would be produced by Gravier Productions. The film was produced with Mediapro, an independent Spanish TV-film company. &quot;Rifkin&#x27;s Festival&quot; completed filming in October 2019. On September 18, 2020, it premiered at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. It received mixed reviews, though Jessica Kiang of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;to the ravenous captive, like finding an unexpected stash of dessert&quot;.

===2020 to present===

On March 2, 2020, it was announced that after shopping the book from publishers it was decided that Grand Central Publishing would release Allen&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Apropos of Nothing&quot;, on April 7, 2020. According to the publisher, the book is a &quot;comprehensive account of Allen&#x27;s life, both personal and professional, and describes his work in films, theater, television, nightclubs, and print...Allen also writes of his relationships with family, friends, and the loves of his life.&quot; The decision to publish the book was criticized by Dylan and Ronan Farrow, the latter of whom cut ties with the publisher. The announcement also incited criticism from employees of the publishers. On March 6, the publisher announced that it had canceled the book&#x27;s release, saying in part, &quot;The decision to cancel Mr. Allen&#x27;s book was a difficult one.&quot; Hachette&#x27;s decision also drew criticism from novelist Stephen King, Executive director of PEN America Suzanne Nossel, and others. On March 6, 2020, Manuel Carcassonne of Hachette&#x27;s French branch, the publishing company Stock, announced it would publish the book if Allen permitted it. On March 23, 2020, Arcade published the memoir.

In June 2020, Allen appeared on Alec Baldwin&#x27;s podcast &quot;Here&#x27;s the Thing&quot; and talked about his career as a standup comedian, comedy writer, and filmmaker, and his life during the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2022, Allen suggested that he might retire from filmmaking after the release of his next film. In an interview with &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, Allen said, &quot;My idea, in principle, is not to make more movies and focus on writing.&quot; Allen&#x27;s publicist later said, &quot;Woody Allen never said he was retiring, nor did he say he was writing another novel. He said he was thinking about not making films, as making films that go straight or very quickly to streaming platforms is not so enjoyable for him, as he is a great lover of the cinema experience. Currently, he has no intention of retiring and is very excited to be in Paris shooting his new movie, which will be the 50th.&quot;

Allen has made 50 feature films to date, with his latest film, &quot;Coup de chance&quot; (2023), a domestic thriller set in Paris. The film is Allen&#x27;s first French-language film. It premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival to positive reviews. Chris Vognar of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a pretty slight and minor film, but for an 87-year-old American working in a second language, it can&#x27;t help but seem impressive&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;his best since &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot;&quot;.

In February 2024, it was reported that Allen had expressed interest in starting a new film as soon as summer 2024: &quot;In a new interview with Spanish filmmaker David Trueba, the 88-year-old Allen confirms that he is currently trying to launch a new film, which could start shooting as early as this summer in Italy.&quot;

== Theater ==
While best known for his films, Allen has also had a successful theater career, starting as early as 1960, when he wrote sketches for the revue &quot;From A to Z&quot;. His first great success was &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot;, which opened in 1966 and ran for 598 performances on Broadway. His success continued with &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;, which opened in 1969, starring Allen and Diane Keaton. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three Tony Awards, although none of the nominations were for Allen&#x27;s writing or acting.

In the 1970s, Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, such as &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Death&quot;, which were published in his 1975 collection &quot;Without Feathers&quot;. In 1981, Allen&#x27;s play &quot;The Floating Light Bulb&quot; opened on Broadway. It was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two Tony Award nominations, a Tony win for the acting of Brian Backer (who won the 1981 Theater World Award and a Drama Desk Award for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.

In 1995, after a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to theater with the one-act &quot;Central Park West&quot;, an installment in an evening of theater, &quot;Death Defying Acts&quot;, that also included new work by David Mamet and Elaine May.

For the next few years, Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, but productions of his work were staged. &quot;God&quot; was staged at The Bank of Brazil Cultural Center in Rio de Janeiro, and theatrical adaptations of Allen&#x27;s films &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; and &quot;September&quot; were produced in Italy and France, respectively, without Allen&#x27;s involvement.

In 2003, Allen returned to the stage with &quot;Writer&#x27;s Block&quot;, an evening of two one-acts, &quot;Old Saybrook&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;concordtheatricals/1890&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Riverside Drive&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;concordtheatricals/1889&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/2005/07/01/allen-sex-lies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that played Off-Broadway″s Atlantic Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;playbill/108992&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The production marked his stage-directing debut and sold out the entire run.

In 2004, Allen&#x27;s first full-length play since 1981, &quot;A Second Hand Memory&quot;, was directed by Allen and enjoyed an extended run Off-Broadway. In June 2007 it was announced that Allen would make two more creative debuts in the theater, directing a work he did not write and an opera—a reinterpretation of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; for the Los Angeles Opera—which debuted at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on September 6, 2008. Of his direction of the opera, Allen said, &quot;I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing.&quot; His production of the opera opened the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, in June 2009.

In October 2011, Allen&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Honeymoon Motel&quot; premiered as one in a series of one-act plays on Broadway titled &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;. Also contributing to the series were Elaine May and Ethan Coen; John Turturro directed.

It was announced in February 2012 that Allen would adapt &quot;Bullets over Broadway&quot; into a Broadway musical. It ran from April 10 to August 24, 2014. The cast included Zach Braff, Nick Cordero and Betsy Wolfe. The show was directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman, known for directing the stage and film productions of Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;The Producers&quot;. The show drew mixed reviews from critics but received six Tony Award nominations, including one for Allen for Best Book of a Musical.

== Jazz band ==
Allen is a passionate fan of jazz, which appears often in the soundtracks to his films. He began playing clarinet as a child and took his stage name from clarinetist Woody Herman. He has performed publicly at least since the late 1960s, including with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band on the soundtrack of &quot;Sleeper&quot;.

Woody Allen and his New Orleans Jazz Band have been playing each Monday evening at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan for many years specializing in New Orleans jazz from the early 20th century. He plays songs by Sidney Bechet, George Lewis, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone, and Louis Armstrong. The documentary film &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot; (directed by Barbara Kopple) chronicles a 1996 European tour by Allen and his band, as well as his relationship with Previn. The band released the albums &quot;The Bunk Project&quot; (1993) and the soundtrack of &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot; (1997). In 2005, Allen, Eddy Davis and Conal Fowkes released the trio album &quot;Woody With Strings&quot;. In a 2011 review of a concert by Allen&#x27;s jazz band, critic Kirk Silsbee of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; suggested that Allen should be regarded a competent musical hobbyist with a sincere appreciation for early jazz: &quot;Allen&#x27;s clarinet won&#x27;t make anyone forget Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard or Evan Christopher. His piping tone and strings of staccato notes can&#x27;t approximate melodic or lyrical phrasing. Still his earnestness and the obvious regard he has for traditional jazz counts for something.&quot;

Allen and his band played at the Montreal International Jazz Festival on two consecutive nights in June 2008. For many years he wanted to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans. Tentatively titled &quot;American Blues&quot;, the film would follow the different careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Allen stated that the film would cost between $80 and $100 million and is therefore unlikely to be made.

== Influence ==
Allen has said that he was enormously influenced by comedians Bob Hope, Groucho Marx, Mort Sahl, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields, playwright George S. Kaufman and filmmakers Ernst Lubitsch and Ingmar Bergman.

Many comedians have cited Allen as an influence, including Louis C.K., Larry David, Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Steve Martin, John Mulaney, Bill Hader, Aziz Ansari, Sarah Silverman, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Seth MacFarlane, Seth Meyers, Richard Ayoade, Bill Maher, Albert Brooks, John Cleese, Garry Shandling, Bob Odenkirk, Richard Kind, Rob McElhenney, and Mike Schur. Comedic writers such as Simon Rich and Jesse Eisenberg have also cited Allen as a major influence.

Many filmmakers have also cited Allen as an influence, including Wes Anderson, Greta Gerwig, Noah Baumbach, Luca Guadagnino, Nora Ephron, Whit Stillman, Mike Mills, Ira Sachs, Richard Linklater, Charlie Kaufman, Nicole Holofcener, Rebecca Miller, Tamara Jenkins, Alex Ross Perry, Greg Mottola, Lynn Shelton, Lena Dunham, Lawrence Michael Levine, Olivier Assayas, the Safdie brothers, and Amy Sherman-Palladino.

Directors who admire Allen&#x27;s work include Quentin Tarantino, who called him &quot;one of the greatest screenwriters of all time&quot;, as well as Martin Scorsese, who said in &quot;Woody Allen: A Documentary&quot;, &quot;Woody&#x27;s sensibilities of New York City is one of the reasons why I love his work, but they are extremely foreign to me. It&#x27;s not another world; it&#x27;s another planet&quot;. Stanley Donen stated he liked Allen&#x27;s films, Spike Lee has called Allen a &quot;great, great filmmaker&quot; and Pedro Almodóvar has said he admires Allen&#x27;s work. In 2012, directors Mike Leigh, Asghar Farhadi, and Martin McDonagh respectively included &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987), &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; (1969), and &quot;Manhattan&quot; among their Top 10 films for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;. Other admirers of his work include Olivia Wilde and Jason Reitman, who staged live readings of &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot; respectively. Filmmaker Edgar Wright listed five of Allen&#x27;s films (&quot;Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Play It Again, Sam, Sleeper, Annie Hall&quot;) in his list of 100 Favorite Comedy films.

Bill Hader cited Allen&#x27;s mockumentary films &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; and &quot;Zelig&quot; as the biggest inspirations of the IFC series &quot;Documentary Now!&quot;

Film critics including Roger Ebert and Barry Norman have highly praised Allen&#x27;s work. In 1980, on &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, Siskel and Ebert called Allen and Mel Brooks &quot;the two most successful comedy directors in the world today ... America&#x27;s two funniest filmmakers.&quot; Pauline Kael wrote of Allen that &quot;his comic character is enormously appealing to people partly because he&#x27;s the smart, urban guy who at the same time is intelligent, is vulnerable, and somehow by his intelligence, he triumphs&quot;.

== Favorite films ==
In 2012, Allen participated in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; film polls. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Allen&#x27;s choices, in alphabetical order, were:

* &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (France, 1959)
* &quot;8½&quot; (Italy, 1963)
* &quot;Amarcord&quot; (Italy, 1972)
* &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (Italy, 1948)
* &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (USA, 1941)
* &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; (France, 1972)
* &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (France, 1937)
* &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (USA, 1957)
* &quot;Rashomon&quot; (Japan, 1950)
* &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (Sweden, 1957)
In his 2020 autobiography &quot;Apropos of Nothing&quot; Allen praised Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951): 

== Film activism and preservation ==
In 1987, Allen joined Ginger Rogers, Sydney Pollack, and Miloš Forman at a Senate Judiciary committee hearing in Washington, D.C., where they each gave testimony against Ted Turner&#x27;s and other companies&#x27; colorizing films without the artists&#x27; consent. Only one senator, Patrick Leahy, was present for the testimony. Allen testified:
Allen also spoke about his decisions to make films in black and white, such as &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;, &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;, and &quot;Zelig&quot;. Film director John Huston appeared in a pretaped video, and Rogers read a statement by Jimmy Stewart criticizing the colorization of his film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

In 1990, The Film Foundation was founded as a nonprofit film preservation organization that collaborates with film studios to restore prints of old or damaged films to meet the vision of the original filmmaker. Allen was part of the founding and sat on the foundation&#x27;s original board of directors alongside Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg.

==Awards and honors==


Over his more than 50-year film career, Allen has received many award nominations. He holds the record for most Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay, with 16 nominations and three wins (&quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;). Allen has been nominated for Best Director seven times and won for &quot;Annie Hall&quot;. Three of Allen&#x27;s films have been nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;.

Allen shuns award ceremonies, citing their subjectivity. His first and only appearance at the Academy Awards was at the 2002 Oscars, where he received a standing ovation. As a New York icon, he had been asked by the Academy to introduce a film montage of clips of New York City in the movies that Nora Ephron compiled to honor the city after the 9/11 attacks. Two of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Allen has received numerous honors, including an Honorary Golden Palm from the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 and a Career Golden Lion from the Venice International Film Festival in 1995. He also received a BAFTA Fellowship in 1997, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America and a Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2014. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2010. In 2015, the Writers Guild of America named his screenplay for &quot;Annie Hall&quot; first on its list of the &quot;101 Funniest Screenplays&quot;. In 2011, PBS televised the film biography &quot;Woody Allen: A Documentary&quot; on its series &quot;American Masters&quot;.

In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, while a UK survey ranked Allen the third-greatest comedian.

== Personal life ==
Allen has been married three times: to Harlene Rosen from 1956 to 1959, Louise Lasser from 1966 to 1970, and Soon-Yi Previn since 1997. He also had a 12-year relationship with actress Mia Farrow and relationships with Stacey Nelkin and Diane Keaton.

=== Early marriages and relationships ===
In 1956, Allen married Harlene Rosen. He was 20 and she was 17. The marriage lasted until 1959. Rosen, whom Allen called &quot;the Dread Mrs. Allen&quot; in his standup act, sued him for defamation as a result of comments he made during a television appearance shortly after their divorce. In his mid-1960s album &quot;Standup Comic&quot;, Allen said that Rosen had sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been sexually assaulted outside her apartment. According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been &quot;violated&quot;. In the interview, Allen said, &quot;Knowing my ex-wife, it probably wasn&#x27;t a moving violation.&quot; In an interview on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Allen repeated his comments and said that she &quot;sued me for a million dollars&quot;.

In 1966, Allen married Louise Lasser. They divorced in 1970. Lasser provided voice dubbing in Allen&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot; and appeared in three of his other films: &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, &quot;Bananas&quot;, and &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;. She also appeared briefly in &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot; was based on Allen&#x27;s romantic relationship with actress Stacey Nelkin. Her bit part in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; ended up on the cutting room floor, and their relationship reportedly began when she was 17 and a student at Stuyvesant High School in New York. In December 2018 &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; interviewed Babi Christina Engelhardt, who said she had an eight-year affair with Allen that began in 1976 when she was 17 years old (they met when she was 16), and that she believes the character of Tracy in &quot;Manhattan&quot; is a composite of any number of Allen&#x27;s presumed other real-life young paramours from that period, not necessarily Nelkin or Engelhardt. When asked, Allen declined to comment.

=== Diane Keaton ===

In 1968, Allen cast Diane Keaton in his Broadway show &quot;Play It Again, Sam.&quot; During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including &quot;Sleeper&quot; as a futuristic poet and &quot;Love and Death&quot; as a composite character based on the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was very important in Allen&#x27;s and Keaton&#x27;s careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton&#x27;s birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in &quot;Interiors&quot; as a poet, followed by &quot;Manhattan&quot;. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in &quot;Radio Days&quot;, and she was chosen to replace Mia Farrow in &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship. In total Keaton has starred in eight of Allen&#x27;s films. As of 2018 Keaton and Allen remain close friends. In a rare public appearance, Allen presented Keaton with the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2017.

=== Mia Farrow ===
Allen and Mia Farrow met in 1979 and began a relationship in 1980; Farrow starred in 13 of Allen&#x27;s films from 1982 to 1992. Throughout the relationship they lived in separate apartments on opposite sides of Central Park in Manhattan. Farrow had seven children when they met: three biological sons from her marriage to composer André Previn, three adopted girls (two Vietnamese and one South Korean, Soon-Yi Previn), and an adopted South Korean boy, Moses Farrow.

In 1984, she and Allen tried to conceive a child together; Allen agreed to this on the understanding that he need not be involved in the child&#x27;s care. When the effort failed, Farrow adopted a baby girl, Dylan Farrow, in July 1985. Allen was not involved in the adoption, but when Dylan arrived he assumed a parental role toward her and began spending more time in Farrow&#x27;s home. On December 19, 1987, Farrow gave birth to their son Satchel Ronan O&#x27;Sullivan Farrow. According to Allen, his intimate relationship with Mia Farrow ceased completely after Satchel&#x27;s birth and he was asked to return her apartment key; they maintained a working relationship when they filmed a movie, and he regularly visited Moses, Dylan and Satchel, but he and Mia were only &quot;social companions on those occasions where there&#x27;d be a dinner, an event, but after the event she&#x27;d go home and I&#x27;d go home.&quot; In 1991, Farrow wanted to adopt another child. According to a 1993 custody hearing, Allen told her he would not object to another adoption so long as she would agree to his adoption of Dylan and Moses; that adoption was finalized in December 1991. Eric Lax, Allen&#x27;s biographer, wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Allen was &quot;there before they [the children] wake up in the morning, he sees them during the day and he helps put them to bed at night&quot;.

=== Soon-Yi Previn ===

In 1977, Mia Farrow and André Previn adopted Soon-Yi Previn from Seoul, South Korea. She had been abandoned. The Seoul Family Court established a Family Census Register (legal birth document) on her behalf on December 28, 1976, with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970. According to Mia Farrow, a bone scan in the U.S. estimated that she was between six and eight years old (&#x27;We&#x27;re saying seven&#x27;) in early 1978, in accordance with the Seoul Family Court&#x27;s information. According to Previn, her first friendly interaction with Allen took place when she was injured playing soccer during 11th grade and Allen offered to transport her to school. After her injury, she began attending New York Knicks basketball games with Allen in 1990. They attended more games and by 1991 had become closer. In September 1991, she began studies at Drew University in New Jersey.

In January 1992, Farrow found nude photographs of Previn in Allen&#x27;s home. Allen, then 56, told Farrow that he had taken the photos the day before, approximately two weeks after he first had sex with Previn. Both Farrow and Allen contacted lawyers shortly after the photographs were discovered. Previn was asked to leave summer camp because she was spending too much time taking calls from a &quot;Mr. Simon&quot;, who turned out to be Allen.
In an August 1992 interview with &quot;Time Magazine&quot; Allen said, &quot;I am not Soon-Yi&#x27;s father or stepfather&quot;, adding, &quot;I&#x27;ve never even lived with Mia. I&#x27;ve never in my entire life slept at Mia&#x27;s apartment, and I never even used to go over there until my children came along seven years ago. I never had any family dinners over there. I was not a father to her adopted kids in any sense of the word.&quot; Adding that Soon-Yi never treated him as a father figure and that he rarely spoke to her before their romantic relationship, Allen seemed to see few or no problems with their relationship.

On August 17, 1992, Allen issued a statement saying that he was in love with Previn. Their relationship became public and &quot;erupted into tabloid headlines and late-night monologues in August 1992&quot;.

Allen and Previn were married in Venice, Italy, on December 23, 1997. They have two adopted daughters, and live in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side.

=== Sexual abuse allegation ===

According to court testimony, on August 4, 1992, Allen visited the children at Mia Farrow&#x27;s home in Bridgewater, Connecticut, while she was shopping with a friend. The next day, that friend&#x27;s babysitter told her employer that she had seen that &quot;Dylan was sitting on the sofa, and Woody was kneeling on the floor, facing her, with his head in her lap&quot;. When Farrow asked Dylan about it, Dylan allegedly said that Allen had touched Dylan&#x27;s &quot;private part&quot; while they were alone together in the attic. Allen strongly denied the allegation, calling it &quot;an unconscionable and gruesomely damaging manipulation of innocent children for vindictive and self-serving motives&quot;. He then began proceedings in New York Supreme Court for sole custody of his and Farrow&#x27;s son Satchel, as well as Dylan and Moses, their two adopted children. In March 1993, a six-month investigation by the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale-New Haven Hospital concluded that Dylan had not been sexually abused.

In June 1993, Judge Elliott Wilk rejected Allen&#x27;s bid for custody and rejected the allegation of sexual abuse. Wilk said he was less certain than the Yale-New Haven team that there was conclusive evidence that there was no sexual abuse and called Allen&#x27;s conduct with Dylan &quot;grossly inappropriate&quot;, although not sexual. In September 1993, the state prosecutor announced that despite having &quot;probable cause&quot;, he would not pursue charges in order &quot;to avoid the unjustifiable risk of exposing a child to the rigors and uncertainties of a questionable prosecution&quot;. In October 1993 the New York Child Welfare Agency of the State Department of Social Services closed a 14-month investigation and concluded there was not credible evidence of abuse or maltreatment, and the allegation was unfounded.

In 2014, when Allen received a Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement, the issue returned to the forefront of media attention, with Mia Farrow and Ronan Farrow making disparaging remarks about Allen on Twitter. On February 1, 2014, &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Nicholas Kristof, with Dylan&#x27;s permission, published a column that included excerpts from a letter Dylan had written to Kristof restating the allegation against Allen, and called out fellow actors who have continued to work in his films. Allen responded to the allegation in an open letter, also in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; strongly denying it. &quot;Of course, I did not molest Dylan...No one wants to discourage abuse victims from speaking out, but one must bear in mind that sometimes there are people who are falsely accused and that is also a terribly destructive thing&quot;, he wrote.

In 2018, Moses Farrow (who was present at Mia&#x27;s Bridgewater house during Allen&#x27;s visit) published a blog post called &quot;A Son Speaks Out.&quot; In the post, Moses strenuously denied the abuse allegations, writing, &quot;given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.&quot; He also recounted a series of instances of alleged physical abuse at the hands of Mia Farrow: &quot;It pains me to recall instances in which I witnessed siblings, some blind or physically disabled, dragged down a flight of stairs to be thrown into a bedroom or a closet, then having the door locked from the outside. [Mia] even shut my brother Thaddeus, paraplegic from polio, in an outdoor shed overnight as punishment for a minor transgression&quot;. Hollywood remained largely split over the allegation. Some defended Dylan&#x27;s allegation, while others vouched for Allen&#x27;s innocence, citing potential extortion from Farrow as a result of Allen and Soon-Yi&#x27;s courtship.

== Works about Allen ==
From 1976 to 1984 Stuart Hample wrote and drew &quot;Inside Woody Allen&quot;, a comic strip based on Allen&#x27;s film persona.

The 1997 documentary &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot;, directed by Barbara Kopple, focuses on Allen, and other documentaries featuring Allen include the 2002 cable television documentary &quot;Woody Allen: A Life in Film&quot;, directed by &quot;Time&quot; film critic Richard Schickel, which interlaces interviews of Allen with clips of his films, and the 1986 short film &quot;Meetin&#x27; WA&quot;, in which Allen is interviewed by French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard.
In 2003, a life-size bronze statue of Allen was installed in Oviedo, Spain. He had visited the city the previous year to accept a Prince of Asturias Award.

In 2011, the PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot; co-produced the documentary &quot;Woody Allen: A Documentary&quot;, directed by Robert B. Weide. New interviews provide insight and backstory with Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johansson, Penélope Cruz, Dianne Wiest, Larry David, Chris Rock, Martin Scorsese, Dick Cavett, and Leonard Maltin, among others.

Eric Lax wrote the book &quot;Woody Allen: A Biography&quot;.

In 2015, David Evanier published &quot;Woody: The Biography&quot;, which was billed as the first new biography of Allen in over a decade.

In early March 2020, Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group, announced that it would publish Allen&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Apropos of Nothing&quot;, on April 7, 2020. Days later, after employee walkouts, parent company Hachette announced that the title was canceled and rights had reverted to Allen. On March 23, 2020, Skyhorse Publishing announced that it had acquired and released &quot;Apropos of Nothing&quot; through its Arcade imprint.

In February 2021, HBO released Kirby Dick&#x27;s and Amy Ziering&#x27;s four-part documentary &quot;Allen v. Farrow&quot;, which explores the sexual abuse allegations against Allen. The series drew largely positive reviews from critics. Lorraine Ali of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it &quot;makes a compelling argument that Allen got away with the unthinkable thanks to his fame, money, and revered standing in the world of film—and that a little girl never received justice.&quot; Rachel Brodsky wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that the &quot;documentary will sound the death knell for Woody Allen&#x27;s career.&quot; Hadley Freeman in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the series &quot;sets itself up as an investigation but much more resembles PR, as biased and partial as a political candidate&#x27;s advert vilifying an opponent in election season.&quot; A statement on behalf of Allen and Previn denounced the documentary as &quot;a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods&quot; and said that they were approached two months before it was aired on HBO and &quot;given only a matter of days &#x27;to respond.&#x27; Of course, they declined to do so.&quot; The filmmakers said they gave Allen and Previn two weeks to comment, which is &quot;more than ample time by journalistic standards.&quot;

<text>Ernst Wilhelm &quot;Wim&quot; Wenders (; born 14 August 1945) is a German filmmaker and photographer, who is a major figure in New German Cinema. Among the honors he has received are prizes from the Cannes, Venice, and Berlin film festivals. He has also received a BAFTA Award and been nominated for four Academy Awards and a Grammy Award.

Wenders made his feature film debut with &quot;Summer in the City&quot; (1970). He earned critical acclaim for directing the films &quot;Alice in the Cities&quot; (1974), &quot;The Wrong Move&quot; (1975), and &quot;Kings of the Road&quot; (1976), later known as the &quot;Road Movie trilogy&quot;. Wenders won the BAFTA Award for Best Direction and the Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) and the Cannes Film Festival Best Director Award for &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987). His other notable films include &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977), &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot; (1993), and &quot;Perfect Days&quot; (2023).

Wenders has received three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature: for &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; (1999), &quot;Pina&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Salt of the Earth&quot; (2014). He received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video for &quot;Willie Nelson at the Teatro&quot; (1998). He is also known for directing the documentaries &quot;Tokyo-Ga&quot; (1985), &quot;The Soul of a Man&quot; (2003), &quot;Pope Francis: A Man of His Word&quot; (2018), and &quot;Anselm&quot; (2023).

Wenders formerly served as the president of the European Film Academy from 1996–2020. He also earned an Honorary Golden Bear in 2015. He is an active photographer, emphasizing images of desolate landscapes. He is considered an auteur director.

== Early life and education ==
Wenders was born in Düsseldorf into a traditionally Catholic family. His father, Heinrich Wenders, was a surgeon. The Dutch name &quot;Wim&quot; is a shortened version of the baptismal name &quot;Wilhelm&quot;. As a boy, Wenders took unaccompanied trips to Amsterdam to visit the Rijksmuseum. He graduated from high school in Oberhausen in the Ruhr area. He then studied medicine at the University of Freiburg (1963–64) and philosophy at the University of Dusseldorf (1964–65), but dropped out and moved to Paris in October 1966 in order to become a painter. He failed his entry test at France&#x27;s national film school, IDHEC (now La Fémis), and instead became an engraver at Johnny Friedlaender&#x27;s studio in Montparnasse. During this time he became fascinated with cinema, and saw up to five movies a day at the local movie theater.

Set on making his obsession his life&#x27;s work, he returned to Germany in 1967 to work in the Düsseldorf office of United Artists. That fall, he entered the University of Television and Film Munich (HFF). Between 1967 and 1970, while at the HFF, he also worked as a film critic for &quot;FilmKritik&quot;, the Munich daily newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Twen&quot; magazine, and &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;.

Wenders completed several short films before graduating from the Hochschule with a 16mm black-and-white film, &quot;Summer in the City&quot; (1970), his feature directorial debut.

== Career ==
=== 1970–1976: Film debut and early work ===
Wenders&#x27;s career began in the late 1960s, the New German Cinema era. Much of the distinctive cinematography in his movies is the result of a long-term collaboration with Dutch cinematographer Robby Müller. Wenders made his directorial film debut with &quot;Summer in the City&quot; (1970), his graduation project at the University of Television and Film Munich, which he attended from 1967 to 1970. Shot in 16 mm black-and-white by Müller, the movie exhibited many of Wenders&#x27;s later trademark themes of aimless searching, running from invisible demons, and persistent wandering toward an indeterminate goal. Protagonist Hans (Zischler) is released from prison, and after searching through seedy West German streets and bars, he visits an old friend in Berlin.

Wenders then directed &quot;The Goalkeeper&#x27;s Fear of the Penalty&quot;, titled &quot;The Goalie&#x27;s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick&quot; in the United States. The film was adapted from Peter Handke&#x27;s 1970 short novel. He then directed the period drama &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1973), adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s 1850 novel of the same name. From 1974 to 1976 Wender directed the Road Movie trilogy. The first film in the trilogy was &quot;Alice in the Cities&quot; (1974), which was shot in 16mm. The last two films are &quot;The Wrong Move&quot; (1975) and &quot;Kings of the Road&quot; (1976), the latter of which won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival.

=== 1977–1987: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

In 1977 Wenders gained prominence for directing the neo-noir &quot;The American Friend&quot;, starring Dennis Hopper and Bruno Ganz. The film is adapted from the Patricia Highsmith 1974 novel &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;. J. Hoberman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; has compared the film to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, writing, &quot;Like &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;The American Friend&quot; was a new sort of movie-movie—sleekly brooding, voluptuously alienated and saturated with cinephilia.&quot;

Wenders earned critical acclaim for his road drama &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984), starring Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski and Dean Stockwell. The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d&#x27;Or. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of the film, &quot;[it&#x27;s] a movie with the kind of passion and willingness to experiment that was more common fifteen years ago than it is now. It has more links with films like &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; than with the slick arcade games that are the box-office winners of the 1980s. It is true, deep, and brilliant&quot;.

Wenders then directed the romance fantasy &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987), starring Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk. It premiered at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, where Wenders won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director. Peter Handke co-wrote the screenplay. West Germany submitted &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, a bid supported by its distribution company. It was not nominated; the academy seldom recognized West German cinema. The film was one of the most acclaimed films of the year, with many critics adding it on their top 10 lists.

=== 1991–2010: Career fluctuations ===

In 1991 Wenders directed the science fiction adventure drama &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;, starring William Hurt, Solveig Dommartin, Max Von Sydow and Jeanne Moreau. The film has been released in several editions, ranging in length from 158 to 287 minutes, with the longer versions receiving mixed reviews. In 1993 he directed &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;. Actors Otto Sander, Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk reprised their roles as angels who have become human. The film also stars Nastassja Kinski, Willem Dafoe and Heinz Rühmann, in his last film role. It received critical acclaim, premiering at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, where it earned the Grand Prix. The next year, he directed &quot;Lisbon Story&quot;, which screened at Un Certain Regard at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. In 1995 he directed both &quot;A Trick of Light&quot; and the anthology film &quot;Lumière and Company&quot;.

In 1997, Wenders directed the American drama film &quot;The End of Violence&quot;, starring Bill Pullman, Andie MacDowell, and Gabriel Byrne. The film received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office after its debut at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Like many other of Wenders&#x27;s American movies, it was shot in multiple locations, including the Griffith Observatory and the Santa Monica Pier. Wenders has directed several highly acclaimed documentaries, including &quot;Willie Nelson at the Teatro&quot;, a documentary about the recording sessions of &quot;Teatro&quot; (1998). The next year he directed &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, about the music of Cuba. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. In 2002, he directed a documentary about the German rock group BAP called &quot;&quot; (A lot has happened).

=== 2011–present: Resurgence with documentaries ===

Wenders has directed music videos for groups such as U2 and Talking Heads, including &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot; and &quot;Sax and Violins&quot;. His television commercials include a UK advertisement for Carling Premier Canadian beer. Wenders&#x27;s book &quot;Emotion Pictures&quot;, a collection of diary essays written as a film student, was adapted and broadcast as a series of plays on BBC Radio 3, featuring Peter Capaldi as Wenders, with Gina McKee, Saskia Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton and Ricky Tomlinson, dramatized by Neil Cargill.

Wenders also directed a documentary-style film on the Skladanowsky brothers, known in English as &quot;A Trick of the Light&quot;. The Skladanowsky brothers were inventing &quot;moving pictures&quot; when several others like the Lumière brothers and William Friese-Greene were doing the same. In 2011, Wenders was selected to stage the 2013 cycle of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; at the Bayreuth Festival. The project fell through when he insisted on filming in 3-D, which the Wagner family found too costly and disruptive. In 2012, while promoting his 3-D dance film &quot;Pina&quot;, Wenders told the blog that he had begun work on a new 3-D documentary about architecture. He also said he would only work in 3-D from then on. Wenders had admired the dance choreographer Pina Bausch since 1985, but only with the advent of digital 3-D cinema did he decide that he could sufficiently capture her work on screen.

In 2015, Wenders collaborated with artist/journalist and longtime friend Melinda Camber Porter on a documentary feature about his body of work, &quot;Wim Wenders – Visions on Film&quot;. Porter died before it was finished, and the film remains incomplete. Wenders is a member of the advisory board of World Cinema Foundation. The project was founded by Martin Scorsese and aims to find and reconstruct world cinema films that have been neglected. As of 2015 he served as a Jury Member for the digital studio Filmaka, a platform for undiscovered filmmakers to show their work to industry professionals.
In June 2017, Wenders stage-directed Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Les Pêcheurs de perles&quot;, starring Olga Peretyatko and Francesco Demuro and conducted by Daniel Barenboim at the Berlin State Opera (Staatsoper). In a 2018 interview, he said his favorite movie of all time was his film about Pope Francis, and that his entire career had been building up to it. His admiration for Francis is profound; he said he felt Francis is doing his best in a world full of calamities. He also said that, though raised Catholic, he had converted to Protestantism years earlier.

In 2019 Wenders acted as executive producer for his former assistant director Luca Lucchesi&#x27;s documentary &quot;A Black Jesus&quot;, which has similar themes to &quot;Pope Francis: A Man of His Word.&quot; The film explores the role of religion in communal identity and how this can create or dissolve differences in a small Sicilian town during the height of the refugee crisis. Lucchesi noted that Wenders pushed the film to be more symbolic and philosophical, saying that Wenders wanted the film to have a &quot;universal fairy-tale aspect&quot; and to represent &quot;Europe in a nutshell&quot;.

==Photography==
Wenders has worked with photographic images of desolate landscapes and themes of memory, time, loss, nostalgia and movement. He began his long-running project &quot;Pictures from the Surface of the Earth&quot; in the early 1980s and pursued it for 20 years. The initial photographic series was titled &quot;Written in the West&quot; and was produced while Wenders criss-crossed the American West in preparation for his film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984). It became the starting point for a nomadic journey across the globe, including Germany, Australia, Cuba, Israel and Japan, to take photographs capturing the essence of a moment, place or space.

==Personal life==
Wenders lives and works in Berlin with his wife, Donata. He has lived in Berlin since the mid-1970s. He is an ecumenical Christian; as a teenager he wished to become a Catholic priest. He supports German football club Borussia Dortmund.

In 2009, Wenders signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot; and argued that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door to &quot;actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

From 1979 to 1981, Wenders was married to the American actress and singer-songwriter Ronee Blakley.

It provides a framework to bring together his cinematic, photographic, artistic and literary works in his native country and make them permanently accessible to the public. In 2016, he received the Großer Kulturpreis of the Sparkassen Culture-Foundation Rhineland.

<doc id="32905" wikidata="Q1371" url="?curid=32905" title="West Virginia">
<text>West Virginia is a landlocked state in the Southern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered by Pennsylvania and Maryland to the northeast, Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, and Ohio to the northwest. West Virginia is the 10th-smallest state by area and ranks as the 12th-least populous state, with a population of 1,769,979 residents. The capital and most populous city is Charleston with a population of 49,055.

West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863, and was a key border state during the American Civil War. It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state, one of two states (along with Nevada) admitted to the Union during the Civil War, and the third state to separate from another state, after Kentucky and Maine had separated from Virginia and Massachusetts in 1792 and 1820, respectively. Some of its residents held slaves, but most were yeoman farmers, and the delegates provided for the gradual abolition of slavery in the new state constitution. The state legislature abolished slavery in the state, and at the same time ratified the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery nationally on February 3, 1865.

West Virginia&#x27;s northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio to form a tristate area, with Wheeling, Weirton, and Morgantown just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Huntington in the southwest is close to Ohio and Kentucky, while Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry in the eastern panhandle region are considered part of the Washington metropolitan area, between Maryland and Virginia. West Virginia is often included in several U.S. geographical regions, including the Mid-Atlantic, the Upland South, and the Southeastern United States. It is the only state entirely within the area served by the Appalachian Regional Commission; the area is commonly defined as &quot;Appalachia&quot;.

The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant coal mining and logging industries, and its political and labor history. It is also known for its tourism and a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities, including skiing, whitewater rafting, fishing, hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and hunting. From the Great Depression to the 1990s, the state voted heavily for the Democratic Party due to its tradition of union-based politics. Since then, the state has become heavily Republican, and is considered a &quot;deep red&quot; state at the federal level.

==History==
Many ancient manmade earthen mounds from various prehistoric mound builder cultures survive in West Virginia, especially in the areas of present-day Moundsville, South Charleston, and Romney. Artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of village societies with a tribal trade system culture that crafted cold-worked copper pieces.

In the 1670s, during the Beaver Wars, the powerful Iroquois, five allied nations based in present-day New York and Pennsylvania, drove out other Native American tribes from the region to reserve the upper Ohio Valley as a hunting ground. Siouan language tribes, such as the Moneton, had previously been among the earliest recorded in the area. Conflicts with European settlers resulted in various displaced Native tribes settling in West Virginia, where they were known as &quot;Mingo&quot;, meaning &quot;remote affiliates of the Iroquois Confederacy&quot;.

The area now identified as West Virginia was contested territory among Anglo-Americans as well, with the colonies of Pennsylvania and Virginia claiming territorial rights under their colonial charters to this area before the American Revolutionary War. Some speculative land companies, such as the Vandalia Company, the Ohio Company and the Indiana Company, tried but failed to legitimize their claims to land in parts of West Virginia and present-day Kentucky. This rivalry resulted in some settlers petitioning the Continental Congress to create a new territory called Westsylvania. With the federal settlement of the Pennsylvania and Virginia border dispute, creating Kentucky County, Virginia, Kentuckians &quot;were satisfied [...] and the inhabitants of a large part of West Virginia were grateful.&quot;

The Crown considered the area of West Virginia part of the British Virginia Colony from 1607 to 1776. The United States considered this area the western part of the state of Virginia (commonly called &quot;Trans-Allegheny Virginia&quot;) from 1776 to 1863, before West Virginia&#x27;s formation. Its residents were discontented for years with their position in Virginia, as the government was dominated by the planter elite of the Tidewater and Piedmont areas. The legislature had electoral malapportionment, based on the counting of slaves toward regional populations, and western white residents were underrepresented in the state legislature. More subsistence and yeoman farmers lived in the west, and they were generally less supportive of slavery, although many counties were divided on their support. Residents of that area became more sharply divided after the planter elite of eastern Virginia voted to secede from the Union during the Civil War.

Residents of the western and northern counties set up a separate government under Francis Pierpont in 1861, which they called the Restored Government. Most voted to separate from Virginia, and the new state was admitted to the Union in 1863. In 1864 a state constitutional convention drafted a constitution, which was ratified by the legislature without putting it to popular vote. West Virginia abolished slavery by a gradual process and temporarily disenfranchised those who had held Confederate office or fought for the Confederacy.

West Virginia&#x27;s history has been profoundly affected by its mountainous terrain, numerous and vast river valleys, and rich natural resources. These were all factors driving its economy and the lifestyles of its residents, who tended to live in many small, relatively isolated communities in the mountain valleys.

===Prehistory===

A 2010 analysis of a local stalagmite revealed that Native Americans were burning forests to clear land as early as 100BCE. Some regional late-prehistoric Eastern Woodland tribes were more involved in hunting and fishing, practicing the Eastern Agricultural Complex gardening method which used fire to clear out underbrush from certain wooded areas. Another group progressed to the more time-consuming, advanced companion crop fields method of gardening. Also continuing from the ancient Indigenous people of the state, they cultivated tobacco through to early historic times. It was used in numerous social and religious rituals.

&quot;Maize (corn) did not make a substantial contribution to the diet until after 1150 BP&quot;, to quote Mills (OSU 2003). Eventually, tribal villages began depending on corn to feed their turkey flocks, as Kanawha Fort Ancients practiced bird husbandry. The local Natives made cornbread and a flat rye bread called &quot;bannock&quot; as they emerged from the protohistoric era. A horizon extending from a little before the early 18th century is sometimes called the acculturating &quot;Fireside Cabin culture&quot;. Trading posts were established by European traders along the Potomac and James rivers.

Tribes that inhabited West Virginia as of 1600 were the Siouan Monongahela Culture to the north, the Fort Ancient culture along the Ohio River from the Monongahela to Kentucky and extending an unknown distance inland, and the Eastern Siouan Tutelo and Moneton tribes in the southeast. There was also the Iroquoian Susquehannock in the region approximately east of the Monongahela River and north of the Monongahela National Forest, a possible tribe called the Senandoa, or Shenandoah, in the Shenandoah Valley and the easternmost tip of the state may have been home to the Manahoac people. The Monongahela may have been the same as a people known as the Calicua, or Cali. The following may have also all been the same tribe—Moneton, Moheton, Senandoa, Tomahitan.

During the Beaver Wars, other tribes moved into the region. The Iroquoian Tiontatecaga (also Little Mingo, Guyandotte) seem to have split off from the Petun after they were defeated by the Iroquois. They eventually settled somewhere between the Kanawha and Little Kanawha Rivers. During the 1750s, when the Mingo Seneca seceded from the Iroquois and returned to the Ohio River Valley, they contend that this tribe merged with them. The Shawnee arrived as well; though primarily stationed within former Monongahela territory approximately until 1750, they extended their influence throughout the Ohio River region. They were West Virginia&#x27;s last Native tribe and were driven out by the United States during the Shawnee Wars (1811–1813). The Erie, who were chased out of Ohio around 1655, are now believed to be the same as the Westo, who invaded as far as South Carolina before being destroyed in the 1680s. If so, their path would have brought them through West Virginia. The historical movement of the Tutelo and carbon dating of the Fort Ancients seem to correspond with the given period of 1655–1670 as the time of their removal. The Susquehannocks were original participants in the Beaver Wars but were cut off from the Ohio River by the Iroquois around 1630 and found themselves in dire straits. Suffering from disease and constant warfare and unable to provide for themselves financially, they began to collapse and moved further and further east, to the Susquehanna River of Eastern Pennsylvania. The Manahoac were probably forced out in the 1680s when the Iroquois began to invade Virginia. The Siouan tribes there moved into North Carolina and later returned as one tribe, known as the Eastern Blackfoot, or Christannas.

The Westo did not secure the territory they conquered. Even before they were gone, displaced natives from the south flooded into freshly conquered regions and took them over. These became known as the Shattaras, or West Virginia Cherokees. They took in and merged with the Monetons, who began to call themselves the Mohetons. The Calicua also began to call themselves Cherokees soon after, showing an apparent further merger. These Shattaras were closely related to the tribes that formed to the south in the aftermath of the Westo—the Yuchi and Cherokee. From 1715 to 1717, the Yamasee War sprang up. The Senandoa allegedly sided with the Yuchi and were destroyed by Yamasee allies. Therefore, if the Senandoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, this would mean the collapse of Shattara-Moneton culture. Another tribe that appeared in the region was the Canaragay, or Kanawha. It later migrated to Maryland and merged into colonial culture.

===European exploration and settlement===

In 1671, General Abraham Wood, at the direction of Royal Governor William Berkeley of the Virginia Colony, sent a party from Fort Henry led by Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam to survey this territory. They were the first Europeans recorded as discovering Kanawha Falls. Some sources state that Governor Alexander Spotswood&#x27;s 1716 Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition (for which the state&#x27;s Golden Horseshoe Competition for 8th graders is named) had penetrated as far as Pendleton County, but modern historians interpret the original accounts of the excursion as suggesting that none of the expedition&#x27;s horsemen ventured much farther west of the Blue Ridge Mountains than Harrisonburg, Virginia. John Van Metre, a Native trader, penetrated into the northern portion in 1725. The same year, German settlers from Pennsylvania founded New Mecklenburg, the present Shepherdstown, on the Potomac River, and others followed.

King Charles II of England, in 1661, granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, known as the Northern Neck. Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ultimately took possession of this grant, and in 1746 a stone was erected at the source of the North Branch Potomac River to mark his grant&#x27;s western limit. George Washington surveyed a considerable part of this land between 1748 and 1751. His diary recorded that there were already many squatters, largely of German origin, along the South Branch Potomac River.

Christopher Gist, a surveyor in the employ of the first Ohio Company, which was composed chiefly of Virginians, explored the country along the Ohio River north of the mouth of the Kanawha River between 1751 and 1752. The company sought to have a 14th colony established with the name &quot;Vandalia&quot;. Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, though they were hindered by Native American resistance. Few Native Americans lived permanently within the state&#x27;s present limits, but the region was a common hunting ground, crossed by many trails. During the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe),Native allies of the French nearly destroyed the scattered British settlements.

Shortly before the American Revolutionary War, in 1774 Crown Governor of Virginia John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, led a force over the mountains. A body of militia under then-Colonel Andrew Lewis dealt the Shawnee Natives, under Hokoleskwa (or &quot;Cornstalk&quot;), a crushing blow during the Battle of Point Pleasant at the junction of the Kanawha and the Ohio rivers. At the Treaty of Camp Charlotte concluding Dunmore&#x27;s War, Cornstalk agreed to recognize the Ohio River as the new boundary with the &quot;Long Knives&quot;. But by 1776 the Shawnee returned to war, joining the Chickamauga, a band of Cherokee known for the area where they lived. Native American attacks on settlers continued until after the American Revolutionary War. During the war, the settlers in western Virginia were generally active Whigs; many served in the Continental Army. Claypool&#x27;s Rebellion of 1780–1781, in which a group of men refused to pay taxes to the Continental Army, showed war-weariness in what became West Virginia.

===Trans-Allegheny Virginia===


Social conditions in western Virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern part. The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of Pennsylvania and included Germans, Protestant Scotch-Irish, and settlers from states farther north. Counties in the east and south were settled mostly by eastern Virginians. During the American Revolution, the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of &quot;Westsylvania&quot; was presented to Congress, on the grounds that the mountains presented an almost impassable barrier to the east. The rugged terrain made slavery unprofitable, and time only increased the social, political, economic, and cultural differences (&quot;see&quot; Tuckahoes and Cohees) between Virginia&#x27;s two sections.

In 1829, a constitutional convention met in Richmond to consider reforms to Virginia&#x27;s outdated constitution. Philip Doddridge of Brooke County championed the cause of western Virginians who sought a more democratic frame of government, but western reforms were rejected by leaders from east of the Alleghenies who &quot;clung to political power in an effort to preserve their plantation lifestyles dependent on enslaving blacks&quot;. Virginia leaders maintained a property qualification for suffrage, effectively disenfranchising poorer farmers in the west whose families did much of the farm work themselves. In addition, the 1829–30 convention gave slaveholding counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population in apportioning the state&#x27;s representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a result, every county west of the Alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution, which nevertheless passed because of eastern support. The eastern planter elite&#x27;s failure to make constitutional reforms exacerbated existing east–west sectionalism in Virginia and contributed to its division.

The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850–51, the Reform Convention, addressed a number of issues important to western Virginians. It extended the vote to all white males 21 years or older. The governor, lieutenant governor, the judiciary, sheriffs, and other county officers were to be elected by public vote. The General Assembly&#x27;s composition was changed. Representation in the House of Delegates was apportioned based on the census of 1850, counting whites only. The Senate representation was arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats, with the west receiving 20 senators and the east 30. This was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the General Assembly to reapportion representation based on the white population in 1865, or else put the matter to a public referendum. But the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value, except for slaves. Slaves under age 12 were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only $300, a fraction of their true value, but small farmers had all their assets, animals, and land taxed at full value. Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the west, the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new constitution. Most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the west.

Given these differences, many in the west had long contemplated a separate state. In particular, men such as lawyer Francis H. Pierpont from Fairmont had long chafed under the Tidewater and Piedmont slaveholders&#x27; political dominance. In addition to differences over slavery, he and allies felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west, such as turnpikes and railroads.

===Separation from Virginia===


West Virginia was the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate state (Virginia) during the Civil War. In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 voted to secede from the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner (which ultimately became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favor of the Ordinance of Secession, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions). Almost immediately after that vote, a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861. When this First Wheeling Convention met, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, though more than one-third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area. Soon there was a division of sentiment.

Some delegates led by pro-Union slaveowner John S. Carlile favored the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, as Virginia&#x27;s secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum (as happened on May 23), such action would constitute revolution against the United States. The convention decided that if Virginians adopted the secession ordinance (of which there was little doubt), another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in Wheeling in June 1861. On May 23, 1861, secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the ordinance.

The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on June 11 and declared that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its acts were void and all who adhered to it had vacated their offices. The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western Virginia. Of its 103 members, 33 had been elected to the Virginia General Assembly on May 23. This included some hold-over state senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and some who vacated their offices to convene in Wheeling. Other members &quot;were chosen even more irregularly—some in mass meetings, others by county committee, and still others were seemingly self-appointed&quot;. An act for the reorganization of the government was passed on June 19. The next day, convention delegates chose Francis H. Pierpont as governor of Virginia and elected other officers to a rival state government and two U.S. senators (Willey and Carlile) to replace secessionists before adjourning. The federal government promptly recognized the new government and seated the two new senators. Thus there were two state governments in Virginia: one pledging allegiance to the United States and one to the Confederacy.

The second Wheeling Convention had recessed until August 6, then reassembled on August 20 and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote were favorable. In the October 24, 1861, election, 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and 781 against. The election results were questioned since the Union army then occupied the area and Union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting. This was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in camps of Confederate soldiers, who elected rival state officials, such as Robert E. Cowan. Most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the northern panhandle. Over 50,000 votes had been cast on the Ordinance of Secession, yet the vote on statehood garnered little more than 19,000. In Ohio County, home to Wheeling, only about a fourth of the registered voters cast votes. In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote at all, as two-thirds of the territory of West Virginia had voted for secession, and county officers remained loyal to Richmond. Votes recorded from pro-secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by Unionist refugees from these counties.

Despite that controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to write a constitution for the new state, beginning on November 26, 1861. During that constitutional convention, a Mr. Lamb of Ohio County and a Mr. Carskadon claimed that in Hampshire County, out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state; the rest were cast illegally by Union soldiers. One of the key figures was Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools, as well as to limit the movement of slaves into the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery. The education proposal succeeded, but the convention tabled the slavery proposals before finishing its work on February 18, 1862. The new constitution was more closely modeled on Ohio&#x27;s than Virginia&#x27;s, adopting a township model of government rather than the &quot;courthouse cliques&quot; of Virginia which Carlile criticized, and a compromise demanded by the Kanawha region (Charleston lawyers Benjamin Smith and Brown) allowed counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railroads or other improvement organizations. The resulting instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on April 11, 1862.
On May 13, 1862, the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state. An application for admission to the Union was made to Congress, introduced by Senator Waitman Willey of the Restored Government of Virginia. Carlile sought to sabotage the bill, first trying to expand the new state&#x27;s boundaries to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then to defeat the Willey amendment at home. On December 31, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln approved an enabling act admitting West Virginia on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution (as Battelle had urged in the &quot;Wheeling Intelligencer&quot; and also written to Lincoln). While many felt West Virginia&#x27;s admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln issued his &quot;Opinion on the Admission of West Virginia&quot; finding that &quot;the body which consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Legislature of Virginia&quot;, and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient.
The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met. The revised constitution was adopted on March 26, 1863, and on April 20, 1863, Lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state 60 days later on June 20, 1863. Meanwhile, officers for the new state were chosen, while Pierpont moved his pro-Union Virginia capital to Union-occupied Alexandria, where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all the remaining Virginia counties within the federal lines.

The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was later brought before the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Virginia v. West Virginia.&quot; Berkeley and Jefferson counties, lying on the Potomac east of the mountains, voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia in 1863, with the consent of Virginia&#x27;s reorganized government.

Many voters of the strongly pro-secessionist counties were absent in the Confederate Army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer when they returned. The Virginia General Assembly repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against West Virginia asking the court to declare the counties part of Virginia, which would have made West Virginia&#x27;s admission as a state unconstitutional. Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer. The Supreme Court decided in West Virginia&#x27;s favor in 1870.

====Claims by Maryland====
The original charters for Maryland and Virginia were silent as to which branch of the upper Potomac was the boundary. This was settled by the 1785 Mount Vernon Conference. Nevertheless, when West Virginia seceded from Virginia, Maryland claimed West Virginia land north of the South Branch (all of Mineral and Grant Counties and parts of Hampshire, Hardy, Tucker and Pendleton Counties). The Supreme Court rejected these claims in two separate decisions in 1910.

===In the Civil War===
During the Civil War, Union General George B. McClellan&#x27;s forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating at the Battle of Rich Mountain, and Union control was never again seriously threatened. In 1863, General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 Confederates, raided a considerable portion of the state and burned Pierpont&#x27;s library, although Willey escaped their grasp. Bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections, and were not entirely suppressed until the war ended. The eastern panhandle counties were more affected by the war, with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands.

The area that became West Virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the Union and Confederate armies, about 22,000–25,000 each. In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to strip voting rights from returning Confederates in order to retain control. James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said if it was not enacted he would lose the election by 500 votes. Confederates&#x27; property might also be confiscated, and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the Confederacy was adopted. The addition of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution caused a reaction. The Democratic party secured control in 1870, and in 1871 the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated. Republicans had taken the first steps toward this change in 1870. On August 22, 1872, an entirely new constitution was adopted.

Beginning in Reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states disputed the new state&#x27;s share of the prewar Virginia government&#x27;s debts, which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements, such as canals, roads, and railroads under the Virginia Board of Public Works. Virginians—led by former Confederate general William Mahone—formed a political coalition based upon this: the Readjuster Party. West Virginia&#x27;s first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the Virginia debt, but negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were fruitless, and in 1871 Virginia funded two-thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to West Virginia. The issue was finally settled in 1915, when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50. The final installment of this sum was paid in 1939.

===Development of natural resources===

After Reconstruction, the new 35th state benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other single economic activity.

Saltpeter caves had been employed throughout Appalachia for munitions; the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the &quot;Saltpeter Trail&quot;, a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate which were rendered and sold to the government. The trail stretched from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the route in the town of Union, Monroe County. Nearly half of these caves are on the West Virginia side, including Organ Cave and Haynes Cave. In the late 18th century, saltpeter miners in Haynes Cave found large animal bones in the deposits. These were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier Colonel John Stuart to Thomas Jefferson. The bones were named &quot;Megalonyx jeffersonii&quot;, or great-claw, and became known as Jefferson&#x27;s three-toed sloth. It was declared the official state fossil of West Virginia in 2008. The West Virginia official state rock is bituminous coal, and the official state gemstone is silicified Mississippian fossil Lithostrotionella coral.

The limestone also produced a useful quarry industry. Usually small, and softer, high-calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime. This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years a specific portion of the C &amp; O Railroad carried limestone rock to Clifton Forge, Virginia as an industrial flux.

Salt mining had been underway since the 18th century, though it had largely played out by the time of the American Civil War, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valued commodity of first Confederate, and later Union, forces. In the years following, more sophisticated mining methods would restore West Virginia&#x27;s role as a major producer of salt.

However, in the second half of the 19th century, there was an even greater treasure not yet developed: bituminous coal. It would fuel much of the Industrial Revolution in the U.S. and the steamships of many of the world&#x27;s navies.

The residents (both Native Americans and early European settlers) had long known of the underlying coal, and that it could be used for heating and fuel. However, for a long time, &quot;personal&quot; or artisanal mining was the only practical development. After the War, with the new railroads came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding U.S. and export markets. As the anthracite mines of northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period, investors and industrialists focused new interest in West Virginia. Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects.

The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) across the state to the new city of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River Coal Field. Soon, the C&amp;O was building its huge coal pier at Newport News, Virginia, on the large harbor of Hampton Roads. In 1881, the new Philadelphia-based owners of the former Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O), which stretched across Virginia&#x27;s southern tier from Norfolk, had sights clearly set on West Virginia, where the owners had large landholdings. Their railroad was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W), and a new railroad city was developed at Roanoke to handle planned expansion. After its new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam, which Kimball&#x27;s wife named &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, the N&amp;W redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it. Soon, the N&amp;W was also shipping from new coal piers at Hampton Roads.

In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and Western rail lines, the important coal center of Bluefield, West Virginia, was founded. The &quot;capital&quot; of the Pocahontas coalfield, this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades. It shares its name with a sister city, Bluefield, in Virginia.

In the northern portion of the state and elsewhere, the older Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities. The B&amp;O developed coal piers in Baltimore and at several points on the Great Lakes. Other significant rail carriers of coal were the Western Maryland Railway (WM), Southern Railway (SOU), and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N).

Particularly notable was a latecomer, the Virginian Railway (VGN). By 1900, only the most rugged terrain of southern West Virginia was any distance from the existing railroads and mining activity. Within this area west of the New River Coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties lay the Winding Gulf Coalfield, later promoted as the &quot;Billion Dollar Coalfield&quot;.

A protégé of Dr. Ansted was William Nelson Page (1854–1932), a civil engineer and mining manager in Fayette County. Former West Virginia governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land &quot;as a farmer knows a field&quot;. Beginning in 1898, Page teamed with northern and European-based investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area. They acquired large tracts of land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short-line railroad chartered to stretch between the C&amp;O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&amp;W at Matoaka—a distance of about .

Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad, leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme. In secret collusion, each declined to negotiate favorable rates with Page, nor did they offer to purchase his railroad, as they had many other short-lines. However, if the C&amp;O and N&amp;W presidents thought they could thus kill the Page project, they were to be proved mistaken. One of the silent partner investors Page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a principal in John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil Trust and an old hand at developing natural resources and transportation. A master at competitive &quot;warfare&quot;, Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his endeavors and also had &quot;deep pockets&quot;.

Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across Virginia, using Rogers&#x27; private fortune to finance the $40 million cost. When the renamed Virginian Railway (VGN) was completed in 1909, no fewer than three railroads were shipping ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads. West Virginia coal was also in high demand at Great Lakes ports. The VGN and the N&amp;W ultimately became parts of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the VGN&#x27;s well-engineered 20th-century tracks continue to offer a favorable gradient to Hampton Roads.

As coal mining and related work became major employment activities in the state, there was considerable labor strife as working conditions, safety issues and economic concerns arose. Even in the 21st century, mining safety and ecological concerns are still challenging to the state whose coal continues to power electrical generating plants in many other states.

Coal is not the only valuable mineral found in West Virginia, as the state was the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34.48 carat (6.896 g) Jones Diamond.

==Geography==

Located in the Appalachian Mountains, West Virginia covers an area of , with of land and of water, making it the 41st-largest state in the United States. West Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest, and Kentucky in the southwest. Its longest border is with Virginia at , followed by Ohio at , Maryland at , Pennsylvania at , and Kentucky at .

===Geology and terrain===

West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving the reason for the nickname &quot;The Mountain State&quot; and the motto &quot;Montani Semper Liberi&quot; (&quot;Mountaineers are always free&quot;). The elevations and ruggedness drop near large rivers like the Ohio River or Shenandoah River. About 75% of the state is within the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions. Though the relief is not high, the plateau region is extremely rugged in most areas. The average elevation of West Virginia is approximately above sea level, which is the highest of any U.S. state east of the Mississippi River.

On the eastern state line with Virginia, high peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region give rise to an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those of northern New England and eastern Canada. The highest point in the state is atop Spruce Knob, at , and is covered in a boreal forest of dense spruce trees at altitudes above . Spruce Knob lies within the Monongahela National Forest and is a part of the Spruce Knob–Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area. A total of six wilderness areas can also be found within the forest. Outside the forest to the south, the New River Gorge is a canyon deep, carved by the New River. The National Park Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.

Other areas under protection and management include:

Most of West Virginia lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion, while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian–Blue Ridge forests. The native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak, chestnut, maple, beech, and white pine, with willow and American sycamore along the state&#x27;s waterways. Many of the areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact appreciated by native West Virginians, who refer to their home as &quot;Almost Heaven&quot; (from the song &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; by John Denver). Before the song, it was known as &quot;The Cog State&quot; (Coal, Oil, and Gas) or &quot;The Mountain State&quot;.

The underlying rock strata are Paleozoic Era sandstones, shales, bituminous coal beds, and limestones laid down in near-shore environments. The sandstones and shales were derived from sediments eroded from former mountains to the east, then deposited in a shallow inland sea to the west. The limestones were derived from biomineralizing marine organisms such as calcareous algae, brachiopods, and crinoids. Coals were formed in coastal swamp environments, and deltaic environments formed near the mouths of ancient rivers. Sea level rose and fell many times during the Carboniferous Period (Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Subperiods), yielding a variety of rock strata that dominate the bedrock today. The Appalachian Mountains, which are a major influence on the present-day geography of West Virginia, formed more than three hundred million years ago.

The State Fossil of West Virginia is the giant ground sloth &quot;Megalonyx jeffersonii,&quot; which lived during the Pleistocene Epoch (the most recent &quot;Ice Age&quot;). The genus was described by Thomas Jefferson in 1799 from remains collected in Haynes Cave, Monroe County, West Virginia. In 1799, that area was considered to belong to the western part of the State of Virginia. &quot;Megalonyx&quot; was the first genus of fossil vertebrate animal named from the United States.

===Climate===

The climate of West Virginia is generally a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;, except &quot;Dfb&quot; at the higher elevations) with warm to hot, humid summers and chilly winters, increasing in severity with elevation. Some southern highland areas also have a mountain temperate climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are somewhat cooler. However, the weather is subject in all parts of the state to change. The hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the central Appalachian Mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest elevations.

In the eastern panhandle and the Ohio River valley, temperatures are warm enough to see and grow subtropical plants such as southern magnolia (&quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot;), crepe myrtle, &quot;Albizia julibrissin&quot;, American sweetgum and even the occasional needle palm and sabal minor. These plants do not thrive as well in other parts of the state. The eastern prickly pear grows well in many portions of the state.

Average January temperatures range from around 26 °F (−4 °C) near the Cheat River to 41 °F (5 °C) along sections of the border with Kentucky. July averages range from 67 °F (19 °C) along the North Branch Potomac River to 76 °F (24 °C) in the western part of the state. It is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state. The highest recorded temperature in the state is at Martinsburg on July 10, 1936, and the lowest recorded temperature in the state is at Lewisburg on December 30, 1917.

Annual precipitation ranges from less than in the lower eastern section to more than in higher parts of the Allegheny Front. Valleys in the east have lower rainfall because the Allegheny mountain ridges to the west create a partial rain shadow. Slightly more than half the rainfall occurs from April to September. Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section, especially the Tygart Valley. West Virginia is also one of the cloudiest states in the nation, with the cities of Elkins and Beckley ranking 9th and 10th in the U.S. respectively for the number of cloudy days per year (over 210). In addition to persistent cloudy skies caused by the damming of moisture by the Alleghenies, West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation, with Snowshoe averaging nearly 200 days a year with either rain or snow. Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections but may persist for weeks in the higher mountain areas. An average of of snow falls annually in Charleston, although during the winter of 1995–1996 more than three times that amount fell as several cities in the state established new records for snowfall. Average snowfall in the Allegheny Highlands can range up to per year. Severe weather is somewhat less prevalent in West Virginia than in most other eastern states, and it ranks among the least tornado-prone states east of the Rockies.

===Flora and fauna===
===Major cities===
There are 232 incorporated municipalities in West Virginia. Charleston is the state&#x27;s capital and most populous city; the Charleston metropolitan area has approximately 200,000 residents. The Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area is anchored by Huntington, the state&#x27;s second-most populous city. Other metro areas in the state include Morgantown, Wheeling, Weirton, Beckley, and Parkersburg–Vienna. Other metropolitan areas that contain cities in West Virginia, but are primarily in other states include Cumberland, Maryland; Hagerstown, Maryland; Washington, D.C.; and Winchester, Virginia. Another six cities function as the centers of micropolitan statistical areas, which are predominantly more rural: Bluefield, Clarksburg, Elkins, Fairmont, Logan, and Point Pleasant.

Originally, the state capital was located in Wheeling, from 1863 to 1870. It was then moved to Charleston, a more central city, from 1870 to 1875, when it returned to Wheeling. In 1885, the capitol burned down and it was moved back to Charleston that year, where a vote was held to determine the permanent capital between Charleston, Clarksburg, and Martinsburg. Charleston was selected, and it has remained the capital since.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, West Virginia&#x27;s population was 1,793,716, a 3.2% decrease from the 2010 United States census. West Virginia&#x27;s center of population is in Gassaway.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 1,375 homeless people in West Virginia.

As of 2019, West Virginia has an estimated population of 1,792,147, which is a decrease of 10,025 (0.55%) from the prior year and a decrease of 47,162 (2.55%) since the previous census. This includes a natural decrease of 3,296 (108,292 births minus 111,588 deaths) and an increase from net migration of 14,209 into the state. West Virginia is the least populous southeastern state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 3,691, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 10,518.

In 2018, The top countries of origin for West Virginia&#x27;s immigrants were Mexico, China, India, the Philippines and Germany.

Only 1.6% of the state&#x27;s residents were foreign-born, placing West Virginia last among the 50 states in that statistic. It also has the lowest percentage of residents who speak a language other than English at home (2.6%).

The five largest ancestry groups in West Virginia according to the American Community Survey are: American 22%, English 17%, German 13%, Irish 10% and Italian 4%

Large numbers of people of German ancestry are present in the northeastern counties of the state. People of English ancestry are present throughout the entire state. Many West Virginians who self-identify as Irish are actually Scots-Irish Protestants. African Americans are concentrated in Metro Valley in the vicinity of Charleston and Huntington. African Americans also live in the New River/Greenbrier Valley. There are also small numbers of Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans in West Virginia. There is also a Romani community in West Virginia. There are also Melungeons in the state.
2010 census data show that 16 percent of West Virginia&#x27;s residents are 65 or older (exceeded only by Florida&#x27;s 17 percent).

There were 20,928 births in 2006. Of these, 19,757 (94.40% of the births, 95.19% of the population) were to non-Hispanic whites. There were 22 births to Native American (0.11% of the births and 0.54% of the population), 177 births to Asians (0.85% of the births and 0.68% of the population), 219 births to Hispanics (1.05% of the births and 0.88% of the population) and 753 births to blacks and others (3.60% of the births and 3.56% of the population). The county with the highest percentage of residents under 18 is Berkeley County with 23.5% and Gilmer County with the lowest percentage at 15.3%.

The state&#x27;s northern panhandle and north-central region feel an affinity for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Also, those in the eastern panhandle feel a connection with the Washington, D.C. suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, and southern West Virginians often consider themselves Southerners. Finally, the towns and farms along the mid-Ohio River, which forms most of the state&#x27;s western border, have an appearance and culture somewhat resembling the Midwest.

===Birth data===
&quot;Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.&quot;

* Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one &quot;Hispanic&quot; group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

===Languages===

In 2010 97.67% (1,697,042) of West Virginia residents aged 5 years and older spoke English as their primary language. 2.33% of residents spoke a mother language other than English.

===Religion===
Several surveys of West Virginians&#x27; religious affiliation have been made in recent years, including in 2008 by the American Religion Identity Survey, and in 2010 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. The Pew survey results admit to a 6.5% margin of error, while the ARIS survey says &quot;estimates are subject to larger sampling errors in states with small populations.&quot; A characteristic of religion in Appalachian communities is the abundance of independent, non-affiliated churches, which &quot;remain unnoted and uncounted in any census of church life in the United States&quot;. This sometimes leads to the belief that these communities are &quot;unchurched&quot;.

The largest denomination as of 2010, according to Association of Religion Data Archives, was the United Methodist Church with 136,000 members in 1,200 congregations. The second-largest Protestant church was the American Baptist Churches USA, with 88,000 members and 381 congregations. The Southern Baptist church had 44,000 members and 232 congregations. The Churches of Christ had 22,000 members and 287 congregations. The Presbyterian Church (USA) had 200 congregations and 20,000 members. By the 2020 ARDA study, non-denominational Protestantism became the largest Christian group, with 152,518 adherents.

A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that West Virginia was the seventh-most &quot;highly religious&quot; state in the nation. A 2020 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 69% of the adult population was Christian, reflecting a slight decrease since the Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2015 survey. In 2020, a survey of nearly 1,900 West Virginians reported that 78.6% were Christian and 16.2% were unaffiliated. In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute estimated 67% of the state was Christian (53% Protestant, 11% Catholic, 2% Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, and 1% Mormon), 28% unaffiliated, 3% New Ager, and 2% Buddhist.

==Economy==

According to the World Bank, West Virginia&#x27;s economy would nominally be the world&#x27;s 69th-largest, behind Luxembourg and ahead of Bulgaria. The state has a projected nominal GDP of $85.434 billion in 2009 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis report as of 2021, and a real GDP of $71.343 billion. The state&#x27;s real GDP growth of 1.3% in 2021 was the 8th-best in the country.

While per capita income fell 2.6% nationally in 2009, West Virginia&#x27;s grew at 1.8%. Through the first half of 2010, exports from West Virginia topped $3 billion, growing 39.5% over the same period from the previous year and ahead of the national average by 15.7%.

&quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Morgantown as the 10th-best small city in the nation to conduct business in 2010. The city is also home to West Virginia University, the 95th-best public university, according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2011. The proportion of West Virginia&#x27;s adult population with a bachelor&#x27;s degree is the lowest in the U.S., at 17.3%.

The net corporate income tax rate is 6.5% while business costs are 13% below the national average.

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 2014 West Virginia&#x27;s economy grew twice as fast as the next fastest-growing state east of the Mississippi River, ranking third alongside Wyoming and just behind North Dakota and Texas among the fastest-growing states.

===Tourism===
Tourism contributed $4.27 billion to the state&#x27;s economy and employed 44,400 people in 2010, making it one of the state&#x27;s largest industries. Many tourists, especially in the eastern mountains, are drawn to the region&#x27;s notable opportunities for outdoor recreation. Canaan Valley is popular for winter sports, Seneca Rocks is one of the premier rock climbing destinations in the eastern U.S., the New River Gorge/Fayetteville area draws rock climbers as well as whitewater rafting enthusiasts, and the Monongahela National Forest is popular with hikers, backpackers, hunters, and anglers.

Also drawing tourism to the state is the West Virginia State Park &amp; State Forest system, which comprises 45 units covering 164,000 acres. In 2021, over 9 million people visited a West Virginia State Park, the highest number on record. This is partly due to a recent $151 million improvement project that has seen improvements at every park and forest.

In addition to such outdoor recreation opportunities, the state offers a number of historic and cultural attractions. Harpers Ferry National Historical Park is a historic town situated at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers. Harpers Ferry was the site of John Brown&#x27;s 1859 raid on the U.S. Armory and Arsenal. Located at the approximate midpoint of the Appalachian Trail, Harpers Ferry is the base of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.

The Greenbrier hotel and resort, originally built in 1778, has long been considered a premier hotel, frequented by numerous world leaders and U.S. presidents over the years.

West Virginia is the site of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which features the Green Bank Telescope. For the 1963 Centennial of the State, it hosted two high school graduate delegates from each of the 50 States at the National Youth Science Camp near Bartow, and has continued this tradition ever since. The main building of Weston State Hospital is the largest hand-cut sandstone building in the western hemisphere, second worldwide only to the Kremlin in Moscow. Tours of the building, which is a National Historic Landmark and part of the National Civil War Trail, are offered seasonally and by appointment year-round. West Virginia has numerous popular festivals throughout the year.

===Energy===
One of the major resources in West Virginia&#x27;s economy is coal. According to the Energy Information Administration, West Virginia is a top coal producer in the United States, second only to Wyoming. West Virginia is located in the heart of the Marcellus Shale Natural Gas Bed, which stretches from Tennessee north to New York in the middle of Appalachia.

As of 2017, the coal industry accounted for 2% of state employment. Nearly all the electricity generated in West Virginia is from coal-fired power plants. West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the nation in net interstate electricity exports. Farming is also practiced in West Virginia, but on a limited basis because of the mountainous terrain over much of the state.

An assessment from 2012 estimated that West Virginia had the potential to generate 8,627 GWh/year from 2,772 MW of 100-meter wind turbines, and 60,000 GWh from 40,000 MW of photovoltaics, including 3,810 MW of rooftop photovoltaics. This was based on then-existing technologies and apparently was based on some assumed requirements for the economic performance of the respective resources.

===Taxes===

West Virginia personal income tax is based on federal adjusted gross income (not taxable income), as modified by specific items in West Virginia law. Citizens are taxed within five income brackets, which range from 3.0% to 6.5%. The state&#x27;s consumer sales tax is levied at 6% on most products except for non-prepared foods.

West Virginia counties administer and collect property taxes, although property tax rates reflect levies for state government, county governments, county boards of education and municipalities. Counties may also impose a hotel occupancy tax on lodging places not located within the city limits of any municipality that levies such a tax. Municipalities may levy license and gross receipts taxes on businesses located within the city limits and a hotel occupancy tax on lodging places in the city. Although the Department of Tax and Revenue plays a major role in the administration of this tax, less than half of one percent of the property tax collected goes to state government.

The primary beneficiaries of the property tax are county boards of education. Property taxes are paid to the sheriff of each of the state&#x27;s 55 counties. Each county and municipality can impose its own rates of property taxation within the limits set by the West Virginia Constitution. The West Virginia legislature sets the rate of tax of county boards of education. This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide. However, the total tax rate for county boards of education may differ from county to county because of excess levies. The Department of Tax and Revenue supervises and otherwise assists counties and municipalities in their work of assessment and tax rate determination. The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities: state, county, schools and municipal. This total tax rate varies for each of the four classes of property, which consists of personal, real and intangible properties. Property is assessed according to its use, location and value as of July 1. WV Assessments has a free searchable database of West Virginia real estate tax assessments, covering current and past years. All property is reappraised every three years; annual adjustments are made to assessments for property with a change of value. West Virginia does not impose an inheritance tax. Because of the phase-out of the federal estate tax credit, West Virginia&#x27;s estate tax is not imposed on estates of persons who died on or after January 1, 2005.

==Quality of life==


===Economy===
West Virginia coal exports declined 40% in 2013—a loss of $2.9 billion and overall total exports declined 26%. West Virginia ranked last in the Gallup Economic Index for the fourth year running. West Virginia&#x27;s score was −44, or a full 17 points lower than the average of −27 for the other states in the bottom ten. West Virginia ranked 48th in the CNBC &quot;Top States for Business 2013&quot; based on measures of competitiveness such as economy, workforce and cost of living—ranking among the bottom five states for the last six years running. West Virginia ranked 49th in the 2014 State New Economy Index and has ranked in the bottom three states since 1999. West Virginia ranked last or next-to-last in critical indicators such as Workforce Education, Entrepreneurial Activity, High-Tech Jobs, and Scientists and Engineers.

===Employment===

In 2012, West Virginia&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.3%. The state issued a report highlighting the state&#x27;s GDP as indicating a fast-growing economy, but did not address employment indicators. In 2009–2013, the U.S. real GDP increased 9.6% and total employment increased 3.9%. In West Virginia during the same time period, its real GDP increased about 11%, while total employment decreased by 1,000 jobs from 746,000 to 745,000.

In 2013, West Virginia ranked last in the nation with an employment-to-population ratio of only 50%, compared to the national average of 59%. The state lost 5,600 jobs in its labor force in four critical economic sectors: construction (1,900), manufacturing (1,100), retail (1,800), and education (800), while gaining just 400 in mining and logging. The state&#x27;s Civilian Labor Force dropped by 15,100.

===Wages and poverty===

Personal income growth in West Virginia during 2013 was only 1.5%—the lowest in the nation—and about half the national average (2.6%). Overall income growth in West Virginia in the last thirty years has been only 13%—about a third of the national average (37%). Wages of the impoverished bottom 1% income earners decreased by 3%, compared to the national average, which increased 19%.

West Virginia&#x27;s poverty rate is one of the highest in the nation. 2017 estimates indicate that 19% of the state&#x27;s population lives in poverty, exceeding the national average of 13%.

===Population===

United Van Lines 37th Annual Migration Study showed in 2013 that 60% more people moved out of West Virginia than moved in. West Virginia&#x27;s population is expected to decline by more than 19,000 residents by 2030, and West Virginia lost one of its three seats in the United States House of Representatives in the 2020 census. West Virginia is the only state where death rates exceed birth rates. During 2010–2013, about 21,000 babies per year were born in West Virginia, but over these three years West Virginia had 3,000 more deaths than births.

===Family===

Gallup-Healthways annual &quot;State of American Well-Being&quot; rankings reports that 1,261 concerned West Virginians rated themselves as &quot;suffering&quot; in categories such as Quality of Life, Physical Health, and Access to Basic Needs. Overall, West Virginia citizens rated themselves as being more miserable than people in all other states—for five years running. In addition, the Gallup Well-Being Index for 2013 ranked Charleston, the state capital, and Huntington last and next-to-last out of 189 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas.

The Annie E. Casey Foundation&#x27;s National Index of Children&#x27;s Progress ranked West Virginia 43rd in the nation for all kids, and last for white kids. The Annie E. Casey Foundation&#x27;s 2013 KIDS COUNT Data Book also ranked West Virginia&#x27;s education system 47th in the nation for the second straight year. Charleston, West Virginia has the worst divorce rate among 100 cities in the nation. Stephen Smith, the executive director of the West Virginia Healthy Kids and Families Coalition, said poor employment prospects are to blame: &quot;The pressure to make a good living puts strain on a marriage, and right now it is infinitely harder to make a living here than it was 40 years ago.&quot;

===Health===

United Health Foundation&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Health Rankings&quot; for 2013 found that Americans are making considerable progress in key health measures. West Virginia, however, ranked either last or second-to-last in twenty categories, including cancer, child immunization, diabetes, disabilities, drug deaths, teeth loss, low birth weight, missed work days due to health, prescription drug overdose, preventable hospitalizations, and senior clinical care. Wisconsin Population Health Institute annual &quot;Health Rankings&quot; for 2012 showed West Virginia spends $9,671 per capita on health care annually. El Salvador spends just $467, yet both have the same life expectancy. In 2012, according to the Census Bureau, West Virginia was the only state where death rates exceed birth rates. During 2010–2013, about 21,000 babies per year were born in West Virginia, but there were 24,000 deaths. In demographics, this is called a &quot;net mortality society&quot;.

The National Center for Health Statistics says national birth rates for teenagers are at historic lows—during 2007–2010, teen birth rates fell 17% nationally. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. A study by West Virginia&#x27;s Marshall University showed that 19% of babies born in the state have evidence of drug or alcohol exposure. This is several times the national rate, where studies show that about 5.9% of pregnant women in the U.S. use illicit drugs, and about 8.5% consume any alcohol. An Institute for Health Policy Research study determined that mortality rates in Appalachia are correlated with coal production. In twenty West Virginia coal counties mining more than a million tons of coal per year and having a total population of 850,000, there are about 10,100 deaths per year, with 1,400 of those statistically attributed to deaths from heart, respiratory and kidney disease from living in an Appalachian coal county.

In 2015, McDowell County had the highest rate of drug-induced deaths of any county in the United States, with a rate of 141 deaths per 100,000 people. Four of the five counties with the highest rates of drug-induced deaths are in West Virginia (McDowell, Wyoming, Cabell and Raleigh Counties). In 2022, West Virginia had the highest drug overdose death rate of any US state, at 80.9 per 100,000 people.

American environmental attorney Robert Bilott exposed how DuPont had been knowingly polluting water with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in Parkersburg, West Virginia, since the 1980s. This battle with DuPont is depicted in the film &quot;Dark Waters&quot;.

====Life expectancy====
The residents of West Virginia have a lower life expectancy than the national average. In 2014 life expectancy for both sexes in the state was 76.0 years compared to 79.1 years for the United States as a whole. In 2014, males in West Virginia lived an average of 73.6 years compared to a national average of 76.7 years and females lived an average of 77.5 years compared to a national average of 81.5 years. Male life expectancy in West Virginia between 1980 and 2014 increased by 4.7 years, compared to a national average of a 6.7-year increase. Life expectancy for females in West Virginia between 1980 and 2014 increased by 1.7 years, compared to a national average of a 4.0-year increase. Life expectancy for both sexes is among the lowest of all states.

Life expectancies in 2014 for both sexes in West Virginia counties ranged from a low of 70.3 years in McDowell County to a high of 79.3 years in Pendleton County. McDowell and several other West Virginia counties are among the counties in the U.S. with the lowest life expectancies.

==Government and politics==

The West Virginia Legislature is bicameral. It consists of the House of Delegates and the Senate, both housed in the West Virginia State Capitol. It is a citizen&#x27;s legislature, meaning that legislative office is not a full-time occupation, but rather a part-time position. Consequently, the legislators often hold full-time jobs in their community of residence.

Typically, the legislature is in session for 60 days between January and early April. The final day of the regular session ends in a bewildering fury of last-minute legislation to meet a constitutionally imposed midnight deadline. During the remainder of the year, monthly interim sessions are held in preparation for the regular session. Legislators also gather periodically for &#x27;special&#x27; sessions when called by the governor.

The governor, elected every four years on the same day as the U.S. presidential election, is sworn in during the following January. Governors of West Virginia can serve two consecutive terms but must sit out a term before serving a third term in office. The title of Lieutenant Governor is assigned by statute to the senate president. West Virginia&#x27;s current governor is Patrick Morrisey.

West Virginia&#x27;s highest court is the Supreme Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is the busiest appellate court of its type in the United States. West Virginia is one of 11 states with a single appellate court. The state constitution allows for the creation of an intermediate court of appeals, but the Legislature has never created one. The Supreme Court is made up of five justices, elected in nonpartisan elections to 12-year terms. For the purpose of courts of general jurisdiction, the state is divided into 31 judicial circuits. Each circuit is made up of one or more counties. Circuit judges are elected in non-partisan elections to serve eight-year terms.

West Virginia is an alcoholic beverage control state, but unlike most such states, it does not operate retail outlets, having exited that business in 1990. It retains a monopoly on wholesaling of distilled spirits only. West Virginia is one of 27 states that do not have a death penalty, and it was the only state in the southeastern United States to have abolished it until 2021, when Virginia did so as well.

===Politics===

West Virginia is regarded as a heavily Republican, &quot;deep red&quot; state at the federal level. Since 2000, West Virginians have supported the Republican candidate in every presidential election. In the 2024 presidential election, Republican Donald Trump won all of the state&#x27;s counties and 69.97% of the vote, the highest percentage any party has won in the state&#x27;s history. West Virginia was Trump&#x27;s best performance in 2016. The 2008 presidential election was the last to date in which the Democratic nominee won any of the state&#x27;s counties.

At the state level, West Virginia&#x27;s politics were largely dominated by the Democratic Party from the Great Depression through the 2000s. This was a legacy of West Virginia&#x27;s very strong tradition of union membership. After the 2014 midterm elections Democrats controlled the governorship, the majority of statewide offices, and one U.S. Senate seat, while Republicans held one U.S. Senate seat, all three of the state&#x27;s U.S. House seats, and a majority in both houses of the West Virginia Legislature. In the 2016 elections, the Republicans held on to their seats and made gains in the State Senate and gained three statewide offices.

Evangelical Christians comprised 52% of the state&#x27;s voters in 2008. A poll in 2005 showed that 53% of West Virginia voters are anti-abortion, the seventh highest in the country. A 2014 poll by Pew Research found that 35% of West Virginians supported legal abortion in &quot;all or most cases&quot; while 58% wanted it to be banned &quot;in all or most cases&quot;.

A September 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 19% of West Virginia voters thought same-sex marriage should be legal, while 71% thought it should be illegal and 10% were not sure. A separate question on the same survey found that 43% of West Virginia voters supported the legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 17% supporting same-sex marriage, 26% supporting civil unions but not marriage, 54% favoring no legal recognition and 3% not sure. In 2008, 58% favored troop withdrawal from Iraq while just 32% wanted troops to remain. On fiscal policy in 2008, 52% said raising taxes on the wealthier individuals would benefit the economy, while 45% disagreed.

In a 2020 study, West Virginia was ranked as the 16th hardest state for citizens to vote in.

==Transportation==


Highways form the backbone of transportation systems in West Virginia, with over of public roads in the state. Airports, railroads, and rivers complete the commercial transportation modes for West Virginia. Commercial air travel is facilitated by airports in Charleston, Huntington, Morgantown, Beckley, Lewisburg, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg. All but Charleston and Huntington are subsidized by the federal Department of Transportation&#x27;s Essential Air Service program. The cities of Charleston, Huntington, Beckley, Wheeling, Morgantown, Clarksburg, Parkersburg and Fairmont have bus-based public transit systems.

West Virginia University in Morgantown boasts the PRT (personal rapid transit) system, the state&#x27;s only single-rail public transit system. Developed by Boeing, the WVU School of Engineering and the Department of Transportation, it was a model for low-capacity light transport designed for smaller cities. Recreational transportation opportunities abound in West Virginia, including hiking trails, rail trails, ATV off-road trails, white water rafting rivers, and two tourist railroads, the Cass Scenic Railroad and the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad.

Rail lines in the state used to be more prevalent, but many lines have been discontinued because of increased automobile traffic. Many old tracks have been converted to rail trails for recreational use, although the coal-producing areas still have railroads running at near capacity. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cardinal&quot; roughly parallels I-64&#x27;s path through the state. MARC trains serve commuters to Washington, D.C. in the eastern panhandle. In 2006 Norfolk Southern along with the West Virginia and U.S. Government approved a plan to modify many of the rail tunnels in West Virginia, especially in the southern half of the state, to allow for double-stacked cars (see inter-modal freight). This is expected to also help bring economic growth to the southern half of the state. An Intermodal Freight Facility is located at Prichard, just south of Huntington.

Because of the mountainous nature of the entire state, West Virginia has several notable tunnels and bridges. The most famous of these is the New River Gorge Bridge, which was at a time the longest steel single-arch bridge in the world with a 3,031-foot (924 m) span. The bridge is also pictured on the West Virginia State quarter. The Fort Steuben Bridge (Weirton-Steubenville Bridge) was at the time of its construction one of only three cable-stayed steel girder trusses in the United States. &quot;The Veterans Memorial Bridge was designed to handle traffic from the Fort Steuben Bridge as well as its own traffic load&quot;, to quote the &quot;Weirton Daily Times&quot; newspaper. The 80-year-old Fort Steuben Bridge (Weirton-Steubenville Bridge) was permanently closed on January 8, 2009. The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was the first bridge built across the Ohio River in 1849 and for a time was the longest suspension bridge in the world. It is still the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use.

===Roads===
West Virginia is crossed by seven Interstate Highways. I-64 enters the state near White Sulphur Springs in the mountainous east, and exits for Kentucky in the west, near Huntington. I-77 enters from Virginia in the south, near Bluefield. It runs north past Parkersburg before it crosses into Ohio. I-64 and I-77 between Charleston and Beckley are merged as toll road known as the West Virginia Turnpike, which continues as I-77 alone from Beckley to Princeton. It was constructed beginning in 1952 as a two-lane road, but rebuilt beginning in 1974 to Interstate standards. Today almost nothing of the original construction remains. I-68&#x27;s western terminus is in Morgantown. From there it runs east into Maryland. At the I-68 terminus in Morgantown, it meets I-79, which enters from Pennsylvania and runs through the state to its southern terminus in Charleston. I-70 briefly runs through West Virginia, crossing the northern panhandle through Wheeling, while I-470 is a bypass of Wheeling (making Wheeling among the smallest cities with an interstate bypass). I-81 also briefly runs in West Virginia through the eastern panhandle where it goes through Martinsburg.

The interstates are supplemented by roads constructed under the Appalachian Corridor system. Four Corridors are complete. Corridor D, carrying US 50, runs from the Ohio River, and I-77, at Parkersburg to I-79 at Clarksburg. Corridor G, carrying US 119, runs from Charleston to the Kentucky border at Williamson. Corridor L, carrying US 19, runs from the Turnpike at Beckley to I-79 near Sutton (and provides a shortcut of about and bypasses Charleston&#x27;s urban traffic for travelers heading to and from Florida). Corridor Q, carrying US 460, runs through Mercer County, entering the state from Giles County, Virginia and then reentering Virginia at Tazewell County.

Work continues on the long-delayed Corridor H, which will carry US 48 from Weston to the Virginia line near Wardensville. As of 2018, a section from Weston to Kerens just past Elkins, and another section from Wardensville to Davis are complete. Other projects under development are a four-lane upgrade of US 35 from Scott Depot to the Ohio River at Point Pleasant, which is about two-thirds complete; a four-lane upgrade of WV 10 from Logan to Man and then of WV 80 from Man to Gilbert, which is about half completed; and four-lane upgrades to US 52 from Bluefield to Williamson, known as the &quot;King Coal Highway&quot; and from Williamson to Huntington, known as the &quot;Tolsia Highway&quot; which are many years from completion. A project known as the &quot;Coalfields Expressway&quot; is also ongoing, and will carry US 121 from Beckley west across Raleigh, Wyoming, and McDowell counties, entering Virginia near Bishop.

==Education==
West Virginia is one of the lowest-scoring U.S. states for education. According to The National Assessment of Educational Progress, it is significantly below the national average in mathematics, reading, writing, and science. The surrounding states of Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania score higher than or equal to the national average.

==Culture==

=== West &quot;by God&quot; Virginia ===
West Virginia is often called &quot;West &#x27;by God&#x27; Virginia.&quot; The term first appeared on online-accessible publications in 1926, when students at the University of Virginia wrote an article in the Virginia Spectator claiming that West &quot;by God&quot; Virginia women could consume corn liquor on its own, without having to mix it with other liquids. A 1939 academic article by Harold Wentworth of the WVU History department had a footnote claiming that the term originated from when a native West Virginian, annoyed at being called a Virginian, claimed that he instead hailed from &quot;West &#x27;by God&#x27; Virginia.&quot;

===Sports===

West Virginia is home to college sports teams from two schools—West Virginia and Marshall—that play in NCAA DivisionI. West Virginia is also home to several professional minor league baseball, football, hockey, and other sports teams.

===Music===
====Appalachian music====

West Virginia&#x27;s folk heritage is a part of the Appalachian folk music tradition, and includes styles of fiddling, ballad singing, and other styles that draw on Scots-Irish music. Camp Washington-Carver, a Mountain Cultural Arts Center located at Clifftop in Fayette County, hosts an annual Appalachian String Band Festival. The Capitol Complex in Charleston hosts The Vandalia Gathering, where traditional Appalachian musicians compete in contests and play in impromptu jam sessions and evening concerts over the weekend. The Augusta Heritage Center sponsored by Davis &amp; Elkins College in Elkins in Randolph County produces the annual Augusta Heritage Festival, which includes intensive week-long workshops in the summer that help preserve Appalachian heritage and traditions.

====Classical music====

The West Virginia Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1939, as the &quot;Charleston Civic Orchestra&quot;, before becoming the &quot;Charleston Symphony Orchestra&quot; in 1943. The first conductor was William R. Wiant, followed by the conductor Antonio Modarelli, who was written about in the November 7, 1949 &quot;Time Magazine&quot; for his composition of the &quot;River Saga&quot;, a six-section program piece about the Kanawha River according to the &quot;Charleston Gazette&quot;″s November 6, 1999, photo essay, &quot;Snapshots of the 20th Century&quot;. Before coming to Charleston, Modarelli had conducted the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra and the Philadelphia Orchestra, according to the orchestra&#x27;s website.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning 20th-century composer George Crumb was born in Charleston and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree there before moving outside the state. There had also been a series of operatic-style concerts performed in Wheeling during mid-century as well.

====Musical innovation====

The West Virginia Cultural Center in Charleston is home to the West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History, which helps underwrite and coordinate a large number of musical activities. The center is also home to &quot;Mountain Stage&quot;, an internationally broadcast live-performance music radio program established in 1983 which is carried by many affiliates of National Public Radio. The program also travels to other venues in the state such as the West Virginia University Creative Arts Center in Morgantown.

The center hosts concerts sponsored by the Friends of Old Time Music and Dance, which brings an assortment of acoustic roots music to West Virginians. The center also hosts the West Virginia Dance Festival, which features classical and modern dance.

Huntington&#x27;s historic Keith-Albee Theatre, built by brothers A.B. and S.J. Hyman, was originally opened to the public on May 7, 1928, and hosts a variety of performing arts and music attractions. The theatre was eventually gifted to Marshall University and is currently going through renovation to restore it to its original splendor.

Every summer Elkins hosts the Augusta Heritage Festival, which brings folk musicians from around the world. The town of Glenville has long been home to the annual West Virginia State Folk Festival.

The Mountaineer Opera House in Milton hosts a variety of musical acts.

John Denver&#x27;s hit song &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; describes the experience of driving through West Virginia. The song mentions the Shenandoah River and the Blue Ridge Mountains, both features traversing the easternmost extremity of the state&#x27;s &quot;eastern panhandle&quot;, in Jefferson County. On March 8, 2014, West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed House Concurrent Resolution 40 naming &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; the fourth official state song of West Virginia.

Symphony Sunday is an annual event hosted by the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra held in June. It is a day full of music by community groups, food, and family fun, culminating in a free performance by the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra with a fireworks display following. The event began in 1982 and is held on the front lawn of the University of Charleston.

The Daily Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival is West Virginia&#x27;s longest-running music festival. It is for the eight public high schools in Kanawha County. The festival began in 1947. It is held at the University of Charleston Stadium at Laidley Field in downtown Charleston.

<text>Warsaw, officially the Capital City of Warsaw, is the capital and largest city of Poland. The metropolis stands on the River Vistula in east-central Poland. Its population is officially estimated at 1.86 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3.27 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 7th most-populous city in the European Union. The city area measures and comprises 18 districts, while the metropolitan area covers . Warsaw is classified as an alpha global city, a major cultural, political and economic hub, and the country&#x27;s seat of government. It is also the capital of the Masovian Voivodeship.

Warsaw traces its origins to a small fishing town in Masovia. The city rose to prominence in the late 16th century, when Sigismund III decided to move the Polish capital and his royal court from Kraków. Warsaw served as the de facto capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795, and subsequently as the seat of Napoleon&#x27;s Duchy of Warsaw. The 19th century and its Industrial Revolution brought a demographic boom, which made it one of the largest and most densely populated cities in Europe. Known then for its elegant architecture and boulevards, Warsaw was bombed and besieged at the start of World War II in 1939. Much of the historic city was destroyed and its diverse population decimated by the Ghetto Uprising in 1943, the general Warsaw Uprising in 1944, and systematic razing.

Warsaw is served by three international airports, the busiest being Warsaw Chopin, as well as Warsaw Modlin and Warsaw Radom Airport. Major public transport services operating in the city include the Warsaw Metro, buses, commuter rail service and an extensive tram network. The city is a significant economic centre for the region, with the Warsaw Stock Exchange being the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. It is the base for Frontex, the European Union agency for external border security, and ODIHR, one of the principal institutions of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Warsaw has one of Europe&#x27;s highest concentrations of skyscrapers, and the Varso Place is the tallest building in the European Union.

The city&#x27;s primary educational and cultural institutions comprise the University of Warsaw, the Warsaw University of Technology, the SGH Warsaw School of Economics, the Chopin University of Music, the Polish Academy of Sciences, the National Philharmonic Orchestra, the National Museum, and the Warsaw Grand Theatre, the largest of its kind in the world. The reconstructed Old Town, which represents a variety of European architectural styles, was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1980. Other landmarks include the Royal Castle, Sigismund&#x27;s Column, the Wilanów Palace, the Palace on the Isle, St. John&#x27;s Archcathedral, Main Market Square, and numerous churches and mansions along the Royal Route. Warsaw is a green capital, with around a quarter of the city&#x27;s area occupied by parks. In sports, the city is home to Legia Warsaw football club and hosts the annual Warsaw Marathon.

==Toponymy and names==
Warsaw&#x27;s name in the Polish language is . Other previous spellings of the name may have included: , , or . The exact origin and meaning of the name is uncertain and has not been fully determined. Originally, Warszawa was the name of a small fishing settlement on the banks of the Vistula river. One hypothesis states that means &quot;belonging to Warsz&quot;, being a shortened form of the masculine Old Polish name Warcisław, which etymologically is linked with Wrocław. However the ending -awa is unusual for a large city; the names of Polish cities derived from personal names usually end in -ów/owo/ew/ewo (e.g. Piotrków, Adamów).

Folk etymology attributes the city name to Wars and Sawa. There are several versions of the legend with their appearance. According to one version, Sawa was a mermaid living in the Vistula with whom fisherman Wars fell in love. The official city name in full is (&quot;The Capital City of Warsaw&quot;).

A native or resident of Warsaw is known as a &quot;Varsovian&quot; – in Polish , (male), (female), , and (plural).

==History==

===1300–1800===

The first fortified settlements on the site of today&#x27;s Warsaw were located in Bródno (9th/10th century) and Jazdów (12th/13th century). After Jazdów was raided by nearby clans and dukes, a new fortified settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called &quot;Warszowa&quot;. The Prince of Płock, Bolesław II of Masovia, established the modern-day city in about 1300 and the first historical document attesting to the existence of a castellany dates to 1313. With the completion of St John&#x27;s Cathedral in 1390, Warsaw became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia and was officially made capital of the Masovian Duchy in 1413. The economy then predominantly rested on craftsmanship or trade, and the town housed approximately 4,500 people at the time.

During the 15th century, the population migrated and spread beyond the northern city wall into a newly formed self-governing precinct called New Town. The existing older settlement became eventually known as the Old Town. Both possessed their own town charter and independent councils. The aim of establishing a separate district was to accommodate new incomers or &quot;undesirables&quot; who were not permitted to settle in Old Town, particularly Jews. Social and financial disparities between the classes in the two precincts led to a minor revolt in 1525. Following the sudden death of Janusz III and the extinction of the local ducal line, Masovia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland in 1526. Bona Sforza, wife of Sigismund I of Poland, was widely accused of poisoning the duke to uphold Polish rule over Warsaw.
In 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of a General Sejm and held that privilege permanently from 1569. The city&#x27;s rising importance encouraged the construction of a new set of defenses, including the landmark Barbican. Renowned Italian architects were brought to Warsaw to reshape the Royal Castle, the streets and the marketplace, resulting in the Old Town&#x27;s early Italianate appearance. In 1573, the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation which formally established religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to its central location between the capitals of the Commonwealth&#x27;s two component parts, Poland and Lithuania, which were Kraków and Vilnius respectively, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Polish Crown when Sigismund III Vasa transferred his royal court in 1596. In the subsequent years the town significantly expanded to the south and westwards. Several private independent districts (&quot;jurydyka&quot;) were the property of aristocrats and the gentry, which they ruled by their own laws. Between 1655 and 1658 the city was besieged and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces. The conduct of the Great Northern War (1700–1721) also forced Warsaw to pay heavy tributes to the invading armies.

The reign of Augustus II and Augustus III was a time of great development for Warsaw, which turned into an early-capitalist city. The Saxon monarchs employed many German architects, sculptors and engineers, who rebuilt the city in a style similar to Dresden. The year 1727 marked the opening of the Saxon Garden in Warsaw, the first publicly accessible park. The Załuski Library, the first Polish public library and the largest at the time, was founded in 1747. Stanisław II Augustus, who remodelled the interior of the Royal Castle, also made Warsaw a centre of culture and the arts. He extended the Royal Baths Park and ordered the construction or refurbishment of numerous palaces, mansions and richly-decorated tenements. This earned Warsaw the nickname &quot;Paris of the North&quot;.

Warsaw remained the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795 when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the third and final partition of Poland; it subsequently became the capital of the province of South Prussia. During this time, Louis XVIII of France spent his exile in Warsaw under the pseudonym &quot;Comte de Lille&quot;.

===1800–1939===

Warsaw was made the capital of a newly created French client state, known as the Duchy of Warsaw, after a portion of Poland&#x27;s territory was liberated from Prussia, Russia and Austria by Napoleon in 1806. Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat and exile, the 1815 Congress of Vienna assigned Warsaw to Congress Poland, a constitutional monarchy within the easternmost sector (or partition) under a personal union with Imperial Russia. The Royal University of Warsaw was established in 1816.

With the violation of the Polish constitution, the 1830 November Uprising broke out against foreign influence. The Polish-Russian war of 1831 ended in the uprising&#x27;s defeat and in the curtailment of Congress Poland&#x27;s autonomy. On 27 February 1861, a Warsaw crowd protesting against Russian control over Congress Poland was fired upon by Russian troops. Five people were killed. The Underground Polish National Government resided in Warsaw during the January Uprising in 1863–64.

Warsaw flourished throughout the 19th century under Mayor Sokrates Starynkiewicz (1875–92), who was appointed by Alexander III. Under Starynkiewicz Warsaw saw its first water and sewer systems designed and built by the English engineer William Lindley and his son, William Heerlein Lindley, as well as the expansion and modernisation of trams, street lighting, and gas infrastructure. Between 1850 and 1882, the population grew by 134% to 383,000 as a result of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Many migrated from surrounding rural Masovian towns and villages to the city for employment opportunities. The western borough of Wola was transformed from an agricultural periphery occupied mostly by small farms and windmills (mills being the namesake of Wola&#x27;s central neighbourhood Młynów) to an industrial and manufacturing centre. Metallurgical, textile and glassware factories were commonplace, with chimneys dominating the westernmost skyline.

Like London, Warsaw&#x27;s population was subjected to income segmentation. Gentrification of inner suburbs forced poorer residents to move across the river into Praga or Powiśle and Solec districts, similar to the East End of London and London Docklands. Poorer religious and ethnic minorities, such as the Jews, settled in the crowded parts of northern Warsaw, in Muranów. The Imperial Census of 1897 recorded 626,000 people living in Warsaw, making it the third-largest city of the Empire after St. Petersburg and Moscow as well as the largest city in the region. Grand architectural complexes and structures were also erected in the city centre, including the Warsaw Philharmonic, the Church of the Holiest Saviour and tenements along Marszałkowska Street.

During World War I, Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 concluded that defeated Germany is to withdraw from all foreign areas, which included Warsaw. Germany did so, and underground leader Józef Piłsudski returned to Warsaw on the same day which marked the beginning of the Second Polish Republic, the first truly sovereign Polish state after 1795. In the course of the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), the 1920 Battle of Warsaw was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city. Poland successfully defended the capital, stopped the brunt of the Bolshevik Red Army and temporarily halted the &quot;export of the communist revolution&quot; to other parts of Europe.

The interwar period (1918–1939) was a time of major development in the city&#x27;s infrastructure. New modernist housing estates were built in Mokotów to de-clutter the densely populated inner suburbs. In 1921, Warsaw&#x27;s total area was estimated at only 124.7 km2 with 1 million inhabitants–over 8,000 people/km2 made Warsaw more densely populated than contemporary London. The Średnicowy Bridge was constructed for railway (1921–1931), connecting both parts of the city across the Vistula. Warszawa Główna railway station (1932–1939) was not completed due to the outbreak of the Second World War.

Stefan Starzyński was the Mayor of Warsaw between 1934 and 1939.

===Second World War===
After the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 started the Second World War, Warsaw was defended until 27 September. Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a German Nazi colonial administration. All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw&#x27;s entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand, some 30% of the citywere herded into the Warsaw Ghetto. In July 1942, the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto began to be deported en masse to the Aktion Reinhard extermination camps, particularly Treblinka. The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe. When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Final Solution&quot; on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the ghetto held out for almost a month. When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.

By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Nazis toward Warsaw. The Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw before the Red Army arrived. Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw uprising began. The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, was partially successful, however, it went on for 63 days. Eventually, the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate. They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled. Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.

Hitler, ignoring the agreed terms of the capitulation, ordered the entire city to be razed to the ground and the library and museum collections taken to Germany or burned. Monuments and government buildings were blown up by special German troops known as &quot;Verbrennungs- und Vernichtungskommando&quot; (&quot;Burning and Destruction Detachments&quot;). About 85% of the city was destroyed, including the historic Old Town and the Royal Castle.

On 17 January 1945 – after the beginning of the Vistula–Oder Offensive of the Red Army – Soviet troops and Polish troops of the First Polish Army entered the ruins of Warsaw, and liberated Warsaw&#x27;s suburbs from German occupation. The city was swiftly freed by the Soviet Army, which rapidly advanced towards Łódź, as German forces regrouped at a more westward position.

===1945–1989===

In 1945, after the bombings, revolts, fighting, and demolition had ended, most of Warsaw lay in ruins. The area of the former ghetto was razed to the ground, with only a sea of rubble remaining. The immense destruction prompted a temporary transfer of the new government and its officials to Łódź, which became the transitional seat of power. Nevertheless, Warsaw officially resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country&#x27;s centre of political and economic life.

After World War II, the &quot;Bricks for Warsaw&quot; campaign was initiated and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the major housing shortage. Plattenbau-styled apartment buildings were seen as a solution to avoid Warsaw&#x27;s former density problem and to create more green spaces. Some of the buildings from the 19th century that had survived in a reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless demolished in the 1950s and 1960s, like the Kronenberg Palace. The Śródmieście (central) region&#x27;s urban system was completely reshaped; former cobblestone streets were asphalted and significantly widened for traffic use. Many notable streets such as Gęsia, Nalewki and Wielka disappeared as a result of these changes and some were split in half due to the construction of Plac Defilad (Parade Square), one of the largest of its kind in Europe.

Much of the central district was also designated for future skyscrapers. The 237-metre Palace of Culture and Science resembling New York&#x27;s Empire State Building was built as a gift from the Soviet Union. Warsaw&#x27;s urban landscape is one of modern and contemporary architecture. Despite wartime destruction and post-war remodelling, many of the historic streets, buildings, and churches were restored to their original form.

John Paul II&#x27;s visits to his native country in 1979 and 1983 brought support to the budding &quot;Solidarity&quot; movement and encouraged the growing anti-communist fervor there. In 1979, less than a year after becoming pope, John Paul celebrated Mass in Victory Square in Warsaw and ended his sermon with a call to &quot;renew the face&quot; of Poland. These words were meaningful for Varsovians and Poles who understood them as the incentive for liberal-democratic reforms.

===1989–present===
In 1995, the Warsaw Metro opened with a single line. A second line was opened in March 2015. On 28 September 2022, three new Warsaw metro stations were opened, increasing the number of Warsaw Metro stations to 36 and its length to 38.3 kilometers. In February 2023, Warsaw&#x27;s mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, announced plans to more than double the size of the city&#x27;s metro system by 2050.

 Warsaw is experiencing a large economic boom. The opening fixture of UEFA Euro 2012 took place in Warsaw and the city also hosted the 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference and the 2016 NATO Summit. As of August 2022, Warsaw had received around 180,000 refugees from Ukraine, because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The amount means a tenth of the Polish capital&#x27;s population of 1.8 million — the second-largest single group of Ukrainian refugees.

==Geography==

===Location and topography===
Warsaw lies in east-central Poland about from the Carpathian Mountains and about from the Baltic Sea, east of Berlin, Germany. The city straddles the Vistula River. It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain, and its average elevation is above sea level. The highest point on the West side of the city lies at a height of (&quot;Redutowa&quot; bus depot, district of Wola), on the East side – (&quot;Groszówka&quot; estate, district of Wesoła, by the eastern border). The lowest point lies at a height (at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw). There are some hills (mostly artificial) located within the confines of the city – e.g. Warsaw Uprising Hill () and Szczęśliwice hill ( – the highest point of Warsaw in general).

Warsaw is located on two main geomorphologic formations: the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley with its asymmetrical pattern of different terraces. The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right. The left one is situated both on the moraine plateau ( above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. above Vistula level). The significant element of the relief, in this part of Warsaw, is the edge of moraine plateau called Warsaw Escarpment. It is high in the Old Town and Central district and about in the north and south of Warsaw. It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.

The plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of clay pits. The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical. The left side consists mainly of two levels: the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one is the floodplain terrace. The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground depressions with water systems coming from the old Vistula – riverbed. They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the Vistula plain terraces (flooded as well as formerly flooded), and only a small part is a not-so-visible moraine escarpment. Aeolian sand with a number of dunes parted by peat swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace. These are mainly forested areas (pine forest).

===Climate===

Warsaw experiences an oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb)&quot; or humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfb)&quot; climate, depending on the isotherm used; although the city used to be humid continental regardless of isotherm prior to the recent effect of climate change and the city&#x27;s urban heat island. Meanwhile, by the genetic climate classification of Wincenty Okołowicz, it has a temperate &quot;fusion&quot; climate, with both oceanic and continental features.

The city has cold, sometimes snowy, cloudy winters, and warm, relatively sunny but frequently stormy summers. Spring and autumn can be unpredictable, highly prone to sudden weather changes; however, temperatures are usually mild, especially around May and September. The daily average temperature ranges between in January and in July and the mean year temperature is . Temperatures may reach in the summer, although the effects of hot weather are usually offset by relatively low dew points and large diurnal temperature differences. Warsaw is Europe&#x27;s sixth driest major city (driest in Central Europe), with yearly rainfall averaging , the wettest month being July.


==Cityscape==
===Urbanism and architecture===

Warsaw&#x27;s long and eclectic history left a noticeable mark on its architecture and urban form. Unlike most Polish cities, Warsaw&#x27;s cityscape is mostly contemporary – modern glass buildings are towering above older historical edifices which is a common feature of North American metropolises. Warsaw is among the European cities with the highest number of skyscrapers and is home to European Union&#x27;s tallest building. Skyscrapers are mostly centered around the Śródmieście district, with many located in the commercial district of Wola. A concentric zone pattern emerged within the last decades; the majority of Warsaw&#x27;s residents live outside the commercial city centre and commute by metro, bus or tram. Tenements and apartments in the central neighbourhoods are often reserved for commercial activity or temporary (tourist, student) accommodation. The nearest residential zones are predominantly located on the outskirts of the inner borough, in Ochota, Mokotów and Żoliborz or along the Vistula in Powiśle.

A seat of Polish monarchs since the end of the 16th century, Warsaw remained a small city with only privately owned palaces, mansions, villas and several streets of townhouses. These displayed a richness of color and architectonic details. The finest German, Italian and Dutch architects were employed, among them Tylman van Gameren, Andreas Schlüter, Jakub Fontana, and Enrico Marconi. The buildings situated in the vicinity of the Warsaw Old Town represent nearly every European architectural style and historical period. Warsaw has excellent examples of architecture from the Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical periods, all of which are located within walking distance of the centre. This architectural richness has led to Warsaw being described by some commentators as a &quot;Paris of the East&quot;.

Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the burgher houses and fortifications. The most significant buildings are St John&#x27;s Cathedral (1390), a typical example of the so-called Masovian Brick Gothic style; St Mary&#x27;s Church (1411); the Burbach townhouse (14th century); Gunpowder Tower (after 1379); and Royal Castle&#x27;s &quot;Curia Maior&quot; (1407–1410). The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in the city are the house of the Baryczko merchant family (1562), a building called &quot;The Negro&quot; (early 17th century), and Salwator tenement (1632), all situated on the Old Market Place. The most interesting examples of Mannerist architecture are the Royal Castle (1596–1619) and the Jesuit Church (1609–1626).

Baroque architecture arrived in Warsaw at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries with the artists from the court circle of King Sigismund III Vasa (the early Warsaw Baroque is referred to as Vasa Baroque). Among the first structures of the early Baroque, the most important are St. Hyacinth&#x27;s Church and Sigismund&#x27;s Column, the first secular monument in the form of a column in modern history. At that time, part of the Royal Castle was rebuilt in this style, the Ujazdów Castle and numerous Baroque palaces on the Vistula escarpment were constructed. In the architecture of Catholic churches, the Counter-Reformation type became a novelty, exemplified by the Church of St. Anthony of Padua, the Carmelite Church and the Holy Cross Church.

Warsaw Baroque from the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries was characterized by building facades with a predominance of vertical elements close to the wall and numerous ornaments. The most important architect working in Warsaw at that time was Tylman van Gameren. His projects include the Krasiński Palace, Palace of the Four Winds, Ostrogski Palace, Czapski Palace, Brühl Palace, and St. Kazimierz Church. The most significant Baroque building of this period is the Wilanów Palace, built on the order of King John III Sobieski.

The late Baroque era was the epoch of the Saxon Kings (1697–1763). During this time, three major spatial projects were realized: the 880-meter Piaseczyński Canal on the axis of Ujazdów Castle, the Ujazdów Calvary and the Saxon Axis. The Visitationist Church also dates from this period.

The neoclassical architecture began to be the main style in the capital&#x27;s architecture in Warsaw in the second half of the 18th century thanks to King Stanisław August Poniatowski. It can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period. The best-known architect who worked in Warsaw at the time was Domenico Merlini, who designed the Palace on the Isle. Other significant buildings from this period include Królikarnia, Holy Trinity Church, St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Warsaw.

Also in the first half of the 19th century, neoclassicism dominated the architecture of Warsaw. Old buildings were rebuilt and new ones were built in this style. The neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture; the most notable examples are the Great Theater, buildings located at Bank Square, headquarters of the Warsaw Society of Friends of Sciences (Staszic Palace), St. Alexander&#x27;s Church, the Belweder. Many classicist tenement houses were built on Senatorska Street and along Nowy Świat Street. After the outbreak of the November Uprising, the Warsaw Citadel was constructed in the north of the city, and the Saxon Palace underwent a complete reconstruction, where the central body of the building was demolished and replaced by a monumental 11-bay colonnade.
In the mid-19th century, the industrial revolution reached Warsaw, leading to the mass use of iron as a building material. In 1845, the Warsaw-Vienna Railway Station was opened. Another important aspect of the developing city was ensuring access to water and sewage disposal. The first modern Warsaw water supply system was launched in 1855, designed by one of the most outstanding architects of that period – Enrico Marconi, who designed also All Saints Church. The dynamic development of the railway became a factor that enabled equally dynamic development of Warsaw&#x27;s industry. Among the establishments built at that time were the Wedel factory and the extensive Municipal Gasworks complex.
In the architecture of the 1920s, national historicism and other historical forms were dominant. Art Deco forms also appeared, and towards the end of the decade, avant-garde functionalism emerged. The creation of urban plans for the capital of Poland can be traced back to 1916, when, after the retreat of the Russians from Warsaw and the beginnings of the German occupation, the territories of the surrounding municipalities were annexed to the city. Even before Poland regained its independence, parallel to the creation of the administration of the future state, the first urban visions were emerging. These included, among others, the construction of a representative government district in the southern part of Śródmieście. However, major changes in urban planning and the architectural landscape of the city only began in the mid-1920s. The forming state structures needed headquarters, leading to the construction of many monumental public buildings, including the buildings of the Sejm and the Senate, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education, the Ministry of Public Works, the National Museum, the State Geological Institute, the State Agricultural Bank, the Domestic Economy Bank, the directorate of the Polish State Railways, the Supreme Audit Office, and the campus of the Warsaw School of Economics. New districts were also established in Żoliborz, Ochota, and Mokotów, often designed around a central square with radiating streets (Narutowicz Square, Wilson Square). Examples of new large urban projects are the Staszic and Lubecki colonies in Ochota.
Exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the war or were remodelled into a socialist realist style (like Warsaw Philharmonic edifice originally inspired by Palais Garnier in Paris). Despite that, the Warsaw University of Technology (Polytechnic) building. is the most interesting of the late 19th-century architecture. Some 19th-century industrial and brick workhouse buildings in the Praga district were restored, though many have been poorly maintained or demolished. Notable examples of post-war architecture include the Palace of Culture and Science, a soc-realist and art deco skyscraper based on the Empire State Building in New York. The Constitution Square with its monumental socialist realism architecture (MDM estate) was modelled on the grand squares of Paris, London, Moscow and Rome. Italianate tuscan-styled colonnades based on those at Piazza della Repubblica in Rome were also erected on Saviour Square.

Contemporary architecture in Warsaw is represented by the Metropolitan Office Building at Pilsudski Square and Varso tower, both by Norman Foster, Warsaw University Library (BUW) by Marek Budzyński and Zbigniew Badowski, featuring a garden on its roof and view of the Vistula River, Rondo 1 office building by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Złota 44 residential skyscraper by Daniel Libeskind, Museum of the History of Polish Jews by Rainer Mahlamäki and Golden Terraces, consisting of seven overlapping domes retail and business centre. Jointly with Moscow, Istanbul, Frankfurt, London, Paris and Rotterdam, Warsaw is one of the cities with the highest number of skyscrapers in Europe.

===Landmarks===
Although contemporary Warsaw is a fairly young city compared to other European capitals, it has numerous tourist attractions and architectural monuments dating back centuries. Apart from the Warsaw Old Town area, reconstructed after World War II, each borough has something to offer. Among the most notable landmarks of the Old Town are the Royal Castle, Sigismund&#x27;s Column, Market Square, and the Barbican.

Further south is the so-called Royal Route, with many historical churches, Baroque and Classicist palaces, most notably the Presidential Palace, and the University of Warsaw campus. The former royal residence of King John III Sobieski at Wilanów is notable for its Baroque architecture and eloquent palatial garden.

In many places in the city the Jewish culture and history resonates down through time. Among them the most notable are the Jewish theater, the Nożyk Synagogue, Janusz Korczak&#x27;s Orphanage and the picturesque Próżna Street. The tragic pages of Warsaw&#x27;s history are commemorated in places such as the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes, the Umschlagplatz, fragments of the ghetto wall on Sienna Street and a mound in memory of the Jewish Combat Organization.

Many places commemorate the heroic history of Warsaw such as Pawiak, a German Gestapo prison now occupied by a Mausoleum of Memory of Martyrdom and a museum. The Warsaw Citadel, a 19th-century fortification built after the defeat of the November Uprising, was a place of martyrdom for the Poles. Another important monument, the statue of Little Insurrectionist located at the ramparts of the Old Town, commemorates the children who served as messengers and frontline troops in the Warsaw Uprising, while the Warsaw Uprising Monument by Wincenty Kućma was erected in memory of the largest insurrection of World War II.

In Warsaw there are many places connected with the life and work of Frédéric Chopin who was born near the city in Żelazowa Wola. The heart of the Polish composer is sealed inside Warsaw&#x27;s Holy Cross Church. During the summer time the Chopin Statue in Łazienki Park is a place where pianists give concerts to the park audience.

Also many references to Marie Curie, her work and her family can be found in Warsaw; Curie&#x27;s birthplace at the Warsaw New Town, the working places where she did her first scientific works and the Radium Institute at Wawelska Street for the research and the treatment of which she founded in 1925.

===Cemeteries===

The oldest necropolis in Warsaw is Stare Powązki, established in 1790. It is one of Poland&#x27;s national necropolises.

The cemetery covers an area of 43 ha. On the day of consecration of the Powązki Cemetery, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of the church of Saint Charles Borromeo, designed by the royal architect Domenico Merlini. Catacombs were intended to be a prestigious resting place intended mainly for the nobles, such as Michał Poniatowski, Hugo Kołłątaj, Michał Kazimierz Ogiński. Over a million people are buried at Stare Powązki. In the Avenue of Merit there are the graves of insurgents and soldiers, independence activists, writers, poets, scientists, artists and thinkers. The nearby Powązki Military Cemetery was established in 1912 for soldiers stationed in Warsaw. After World War II, the cemetery became a burial place for people associated with the Polish People&#x27;s Republic - politicians, officials and military personnel.

The complex of non-Roman Catholic cemeteries consists of Evangelical–Augsburg Cemetery, Evangelical Reformed Cemetery, Jewish Cemetery, Orthodox Cemetery and Muslim Tatar Cemetery. Other significant Warsaw necropolises are: Bródno Cemetery Warsaw Insurgents Cemetery, Służew Old Cemetery, Służew New Cemetery. There are two large municipal cemeteries in the city – Northern Communal Cemetery and Southern Communal Cemetery.

===Memorials===
The city&#x27;s symbol is the mermaid placed in the capital&#x27;s coat of arms. There are three mermaid monuments in Warsaw: one on the banks of the Vistula, the second on the Old Town Square, and the third in Praga-Południe. The oldest monument in Warsaw is the Sigismund&#x27;s Column. It was built in 1644 according to the design of the Italians: Augustine Locci and Constantin Tencall. The King of Poland Sigismund III Vasa stands on a 22-meter high tower, holding a cross and a sword in his hand. The monument was destroyed and rebuilt many times.

Many monuments commemorate heroic and tragic moments in the history of Poland and Warsaw. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier located in Piłsudski Square was built on the initiative of General Władysław Sikorski in the arcades of the Saxon Palace. In 1925, the ashes of the unknown soldier who died during the defense of Lviv were placed under the colonnade, then urns with soil from 24 battlefields were buried here. Among the monuments related to the World War II are Nike Monument that commemorates the heroes of Warsaw from 1939 to 1945, Monument to the Polish Underground State and Home Army, Monument to the Little Insurrectionist and Warsaw Uprising Monument in front of the Supreme Court building at Krasiński Square. Monument to the Ghetto Heroes commemorates the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943.

In 1929, a monument to Frédéric Chopin was constructed in the Royal Łazienki Park. Every summer at its foot classical music concerts featuring world-famous pianists take place. Other important monuments are: Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Tadeusz Kościuszko Monument, Marie Curie Monument, Prince Józef Poniatowski Monument, Nicolaus Copernicus Monument, Stefan Starzyński Monument, Józef Piłsudski Monument, Janusz Korczak Monument.

===Flora and fauna===
Green space covers almost a quarter of Warsaw&#x27;s total area. These range from small neighborhood parks and green spaces along streets or in courtyards, to tree-lined avenues, large historic parks, nature conservation areas and urban forests at the fringe of the city. There are as many as 82 parks in the city; the oldest ones were once part of representative palaces and include the Saxon and Krasiński Gardens, Łazienki Park (Royal Baths Park) and Wilanów Palace Parkland.
The Saxon Garden, covering an area of 15.5 ha, formally served as a royal garden to the now nonexistent Saxon Palace. In 1727, it was made into one of the world&#x27;s first public parks and later remodelled in the forest-like English style. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated at the east end of the park near the central fountain, on Piłsudski Square. With its benches, flower carpets and a central pond, the Krasiński Palace Garden was once a notable strolling destination for most Varsovians. The Łazienki Park covers an area of 76 ha and its unique character and history is reflected in the landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, water cascades) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and shrubs). The presence of peacocks, pheasants and squirrels at Łazienki attracts tourists and locals. The Wilanów Palace Parkland on the outskirts of Warsaw traces it history to the second half of the 17th century and covers an area of 43 ha. Its French-styled alleys corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace.
The Botanical Garden and the University Library rooftop garden host an extensive collection of rare domestic and foreign plants, while a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world. Mokotów Field (once a racetrack), Ujazdów Park and Skaryszewski Park are also located within the city borders. The oldest park in the Praga borough was established between 1865 and 1871.

The flora of Warsaw may be considered very rich in species on city standards. This is mainly due to the location of Warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas (natural forests, wetlands along the Vistula) as well as arable land, meadows and forests. The nearby Kampinos Nature Reserve is the last remaining part of the Masovian Primeval Forest and is protected by law. The Kabaty Woods are by the southern city border and are visited by the residents of southern boroughs such as Ursynów. There are 13 natural reserves in the vicinity and just from Warsaw, the environment features a perfectly preserved ecosystem with a habitat of animals like the otter, beavers and hundreds of bird species. There are also several lakes in Warsaw – mainly the oxbow lakes at Czerniaków and Kamionek.

The Warsaw Zoo covers an area of . There are about 5,000 animals representing nearly 500 species. Although officially created in 1928, it traces back its roots to 17th century private menageries, often open to the public.
==Demographics==
Demographically, Warsaw was the most diverse city in Poland, with significant numbers of foreign-born residents. In addition to the Polish majority, there was a large and thriving Jewish minority. According to the Imperial Census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (equivalent to 34%). Prior to the Second World War, Warsaw hosted the world&#x27;s second largest Jewish population after New York – approximately 30 percent of the city&#x27;s total population in the late 1930s. In 1933, 833,500 out of 1,178,914 people declared Polish as their mother tongue. There was also a notable German community. The ethnic composition of contemporary Warsaw is incomparable to the diversity that existed for nearly 300 years. Most of the modern-day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation. In the 2021 census, 98.78% of Warsaw residents identified themselves as Polish, 0.46% as Ukrainian, 0.31% as Belarusian and 0.21% as Jewish.

In 1939, approximately 1,300,000 people resided in Warsaw; by 1945 the population had dropped to 420,000. During the first years after the war, the population growth rate was high and the city soon began to suffer from the lack of flats and dwellings to house new incomers. The first remedial measure was the enlargement of Warsaw&#x27;s total area (1951) – however the city authorities were still forced to introduce limitations; only the spouses and children of permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (renowned specialists, artists, engineers) were permitted to stay. This negatively affected the image of an average Warsaw citizen, who was perceived as more privileged than those migrating from rural areas, towns or other cities. While all restrictions on residency registration were scrapped in 1990, the negative opinion of Varsovians in some form continues to this day.

Warsaw metropolitan area is an example of the development of a strongly polarized region. The capital, along with its immediate surroundings, concentrates over half of the demographic potential of the Masovian Voivodeship, 2/3 of residents with higher education, and 3/4 of larger economic entities employing more than 50 workers.
Current demographic development trends are as follows:
* a clear increase in the number of residents after the 1989 transformations, from 1.6 to about 2.0 million inhabitants (including unregistered population), mainly due to positive migration balance.
* the highest migration attractiveness in the country for many decades, causing a strong drain of people in the mobile age (18–44 years), including a relatively more frequent influx of women, resulting in high feminization
* processes of internal deconcentration of population, consisting of centrifugal migration direction (from central districts to external ones, from external districts to suburban areas). Between 1989 and 2017, 213 thousand registered people moved from Warsaw to the suburbs, and in the opposite direction it was only 110 thousand.
* a clear aging of the population: at the end of 2017, people aged 60 and over constituted 27.2% of the registered population, and those aged 70 and over – 13.5%, while for example in 2002, it was respectively 21.5 and 11.5%
In the coming years, an increase in the city&#x27;s population is predicted, with migration being the main factor determining the state and structure of Warsaw&#x27;s population, including mainly internal (national) and external (foreign) influx. Changes in the population are not uniform for the entire Warsaw and in the division into districts, the predicted demographic changes will have a varied course. A decrease in population is forecasted in some central districts (Praga-Północ, Śródmieście) and an increase in other districts.

===Immigrant population===
In 2019, it was estimated that 40,000 people living in Warsaw were foreign-born. Of those, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, Belarusians, and Russians were the most prominent groups. After Russia&#x27;s aggression against Ukraine, over 1.1 million refugees from Ukraine passed through Warsaw, and at the beginning of March 2022, approximately 40,000 people applied for help every day. According to official data, over 104,000 of Ukrainian citizens who arrived in the first days after the outbreak of the war still reside in the city, including 17,000 young people and children attending urban educational institutions. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the immigrant population has increased significantly to about 340,000.

===Religion===

Throughout its existence, Warsaw had been a multi-cultural and multi-religious city. According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek Orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants. Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.

The archdiocese of Warsaw and the Diocese of Warsaw-Praga are the two ecclesiastical districts active in the city which serve the large Roman Catholic population of 1.4 million. The Lutheran Diocese of Warsaw is one of six in Poland; its main house of worship is the Holy Trinity Church from 1782, one of Warsaw&#x27;s most important and historic landmarks. The Evangelical Reformed Parish (Calvinist) is leading the Polish Reformed Church. The main tserkva of the Orthodox Christians is Praga&#x27;s Cathedral of St. Mary Magdalene from 1869. The Jewish Commune of Warsaw (&quot;Gmina Wyznaniowa Żydowska&quot;) is one of eight in the country; Chief Rabbi of Poland Michael Schudrich resides in the city. There are also 3 active synagogues, one of which is the pre-war Nożyk Synagogue designated for Orthodox Jews. An Islamic Cultural Centre in Ochota and a small mosque in Wilanów serve the Muslims.

There are several Marian shrines in the city, including: sanctuary of the Gracious Mother of God with her image crowned in 1651 in the presence of King John Casimir. Another patron of the city is Blessed Władysław of Gielniów, bernardine from the St. Anne&#x27;s Church. The greatest cult is that of St. Andrew Bobola, patron of the metropolis of Warsaw, whose relics are in the sanctuary of St. Andrew Bobola in Mokotów.
==Government and politics==
As the capital of Poland, Warsaw is the political centre of the country. Almost all central government institutions are located there, including the Chancellery of the President, both houses of the Polish Parliament (the lower house called Sejm and the upper house called Senate), the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court. Warsaw is also host to many major international organizations, including Frontex and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (the oldest and principal institution of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe).

The city is represented in the parliament by 20 members of Sejm (out of 460) and 4 senators (out of 100). In addition, Warsaw together with its metropolitan area elects 6 MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) out of 705.

===Municipal government===


The first city mayor of Warsaw was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695–1696). The municipal self-government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City Council – &quot;Miejska Rada Narodowa&quot; – governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the structure of city government has been modified several times. Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw city mayors simultaneously led the Warsaw Voivodeship. In the years 1990–1994, the city mayor of Warsaw was elected by the city council. Subsequently, a controversial reform was introduced, transforming the city in the years of 1994–1999 into a loose municipal union of several gminas, dominated by one of them, the gmina Centrum encompassing the entire inner city. During this period, the mayor of gmina Centrum who was elected by its council was automatically designated as the city mayor of Warsaw, in spite of representing only a fraction of the population of the city. The city was becoming increasingly unmanageable, especially after the administrative reform of Poland in 1999 which further complicated the local government structure of Warsaw. In 2002, the new &quot;Warsaw Act&quot; of the Polish parliament restored Warsaw as a single urban gmina with the status of a city with powiat rights, led by a unified local government. At the same time, a significant reform was implemented in all Polish municipal governments, introducing direct elections of the wójt/town mayor/city mayor in all Polish gminas. The first city mayor of Warsaw elected according to these rules was Lech Kaczyński, who however resigned ahead of term when he was elected President of Polish Republic in 2005.

Warsaw has thereafter remained an urban gmina with the status of a city with powiat rights. Legislative power in Warsaw is vested in a unicameral Warsaw City Council (&quot;Rada Miasta&quot;), which comprises 60 members. Council members are elected directly every five years (since 2018 election). Like most legislative bodies, the city council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government. The city mayor exercises the executive power in the city, being the superior of all unelected municipal- or county-level officials and other employees and supervising all subsidiary entities of the city. The incumbent city mayor of Warsaw is Rafał Trzaskowski.

The &quot;Warsaw Act&quot; imposes a mandatory division into 18 auxiliary units called &quot;dzielnica&quot; (district) on the city. In spite of remaining an integral part of the city as an entity, the districts have a degree of autonomy legally guaranteed through a form of an own local self-government exercising some powers devolved by law from the city. They have the duty to assist the city mayor and the City Council in their tasks, such as supervising some municipal companies, city-owned property or schools. Each of the 18 city districts has an own council (&quot;rada dzielnicy&quot;) which elects an executive board (&quot;zarząd dzielnicy&quot;) headed by a district mayor (&quot;burmistrz dzielnicy&quot;), the latter elected by the council among several candidates nominated by the city mayor of Warsaw among the council&#x27;s members.

===Districts===


As a result, Warsaw has thereafter continued as an urban gmina holding status of a city with powiat rights, divided into 18 districts (&quot;dzielnica&quot;), auxiliary municipal units established within the city as an entity as its integral parts, though with some limited powers devolved from the city to their own local self-governments. Each of the districts is customarily subdivided into several neighbourhoods lacking any meaningful legal or administrative powers. The central district of Śródmieście includes the two founding neighbourhoods of the city, called the Old Town (&quot;Stare Miasto&quot;) and the New Town (&quot;Nowe Miasto&quot;).

Warsaw has developed a particularly strong retail market/sector, representing around 13% of the total retail stock in the country.

Following World War II, the authorities decided that the city will be transformed into a major centre for heavy industry and manufacturing.

Among the largest were &quot;Huta Warszawa&quot; steel works, now arcelor), the Ursus SA, and the Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych (FSO) car factory. The now-defunct FSO, established in 1951, was once Warsaw&#x27;s most successful corporation. Notable vehicles assembled there over the decades include the FSO Warszawa, FSO Syrena, Polski Fiat 125p and the FSO Polonez.

Warsaw lacks a complete ring road system and most traffic goes directly through the city centre, leading to the eleventh highest level of congestion in Europe. The Warsaw ring road has been planned to consist of four express roads: S2 (south), S8 (north-west) and S17 (east). S8, S2 and a small 3 km section of S17 are open. Additionally, the S2 and S8 have a concurrency with the S7 and the S2 has a short concurrency with the S8. A second ring road consisting of the A50 motorway (south) and S50 expressway (north) is also planned but it is unknown when construction will start.

The A2 motorway opened in June 2012, stretches west from Warsaw and is a direct motorway connection with Łódź, Poznań and ultimately with Berlin.

===Music and theatre===
Thanks to numerous musical venues, including the &quot;Teatr Wielki&quot;, the Polish National Opera, the Chamber Opera, the National Philharmonic Hall and the National Theatre, as well as the Roma and Buffo music theatres and the Congress Hall in the Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw hosts many events and festivals. Among the events worth particular attention are: the International Frédéric Chopin Piano Competition, the International Contemporary Music Festival Warsaw Autumn, the Jazz Jamboree, Warsaw Summer Jazz Days, the International Stanisław Moniuszko Vocal Competition, the Mozart Festival, and the Festival of Old Music.

Warsaw is also considered one of the European hubs of underground electronic music with a very attractive house and techno music scene.

Warsaw is home to over 30 major theatres spread throughout the city, including the National Theatre (founded in 1765) and the Grand Theatre (established 1778).

Warsaw also attracts many young and off-stream directors and performers who add to the city&#x27;s theatrical culture. Their productions may be viewed mostly in smaller theatres and &quot;Houses of Culture&quot; (&quot;Domy Kultury&quot;), mostly outside &quot;Śródmieście&quot; (Central Warsaw). Warsaw hosts the International Theatrical Meetings.

From 1833 to the outbreak of World War II, Plac Teatralny &quot;(Theatre Square)&quot; was the country&#x27;s cultural hub and home to the various theatres. Plac Teatralny and its environs was the venue for numerous parades, celebrations of state holidays, carnival balls and concerts.

The main building housed the Great Theatre from 1833 to 1834, the Rozmaitości Theatre from 1836 to 1924 and then the National Theatre, the Reduta Theatre from 1919 to 1924, and from 1928 to 1939the Nowy Theatre, which staged productions of contemporary poetical drama, including those directed by Leon Schiller.

The Wojciech Bogusławski Theatre (1922–26) was the best example of &quot;Polish monumental theatre&quot;. From the mid-1930s, the Great Theatre building housed the Upati Institute of Dramatic Artsthe first state-run academy of dramatic art, with an acting department and a stage directing department.

===Museums and art galleries===

There are over 60 museums and galleries in Warsaw which are accessible to the public.

===Cuisine and food===

Warsaw&#x27;s culinary tradition was shaped by its once multicultural population; its cuisine is distinct from that of other cities and towns in Poland. Strong Jewish and French influences were cultivated over the years, in particular herring, consommé, bagels, aspic and French meringue-based pastries or cakes. Traditional Varsovian food is hearty and includes a tripe soup for entrée, a pyza dumpling for main and the iconic wuzetka (voo-zetka) chocolate cream pie for dessert. Crayfish and fish in gelatin were the classical dishes in Warsaw&#x27;s restaurants throughout the 1920s and the 1930s.

Much like Paris or Vienna, Warsaw once possessed a prominent café culture which dated back to the early 18th century, and the city&#x27;s cafeterias were a place for socializing. The historic Wedel Chocolate Lounge on Szpitalna Street remains one of the most renowned spots for social gatherings. Cafeterias, confectioneries and patisseries such as Caffè Nero, Costa Coffee and Starbucks are predominantly found along the Royal Route on New World Street. Thousands of Warsaw&#x27;s residents also flock annually to the pastry workshops (&quot;pączkarnia&quot;) to buy pączki doughnuts on Fat Thursday.

Restaurants offering authentic Polish cuisine are concentrated around the Old Town district. Various spit cakes of Czech or Hungarian origin (kürtőskalács and trdelník) are also sold primarily in the Old Town. Hala Koszyki is a popular meeting place in Warsaw noted for its food hall.

In the 20th century, Warsaw was famed for its state-owned milk bars (&quot;bar mleczny&quot;) which offered cheap fast food in the form of home dinners. Examples of dishes popularized by these canteens include tomato soup, schnitzels, frikadeller, mizeria salad and many others. Contemporary fast food giants like McDonald&#x27;s, KFC, Subway and Burger King are the successors to milk bars, though some reemerged in recent years due to widespread nostalgia.

Gourmet and haute cuisine establishments are situated in the vicinity of the downtown area or in the Frascati neighbourhood. Thirteen Varsovian restaurants were appreciated by the Michelin Guide, with two receiving a michelin star in 2019.

In 2021, National Geographic named Warsaw one of the top cities for vegans in Europe. Śródmieście Południowe (Southern Downtown) and its &quot;hipster food culture&quot; was singled out as the epicenter.

===Events===

Several commemorative events take place every year, notably the Orange Warsaw Festival featuring music concerts. One of the more popular events is the procession of the Three Wise Men (in Polish known as the Three Kings) on Epiphany, shortly after the New Year. Paper crowns are usually worn by spectators throughout the day. The event, which runs along the Royal Route, is attended by Warsaw&#x27;s highest officials and by the Polish president who resides nearby.

Gatherings of thousands of people on the banks of the Vistula on Midsummer&#x27;s Night for a festival called Wianki (Polish for &quot;Wreaths&quot;) have also become a tradition and a yearly event in the programme of cultural events in Warsaw. The festival traces its roots to a peaceful pagan ritual where maidens would float their wreaths of herbs on the water to predict when they would be married, and to whom. By the 19th century this tradition had become a festive event, and it continues today. The city council organize concerts and other events. Each Midsummer&#x27;s Eve, apart from the official floating of wreaths, jumping over fires, and looking for the fern flower, there are musical performances, dignitaries&#x27; speeches, fairs and fireworks by the river bank.

Warsaw Multimedia Fountain Park is located in an enchanting place, near the Old Town and the Vistula. The &#x27;Water – Light – Sound&#x27; multimedia shows take place each Friday and Saturday from May until September at 9.30 pm (May and – 9 October pm). On other weekdays, the shows do not include lasers and sound.

The Warsaw Film festival, an annual festival that takes place every October. Films are usually screened in their original language with Polish subtitles and participating cinemas include Kinoteka (Palace of Science and Culture), Multikino at Golden Terraces and Kultura. Over 100 films are shown throughout the festival, and awards are given to the best and most popular films.

===Warsaw Mermaid===


The mermaid (&quot;syrenka&quot;) is Warsaw&#x27;s symbol and can be found on statues throughout the city and on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. This imagery has been in use since at least the mid-14th century. The oldest existing armed seal of Warsaw is from the year 1390, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription &quot;Sigilium Civitatis Varsoviensis&quot; (Seal of the city of Warsaw). City records as far back as 1609 document the use of a crude form of a sea monster with a female upper body and holding a sword in its claws. In 1653 the poet Zygmunt Laukowski asks the question:

The Mermaid Statue stands in the very centre of Old Town Square, surrounded by a fountain. Due to vandalism, the original statue had been moved to the grounds of the Museum of Warsaw – the statue in the square is a copy.
This is not the only mermaid in Warsaw. Another is located on the bank of the Vistula River near Świętokrzyski Bridge and another on Karowa Street.

The origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The best-known legend, by Artur Oppman, is that long ago two of Triton&#x27;s daughters set out on a journey through the depths of the oceans and seas. One of them decided to stay on the coast of Denmark and can be seen sitting at the entrance to the port of Copenhagen. The second mermaid reached the mouth of the Vistula River and plunged into its waters. She stopped to rest on a sandy beach by the village of Warszowa, where fishermen came to admire her beauty and listen to her beautiful voice. A greedy merchant also heard her songs; he followed the fishermen and captured the mermaid.

Another legend says that a mermaid once swam to Warsaw from the Baltic Sea for the love of the Griffin, the ancient defender of the city, who was killed in a struggle against the Swedish invasions of the 17th century. The mermaid, wishing to avenge his death, took the position of defender of Warsaw, becoming the symbol of the city.

Every member of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars of the UK&#x27;s light cavalry wears the &quot;Maid of Warsaw&quot;, the crest of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. Members of 651 Squadron Army Air Corps of the United Kingdom also wear the &quot;Maid of Warsaw&quot; on the left sleeve of their No. 2 (Service) Dress.

==Sports==


On 9 April 2008, the Mayor of Warsaw, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, obtained from the mayor of Stuttgart Wolfgang Schuster a challenge award – a commemorative plaque awarded to Warsaw as the European capital of Sport in 2008.

The Kazimierz Górski National Stadium, a 58,580-seat-capacity football (soccer) stadium, replaced Warsaw&#x27;s recently demolished 10th-Anniversary Stadium. The National Stadium hosted the opening match, two group matches, a quarter-final, and a semi-final of UEFA Euro 2012.

There are many sports centres in the city as well. Most of these facilities are swimming pools and sports halls, many of them built by the municipality in the past several years. The main indoor venue is Hala Torwar, used for a variety of indoor sports (it was a venue for the 2009 EuroBasket but it is also used as an indoor skating rink). There is also an open-air skating rink (Stegny) and a horse racetrack (Służewiec).

The best of the city&#x27;s swimming centres is at Wodny Park Warszawianka, south of the centre at Merliniego Street, where there&#x27;s an Olympic-sized pool as well as water slides and children&#x27;s areas.

Among the Varsovian football teams, the most recognisable is Legia Warsaw – the army club with a nationwide following play at the Polish Army Stadium, just southeast of the centre at Łazienkowska Street. Established in 1916, they have won the country&#x27;s championship fifteen times (most recently in 2021) and won the Polish Cup nineteen times. In the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League season, they reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to Greek club Panathinaikos.

Their local rivals, Polonia Warsaw, have significantly fewer supporters, yet they managed to win the country&#x27;s championship two times (in 1946 and 2000) and won the cup twice as well. Polonia&#x27;s home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, a ten-minute walk north from the Old Town. Polonia was relegated from the country&#x27;s top flight in 2013 because of their disastrous financial situation. They are now playing in the first league (2nd tier in Poland).

Legia Warsaw&#x27;s basketball team was one of the country&#x27;s best teams in 50s and 60s. They are now participating in PLK, the highest-tier level of the Polish basketball.

<text>Walter Elias Disney ( ; December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American animator, film producer, voice actor, and entrepreneur. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, he holds the record for most Academy Awards earned (22) and nominations (59) by an individual. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress and have also been named as some of the greatest films ever by the American Film Institute.

Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and took a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio (now the Walt Disney Company) with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, he developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, he became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot; (both 1940), &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), and &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950), &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959) and &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), the last of which received five Academy Awards.

In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the theme park industry, and in July 1955 he opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Disneyland&quot; and &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. He was also involved in planning the 1959 Moscow Fair, the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In 1965, he began development of another theme park, Disney World, the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the &quot;Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow&quot; (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life and died of lung cancer in 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.

Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or antisemitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. Historiography of Disney has taken a variety of perspectives, ranging from views of him as a purveyor of homely patriotic values to being a representative of American cultural imperialism. Widely considered to be one of the most influential cultural figures of the 20th century, Disney remains an important presence in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is acknowledged as a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted, the Disney theme parks have grown in size and number around the world and his company has grown to become one of the world&#x27;s largest mass media and entertainment conglomerates.

==Early life==

Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago&#x27;s Hermosa neighborhood. He was the fourth son of Elias Disneyborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parentsand Flora ( Call), an American of German and English descent. Aside from Walt, Elias and Flora&#x27;s sons were Herbert, Raymond and Roy; and the couple had a fifth child, Ruth, in December 1903. In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri, where his uncle Robert had just purchased land. In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor. Elias was a subscriber to the &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of Ryan Walker. He also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons. He lived near the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line and became enamored with trains. He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909. The Disney family were active members of a Congregational church.

In 1911, the Disneys moved to Kansas City, Missouri. There, Disney attended the Benton Grammar School, where he met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced him to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, Disney was spending more time at the Pfeiffers&#x27; house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; and &quot;Kansas City Times&quot;. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the &quot;Times&quot; before school and repeated the round for the evening &quot;Star&quot; after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence course in cartooning.

In 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to the city with his family. Disney enrolled at McKinley High School and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures about World War I; he also took night courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. In mid-1918, he attempted to join the United States Army to fight the Germans, but he was rejected as too young. After forging the date of birth on his birth certificate, he joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after the armistice. He drew cartoons on the side of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. He returned to Kansas City in October 1919, where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio, where he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs, and befriended fellow artist Ub Iwerks.

==Career==
===Early career: 1920–1928===

In January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin&#x27;s revenue declined after Christmas, Disney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A. V. Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined. The company produced commercials using the cutout animation technique. Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; and Max Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot;. With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home. He came to the conclusion that cel animation was more promising than the cutout method. Unable to persuade Cauger to try cel animation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman. Their main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as &quot;Newman&#x27;s Laugh-O-Grams&quot;. Disney studied Paul Terry&#x27;s &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; as a model, and the first six &quot;Laugh-O-Grams&quot; were modernized fairy tales.

In May 1921, the success of the &quot;Laugh-O-Grams&quot; led to the establishment of Laugh-O-Gram Studio, for which he hired more animators, including Fred Harman&#x27;s brother Hugh, Rudolf Ising and Iwerks. The Laugh-O-Grams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the company solvent, so Disney started production of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;based on &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;which combined live action with animation; he cast Virginia Davis in the title role. The result, a 12½-minute, one-reel film, was completed too late to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.
Disney moved to Hollywood in July 1923 at 21 years old. Although New York was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from tuberculosis there, and he hoped to become a live-action film director. Disney&#x27;s efforts to sell &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler. She was losing the rights to both the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; and &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; cartoons, and needed a new series. In October, they signed a contract for six &quot;Alice&quot; comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studiowhich later became the Walt Disney Companyto produce the films; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to Hollywood to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City. In 1926, the first official Walt Disney Studio was established at 2725 Hyperion Avenue; the building was demolished in 1940.

By 1926, Winkler&#x27;s role in the distribution of the &quot;Alice&quot; series had been handed over to her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz, although the relationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained. The series ran until July 1927, by which time Disney had begun to tire of it and wanted to move away from the mixed format to all animation. After Mintz requested new material to distribute through Universal Pictures, Disney and Iwerks created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character Disney wanted to be &quot;peppy, alert, saucy and venturesome, keeping him also neat and trim&quot;.

In February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the &quot;Oswald&quot; series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work directly for him, including Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell and Friz Freleng. Disney also found out that Universal owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald. Mintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if Disney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz&#x27;s ultimatum and lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.

===Creation of Mickey Mouse and following successes: 1928–1934===
To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are unclear. Disney&#x27;s original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but his wife Lillian thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey instead. Iwerks revised Disney&#x27;s provisional sketches to make the character easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself from the animation process, provided Mickey&#x27;s voice until 1947. In the words of one Disney employee, &quot;Ub designed Mickey&#x27;s physical appearance, but Walt gave him his soul.&quot;
Mickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the short &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;, but it, and the second feature, &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;, failed to find a distributor. Following the 1927 sensation &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, to create the first post-produced sound cartoon. After the animation was complete, Disney signed a contract with the former executive of Universal Pictures, Pat Powers, to use the &quot;Powers Cinephone&quot; recording system; Cinephone became the new distributor for Disney&#x27;s early sound cartoons, which soon became popular.

To improve the quality of the music, Disney hired the professional composer and arranger Carl Stalling, on whose suggestion the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot; (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several artists, both local and from New York. Both the Mickey Mouse and &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of drawing every frame individually in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting assistants sketch the poses. Disney asked Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close. Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overworkso he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.

With the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with Columbia Pictures to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became increasingly popular, including internationally. Disney and his crew also introduced new cartoon stars like Pluto in 1930, Goofy in 1932 and Donald Duck in 1934. Always keen to embrace new technology and encouraged by his new contract with United Artists, Disney filmed &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; (1932) in full-color three-strip Technicolor; he was also able to negotiate a deal giving him the sole right to use the three-strip process until August 31, 1935. All subsequent &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons were in color. &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; was popular with audiences and won the inaugural Academy Award for best Short Subject (Cartoon) at the 1932 ceremony. Disney had been nominated for another film in that category, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Orphans&quot;, and received an Honorary Award &quot;for the creation of Mickey Mouse&quot;.

In 1933, Disney produced &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;, a film described by the media historian Adrian Danks as &quot;the most successful short animation of all time&quot;. The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category. The film&#x27;s success led to a further increase in the studio&#x27;s staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of the year. Disney realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that would interest the audience, and he invested in a &quot;story department&quot; separate from the animators, with storyboard artists who would detail the plots of Disney&#x27;s films.

===Golden age of animation: 1934–1941===

By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing cartoon shorts, and believed a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable. The studio began the four-year production of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, based on the fairy tale. When news leaked out about the project, many in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company; industry insiders nicknamed it &quot;Disney&#x27;s Folly&quot;. The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to producethree times over budget. To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard Art Institute; he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that the animators could study realistic movement. To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disney&#x27;s animators developed a multiplane camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth. The glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through the scene. The first work created on the cameraa &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; called &quot;The Old Mill&quot; (1937)won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power. Although &quot;Snow White&quot; had been largely finished by the time the multiplane camera had been completed, Disney ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects.

&quot;Snow White&quot; premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and audiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and by May 1939 its total gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful sound film made to that date. Disney won another Honorary Academy Award, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar statuettes. The success of &quot;Snow White&quot; heralded one of the most productive eras for the studio; the Walt Disney Family Museum calls the following years &quot;the &#x27;Golden Age of Animation. With work on &quot;Snow White&quot; finished, the studio began producing &quot;Pinocchio&quot; in early 1938 and &quot;Fantasia&quot; in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940, and neither performed well at the box officepartly because revenues from Europe had dropped following the start of World War II in 1939. The studio incurred a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of February 1941.

In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company&#x27;s first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney&#x27;s sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators&#x27; strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio. Due to the strikeand the financial state of the companyseveral animators left the studio, and Disney&#x27;s relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. The strike temporarily interrupted the studio&#x27;s next production, &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.

===World War II and beyond: 1941–1950===

Shortly after the release of &quot;Dumbo&quot; in October 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce instruction films for the military such as &quot;Four Methods of Flush Riveting&quot; and &quot;Aircraft Production Methods&quot;. Disney also met with Henry Morgenthau Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury, and agreed to produce short Donald Duck cartoons to promote war bonds. Disney also produced several propaganda productions, including shorts such as &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot;which won an Academy Awardand the 1943 feature film &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot;.

The military films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the feature film &quot;Bambi&quot;which had been in production since 1937underperformed on its release in August 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office. On top of the low earnings from &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot;, the company had debts of $4 million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss the future of the company, the bank&#x27;s chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, &quot;I&#x27;ve been watching the Disneys&#x27; pictures quite closely because I knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk. ... They&#x27;re good this year, they&#x27;re good next year, and they&#x27;re good the year after. ... You have to relax and give them time to market their product.&quot; Disney&#x27;s production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot;, with &quot;Seal Island&quot; the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.

===Theme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966===
In early 1950, Disney produced &quot;Cinderella&quot;, his studio&#x27;s first animated feature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first year. Disney was less involved than he had been with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951) and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures. Around the same time, Disney established his own film distribution division Buena Vista, replacing his most recent distributor RKO Pictures.
For several years Disney had been considering building a theme park. When he visited Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters, he wanted to be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun. He visited the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was heavily influenced by the cleanliness and layout of the park. In March 1952, he received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios. This site proved too small, and a larger plot in Anaheim, south of the studio, was purchased. To distance the project from the studiowhich might attract the criticism of shareholdersDisney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans; those involved became known as &quot;Imagineers&quot;. After obtaining bank funding he invited other stockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatrespart of American Broadcasting Company (ABC)and Western Printing and Lithographing Company. In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into his design. Construction work started in July 1954, and Disneyland opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70 million viewers. The park was designed as a series of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A.a replica of the main street in his hometown of Marceline. The connected themed areas were Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. The park also contained the narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad that linked the lands; around the outside of the park was a high berm to separate the park from the outside world. An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered that Disney had &quot;tastefully combined some of the pleasant things of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow&quot;. Although there were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a month&#x27;s operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by the end of its first year, it attracted 3.6 million guests.

The money from ABC was contingent on Disney television programs. The studio had been involved in a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Roy believed the program added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to shareholders, he wrote that &quot;television can be a most powerful selling aid for us, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise that we enter television when we do&quot;. In 1954, after the Disneyland funding had been agreed, ABC broadcast &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Disneyland&quot;, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio&#x27;s library. The show was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%. In April 1955, &quot;Newsweek&quot; called the series an &quot;American institution&quot;. ABC was pleased with the ratings, leading to Disney&#x27;s first daily television program, &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, a variety show catering specifically to children. The program was accompanied by merchandising through various companies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring books and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connected to the show). One of the segments of &quot;Disneyland&quot; consisted of the five-part miniseries &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; which, according to Disney biographer Neal Gabler, &quot;became an overnight sensation&quot;. The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot;, became internationally popular and ten million records were sold. As a result, Disney formed his own record production and distribution entity, Disneyland Records.

As well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects away from the studio. He was consultant to the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow; Disney Studios&#x27; contribution was &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, a 19-minute film in the 360-degree Circarama theater that was one of the most popular attractions. The following year he acted as the chairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, where he designed the opening, closing and medal ceremonies. He was one of twelve investors in the Celebrity Sports Center, which opened in 1960 in Glendale, Colorado; he and Roy bought out the others in 1962, making the Disney company the sole owner.
Despite the demands wrought by non-studio projects, Disney continued to work on film and television projects. In 1955, he was involved in &quot;Man in Space&quot;, an episode of the &quot;Disneyland&quot; series, which was made in collaboration with NASA rocket designer Wernher von Braun. Disney also oversaw aspects of the full-length features &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (the first animated film in CinemaScope) in 1955, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (the first animated film in Technirama 70 mm film) in 1959, &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (the first animated feature film to use Xerox cels) in 1961, and &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; in 1963.

In 1964, Disney produced &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, based on the book series by P. L. Travers; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s. It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although Travers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights. The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.

Disney provided four exhibits for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, for which he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For PepsiCo, who planned a tribute to UNICEF, Disney developed It&#x27;s a Small World, a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world; Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln contained an animatronic Abraham Lincoln giving excerpts from his speeches; Carousel of Progress promoted the importance of electricity; and Ford&#x27;s Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibitsprincipally concepts and technologywere re-installed in Disneyland, although It&#x27;s a Small World is the ride that most closely resembles the original.

During the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a ski resort in Mineral King, a glacial valley in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada. He hired experts such as the Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer Willy Schaeffler. With income from Disneyland accounting for an increasing proportion of the studio&#x27;s income, Disney continued to look for venues for other attractions. In 1963, he presented a project to create a theme park in downtown St. Louis, Missouri; he initially reached an agreement with the Civic Center Redevelopment Corp, which controlled the land, but the deal later collapsed over funding. In late 1965, he announced plans to develop another theme park to be called &quot;Disney World&quot; (now Walt Disney World), a few miles southwest of Orlando, Florida. Disney World was to include the &quot;Magic Kingdom&quot;a larger and more elaborate version of Disneylandplus golf courses and resort hotels. The heart of Disney World was to be the &quot;Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow&quot; (EPCOT), which he described as:

an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry. It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed, but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and systems. And EPCOT will always be a showcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise.

During 1966, Disney cultivated businesses willing to sponsor EPCOT. He received a story credit in the 1966 film &quot;Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.&quot; as Retlaw Yensid, his name spelt backwards. He increased his involvement in the studio&#x27;s films, and was heavily involved in the story development of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, the live-action musical feature &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; (both 1967) and the animated short &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; (1968).

==Illness, death and aftermath==

Disney had been a heavy smoker since World War I. He did not use cigarettes with filters and had smoked a pipe as a young man. In early November 1966, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with cobalt therapy. On November 30, he felt unwell and was taken by ambulance from his home to St. Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, at age 65, he died of circulatory collapse caused by the cancer. His remains were cremated two days later and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

The release of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to 81. When &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; was released in 1968, it earned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously. After Disney&#x27;s death, his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically while the quality of their animated films was allowed to languish. In the late 1980s, this trend was reversed in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes as the &quot;Disney Renaissance&quot; that began with &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). Disney&#x27;s studios continue to produce successful film, television and stage entertainment.

Disney&#x27;s plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition. After Disney&#x27;s death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a town to an attraction. At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt Disney World to his brother. Walt Disney World expanded with the opening of Epcot Center in 1982; Walt Disney&#x27;s vision of a functional city was replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world&#x27;s fair. In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney&#x27;s daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco. Thousands of artifacts from Disney&#x27;s life and career are on display, including numerous awards that he received. In 2014, the Disney theme parks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.

==Personal life and character==
Early in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, Lillian Bounds. They married in July of that year, at her brother&#x27;s house in her home town of Lewiston, Idaho. The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney&#x27;s biographer Neal Gabler she did not &quot;accept Walt&#x27;s decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people &#x27;how henpecked he is&#x27;.&quot; Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts, &quot;content with household management and providing support for her husband&quot;. Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously). Within the family, neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point. The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the Lindbergh kidnapping; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press.
In 1949, Disney and his family moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills district of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had their own backyard railroad, Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his back yard. The name of the railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from his home&#x27;s location on Carolwood Drive. The miniature working steam locomotive was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and Disney named it &quot;Lilly Belle&quot; after his wife; after three years Disney ordered it into storage due to a series of accidents involving his guests.

Disney grew more politically conservative as he got older. A Democratic Party supporter until the 1940 presidential election, when he switched allegiance to the Republican Party, he became a generous donor to Thomas E. Dewey&#x27;s 1944 bid for the presidency. Disney engaged in red-baiting in response to organized labor actions against his company. In 1941, he paid for a full-page ad in &quot;Variety&quot; claiming that &quot;Communistic agitation&quot; was responsible for a cartoonist strike against him. In 1946, he was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an organization who stated they &quot;believ[ed] in, and like, the American Way of Life ... we find ourselves in sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life&quot;. In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1993 that Disney had been an FBI informant passing secret information to J. Edgar Hoover about communist activities in Hollywood. However, while Walt Disney was made a &quot;Special Agent in Charge Contact&quot; in 1954, FBI officials claim this was largely an honorary title regularly awarded to members of a community who might be of use to the bureau. The FBI declassified and released Walt Disney&#x27;s file on their website, and revealed that much of Disney&#x27;s correspondence with the bureau (via studio personnel) was in relation to the production of educational films; such as a certain installment of the &quot;Career Day&quot; newsreel segments on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; focusing on the bureau (which aired in January 1958), as well as an unmade 1961 educational short warning children about the dangers of child molestation.

Disney&#x27;s public persona was very different from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described him as &quot;almost painfully shy ... diffident&quot; and self-deprecating. According to his biographer Richard Schickel, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney &quot;played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public&quot; and knew that he was doing so. Disney acknowledged the façade and told a friend that &quot;I&#x27;m not Walt Disney. I do a lot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink.&quot; Critic Otis Ferguson, in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, called the private Disney: &quot;common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney.&quot; Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said &quot;That&#x27;ll work&quot;, it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.

==Reputation==

Views of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions. Mark Langer, in the &quot;American Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, writes that &quot;Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture.&quot; Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney &quot;as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas&quot;, while PBS records that critics have censured his work because of its &quot;smooth façade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history&quot;.

Disney has been accused of antisemitism for having given Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl a tour of his studio a month after . Riefenstahl&#x27;s invitation was solicited to Disney by painter and ballet dancer Hurbert &quot;Jay&quot; Stowitts, a close friend of Riefenstahl, and a former colleague of Leopold Stokowski who at the time was collaborating with Disney on &quot;Fantasia&quot;. A month later a spokesperson for Disney told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;: &quot;Miss Riefenstahl got into the studio, but she crashed the gate. A Los Angeles man who is known to Disney obtained permission to take a party through the plant. Leni was in the party. If we had known it in advance she wouldn&#x27;t have got in.&quot; Animation historian Jim Korkis, theorizes that Disney may have also met with Riefenstahl for financial reasons: as an attempt by Disney to recover over 135,000 Reichsmarks owed from his German film distributor and to get the ban on Disney films lifted in Germany. Animator Art Babbitt, organizer behind the 1941 strike at the studio and who held a well-known grudge against Disney, claimed in his later years that he saw Disney and his lawyer attend meetings of the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi organization, during the late 1930s. However, according to Disney biographer Neal Gabler: &quot;...that was highly unlikely, not only because Walt had little enough time for his family, much less political meetings, but because he had no real political leanings at the time.&quot; Disney&#x27;s office appointment book makes no mention of him attending Bund rallies, and no other employee ever claimed he attended such meetings. 

According to Gabler, Disney was apolitical and &quot;something of a political naïf&quot; during the 1930s and he had previously told one reporter – as tensions in Europe were brewing – that America should &quot;let &#x27;em fight their own wars&quot; claiming he had &quot;learned my lesson&quot; from World War I. During World War II, Disney was actively involved in making propaganda films against the Nazis, both for the general public (such as &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; and &quot;Education for Death&quot;), as well as educational and training films exclusively for the United States Government. As early as October 1940 (over a year before America&#x27;s entry into the war), Disney began enlisting contracts from various branches of the United States Armed Forces to make training films, and in March 1941 he held a luncheon with Government representatives formally offering his services &quot;...for national defence industries at cost and without profit. In making this offer, I am motivated solely by a desire to help as best I can in the present emergency.&quot; These training films contained highly classified information and required the highest level of security clearance to be viewed. If Disney had any previous sympathies toward Nazism, the U.S. Government would have disqualified him from making these films.

The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons but also points out that Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities and was named the 1955 &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith chapter in Beverly Hills. The organization itself found no evidence of antisemitism on Disney&#x27;s part. The plaque read: &quot;For exemplifying the best tenets of American citizenship and inter-group understanding and interpreting into action the ideals of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith.&quot; Disney had numerous Jewish employees, many of whom were in influential positions. None of Disney&#x27;s employees – including animator Art Babbitt, who disliked Disney intensely – ever accused him of making antisemitic slurs or taunts. Jewish story man Joe Grant, who worked closely with Disney throughout the 1930s and 1940s stated, &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, there was no evidence of antisemitism. I think the whole idea should be put to rest and buried deep. He was not antisemitic. Some of the most influential people at the studio were Jewish. It&#x27;s much ado about nothing. I never once had a problem with him in that way.&quot; In addition songwriter Robert B. Sherman recalled that when one of Disney&#x27;s lawyers made antisemitic remarks towards him and his brother Richard, Disney defended them and fired the attorney. Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of antisemitism and that Disney largely got that reputation due to his association with Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals – an anti-Communist organization formed in 1944, that was rumored to have antisemitic undertones. Gabler concludes that &quot;...though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not antisemitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were antisemitic, and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life.&quot; Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance, and had no involvement with the organization after 1947. 
According to Disney&#x27;s daughter Diane Disney-Miller, her sister Sharon dated a Jewish boyfriend for a period of time, to which her father raised no objections and even reportedly said, &quot;Sharon, I think it&#x27;s wonderful how these Jewish families have accepted you.&quot;

Disney has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of his productions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive material. Gabler argues that &quot;Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive.&quot;
The feature film &quot;Song of the South&quot; was criticized by contemporary film critics, the NAACP, and others for its perpetuation of black stereotypes, but during filming Disney became close friends with its star, James Baskett, describing him in a letter to his sister Ruth as &quot;the best actor, I believe, to be discovered in years.&quot; Disney and Baskett stayed in contact long after the film&#x27;s production, with Walt even sending him gifts. When Baskett was in failing health, Disney not only began financially supporting him and his family, but also campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for his performance, making Baskett the first black actor so honored. Baskett died shortly afterward, and his widow wrote Disney a letter of gratitude for his support claiming he had been a &quot;friend in deed and [we] certainly have been in need.&quot; Floyd Norman, the studio&#x27;s first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, &quot;Not once did I observe a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of peopleand by this I mean all peoplecan only be called exemplary.&quot;

Watts argues that many of Disney&#x27;s post-World War II films &quot;legislated a kind of cultural Marshall Plan. They nourished a genial cultural imperialism that magically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectations, and goods of a prosperous middle-class United States.&quot; Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see Disney&#x27;s studio as an &quot;agent of manipulation and repression&quot;, although he observes that it has &quot;labored throughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy&quot;. John Tomlinson, in his study &quot;Cultural Imperialism&quot;, examines the work of Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart, whose 1971 book ( &quot;How to Read Donald Duck&quot;) identifies that there are &quot;imperialist ... values &#x27;concealed&#x27; behind the innocent, wholesome façade of the world of Walt Disney&quot;; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as &quot;it presents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children.&quot; Tomlinson views their argument as flawed, as &quot;they simply &quot;assume&quot; that reading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the affluent ... [&#x27;Yankee&#x27;] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect&quot;.

Disney has been portrayed numerous times in fictional works. H. G. Wells references Disney in his 1938 novel &quot;The Holy Terror&quot;, in which World Dictator Rud fears that Donald Duck is meant to lampoon the dictator. Disney was portrayed by Len Cariou in the 1995 made-for-TV film &quot;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story&quot;, and by Tom Hanks in the 2013 film &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;. In 2001, the German author Peter Stephan Jungk published (trans: &quot;The King of America&quot;), a fictional work of Disney&#x27;s later years that re-imagines him as a power-hungry racist. The composer Philip Glass later adapted the book into the opera &quot;The Perfect American&quot; (2013).

Several commentators have described Disney as a cultural icon. On Disney&#x27;s death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney&#x27;s films are those &quot;considered valuable in American Christian society&quot;, which include &quot;individualism, decency, ... love for our fellow man, fair play and toleration&quot;. Disney&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; calls the films &quot;wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining ... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty&quot;. Journalist Bosley Crowther argues that Disney&#x27;s &quot;achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in history.&quot; Correspondent Alistair Cooke calls Disney a &quot;folk-hero ... the Pied Piper of Hollywood&quot;, while Gabler considers Disney &quot;reshaped the culture and the American consciousness&quot;. In the &quot;American Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Langer writes:

Disney remains the central figure in the history of animation. Through technological innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.

In December 2021, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York opened a three-month special exhibit in honor of Disney titled &quot;Inspiring Walt Disney&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Disney received 59 Academy Award nominations, including 22 awards: both totals are records. He was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, but did not win, but he was presented with two Special Achievement Awardsfor &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Living Desert&quot; (1953)and the Cecil B. DeMille Award. He also received four Emmy Award nominations, winning once, for Best Producer for the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television series. Several of his films are included in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;: &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot; and &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. In 1998, the American Film Institute published a list of the 100 greatest American films, according to industry experts; the list included &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (at number 49), and &quot;Fantasia&quot; (at 58).

In February 1960, Disney was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame with two stars, one for motion pictures and the other for his television work; Mickey Mouse was given his own star for motion pictures in 1978, and Disneyland received one in 2005. Disney was also inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1986, the California Hall of Fame in December 2006, was the inaugural recipient of a star on the Anaheim walk of stars in 2014, and was a member of the first Orange County Hall of Fame class in 2023.

The Walt Disney Family Museum records that he &quot;along with members of his staff, received more than 950 honors and citations from throughout the world&quot;. He was made a in the French in 1935, and in 1952 he was awarded the country&#x27;s highest artistic decoration, the . Other national awards include Thailand&#x27;s Order of the Crown (1960); Germany&#x27;s Order of Merit (1956), Brazil&#x27;s Order of the Southern Cross (1941), and Mexico&#x27;s Order of the Aztec Eagle (1943). In the United States, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom on September 14, 1964, and on May 24, 1968, he was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. He received the Showman of the World Award from the National Association of Theatre Owners, and in 1955, the National Audubon Society awarded Disney its highest honor, the Audubon Medal, for promoting the &quot;appreciation and understanding of nature&quot; through his &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; nature films. A minor planet discovered in 1980 by astronomer Lyudmila Karachkina, was named 4017 Disneya, and he was also awarded honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles.

<text>A watermark is an identifying image or pattern in paper that appears as various shades of lightness/darkness when viewed by transmitted light (or when viewed by reflected light, atop a dark background), caused by thickness or density variations in the paper.
Watermarks have been used on postage stamps, currency, and other government documents to discourage counterfeiting. There are two main ways of producing watermarks in paper; the &quot;dandy roll process&quot;, and the more complex &quot;cylinder mould process&quot;.

Watermarks vary greatly in their visibility; while some are obvious on casual inspection, others require some study to pick out. Various aids have been developed, such as &quot;watermark fluid&quot; that wets the paper without damaging it. A watermark is very useful in the examination of paper because it can be used for dating documents and artworks, identifying sizes, mill trademarks and locations, and determining the quality of a sheet of paper. The word is also used for digital practices that share similarities with physical watermarks. In one case, overprint on computer-printed output may be used to identify output from an unlicensed trial version of a program. In another instance, identifying codes can be encoded as a digital watermark for a music, video, picture, or other file. Or an artist adding their identifying digital Signature, graphic, logo in their digital artworks as an identifier or anti-counterfeit measure .

== History ==
Watermarks were first introduced in Fabriano, Italy, in 1282. At the time, watermarks were created by changing the thickness of paper during a stage in the manufacturing process when it was still wet.

== Processes ==

=== Dandy roll process ===

Traditionally, a watermark was made by impressing a water-coated metal stamp onto the paper during manufacturing. The invention of the dandy roll in 1826 by John Marshall revolutionised the watermark process and made it easier for producers to watermark their paper.

The &quot;dandy roll&quot; is a light roller covered by material similar to window screen that is embossed with a pattern. Faint lines are made by &quot;laid wires&quot; that run parallel to the axis of the dandy roll, and the bold lines are made by &quot;chain wires&quot; that run around the circumference to secure the laid wires to the roll from the outside. Because the chain wires are located on the outside of the laid wires, they have a greater influence on the impression in the pulp, hence their bolder appearance than the laid wire lines.

This embossing is transferred to the pulp fibres, compressing and reducing their thickness in that area. Because the patterned portion of the page is thinner, it transmits more light through and therefore has a lighter appearance than the surrounding paper. If these lines are distinct and parallel, and/or there is a watermark, then the paper is termed &quot;laid paper&quot;. If the lines appear as a mesh or are indiscernible, and/or there is no watermark, then it is called &quot;wove paper&quot;. This method is called &quot;line drawing watermarks.&quot;

=== Cylinder mould process ===
Another type of watermark is called the &quot;cylinder mould watermark&quot;. It is a shaded watermark first used in 1848 that incorporates tonal depth and creates a greyscale image. Instead of using a wire covering for the dandy roll, the shaded watermark is created by areas of relief on the roll&#x27;s own surface. Once dry, the paper may then be rolled again to produce a watermark of even thickness but with varying density. The resulting watermark is generally much clearer and more detailed than those made by the Dandy Roll process, and as such, Cylinder Mould Watermark Paper is the preferred type of watermarked paper for banknotes, passports, motor vehicle titles, and other documents where it is an important anti-counterfeiting measure.

== On postage stamps ==


In philately, the watermark is a key feature of a stamp, and often constitutes the difference between a common and a rare stamp. Collectors who encounter two otherwise identical stamps with different watermarks consider each stamp to be a separate identifiable issue. The &quot;classic&quot; stamp watermark is a small crown or other national symbol, appearing either once on each stamp or a continuous pattern. Watermarks were nearly universal on stamps in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but generally fell out of use, but some countries continue to use them.

Some types of embossing, such as that used to make the &quot;cross on oval&quot; design on early stamps of Switzerland, resemble a watermark in that the paper is thinner, but can be distinguished by having sharper edges than is usual for a normal watermark. Stamp paper watermarks also show various designs, letters, numbers and pictorial elements.

The process of bringing out the stamp watermark is fairly simple. Sometimes a watermark in stamp paper can be seen just by looking at the unprinted back side of a stamp. More often, the collector must use a few basic items to get a good look at the watermark. For example, watermark fluid may be applied to the back of a stamp to temporarily reveal the watermark.

Even using the simple watermarking method described, it can be difficult to distinguish some watermarks. Watermarks on stamps printed in yellow and orange can be particularly difficult to see. A few mechanical devices are also used by collectors to detect watermarks on stamps such as the Morley-Bright watermark detector and the more expensive Safe Signoscope. Such devices can be very useful for they can be used without the application of watermark fluid and also allow the collector to look at the watermark for a longer period of time to more easily detect the watermark.
