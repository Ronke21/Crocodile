<text>Urho Kaleva Kekkonen (; 3 September 1900 – 31 August 1986), often referred to by his initials UKK, was a Finnish politician who served as the eighth and longest-serving president of Finland from 1956 to 1982. He also served as prime minister (1950–1953, 1954–1956), and held various other cabinet positions. He was the third and most recent president from the Agrarian League/Centre Party. Head of state for nearly 26 years, he dominated Finnish politics for 31 years overall. Holding a large amount of power, he won his later elections with little opposition and has often been classified as an autocrat.

As president, Kekkonen continued the &quot;active neutrality&quot; policy of his predecessor President Juho Kusti Paasikivi that came to be known as the Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine, under which Finland was to retain its independence while maintaining good relations and extensive trade with members of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Critical commentators referred to this policy of appeasement pejoratively as Finlandization. He hosted the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Helsinki in 1975 and was considered a potential candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize that year. He is credited by Finnish historians for his foreign and trade policies, which allowed Finland&#x27;s market economy to keep pace with Western Europe even with the Soviet Union as a neighbor, and for Finland to gradually take part in the European integration process. On the other hand, his perceived hunger for power, his divide-and-rule attitude in domestic politics and the lack of genuine political opposition, especially during the latter part of his presidency, significantly weakened Finnish democracy during his presidency. After Kekkonen&#x27;s presidency, the reform of the Constitution of Finland was initiated by his successors to increase the power of the Parliament and the prime minister at the expense of the president.

Kekkonen was a member of the Parliament of Finland from 1936 until his rise to the presidency. Either prior, during or between his premierships, he served as minister of justice (1936–37, 1944–46, 1951), minister of the interior (1937–39, 1950–51), speaker of the Finnish Parliament (1948–50) and minister of foreign affairs (1952–53, 1954). In addition to his extensive political career, he was a lawyer by education, a policeman and athlete in his youth, a veteran of the Finnish Civil War, and an enthusiastic writer. During World War II, his anonymous reports on the war and foreign politics received a large audience in the &quot;Suomen Kuvalehti&quot; magazine. Even during his presidency, he wrote humorous, informal columns (&quot;causerie&quot;) for the same magazine, edited by his long-time friend Ilmari Turja, under several pseudonyms.

==Biography==
===Family history===
The Kekkonens are an old Savonian family. The ancestors of Urho Kekkonen most likely settled in the Savonia region before the 16th century. Although it is not known where the Kekkonens came to Savonia from, there has been speculation that they are from Karelia as people with the name were known to have lived in certain settlements of the Karelian Isthmus for centuries. Kekkonen himself thought it possible that the family might instead originate from Western Finland, for example from Tavastia, where there have been place names connected to their surname from as early as the 15th century. His seventh-great-grandfather Tuomas Kekkonen (born ca. 1630) is first mentioned in documents in Pieksämäki in 1673. He was probably from either Kangasniemi or Joroinen.

Twelve generations of Urho Kekkonen&#x27;s ancestors were peasants from eastern Finland. The paternal side of Kekkonen&#x27;s family practised slash-and-burn agriculture and the maternal side stayed on their own site. Kekkonen&#x27;s paternal grandfather Eenokki was part of a landless group grown in the 19th century and lived on temporary work and working as a farmworker.

After serving in several houses Eenokki Kekkonen married Anna-Liisa Koskinen. They had four sons, named Taavetti, Johannes, Alpertti and Juho. Juho Kekkonen, the youngest son of the family, who had gone travelling from the family&#x27;s home in Korvenmökki in the village of Koivujärvi, was the father of Urho Kekkonen. Aatu Pylvänäinen, Urho Kekkonen&#x27;s maternal grandfather, who worked as a farmer at the Tarkkala farm in Kangasniemi, married Amanda Manninen in the summer of 1878 when she was only 16 years old. Their children, three daughters and three sons, were Emilia, Elsa, Siilas, Tyyne, Eetu, and Samuel.

As the son of a poor family, Juho Kekkonen had to go to work in the forest and ended up at a log working ground in Kangasniemi in 1898. Emilia Pylvänäinen herded cattle there, on the shores of the Haahkala lands, where Juho Kekkonen worked with other loggers. The two youngsters got to know each other and they married in 1899. The couple moved to Otava, where Juho Kekkonen got a job at the Koivusaha sawmill of Halla Oy. He was later appointed the head of forestry work and caretaker of the logging business.

The couple moved to Pielavesi along with the working grounds, where Juho Kekkonen bought a smoke hut which he later repaired and expanded into a proper house. He built a chimney in the house shortly before the birth of his first son Urho. Because of the beautiful alders growing behind the house, the house became known as &quot;Lepikon torppa&quot; (&quot;croft of alders&quot;). There was a smoke sauna in the yard, where Urho Kekkonen was born on 3 September 1900. The family lived in Lepikon torppa for six years and Urho Kekkonen&#x27;s sister Siiri was born in 1904. The family moved along with Juho Kekkonen&#x27;s forestry work to Kuopio in 1906 and to Lapinlahti in 1908. The family had to live modestly but did not suffer from poverty. The youngest child of the family, Jussi, was born in 1910.

===Early life===

The son of Juho Kekkonen and Emilia Pylvänäinen, Urho Kekkonen was born at &quot;Lepikon Torppa&quot; (&quot;the Lepikko torp&quot;), a small cabin located in Pielavesi, in the Savo region of Finland, and spent his childhood in Kainuu. His family were farmers (though not poor tenant farmers, as some of his supporters later claimed). His father was originally a farm-hand and forestry worker who rose to become a forestry manager and stock agent at Halla Ltd. Claims made that Kekkonen&#x27;s family had lived in a rudimentary farmhouse with no chimney were later proved to be false—a photograph of Kekkonen&#x27;s childhood home had been retouched to remove the chimney. His school years did not go smoothly. During the Finnish Civil War, Kekkonen fought for the White Guard (Kajaani chapter), fighting in the battles of Kuopio, Varkaus, Mouhu, and Viipuri, and taking part in mop-up operations, including leading a firing squad in Hamina. He later admitted to having killed a man in battle, but wrote in his memoirs that he was randomly selected by his company commander to follow a squad escorting ten prisoners, where the squad turned out to be a firing squad, and then to give the actual order to aim and fire. He had to complete further military service after the war, which he did in a car battalion from 1919 to 1920, finishing as a sergeant.

In independent Finland, Kekkonen first worked as a journalist in Kajaani then moved to Helsinki in 1921 to study law. While studying he worked for the security police EK between 1921 and 1927, where he became acquainted with anti-communist policing. During this time he also met his future wife, Sylvi Salome Uino (12 March 1900 – 2 December 1974), a typist at the police station. They had two sons, Matti (1928–2013) and Taneli (1928–1985). Matti Kekkonen served as a Centre Party member of Parliament from 1958 to 1969, and Taneli Kekkonen worked as an ambassador in Belgrade, Athens, Rome, Malta, Warsaw and Tel Aviv.

Kekkonen had a reputation as a heavy-handed, violent interrogator during his years in the security police. Conversely, he described himself as taking the role of a humane &quot;good cop&quot; to balance out his older and more abusive colleagues. Some of the communists he interrogated confirmed the latter account, while others accused him of having been particularly violent. Later, as a minister in the 1950s, he is said to have visited and made peace with a communist he had &quot;beaten up&quot; in an interrogation in the 1920s. Explaining the contradiction of these statements, author Timo J. Tuikka says Kekkonen&#x27;s interrogation methods evolved over time: &quot;He learned that the fist is not always the most efficient tool, but that booze, sauna and chatting are much better means of obtaining information.&quot; These revelatory experiences would significantly influence his career and approach to politics later on. Kekkonen eventually had to resign from the EK after criticising his superiors.

In 1927 Kekkonen became a lawyer and worked for the Association of Rural Municipalities until 1932. Kekkonen took a Doctor of Laws degree in 1936 at the University of Helsinki where he was active in the Pohjois-Pohjalainen Osakunta, a student nation for students from northern Ostrobothnia, and editor-in-chief of the student newspaper &quot;Ylioppilaslehti&quot; in the period 1927–1928. He was also an athlete whose greatest achievement was to become the Finnish high jump champion in 1924 with a jump of . He was best at the standing jump.

===Early political career===
A nationalist at heart, Kekkonen&#x27;s ideological roots lay in the student politics of newly independent Finland and in the radicalism of the right-wing. He joined the Academic Karelia Society (&quot;Akateeminen Karjala-Seura&quot;), an organisation favouring Finland&#x27;s annexation of East Karelia, but resigned from it in 1932 along with over 100 other moderate members because of the organisation&#x27;s support for the 1932 far-right Mäntsälä rebellion. According to Johannes Virolainen, a longtime Agrarian and Centrist politician, some Finnish right-wingers hated and mocked Kekkonen for the decision and cast him as a power-hungry opportunist. Kekkonen chaired Suomalaisuuden Liitto, another nationalist organisation, from 1930 to 1932. He also published articles in its magazine, &quot;Suomalainen Suomi&quot; (), which was later renamed as &quot;Kanava&quot;.

Kekkonen spent long periods of time in late-Weimar-era Germany between 1931 and 1933 while working on his dissertation and there witnessed the rise of Adolf Hitler. This alerted him to far-right radicalism and apparently led him to publish &quot;Demokratian itsepuolustus&quot; (Self-Defense of Democracy), a political pamphlet warning about the danger, in 1934. In 1933 he joined the Agrarian League (later renamed the Centre Party), became a civil servant at the Ministry of Agriculture and made his first unsuccessful attempt at getting elected to the Finnish Parliament.

Kekkonen successfully stood for parliament a second time in 1936 whereupon he became Justice Minister, serving from 1936 to 1937. During his term, he enacted the &quot;Tricks of Kekkonen&quot; (&quot;Kekkosen konstit&quot;), an attempt to ban the right-wing, radical Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (&quot;Isänmaallinen Kansanliike&quot;, IKL). In the end, this effort was found illegal and halted by the Supreme Court. Kekkonen was also Minister of the Interior from 1937 to 1939. 

He was not a member of the cabinets during the Winter War or the Continuation War. In March 1940, in a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Finnish Parliament, he voted against the Moscow peace treaty. During the Continuation War, Kekkonen served as director of the Karelian Evacuees&#x27; Welfare Centre from 1940 to 1943 and as the Ministry of Finance&#x27;s commissioner for coordination from 1943 to 1945, tasked with rationalising public administration. By that time, he had become one of the leading politicians within the so-called Peace opposition which advocated withdrawing from the war, having concluded that Germany, and consequently Finland, would lose. In 1944, he again became Minister of Justice, serving until 1946, and had to deal with the war-responsibility trials. Kekkonen was a Deputy Speaker of the Parliament 1946–1947, and was Speaker from 1948 to 1950.

In the 1950 Presidential election, Kekkonen was the candidate of the Finnish Agrarian Party. He conducted a vigorous campaign against incumbent President Juho Kusti Paasikivi to finish third in the first and only ballot, receiving 62 votes in the electoral college, while Paasikivi was reelected with 171. After the election, Paasikivi appointed Kekkonen Prime Minister where in all his five cabinets, he emphasised the need to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Known for his authoritarian personality, he was ousted in 1953 but returned as Prime Minister from 1954 to 1956. Kekkonen also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for periods in 1952–1953 and 1954, concurrent with his prime ministership.

===President of Finland===
====Overview====
During Kekkonen&#x27;s term, the balance of power between the Finnish Government and the President tilted heavily towards the President. In principle and formally, parliamentarism was followed with governments nominated by a parliamentary majority. However, Kekkonen-era cabinets were often in bitter internal disagreement and alliances formed broke down easily. New cabinets often tried to reverse their predecessors&#x27; policies. Kekkonen used his power extensively to nominate ministers and to compel the legislature&#x27;s acceptance of new cabinets. Publicly and with impunity, he also used the old boy network to bypass the government and communicate directly with high officials. Only when Kekkonen&#x27;s term ended did governments remain stable throughout the entire period between elections.

Nevertheless, during Kekkonen&#x27;s presidency, a few parties were represented in most governments — mainly the Centrists, Social Democrats, and Swedish People&#x27;s Party — while the People&#x27;s Democrats and Communists were often in government from 1966 onwards.

Throughout his time as president, Kekkonen did his best to keep political adversaries in check. The Centre Party&#x27;s rival National Coalition Party was kept in opposition for 20 years despite good election performances. The Rural Party (which had broken away from the Centre Party) was treated similarly. On a few occasions, parliament was dissolved for no other reason than that its political composition did not please Kekkonen. Despite his career in the Centre Party, his relation to the party was often difficult. There was a so-called &quot;K-linja&quot; (&quot;K policy&quot;, named after Urho Kekkonen, Ahti Karjalainen and Arvo Korsimo), which promoted friendly relations and bilateral trade with the Soviet Union. Kekkonen consolidated his power within the party by placing supporters of the &quot;K-linja&quot; in leading roles. Various Centre Party members to whose prominence Kekkonen objected often found themselves sidelined, as Kekkonen negotiated directly with the lower level. Chairman of the Centre Party, Johannes Virolainen, was threatened by Kekkonen with the dissolution of parliament when Kekkonen wanted to nominate SDP&#x27;s Sorsa instead of Virolainen as Prime Minister. Kekkonen&#x27;s so-called &quot;Mill Letters&quot; were a continuous stream of directives to high officials, politicians, and journalists. Yet Kekkonen by no means always used coercive measures. Some prominent politicians, most notably Tuure Junnila (NCP) and Veikko Vennamo (Rural Party), were able to brand themselves as &quot;anti-Kekkonen&quot; without automatically suffering his displeasure as a consequence.

====First term (1956–62)====
In the presidential election of 1956, Kekkonen defeated the Social Democrat Karl-August Fagerholm 151–149 in the electoral college vote. The campaign was notably vicious, with many personal attacks against several candidates, especially Kekkonen. The tabloid gossip newspaper &quot;Sensaatio-Uutiset&quot; (&quot;Sensational News&quot;) accused Kekkonen of fistfighting, excessive drinking and extramarital affairs. The drinking and womanizing charges were partly true. At times, during evening parties with his friends, Kekkonen got drunk, and he had at least two longtime mistresses.

As president, Kekkonen continued the neutrality policy of President Paasikivi, which came to be known as the Paasikivi–Kekkonen line. From the beginning, he ruled with the assumption that he alone was acceptable to the Soviet Union as Finnish President. Evidence from defectors like Oleg Gordievsky and files from the Soviet archives show that keeping Kekkonen in power was indeed the main objective of the Soviet Union in its relations with Finland.

In August 1958, Karl-August Fagerholm&#x27;s third cabinet, a coalition government led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and including Kekkonen&#x27;s party Agrarian League, was formed. The Communist front SKDL was left out. This irritated the Soviet Union because of the inclusion of ministers from SDP&#x27;s anti-Communist wing, namely Väinö Leskinen and Olavi Lindblom. They were seen by the Soviet Union as puppets of the anti-Communist SDP chair Väinö Tanner, who had been convicted in the war-responsibility trials. Kekkonen had warned against this but was ignored by SDP. The Night Frost Crisis, as coined by Nikita Khrushchev, led to Soviet pressure against Finland in economic matters. Kekkonen sided with the Soviet Union, working behind the scenes against the cabinet; Fagerholm&#x27;s cabinet consequently resigned in December 1958. The Finnish Foreign Ministry ignored United States offers for help as promised by Ambassador John D. Hickerson in November 1958. The crisis was resolved by Kekkonen in January 1959, when he privately travelled to Moscow to negotiate with Khrushchev and Andrei Gromyko. The crisis established Kekkonen as having the extra-constitutional authority to determine which parties may participate in government, effectively restricting the free parliamentary formation of governing coalitions for many years ahead.
The second time the Soviets helped Kekkonen was in the Note Crisis in 1961. The most widely held view of the Note Crisis is that the Soviet Union acted to ensure Kekkonen&#x27;s reelection. Whether Kekkonen himself had organized the incident and to what extent remains debated. Several parties competing against Kekkonen had formed an alliance, &quot;Honka-liitto&quot;, to promote Chancellor of Justice Olavi Honka, a non-partisan candidate, in the 1962 presidential elections. Kekkonen had planned to foil the &quot;Honka-liitto&quot; by calling an early parliamentary election and thus forcing his opponents to campaign against each other and together simultaneously. However, in October 1961, the Soviet Union sent a diplomatic note proposing military &quot;consultations&quot; as provided by the Finno-Soviet Treaty. As a result, Honka dropped his candidacy, leaving Kekkonen with a clear majority (199 of 300 electors) in the 1962 elections. In addition to support from his own party, Kekkonen received the backing of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party and the Finnish People&#x27;s Party, a small classical liberal party. Furthermore, the conservative National Coalition Party quietly supported Kekkonen, although they had no official presidential candidate after Honka&#x27;s withdrawal. Following the Note Crisis, genuine opposition to Kekkonen disappeared, and he acquired an exceptionally strong—later even autocratic—status as the political leader of Finland.

Kekkonen&#x27;s policies, especially towards the USSR, were criticised within his own party by Veikko Vennamo, who broke off his Centre Party affiliation when Kekkonen was elected president in 1956. In 1959, Vennamo founded the Finnish Rural Party, the forerunner of the nationalist True Finns.

====Second term (1962–68)====
In the 1960s Kekkonen was responsible for a number of foreign-policy initiatives, including the Nordic nuclear-free zone proposal, a border agreement with Norway, and a 1969 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The purpose of these initiatives was to avoid the enforcement of the military articles in the Finno-Soviet Treaty which called for military co-operation with the Soviet Union. Kekkonen thereby hoped to strengthen Finland&#x27;s moves toward a policy of neutrality. Following the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, pressure for neutrality increased. Kekkonen informed the Soviet Union in 1970 that if it was no longer prepared to recognise Finland&#x27;s neutrality, he would not continue as president, nor would the Finno-Soviet Treaty be extended.

====Third term (1968–78)====
Kekkonen was re-elected for a third term in 1968. That year, he was supported by five political parties: the Centre Party, the Social Democrats, the Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders (a short-lived SDP faction), the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League (a communist front), and the Swedish People&#x27;s Party. He received 201 votes in the electoral college, whereas the National Coalition party&#x27;s candidate finished second with 66 votes. Vennamo came third with 33 votes. Although Kekkonen was re-elected with two-thirds of the vote, he was so displeased with his opponents and their behaviour that he publicly refused to stand for the presidency again. Vennamo&#x27;s bold and constant criticisms of his presidency and policies especially infuriated Kekkonen, who labelled him a &quot;cheat&quot; and &quot;demagogue&quot;.

Initially, Kekkonen had intended to retire at the end of this term, and the Centre Party already began to prepare for his succession by Ahti Karjalainen. However, Kekkonen began to see Karjalainen as a rival instead, and eventually rejected the idea.

====Term extension (1973)====


On 18 January 1973, the Finnish Parliament extended Kekkonen&#x27;s presidential term by four years with a Derogation law (an ad hoc law made as an exception to the constitution). By this time, Kekkonen had secured the backing of most political parties, but the major right-wing National Coalition Party, which Kekkonen had opposed, was still skeptical and stood in the way of the required 5/6 majority. Concurrently, Finland was negotiating a free-trade agreement with the EEC, a deal that was seen as vital by Finnish industry, as the United Kingdom, an important buyer of Finnish exports, had left the European Free Trade Association to become a member of the EEC. Kekkonen implied that only he personally could satisfy the Soviet Union that the deal would not threaten Soviet interests. The tactic secured National Coalition support for the term extension. The elimination of any significant opposition and competition meant he became Finland&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; political autocrat. His power reached its zenith in 1975 when he dissolved parliament and hosted the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki with the assistance of a caretaker government.

====Fourth term (1978–82)====
After nine political parties supported Kekkonen&#x27;s candidacy in the 1978 presidential election, including the Social Democratic, Centre and National Coalition parties, no serious rivals remained. He humiliated his opponents by not appearing in televised presidential debates and went on to win 259 out of the 300 electoral college votes, with his nearest rival, Raino Westerholm of the Christian Union, receiving only 25.

According to Finnish historians and political journalists, there were at least three reasons why Kekkonen clung on to the Presidency. First, he did not believe that any of his successor candidates would manage Finland&#x27;s Soviet foreign policy well enough. Second, until at least the summer of 1978, he considered there was room for improvement in Finnish-Soviet relations and that his experience was vital to the process. This is exemplified by the use of his diplomatic skills to reject the Soviet Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov&#x27;s offer to arrange a joined Soviet-Finnish military exercise.

Third, he believed that by working for as long as possible he would remain healthy and live longer. Kekkonen&#x27;s most severe critics, such as Veikko Vennamo, claimed that he remained President so long mainly because he and his closest associates were power-hungry. In 1980 Kekkonen was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize.

===Later life and death===


From December 1980 onwards, Kekkonen suffered from an undisclosed disease that appeared to affect his brain functions, sometimes leading to delusional thoughts. He had begun to suffer occasional brief memory lapses as early as the autumn of 1972; they became more frequent during the late 1970s. Around the same time, Kekkonen&#x27;s eyesight deteriorated so much that for his last few years in office, all of his official papers had to be typed in block letters. Kekkonen had also suffered from a failing sense of balance since the mid-1970s and from enlargement of his prostate gland since 1974. He was also subject to occasional violent headaches and suffered from diabetes from the autumn of 1979. Rumors about his declining health had begun to circulate in the mid to late 1970s, but the press attempted to silence these rumors to respect the president&#x27;s privacy.

According to biographer Juhani Suomi, Kekkonen gave no thought to resigning until his physical condition began to deteriorate in July 1981. The 80-year-old president then began to seriously consider resigning, most likely in early 1982. Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto finally dealt a defeat to Kekkonen in 1981. In April, Koivisto did what no one else had dared to during Kekkonen&#x27;s presidency by stating that under the constitution, the prime minister and cabinet were responsible to Parliament, not to the President. Kekkonen asked Koivisto to resign, but he refused. This is generally seen as the death knell of the Kekkonen era; Kekkonen, who felt that he had lost a significant amount of his authority, never fully recovered from the shock caused by this event.

Historians and journalists debate the precise meaning of this dispute. According to Seppo Zetterberg, Allan Tiitta, and Pekka Hyvärinen, Kekkonen wanted to force Koivisto to resign to decrease his chances of succeeding him as president. In contrast, Juhani Suomi believed the dispute involved scheming between Koivisto and rival prospective presidential candidates. Kekkonen at times criticised Koivisto for making political decisions too slowly and for his vacillation, especially for speaking too unclearly and philosophically.

Kekkonen became ill in August during a fishing trip to Iceland. He went on medical leave on 10 September, before finally resigning due to ill health on 26 October 1981. There is no report available about his illness, as the papers have been moved to an unknown location, but it is commonly believed that he suffered from vascular dementia, probably due to atherosclerosis.

Kekkonen withdrew from politics during his final years. He died at Tamminiemi on August 31, 1986, three days before his 86th birthday, and was buried with full honours. His heirs restricted access to his diaries and later an &quot;authorised&quot; biography by Juhani Suomi was commissioned, the author subsequently defending the interpretation of the history therein and denigrating most other interpretations. Critics have questioned the value of this work; the historian Hannu Rautkallio considered the biography little else than a &quot;commercial project&quot; designed for selling books rather than aiming for historical accuracy.

==Legacy==
Some of Kekkonen&#x27;s actions remain controversial in modern Finland, and disputes continue about how to interpret many of his policies and actions. He often used what was termed the &quot;Moscow card&quot; when his authority was threatened, but he was not the only Finnish politician with close relations to Soviet representatives. Kekkonen&#x27;s authoritarian behavior during his presidential term was one of the main reasons for the reforms of the Finnish Constitution in 1984–2003. Under these, the powers of Parliament and the prime minister were increased at the expense of presidential power. Several of the changes were initiated by Kekkonen&#x27;s successors.
* Presidential tenure was limited to two consecutive terms.
* The President&#x27;s role in cabinet formation was restricted.
* The President was to be elected directly, not by an electoral college.
* The President could no longer dissolve Parliament without the support of the Prime Minister.
* The Prime Minister&#x27;s role in shaping the foreign relations of Finland was enhanced.

Although controversial, his policy of neutrality allowed trade with both the Communist and Western blocs. The bilateral trade policy with the Soviet Union was lucrative for many Finnish businesses. His term saw a period of high sustained economic growth and increasing integration with the West. He negotiated entrance into EFTA and thus was an early beginner for Finnish participation in European integration, which later culminated in full membership in the EU and the euro. He remained highly popular during his term, even though such a profile approached that of a cult of personality towards the end of his term. He is still popular among many of his contemporaries, particularly in his own Centre Party.

The series of Finnish Markka banknotes used at this time was the second-to-last design series in the entire history of the currency. It is a rare example of a living non-royal head of state being depicted on currency. This banknote was declared Finland&#x27;s most beautiful note according to voting organised by the commemorative coins and medal marketer Suomen Moneta on 1 April 2011.
* To date, President Kekkonen is the only Finnish person to have a collector coin issued in his honour during his lifetime.
** 25 years of presidency (Silver jubilee) of U. K. Kekkonen. The silver collector&#x27;s coin that pays homage to Kekkonen was issued in 1981 when he had served 25 years as the president. The coin also commemorated Kekkonen&#x27;s 80th birthday the previous year. Designed by sculptor Nina Terno, the symbolic reverse side of the coin depicts a ploughman with a pair of horses pulling a harrow. In 2010, the Mint of Finland is re-released coins minted in 1981 from its vaults.
** President U. K. Kekkonen 75th Birthday. The silver coin was issued on Kekkonen&#x27;s birthday on 3 September 1975 to commemorate the president&#x27;s 75th birthday.

==In popular culture==

===Film and television===
* The vote count from the 1978 elections was broadcast on the radio, and has been shown numerous times in television documentaries. The monotonous reading out of the votes, in groups of five, is still well-recognised in Finnish popular culture, and broadly quoted and paraphrased; &quot;Kekkonen, Kekkonen, Kekkonen, Kekkonen, Kekkonen.&quot; 
* A portrait of Kekkonen is stolen by the protagonist of the 1988 Aki Kaurismäki film &quot;Ariel&quot;. A Kekkonen portrait is also used in his 1987 film &quot;Hamlet Goes Business&quot;.
* In the 1987 thriller film &quot;Farewell, Mr. President&quot;, directed by Matti Kassila, one of the most important characters is the president of Finland (played by Tarmo Manni) who has very similar look to Kekkonen, but who is not referred to by name.
* A Finnish movie, &quot;Kekkonen tulee!&quot; (Kekkonen Is Coming!), set in the late 1970s, is about Kekkonen visiting a small village in Finland and how everyone is excited.
* A Vril Kekkonen is portrayed by Tero Kaukomaa in the movie &quot;Iron Sky: The Coming Race&quot;
* In the 2019 Finnish television series &quot;&quot; (&quot;Nyrkki&quot;), Kekkonen appears as a character with J. K. Paasikivi. In the series Kekkonen is played by Janne Reinikainen.

===Other media===
* The North American Finnish invention Saint Urho, created in the 1950s, is likely named after Kekkonen
* The name of the Finnish men&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Urkki&quot;, was a reference to Urho Kekkonen.
* Matti Hagelberg uses a caricature of Kekkonen as the main character in his comic album with the same name.
* A likeness of Kekkonen in portrait is available as a placeable furniture item in the popular online game &quot;Habbo&quot;, which serves as an homage to him by the games&#x27; Finnish developers Sulake.

The university&#x27;s interdisciplinary research targets life sciences, pathways to sustainability, dynamics of youth, and institutions for open societies. Its teaching and research are strongly connected where equality, diversity, and inclusion are valued. Utrecht University counts a number of distinguished scholars among its alumni and faculty, including 12 Nobel Prize, 1 Pulitzer Prize, 2 Wolf Prize, 2 National Medal of Science, 21 Spinoza Prize and 3 Stevin Prize laureates. The university counts several heads of state and government amongst its graduates, including: 4 members of Dutch royal house, 6 Prime Ministers of the Netherlands, a signatory to the United States Constitution Hugh Williamson, 1 Prime Minister of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 4 foreign heads of state or government, and 35 Ministers of the Cabinet of the Netherlands.

==History==

Utrecht University was founded on 26 March 1636. It has its roots in the Illustrious School of Utrecht, which founded two years earlier in 1634 before being elevated to the status of university in 1636. The influential professor of theology Gisbertus Voetius delivered the inaugural speech, and Bernardus Schotanus (professor of law and mathematics) became the university&#x27;s first rector magnificus. Anna Maria van Schurman, who became the university&#x27;s first female student, was invited to write a Latin poem for the inauguration. Initially, only a few dozen students attended classes at the university. Seven professors worked in four faculties: philosophy, which offered all students an introductory education, and three higher-level faculties (theology, medicine and law).

Utrecht University flourished in the seventeenth century, and contributed significantly to the Dutch Golden Age, despite competition with the older universities, such as Leiden (1575) and Groningen (1614). Leiden, in particular, proved a strong competitor and made further improvement necessary; a rivalry that persists to this day. A botanical garden was built on the grounds of the present Sonnenborgh Observatory, and three years later the Smeetoren added an astronomical observatory. The university attracted many students from abroad (especially from Germany, England and Scotland). They witnessed the intellectual and theological battle fought between proponents of the new philosophy (René Descartes lived for a few years in Utrecht) and proponents of the strict Reformed theologian Voetius. They also witnessed the teachings of renowned Dutch jurist, Johannes Voet, a university alumnus and professor of law, whose works remain highly authoritative in modern Roman-Dutch law.

In 1806, the French occupying authorities of the Netherlands downgraded Utrecht University to an &quot;école secondaire&quot; (high school), but after the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813 it regained its former status. Leiden, Leuven, Groningen, Utrecht and Ghent were the five universities () of the new state. Two of the universities (Leuven and Ghent) became part of the new Belgian state after their respective provinces separated from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830. As a result, Utrecht University remained one of only three Dutch universities. During the French occupation, King Louis Napoleon ordered the construction of a palace in the centre of Utrecht, which eventually became the University Library City Centre.

Utrecht University played a prominent role in the golden age of Dutch science. Around 1850 the &quot;Utrechtian School&quot; of science formed, with Pieter Harting, Gerardus J. Mulder, Christophorus H. D. Buys Ballot and Franciscus Donders among the leading scientists. They introduced the educational laboratory (&quot;onderwijslaboratorium&quot;) as a practical learning place for their students. The National Veterinary School (Dutch:&quot;Rijks Veeartsenijschool&quot;) became Utrecht University&#x27;s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1918.

As the university grew, the academic buildings in the historic city centre were unable to meet the university&#x27;s increasing need for space. Therefore, starting from the 1960s, a significant part of the university moved to the De Uithof campus, which occupies the easternmost part of the city and is located south of De Bilt. However, the university continued to retain its academic buildings and presence in the historic city centre.

The university is represented in the &quot;Stichting Academisch Erfgoed&quot;, a foundation with the goal of preserving the university&#x27;s heritage and collections.

==Organisation==
The university consists of seven faculties, which offer 58 undergraduate degree programmes and over 150 graduate programmes.

There are also three interfaculty units:
*University College Utrecht
*University College Roosevelt
*Centre for Education and Learning (COLUU)

==Campus==

The two large faculties of Humanities and Law &amp; Governance are situated in the inner city of Utrecht. The other five faculties and most of the administrative services are located in Utrecht Science Park De Uithof, a campus area on the outskirts of the city. University College Utrecht, along with the Utrecht School of Economics, are situated in the former Kromhout Kazerne, which used to be a Dutch military base. University College Roosevelt is located off-campus in the city of Middelburg in the south-west of the Netherlands.

<doc id="32054" wikidata="Q835545" url="?curid=32054" title="Union for Europe of the Nations">
<text>Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) was a national-conservative, Eurosceptic political group that operated in the European Parliament between 1999 and 2009. At its height in February 2008, it had 44 MEPs. UEN was affiliated with the Alliance for Europe of the Nations political party.

UEN was formed as the successor of the Union for Europe group. Its members were parties such as the Rally for France, Italian National Alliance and Lega Nord, Irish Fianna Fáil, and Polish Law and Justice. After the 2009 European Parliament election, UEN was dissolved due to its member parties opting to switch to other groups.

==History==
UEN was formed on 20 July 1999 for the 5th European Parliament, supplanting the earlier Union for Europe. Its member parties Fianna Fáil (FF) and the National Alliance (AN) were the driving forces behind the group, despite their being alone in the group in their support for the proposed European Constitution. Gianfranco Fini, leader of AN, was a member of the Convention which drafted the Constitution, while Bertie Ahern, leader of FF, negotiated the treaty as President of the European Council in 2004.

UEN was a heterogeneous group: broadly Eurosceptic and national-conservative, it included some parties which were either uncomfortable with this characterisation or eventually evolved into something different. More specifically, FF was a &quot;catch all&quot; centre-right party and later joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, AN was a conservative party which eventually joined the European People&#x27;s Party through The People of Freedom, and Lega Nord was supportive of a &quot;Europe of Regions&quot;.

After the 2009 European elections the group officially had 35 members but this figure included parties such as AN and FF, which had already committed to leave. UEN members migrated to other groups after the elections in June 2009 and before the Seventh European Parliament term started on 14 July 2009. FF had already left for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group, For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK and Law and Justice MEPs went to the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group), and Lega Nord, the Danish People&#x27;s Party and Order and Justice MEPs went to Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) Group. With this loss of members, the UEN group was dissolved by default.

Organs under the domain of urology include the kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and the male reproductive organs (testes, epididymides, vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles, prostate, and penis).

The urinary and reproductive tracts are closely linked, and disorders of one often affect the other. Thus a major spectrum of the conditions managed in urology exists under the domain of genitourinary disorders. Urology combines the management of medical (i.e., non-surgical) conditions, such as urinary-tract infections and benign prostatic hyperplasia, with the management of surgical conditions such as bladder or prostate cancer, kidney stones, congenital abnormalities, traumatic injury, and stress incontinence.

Urological techniques include minimally invasive robotic and laparoscopic surgery, laser-assisted surgeries, and other scope-guided procedures. Urologists receive training in open and minimally invasive surgical techniques, employing real-time ultrasound guidance, fiber-optic endoscopic equipment, and various lasers in the treatment of multiple benign and malignant conditions. Urology is closely related to (and urologists often collaborate with the practitioners of) oncology, nephrology, gynaecology, andrology, pediatric surgery, colorectal surgery, gastroenterology, and endocrinology.

Urology is one of the most competitive and highly sought surgical specialties for physicians, with new urologists comprising less than 1.5% of United States medical-school graduates each year.

Urologists are physicians which have specialized in the field after completing their general degree in medicine. Upon successful completion of a residency program, many urologists choose to undergo further advanced training in a subspecialty area of expertise through a fellowship lasting an additional 12 to 36 months. Subspecialties may include: urologic surgery, urologic oncology and urologic oncological surgery, endourology and endourologic surgery, urogynecology and urogynecologic surgery, reconstructive urologic surgery (a form of reconstructive surgery), minimally-invasive urologic surgery, pediatric urology and pediatric urologic surgery (including adolescent urology, the treatment of premature or delayed puberty, and the treatment of congenital urological syndromes, malformations, and deformations), transplant urology (the field of transplant medicine and surgery concerned with transplantation of organs such as the kidneys, bladder tissue, ureters, and, recently, penises), voiding dysfunction, paruresis, neurourology, and androurology and sexual medicine. Additionally, some urologists supplement their fellowships with a master&#x27;s degree (2–3 years) or with a Ph.D. (4–6 years) in related topics to prepare them for academic as well as focused clinical employment.

==Training==
===United States===
As of 2022, there are 146 residency programs that offered 356 categorical positions. Urology is one of the early match programs, with results given to applicants by early February (6 weeks before NRMP match). Applications are accepted starting Sep 1, with some programs accepting applications until early Jan.

It is a relatively competitive specialty to match into, with only 65.6% of US seniors matching in the 2022 match cycle. The number of positions has grown from 278 in 2012 to 356 in 2022. Matching is significantly more difficult for IMGs and students who have a year or more off before residency - match rates were 27% and 55% respectively in 2012.

The medical school environment may also be a factor. A study in 2012 also showed after an analysis of match rates from schools between 2005 and 2009 that 20 schools sent more than 15 students into urology (1 standard deviation above the median), with Northwestern University sending 44 students over those five years.

After urology residency, there are seven subspecialties recognized by the AUA (American Urological Association):
* Oncology
* Calculi
* Female Urology
* Infertility
* Pediatrics
* Transplant (renal)
* Neurourology.

=== Australia ===
Training is completed through the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS). The program requires six years of full-time training (for those who commenced prior to 2016), or five years for those who commenced after 2016. The program is accredited by the Australian Medical Council.

===Nepal===

In Nepal, the formal urologist degree awarded is MCh (Magister Chirurgiae). This is a three years course post masters and includes thesis and a mandatory publication. This degree is awarded after completing MBBS (four and half year plus a one-year rotatory internship) and MS (Mastery of surgery) in general surgery (three years course). Till now two universities Tribhuvan University and Kathmandu University as well as two Autonomous institutes BP Koirala Institute of health sciences and National Academy of Medical Sciences (Bir Hospital) run the MCh Urology programme. This degree is equivalent to Clinical PhD and called as &quot;Chikitsa Bidhyabaridhi&quot; by Tribhuvan University (Government University) and is considered to be the highest degree among the surgical discipline degrees.

===Ethiopia===
In Ethiopia, in 2001, there were only five qualified urologists. All trained abroad, in countries like India, Tanzania and Hungary. Before this chapter all urology cases were managed by general surgeons. The only urological unit in the country was at Tikur Anbessa Tertiary Hospital. The services provided included ESWL and endo-urology. The urology training program was started in 2009 with a curriculum for general surgeons which had a three-year training program. Up to 2019, six urologists have graduated by this program for general surgeons. The first residency program started accepting general practitioners in 2010 for a five-year program. The first two years were trainings in general surgery, the next three years were dedicated urology training program, which included the same three-year training as of the general surgeons three year curriculum. It started with two residents who graduated in 2015 with a certificate in specialty of urology. Up to 2019, seventeen urologists have graduated from this five-year residency program. From the start these programs in 2009 up to 2019, a total of 23 urologists have been trained in Tikur Anbessa Tertioary Hospital. As of 2020, there were 26 trainees in the programme. All of the urologists who graduated from Tikur Anbessa Tertioary Hospital were as of 2020 working in different parts of the country.

==Subdisciplines==
As a medical discipline that involves the care of many organs and physiological systems, urology can be broken down into several subdisciplines. At many larger academic centers and university hospitals that excel in patient care and clinical research, urologists often specialize in a particular sub discipline.

===Endourology===
Endourology is the branch of urology that deals with the closed manipulation of the urinary tract. It has lately grown to include all minimally invasive urologic surgical procedures. As opposed to open surgery, endourology is performed using small cameras and instruments inserted into the urinary tract. Transurethral surgery has been the cornerstone of endourology. Most of the urinary tract can be reached via the urethra, enabling prostate surgery, surgery of tumors of the urothelium, stone surgery, and simple urethral and ureteral procedures. Recently, the addition of laparoscopy and robotics has further subdivided this branch of urology.

===Laparoscopy===
Laparoscopy is a rapidly evolving branch of urology and has replaced some open surgical procedures. Robot-assisted surgery of the prostate, kidney, and ureter has been expanding this field. Today, many prostatectomies in the United States are carried out by so-called robotic assistance. This has created controversy, however, as robotics greatly increase the cost of surgery and the benefit for the patient may or may not be proportional to the extra cost. Moreover, current (2011) market situation for robotic equipment is a de facto monopoly of one publicly held corporation which further fuels the cost-effectiveness controversy.

===Urologic oncology===
Urologic oncology concerns the surgical treatment of malignant genitourinary diseases such as cancer of the prostate, adrenal glands, bladder, kidneys, ureters, testicles, and penis, as well as the skin and subcutaneous tissue and muscle and fascia of those areas (that particular subspecialty overlaps with dermatological oncology and related areas of oncology). The treatment of genitourinary cancer is managed by either a urologist or an oncologist, depending on the treatment type (surgical or medical). Most urologic oncologists in Western countries use minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopy or endourology, robotic-assisted surgery) to manage urologic cancers amenable to surgical management.

===Neurourology===
Neurourology concerns nervous system control of the genitourinary system, and of conditions causing abnormal urination. Neurological diseases and disorders such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and spinal cord injury can disrupt the lower urinary tract and result in conditions such as urinary incontinence, detrusor overactivity, urinary retention, and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. Urodynamic studies play an important diagnostic role in neurourology. Therapy for nervous system disorders includes clean intermittent self-catheterization of the bladder, anticholinergic drugs, injection of Botulinum toxin into the bladder wall and advanced and less commonly used therapies such as sacral neuromodulation.
Less marked neurological abnormalities can cause urological disorders as well—for example, abnormalities of the sensory nervous system are thought by many researchers to play a role in disorders of painful or frequent urination (e.g. painful bladder syndrome also known as interstitial cystitis).

===Pediatric urology===

Pediatric urology concerns urologic disorders in children. Such disorders include cryptorchidism (undescended testes), congenital abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, enuresis, underdeveloped genitalia (due to delayed growth or delayed puberty, often an endocrinological problem), and vesicoureteral reflux.

===Andrology===

Andrology is the medical specialty that deals with male health, particularly relating to the problems of the male reproductive system and urological problems that are unique to men such as prostate cancer, male fertility problems, and surgery of the male reproductive system. It is the counterpart to gynaecology, which deals with medical issues that are specific to female health, especially reproductive and urologic health.

===Reconstructive urology===
Reconstructive urology is a highly specialized field of male urology that restores both structure and function to the genitourinary tract. Prostate procedures, full or partial hysterectomies, trauma (auto accidents, gunshot wounds, industrial accidents, straddle injuries, etc.), disease, obstructions, blockages (e.g., urethral strictures), and occasionally, childbirth, can necessitate reconstructive surgery. The urinary bladder, ureters (the tubes that lead from the kidneys to the urinary bladder) and genitalia are other examples of reconstructive urology.

===Female urology===

Female urology is a branch of urology dealing with overactive bladder, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence. Many of these physicians also practice neurourology and reconstructive urology as mentioned above. Female urologists (many of whom are men) complete a 1–3-year fellowship after completion of a 5–6-year urology residency. Thorough knowledge of the female pelvic floor together with intimate understanding of the physiology and pathology of voiding are necessary to diagnose and treat these disorders. Depending on the cause of the individual problem, a medical or surgical treatment can be the solution. Their field of practice heavily overlaps with that of urogynecologists, physicians in a sub-discipline of gynecology, who have done a three-year fellowship after a four-year OBGYN residency.

==Journals and organizations==
There are a number of peer-reviewed journals and publications about urology, including &quot;The Journal of Urology&quot;, &quot;European Urology&quot;, the &quot;African Journal of Urology&quot;, &quot;British Journal of Urology International&quot;, &quot;BMC Urology&quot;, Indian Journal of Urology&quot;, &quot;Nature Reviews Urology&quot;, and &quot;Urology&quot;.

There are national organizations such as the American Urological Association, the American Association of Clinical Urologists, European Association of Urology, the Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA), and The Society for Basic Urologic Research. Urology is also included under the auspices of the International Continence Society.

Teaching organizations include the European Board of Urology, as well as the Vattikuti Urology Institute in Detroit, which also hosts an annual International Robotic Urology Symposium devoted to new technologies. The American non-profit IVUMed teaches urology in developing countries.

It enrolls around 3,000 students and offers distance education programs that include centers in the U.S., an online program, an independent study program, and formerly had centers in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.

Upper Iowa offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs with 29 undergraduate majors, including art, business, conservation management, education, human services, information technology, liberal arts, math, nursing, psychology, science, and 6 graduate programs. It operates on two eight-week terms per semester, allowing students to take two classes per term. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

UIU is the only NCAA Division II Athletics Program in the state of Iowa and a member of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC).

==History==

In 1854, Elizabeth Alexander, a pioneer living near what is now Fayette, Iowa, proposed the idea of a college to her husband, Robert, who donated $10,000 toward the cause. Their son-in-law, Samuel Robertson, donated $5,000 and of land. In 1856, the first Board of Trustees meeting was held; articles of Incorporation were adopted; and classes began January 7, 1857. The university was affiliated with the Methodist Church until 1928.

In 1861, a company of male students and faculty members enlisted in the Army to fight in the American Civil War. Student-soldiers participated in 17 major battles, carrying a flag hand-sewn by UIU women students. In 1917, UIU male students joined the armed forces during World War I, while women students organized American Red Cross classes on campus; the UIU gym became a barracks, and the athletic field was the scene of military drills. By 1920, a systematic program of extension work throughout northeast Iowa had begun, with Upper Iowa referred to as &quot;a pioneer in the field.&quot; Those students who joined the service to fight in World War II took advantage of the G.I. Bill to complete their education, which dramatically increased Upper Iowa enrollment between 1947 and 1950. Record enrollments were also seen after the Vietnam War (1952–1970).

In 1972, Upper Iowa launched an external degree program that included Independent Study and Online Programs. In 1978, Darcy C. Coyle was named president, a post in which he served until 1984, when he became President Emeritus.

In 1984 to present, UIU expanded to open locations across the U.S. Upper Iowa was approved by the Higher Learning Commission to offer graduate degrees in 1995, and in 1999 started its International Program by establishing centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
It was also during 1994 to 2003 that UIU underwent an aggressive landscaping and building renovation that brought changes to its Fayette campus. This included the construction of Lee Tower Residence Halls, the acquisition of a new physical plant building and the construction of a recreation center. In 2004, the new Andres Center for Business and Education was built, and Alan G. Walker was appointed the 20th president of the university. During summer 2009, the largest capital improvement project broke ground on the Fayette campus — $75 million — which will include a new student center, suite-style housing, and a Liberal Arts academic building.

In May 2023, in response to a worsening financial situation, the university cut its academic programs in sociology, information systems, information technology, intensive English and sports administration, several of its sports programs and two of its satellite campuses. The university&#x27;s accreditor issued a public disclosure notice to warn the public about the university&#x27;s financial distress.

==UIU Campus and town of Fayette==
Upper Iowa&#x27;s traditional residential campus is in Fayette, Iowa; a small town of 1,200 residents in the county of the same name, in far northeast Iowa. In 1984, the former Fayette Community School District merged with the larger North Fayette County Community Schools, headquartered in the nearby county seat town of West Union. In 2018, North Fayette itself merged with the Valley Community School District, to form the North Fayette Valley Community Schools, leaving Fayette with neither an elementary nor a secondary school. Consequently, Fayette is one of the few communities in the nation with a university but no public school within its boundaries.

The Fayette campus is primarily for undergraduate students, but a master&#x27;s degree in education is also offered, along with two-week IXEL classes in the summer. Students can choose from 40 majors, with the most popular being Elementary Education and Teaching, Marketing/Marketing Management, General, and Natural Resources/Conservation. The Pleggenkuhle Prairie, donated by the Pleggenkuhle family to UIU, is of virgin prairie northwest of Hawkeye. It is used as a teaching tool for students to learn about the prairie ecosystem and to conduct prescribed burns and research projects at the site.

<text>Unitarian Universalism (otherwise referred to as UUism or UU) is a liberal religious movement characterized by a &quot;free and responsible search for truth and meaning&quot;. Unitarian Universalists assert no creed, but instead are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth. Unitarian Universalists do not have an official, unified corpus of sacred texts. Unitarian Universalist congregations include many atheists, agnostics, deists, and theists; there are churches, fellowships, congregations, and societies around the world.

The roots of Unitarian Universalism can be traced back to Protestantism and liberal Christianity; more specifically, it can be traced to Unitarianism and Christian Universalism. Unitarian Universalists state that from these traditions comes a deep regard for intellectual freedom and inclusive love. Congregations and members seek inspiration and derive insight from all major world religions. The beliefs of individual Unitarian Universalists range widely; they can include, but are not limited to, religious humanism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Taoism, syncretism, neopaganism, atheism, agnosticism, New Age, omnism, pantheism, panentheism, pandeism, deism, and teachings of the Baháʼí Faith.

The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) was formed in 1961 through the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association, established in 1825, and the Universalist Church of America, established in 1793. The UUA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and serves churches mostly in the United States. A group of thirty Philippine congregations is represented as a sole member within the UUA. The Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC) became an independent body in 2002. The UUA and CUC were two of the seventeen members of the now defunct International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (1995–2021).

==History==

===Puritan roots and Congregationalist background===


Unitarian Universalism was formed from the consolidation in 1961 of two historically separate Christian denominations, the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association, both based in the United States; the new organization formed in this merger was the Unitarian Universalist Association. At the time of the North American consolidation, Unitarians and Universalists diverged beyond their roots in liberal Christian theology. They draw from a variety of religious traditions. Individuals may or may not self-identify as Christians or subscribe to Christian beliefs. Unitarian Universalist congregations and fellowships tend to retain some Christian traditions, such as Sunday worship with a sermon and the singing of hymns. The extent to which the elements of any particular faith tradition are incorporated into personal spiritual practice is a matter of individual choice for congregants, in keeping with a creedless, non-dogmatic approach to spirituality and faith development.

New England Unitarians evolved from the Pilgrim Fathers&#x27; Congregational Christianity, which was based on a literal reading of the Bible. Liberalizing Unitarians rejected the Trinitarian belief in the tri-personal godhead: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost/Spirit. Instead, they asserted a unitary notion of God. In addition, they rejected the doctrine of original sin, moving away from the Calvinism of the Congregationalists.

New England Universalists rejected the Puritan forefathers&#x27; emphasis on the select few, the Elect, who were supposed to be saved from eternal damnation by a just God. Instead Universalists asserted that all people will eventually be reconciled with God.

===Universalism===
Universalists claim a long history, beginning with several Church Fathers, though some modern scholars question whether these church fathers taught the defining doctrine of Universalism (universal salvation).

This core doctrine asserts that through Christ every single human soul shall be saved, leading to the &quot;restitution of all things&quot; (apocatastasis). In 1793, Universalism emerged as a distinct denomination of Christianity in the United States, eventually called the Universalist Church of America. Early American advocates of universal salvation such as Elhanan Winchester, Hosea Ballou and John Murray taught that all souls would achieve salvation, sometimes after a period resembling purgatory. Christian Universalism denies the doctrine of everlasting damnation, and proclaims belief in an entirely loving God who will ultimately redeem all human beings.

===Unitarianism===
According to Spanish physician, Michael Servetus, he studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books &quot;On the Errors of the Trinity&quot; and &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot; caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in Geneva in 1553.

The term &quot;Unitarian&quot; entered the English language via Henry Hedworth, who applied it to the teachings of Laelio Sozzini and the Polish Socinians. Unitarian churches were formally established in Transylvania and Poland (by the Socinians) in the second half of the 16th century. There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see Edict of Torda) under the jurisdiction of John Sigismund, King of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the pre-existence of Christ as well as, in many cases, predestination and original sin as put forward by Augustine of Hippo, and the substitutionary atonement of Christ developed by Anselm of Canterbury and John Calvin. There were several different forms of Christology in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became psilanthropism: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.

====Great Britain====

Influenced by the Socinian doctrine of the Polish Brethren, the Unitarian minister Samuel Clarke (1675–1729) revised the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, removing the Trinitarian Nicene Creed and references to Jesus as God. Theophilus Lindsey also revised the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the Blasphemy Act 1697 that made it an &quot;offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity&quot;. The Act of Toleration (1689) gave relief to English Dissenters, but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the Church of England. In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the Essex House as a &quot;Dissenting place of worship&quot; with the assistance of barrister John Lee. On the Sunday following the registration—April 17, 1774—the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel. In attendance were Lee, Joseph Priestley and the agent of the Massachusetts Colony, Benjamin Franklin. Priestley also founded a reform congregation, but, after his home was burned down in the Priestley Riots, fled with his wife to America, where he became a leading figure in the founding of the church on American soil.

Once laity and clergy relaxed their vehement opposition to the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, which finally allowed for protections of dissenting religions, the British and Foreign Unitarian Association was founded in 1825. It has its headquarters in Essex Hall, successor to Lindsey&#x27;s Essex House. Two that have been significant in national life are the Cross Street Chapel in Manchester and, Newington Green Unitarian Church in north London. Unitarian congregations in Britain meet under the auspices of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. There are 170 communities of Unitarians across Britain. The Chief Officer of the British Unitarians was Liz Slade as of 2024.

====United States====

In the United States, the Unitarian movement began primarily in the Congregational parish churches of New England, which were part of the state church of Massachusetts. These churches, whose buildings may still be seen in many New England town squares, trace their roots to the division of the Puritan colonies into parishes for the administration of their religious needs. In the late 18th century, conflict grew within some of these churches between Unitarian and Trinitarian factions. In 1805, Unitarians gained key faculty positions at Harvard. In 1819 William Ellery Channing preached the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in Baltimore, outlining the Unitarian position. The American Unitarian Association was founded as a separate denomination in 1825.
By coincidence and unknown to both parties, the AUA was formed on the same day—May 26, 1825—as the British and Foreign Unitarian Association.

In the 19th century, under the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson (who had been a Unitarian minister) and other transcendentalists, Unitarianism began its long journey from liberal Protestantism to its more pluralist form.

===Integration, 1825–1961===
After the schism in the Congregational Churches resulting in the foundation (1825) of the American Unitarian Association, some of those churches remained within the Congregational fold and became member congregations of the Congregational organization (later the United Church of Christ), while others voted to become Unitarian. Some of the latter eventually became part of the Unitarian Universalist Association (formed in 1961) during a consolidation of the Unitarian and Universalist churches. Universalist churches in contrast followed a different path, having begun as independent congregations beyond the bounds of the established Puritan churches entirely. The UUA and the United Church of Christ cooperate jointly on social justice initiatives such as the Sexuality Education Advocacy Training project.

In 1961 the American Unitarian Association (AUA) was consolidated with the Universalist Church of America (UCA), thus forming the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). In the same year, the Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC) formed. The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) was given corporate status in May 1961 under special acts of legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York.

In 1998 the Canadian Unitarian Council and Unitarian Universalist Association dissolved their financial accord, although they continue to cooperate. The CUC had come into being at Meadville Lombard Theological School in 1961. However the continual decline of denominational churches and the almost complete failure of the Universalist movement in Canada had caused the formation of the Council to prompt a plan to merge with the UUA. Opposition to Liberal religious freedom relaxed, so that by 2002 it was agreed to increase autonomy and funding. The amalgamation proved troublesome for the Canadians, a small minority largely ignored, with only 45 congregations and 5,200 members—the Americans were insensitive to cultural differences.

==Beliefs and practices==
===Diversity of beliefs and scriptures===
Unitarian Universalism is a religion marked by freedom, reason, and acceptance. As such, Unitarian Universalists practice a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in any particular belief or doctrine. Rather than sharing common beliefs, Unitarian Universalists are united by a common history, the affirmation of each person&#x27;s individual spiritual quest, and a covenant to uphold the community&#x27;s shared spiritual values. As such, Unitarian Universalists vary greatly in their beliefs, and a plurality of beliefs often defines Unitarian Universalist congregations.

Unitarian Universalists are encouraged to engage in their own unique spiritual journey and to follow their conscience in their beliefs. Unitarian Universalism is seen as compatible with other spiritual paths, and individual Unitarian Universalists are encouraged to engage in their own spiritual journey, whatever the path. Unitarian Universalists are not required to renounce previous faith traditions to join a Unitarian Universalist congregation. As a result, individual practitioners may simultaneously identify as Unitarian Universalists and other faith traditions.

Although Unitarian Universalism draws its roots from Christian sources, contemporary Unitarian Universalists in North America view their religion as multifaith and drawing on a variety of sources, both religious and secular. Unitarian Universalism encourages its members to draw on the world&#x27;s religions as well as the words and deeds of prophetic people as inspiration for their spiritual journeys. Although members are cautioned to be aware of possible cultural appropriation of traditions that do not belong to them, Unitarian Universalists are encouraged to find wisdom in a diverse spectrum of religions, customs, and cultures from around the world.

===Humanism and beliefs about divinity===
Although the predecessors of Unitarian Universalism, Unitarianism and Universalism, find their origin in unorthodox beliefs about the nature of the Christian God, modern Unitarian Universalists hold a variety of views about the nature and existence of deity. Most Unitarian Universalist congregations take no formal stance on whether or not a god or gods exist but leave it up to individual members to decide for themselves what they believe. Unitarian Universalists may be atheists, agnostics, and theists. Among those Unitarian Universalists who use language of divinity, both monotheism and polytheism are common, and Unitarian Universalists hold a variety of beliefs about the nature of the divine.

The diversity of beliefs about divinity in Unitarian Universalism can be accounted for because of the influence of religious humanism on the movement in the late nineteenth century. Although Unitarian Universalists believe that anyone can be a Humanist, regardless of their position on the use of the language of divinity, the rise of religious humanism within Unitarian Universalism enables members to be able to further question the existence and nature of the divine through its encouragement towards reason. Fifteen of the thirty-four signers of Humanist Manifesto I were Unitarians and one was a Universalist. Unitarian Universalists were also a significant presence among the signers of Humanist Manifestos II and III.

Today, the majority of Unitarian Universalists in North America identify as Humanists. Although Humanism is seen as an evolving philosophy where the limits of science and reason are recognized, its tenets continue to play a large role in the thought of Unitarian Universalist congregations. Unitarian Universalist Humanists hold that the naturalism of their Humanism encourages individuals to recognize the awe, beauty, and wonder of the natural world and recognize the interdependence between humans and other beings.

===Covenant===
In the absence of shared beliefs, Unitarian Universalists often see their religion as a covenantal (as opposed to a creedal) one. Unitarian Universalists see covenants as the promises that bind congregations, communities, and individuals together in a community. In Unitarian Universalism, covenants are mutual promises among individuals and communities about how they will behave and engage with each other. Covenants help create trust and care among Unitarian Universalists and in their congregations.

Rather than creating things people have to do, covenants in Unitarian Universalist communities create freedom by helping members know what to expect from each other. In the words of Unitarian Universalist minister Alice Blair Wesley:

The use of covenants in the Unitarian Universalist community dates back to 1646 and the creation of the Cambridge Platform by the Congregational churches of colonial New England, some of whom would later become Unitarians, predecessors of modern Unitarian Universalists. The Platform was the first formal declaration of the principles of church order and governance in colonial North America. Today, many Unitarian Universalist congregations create their own covenants, often called covenants of right relations, to lay out the principles of their congregations formally.

===Principles===
In the United States, members of the Unitarian Universalist Association covenanted together via the seven Principles and Purposes, a part of Article II of the Unitarian Universalist Association&#x27;s bylaws. These Principles and Purposes were statements of shared values that Unitarian Universalist congregations agreed to uphold:
These principles, first adopted in 1960 and later revised in 1984 and 1985, proved so popular that many Unitarian Universalists came to see them as a wisdom source in and of themselves and a guide for participation in Unitarian Universalist congregations.

In June 2024, the UU General Assembly voted to replace the 7 principles in Article II of the UUA bylaws with a new covenant of 6 values, centered on Love.

In Canada, members of the Canadian Unitarian Council affirm the seven principles along with an eighth principle: &quot;Individual and communal action that accountably dismantles racism and systemic barriers to full inclusion in ourselves and our institutions.&quot;

In the Philippines, where Unitarian Universalism is much more theistically oriented, member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines affirm the seven principles, but with the addition of their own first principle: &quot;There is God. God is love.&quot;

===Justice===
Unitarian Universalism believes that actions taken to make the world a better place are more important than what a person actually believes, as espoused by a common slogan in Unitarian Universalist congregations, &quot;Deeds, not creeds.&quot; They hold that belief divorced from action does not change the world and that good intentions often lead to a worse situation in the long term. Unitarian Universalist thinkers have long recognized the need to bring belief and action together and encourage their members to go into the larger world and improve it.

Because of this importance of action, Unitarian Universalists have long been involved in social, economic, and environmental justice movements, both through organizations created by Unitarian Universalists and through local, regional, national, and international grassroots organizing. Many Unitarian Universalists see this work as inseparable from their Unitarian Universalist faith and see their participation in justice movements as a deeply important part of their religious faith.

Historically, the Unitarian Universalist Association&#x27;s predecessor movements, Unitarianism and Universalism, saw members involved in abolitionism, women&#x27;s suffrage, pacifism, temperance, and prison reform. Today, Unitarian Universalists are deeply involved in causes such as racial justice and the Black Lives Matter movement, LGBTQ movements, feminism and women&#x27;s rights, immigration justice, reproductive rights, climate justice, and economic inequality.

==Worship and practices==
===Diversity of practices===
The Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish Seder, Yom Kippur and Passover dinners, &quot;iftaar&quot; meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/Winter Solstice services. Children&#x27;s and youth&#x27;s religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a Hindu temple, a Reform or Orthodox synagogue, and a Catholic church.

There is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.

===Diversity of congregations===
There is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves &quot;churches&quot;, &quot;societies&quot;, &quot;fellowships&quot;, &quot;congregations&quot;, or eschew the use of any particular descriptor. Many use the name &quot;Unitarian Universalist&quot;, (and a few &quot;Universalist Unitarian&quot;), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation &quot;Unitarian&quot; or &quot;Universalist&quot; (e.g. &quot;First Unitarian Church&quot;). A few congregations use neither (e.g. Unity Temple). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word &quot;church&quot; indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation&#x27;s lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as &quot;fellowship&quot; and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).

Also of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey), reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.

===Elevator speeches===
In 2004, &quot;UU World&quot; magazine asked for contributions of &quot;elevator speeches&quot; explaining Unitarian Universalism. These are short speeches that could be made in the course of an elevator ride to those who knew nothing of the religion. Here are examples of the speeches submitted:



==Worship and ritual==
As in theology, Unitarian Universalist worship and ritual are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols. In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a Protestant church, but they vary widely among congregations.

===Symbols===
The most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the flaming chalice, often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the Disciples of Christ also use a chalice as their denomination symbol). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the Second World War. It was created by Austrian artist Hans Deutsch. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.

Nevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech Jan Hus, which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus&#x27;s early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an off-center cross within a circle (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).

Other symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a dove.

===Services of worship===

Religious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition. Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker. Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.

The service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, &quot;Singing the Journey&quot; contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older &quot;Singing the Living Tradition&quot; which contains readings as well. Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources—traditional hymn tunes with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.

Pastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to light a candle or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of meditation or prayer, led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called &quot;talk back&quot;, where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.

Many Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian sacraments of baptism, communion, or confirmation, at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often federated churches or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship or similar covenant groups. &quot;Child dedications&quot; often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such &quot;dedications&quot; are sometimes practiced even in &quot;orthodox&quot; Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons). Annual celebrations of Water Communion and Flower Communion may replace or supplement Christian-style communion (though many pluralist and Christian-oriented congregations may celebrate or otherwise make provisions for communion on Christian holy days). Confirmation may be replaced by a &quot;Coming of Age&quot; program, in which teenagers explore their individual religious identity, often developing their own credo. After they have completed exploring their spiritual beliefs, they write a speech about it which they then personally deliver to the congregation.

Services can vary widely between congregations, and can incorporate dancing, contemporary music and poetry, readings taken from secular fiction or original works by congregants.

==Politics==

===Historical politics of Unitarians and Universalists===
In the 19th century, Unitarians and Universalists were active in abolitionism, the women&#x27;s movement, the temperance movement, and other social reform movements. The second women&#x27;s rights convention was held at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York. Additionally, four Presidents of the United States were Unitarians: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Millard Fillmore, and William Howard Taft.

===Politics of Unitarian Universalists===


Historically, Unitarian Universalists have often been active in political causes, notably the civil rights movement, the LGBT rights movement, the social justice movement, and the feminist movement.

Susan B. Anthony, a Unitarian and Quaker, was extremely influential in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.

Unitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end racism in the United States. John Haynes Holmes, a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York—Unitarian Universalist was among the founders of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. James J. Reeb, a minister at All Souls Church, Unitarian, in Washington, D.C., and a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was clubbed in Selma, Alabama on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, Viola Liuzzo, a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights are best known for Bloody Sunday, which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.

The past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001–2009, William G. Sinkford, is African-American, making Unitarian Universalism one of the first traditionally white denominations to be headed by a member of a racial minority.

While political liberals make up a clear majority of Unitarian Universalists, the movement aspires to diversity, and officially welcomes congregants regardless of their political views. Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither theological liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.
Several congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a &quot;Welcoming Congregation&quot;: a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual &amp; transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church &quot;to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.&quot; Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church, in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—&quot;Siding with Love&quot;. In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published &quot;An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality&quot; to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C., Mayor Adrian Fenty signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the District of Columbia in All Souls Church.

Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on polyamory. At the 2015 UUA General Assembly, the Association&#x27;s non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of &quot;family and relationship structures&quot;; the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.

Many congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and sustainability. These are often termed &quot;seventh principle&quot; activities because of the seventh principle quoted above.

==Controversies==

===External===

====Lack of formal creed====
In May 2004, Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn ruled that Unitarian Universalism was not a &quot;religion&quot; because it &quot;does not have one system of belief&quot;, and stripped the Red River Unitarian Universalist Church in Denison, Texas, of its tax-exempt status. However, within weeks, Strayhorn reversed her decision.

====Confusion with other groups====
There are separate movements and organizations who hold to classical Unitarian or Christian universalist Christian theology and neither belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association nor consider themselves Unitarian Universalists. The American Unitarian Conference and the Christian Universalist Association are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original American Unitarian Association or Universalist Church of America, and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The Unity Church is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.

====Boy Scouts of America====
In 1992, the UUA published statements opposing the BSA&#x27;s policies of discriminating against homosexuals, atheists, and agnostics; and in 1993, the UUA updated the curriculum guidance of its &quot;Religion in Life&quot; emblems program for young people in scouting to include criticism of the BSA policies. On account of the published criticism, in 1998 the BSA withdrew its recognition of UUA&#x27;s Religion in Life emblem program. Subsequently, the UUA removed the objectionable material from the program curriculum and the BSA renewed recognition of the Religion in Life program. Later, the UUA issued internal, supplemental material to emblems-program workbooks that included general statements critical of discrimination on bases of sexual orientation or personal religious viewpoint. When the BSA learned of those (internal) statements it again withdrew recognition of the UUA Religion in Life emblems program.

In 2004, the Unitarian Universalist Scouters Organization (UUSO), a group not affiliated with the UUA, established their &quot;Living Your Religion&quot; emblems program for UU-BSA scouts. Without the knowledge or approval of the UUA, the program was approved by the BSA Religious Relationships committee in 2005. Upon being notified of the UUSO program the UUA issued a statement (March 16, 2005) clarifying that UUSO was not an affiliate organization of the UUA and asserting that, contrary to reports otherwise, UU congregations were still awarding the UUA Religion in Life emblem to their youth members in BSA Scouts—whose emblems then were worn on the Scouts&#x27; uniforms without complaint from the BSA. Further, the statement made clear that the UUA still maintained its criticism of both the BSA&#x27;s ongoing discrimination against gay Scouts and gay Scout leaders and the BSA requirement of a religious litmus test for membership.

Later events made these issues moot: In 2013, BSA opened its membership to gay youth, followed by opening membership to gay adults in 2015, which policy changes resolved the main UUA objection to supporting BSA. The UUSO dissolved in 2015 and by 2016, via a memorandum of understanding, the UUA religious emblems program was again formally recognized by BSA.

===Internal===

====Language of reverence====
During the presidency of William Sinkford, debate roiled the Unitarian Universalist (U.U.) movement over his call to return to, or to re-create, an authentic Unitarian Universalist &quot;language of reverence.&quot; Sinkford suggested that as Unitarian Universalists abandoned traditional religious language they would relinquish, to others, religion&#x27;s words of power. These other religionists would proceed to dictate their meanings of religious words and language, including scripture, in the public sphere. He advocated that Unitarian Universalists should regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. In response, others saw his idea as an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Indeed, some were concerned that it might be a call to oppose the growing influence among UUs of humanism and atheism, the adherents of which would be made unwelcome within the community. Sinkford denied such motives, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he meant by &quot;language of reverence&quot;.

The growth of humanism among Unitarian Universalists stemmed in part from the congregational commitment to reach a universal audience while educating U.U. folk in biblical literacy, many of whom were born into families that eschewed or minimized religious or moral catechisms. (In addition to humanists, these people comprehend atheists and theists, agnostics, skeptics and seekers, non-member affiliates, the religion-alienated and others among the larger UU congregation.)
The debate saw the publication of a book by the UUA Beacon Press, written by former UUA President John Buehrens and titled &quot;Understanding the Bible: An Introduction for skeptics, seekers, and religious liberals&quot;. Meant to serve as a kind of handbook to be read alongside the Bible, it provides interpretative strategies from a liberal religious perspective for the reader to engage in conversation about the Bible—what it says and what it means today. Positive engagement is intended rather than to relinquish all public conversation to others over interpretation of the Bible. Another important work by Buehrens, with Forrest Church, is &quot;A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism&quot;, in which the authors present the many sources of the Unitarian Universalist faith.

====Borrowing from other religions====
The &quot;borrowing&quot; of religious rituals from other faith traditions by Unitarian Universalists was discussed at the Unitarian Universalist General Assembly in 2001 during a seminar titled &quot;Cultural Appropriation: Reckless Borrowing or Appropriate Cultural Sharing&quot; by the Religious Education Dept, UUA. Of particular discussion was the borrowing rituals and practices that are sacred to specific tribes or using spiritual practices without real context.

===Racism===
Internal controversy over the hiring of the UUA&#x27;s Southern Region Lead (a white man from outside the region was hired rather than a Latina woman who resided within the region) led to resignations and apologies in 2017. UUA President Peter Morales, the denomination&#x27;s first Latino president, resigned amid criticism of his failure to address the diversity controversies. The three co-presidents who took over commissioned a &quot;racism audit&quot; to address white supremacy within the denomination. In April 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the UUA &quot;in the past year has been asked to help resolve 15 congregational conflicts involving religious professionals of color&quot;.

==Number of members==
As of 2020, the UUA had 1,027 Unitarian Universalist member congregations in the United States and some congegrations outside the US. In 2011, it had two congregations in the U.S. Virgin Islands, 19 in Canada, six in other countries, plus 28 multi-denominational member congregations: 17 in Massachusetts, four in Illinois, three in New Hampshire, two in Vermont, and one each in Maine and Washington, D.C. Seven of the ten U.S. states with the most congregations are also among the most populous states; the state with the most congregations and members is Massachusetts; Vermont is No. 1 relative to its total population. As of December 2023 there are 42 Unitarian Universalist congregations and emerging groups in Canada affiliated with the CUC.

In 1956, Sam Wells wrote, &quot;Unitarians and Universalists are considering merger which would have total U.S. membership of ( in the world)&quot;. In 1965 Conkin wrote, &quot;In 1961, at the time of the merger, membership [in the United States] was 104,821 in 651 congregations, and the joint membership soared to its historically highest level in the mid-1960s (an estimated ) before falling sharply back in the 1970s ...&quot;. According to the 2008 &quot;Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches&quot;, the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations claimed 214,738 members in 2002.

In the United States, the American Religious Identification Survey reported  members describing themselves as Unitarian Universalist in 2001, an increase from reported in a similar survey in 1990. The highest concentrations are in New England and around Seattle, Washington.

The U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, conducted in 2007 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life and featuring a sample size of over , puts the proportion of American adults identifying as Unitarian Universalist at 0.3%.

The 2001 Canadian census done by Statistics Canada put Canadian Unitarians at 17,480, and the September 2007 membership statistics from the CUC show they had at that time 5,150 official members. In 2015, the CUC reported 3,804 members.

<text>The urea cycle (also known as the ornithine cycle) is a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces urea (NH2)2CO from ammonia (NH3). Animals that use this cycle, mainly amphibians and mammals, are called ureotelic.

The urea cycle converts highly toxic ammonia to urea for excretion. This cycle was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered by Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit in 1932, five years before the discovery of the TCA cycle. The urea cycle was described in more detail later on by Ratner and Cohen. The urea cycle takes place primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys.

==Function==
Amino acid catabolism results in waste ammonia. All animals need a way to excrete this product. Most aquatic organisms, or ammonotelic organisms, excrete ammonia without converting it. Organisms that cannot easily and safely remove nitrogen as ammonia convert it to a less toxic substance, such as urea, via the urea cycle, which occurs mainly in the liver. Urea produced by the liver is then released into the bloodstream, where it travels to the kidneys and is ultimately excreted in urine. The urea cycle is essential to these organisms, because if the nitrogen or ammonia is not eliminated from the organism it can be very detrimental. In species including birds and most insects, the ammonia is converted into uric acid or its urate salt, which is excreted in solid form. Further, the urea cycle consumes acidic waste carbon dioxide by combining it with the basic ammonia, helping to maintain a neutral pH.

==Reactions==
The entire process converts two amino groups, one from and one from aspartate, and a carbon atom from , to the relatively nontoxic excretion product urea. This occurs at the cost of four &quot;high-energy&quot; phosphate bonds (3 ATP hydrolyzed to 2 ADP and one AMP). The conversion from ammonia to urea happens in five main steps. The first is needed for ammonia to enter the cycle and the following four are all a part of the cycle itself. To enter the cycle, ammonia is converted to carbamoyl phosphate. The urea cycle consists of four enzymatic reactions: one mitochondrial and three cytosolic. This uses 6 enzymes.


::The reactions of the urea cycle
1 -ornithine&lt;br&gt;2 carbamoyl phosphate&lt;br&gt;3 -citrulline&lt;br&gt;4 argininosuccinate&lt;br&gt;5 fumarate&lt;br&gt;6 -arginine&lt;br&gt;7 urea&lt;br&gt; -Asp -aspartate&lt;br&gt;CPS-1 carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I&lt;br&gt;OTC Ornithine transcarbamoylase&lt;br&gt;ASS argininosuccinate synthetase&lt;br&gt;ASL argininosuccinate lyase&lt;br&gt;ARG1 arginase 1

=== First reaction: entering the urea cycle ===
Before the urea cycle begins ammonia is converted to carbamoyl phosphate. The reaction is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I and requires the use of two ATP molecules. The carbamoyl phosphate then enters the urea cycle.

=== Steps of the urea cycle ===
# Carbamoyl phosphate is converted to citrulline. With catalysis by ornithine transcarbamylase, the carbamoyl phosphate group is donated to ornithine and releases a phosphate group.
# A condensation reaction occurs between the amino group of aspartate and the carbonyl group of citrulline to form argininosuccinate. This reaction is ATP dependent and is catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthetase.
# Argininosuccinate undergoes cleavage by argininosuccinase to form arginine and fumarate.
# Arginine is cleaved by arginase to form urea and ornithine. The ornithine is then transported back to the mitochondria to begin the urea cycle again.

=== Overall reaction equation ===
In the first reaction, + is equivalent to NH3 + CO2 + H2O.

Thus, the overall equation of the urea cycle is:
* NH3 + CO2 + aspartate + 3 ATP + 3 H2O → urea + fumarate + 2 ADP + 2 Pi + AMP + PPi + H2O
Since fumarate is obtained by removing NH3 from aspartate (by means of reactions 3 and 4), and PPi + H2O → 2 Pi, the equation can be simplified as follows:
* 2 NH3 + CO2 + 3 ATP + 3 H2O → urea + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP
Note that reactions related to the urea cycle also cause the production of 2 NADH, so the overall reaction releases slightly more energy than it consumes. The NADH is produced in two ways:
* One NADH molecule is produced by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase in the conversion of glutamate to ammonium and α-ketoglutarate. Glutamate is the non-toxic carrier of amine groups. This provides the ammonium ion used in the initial synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate.
* The fumarate released in the cytosol is hydrated to malate by cytosolic fumarase. This malate is then oxidized to oxaloacetate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, generating a reduced NADH in the cytosol. Oxaloacetate is one of the keto acids preferred by transaminases, and so will be recycled to aspartate, maintaining the flow of nitrogen into the urea cycle.
We can summarize this by combining the reactions:
* CO2 + glutamate + aspartate + 3 ATP + 2 NAD++ 3 H2O → urea + α-ketoglutarate + oxaloacetate + 2 ADP + 2 Pi + AMP + PPi + 2 NADH
The two NADH produced can provide energy for the formation of 5 ATP (cytosolic NADH provides 2.5 ATP with the malate-aspartate shuttle in human liver cell), a net production of two high-energy phosphate bond for the urea cycle. However, if gluconeogenesis is underway in the cytosol, the latter reducing equivalent is used to drive the reversal of the GAPDH step instead of generating ATP.

The fate of oxaloacetate is either to produce aspartate via transamination or to be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate, which is a substrate for gluconeogenesis.

== Products of the urea cycle ==
As stated above many vertebrates use the urea cycle to create urea out of ammonium so that the ammonium does not damage the body. Though this is helpful, there are other effects of the urea cycle. For example: consumption of two ATP, production of urea, generation of H+, the combining of and to forms where it can be regenerated, and finally the consumption of .

==Regulation==

===&quot;N&quot;-Acetylglutamic acid===
The synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate and the urea cycle are dependent on the presence of &quot;N&quot;-acetylglutamic acid (NAcGlu), which allosterically activates CPS1. NAcGlu is an obligate activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Synthesis of NAcGlu by &quot;N&quot;-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) is stimulated by both Arg, allosteric stimulator of NAGS, and Glu, a product in the transamination reactions and one of NAGS&#x27;s substrates, both of which are elevated when free amino acids are elevated. So Glu not only is a substrate for NAGS but also serves as an activator for the urea cycle.

===Substrate concentrations===
The remaining enzymes of the cycle are controlled by the concentrations of their substrates. Thus, inherited deficiencies in cycle enzymes other than do not result in significant decreases in urea production (if any cycle enzyme is entirely missing, death occurs shortly after birth). Rather, the deficient enzyme&#x27;s substrate builds up, increasing the rate of the deficient reaction to normal.

The anomalous substrate buildup is not without cost, however. The substrate concentrations become elevated all the way back up the cycle to , resulting in hyperammonemia (elevated []P).

Although the root cause of toxicity is not completely understood, a high [] puts an enormous strain on the -clearing system, especially in the brain (symptoms of urea cycle enzyme deficiencies include intellectual disability and lethargy). This clearing system involves and , which decrease the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Glu pools. The brain is most sensitive to the depletion of these pools. Depletion of 2OG decreases the rate of TCAC, whereas Glu is both a neurotransmitter and a precursor to GABA, another neurotransmitter.

== Link with the citric acid cycle ==
The urea cycle and the citric acid cycle are independent cycles but are linked. One of the nitrogen atoms in the urea cycle is obtained from the transamination of oxaloacetate to aspartate. The fumarate that is produced in step three is also an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and is returned to that cycle.

==Urea cycle disorders==
Urea cycle disorders are rare and affect about one in 35,000 people in the United States. Genetic defects in the enzymes involved in the cycle can occur, which usually manifest within a few days after birth. The recently born child will typically experience varying bouts of vomiting and periods of lethargy. Ultimately, the infant may go into a coma and develop brain damage. New-borns with UCD are at a much higher risk of complications or death due to untimely screening tests and misdiagnosed cases. The most common misdiagnosis is neonatal sepsis. Signs of UCD can be present within the first 2 to 3 days of life, but the present method to get confirmation by test results can take too long. This can potentially cause complications such as coma or death.

Urea cycle disorders may also be diagnosed in adults, and symptoms may include delirium episodes, lethargy, and symptoms similar to that of a stroke. On top of these symptoms, if the urea cycle begins to malfunction in the liver, the patient may develop cirrhosis. This can also lead to sarcopenia (the loss of muscle mass). Mutations lead to deficiencies of the various enzymes and transporters involved in the urea cycle, and cause urea cycle disorders. If individuals with a defect in any of the six enzymes used in the cycle ingest amino acids beyond what is necessary for the minimum daily requirements, then the ammonia that is produced will not be able to be converted to urea. These individuals can experience hyperammonemia, or the build-up of a cycle intermediate.

=== Individual disorders ===
* N-Acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency
* Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency
* Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency
* Citrullinemia type I (Deficiency of argininosuccinic acid synthase)
* Argininosuccinic aciduria (Deficiency of argininosuccinic acid lyase)
* Argininemia (Deficiency of arginase)
* Hyperornithinemia, hyperammonemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome (Deficiency of the mitochondrial ornithine transporter)

All urea cycle defects, except OTC deficiency, are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. OTC deficiency is inherited as an X-linked recessive disorder, although some females can show symptoms. Most urea cycle disorders are associated with hyperammonemia, however argininemia and some forms of argininosuccinic aciduria do not present with elevated ammonia.

<text>Ugo Nespolo (born 29 August 1941 in Mosso, Biella) is an Italian artist, painter, sculptor, filmmaker and writer. He lives and works in Turin.

==Life and works==
Nespolo graduated at the Accademia Albertina di Belle Arti of Turin with Enrico Paulucci and obtained a degree in Modern Literature at the University of Turin, with a thesis on Semiology.

His career as an artist started in the 1960s. His work was influenced by Pop Art, which was becoming popular in Italy in those years, conceptual art, Arte Povera and Fluxus. He had a chance to see and appreciate closely these movements during a trip to the United States in 1967. He would then continue to regularly visit the States, where he would spend long periods of time, especially during the 1980s. Irony and transgression became key element in Nespolo&#x27;s art and characterised his work for many years to come.
Since 2010 he has been member of the Honour Committee of &quot;Immagine &amp; Poesia&quot;, an artistic literary movement founded in Turin, with the patronage of Aeronwy Thomas (Dylan Thomas&#x27;s daughter). In 2016 he signed the pptArt Manifesto, an international art movement that promote many notable initiatives like the Corporate Art Awards.

===Cinema===
In the mid-1960s Nespolo started to work with experimental cinema. His first film, &quot;Grazie, mamma Kodak&quot;, is from 1966. His friends and fellow artists such as Lucio Fontana, Enrico Baj, Michelangelo Pistoletto and others appeared regularly in his films. Nespolo&#x27;s second film, &quot;A.G.&quot; (1968), documents the visit to Turin of Allen Ginsberg. In 2001 he directed &quot;Film/a/TO&quot;, with the main character role played by Edoardo Sanguineti. Nespolo&#x27;s films have been exhibited in institutions like the Beaubourg in Paris, the Philadelphia Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw&#x27;s Filmoteka Polska and Ferrara&#x27;s Galleria Civica d&#x27;Arte Moderna. Nespolo has produced and directed about twenty films over forty years.

===Applied arts===

In the 1980s, Nespolo made ceramics and blown glass objects, created over fifty posters for exhibitions and other events, did advertising campaigns for &quot;Campari&quot; and &quot;Azzurra&quot; and realised title sequences for shows on the Italian national broadcast television RAI. In 2002, Nespolo was appointed artistic coordinator for the &quot;Metropolitana di Torino&quot;, with the aim of realising the first &quot;underground museum of modern art&quot;. Several underground stations are decorated with his glass etchings and images.

===Theatre===
In 1986 Nespolo had the possibility of designing the stage sets for Ferruccio Busoni’s opera &quot;Turandot&quot; at Connecticut Grand Opera, Stamford, the first of several theatre works he made in the following years, such as the sets and costumes for Paisiello&#x27;s &quot;Don Chisciotte&quot; at the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma in 1990 and for Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, a production for the Rome Opera, the Paris Opera and the Lausanne Opera, Liège and Metz in 1995. In 2007, he designed stage and costumes for Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; at the Festival Puccini 2007 in Torre del Lago.

===Palio and traditions===
Nespolo was appreciated also for his work with &quot;Palios&quot;. In 1998, he was committed the &quot;Palio&quot; for the &quot;Giostra della Quintana&quot;, Ascoli Piceno. In 2000, he was awarded for his work for &quot;Palio di Asti&quot; and in 1991 and 2009 for the &quot;Palio&quot; of the &quot;Giostra della Quintana&quot; in Foligno. He was chosen to design the &quot;Palio&quot; (&quot;Drappellone&quot; or banner) at the &quot;Palio dell&#x27;Assunta&quot; in August 2007.

<text>Ulster (; or ; or &quot;Ulster&quot;) is one of the four traditional or historic Irish provinces. It is made up of nine counties: six of these constitute Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom); the remaining three are in the Republic of Ireland.

It is the second-largest (after Munster) and second-most populous (after Leinster) of Ireland&#x27;s four traditional provinces, with Belfast being its biggest city. Unlike the other provinces, Ulster has a high percentage of Protestants, making up almost half of its population. English is the main language and Ulster English the main dialect. A minority also speak Irish, and there are (Irish-speaking regions) in County Donegal which is home to a quarter of the total Gaeltacht population of the Republic of Ireland. There are also large Irish-speaking networks in southern County Londonderry and in the Gaeltacht Quarter, Belfast. Ulster-Scots is also spoken extensively in Counties Antrim, Down, Londonderry, Tyrone and Donegal. Lough Neagh, in the east, is the largest lake in the British Isles, while Lough Erne in the west is one of its largest lake networks. The main mountain ranges are the Mournes, Sperrins, Croaghgorms and Derryveagh Mountains.

Historically, Ulster lay at the heart of the Gaelic world made up of Gaelic Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. According to tradition, in ancient Ireland it was one of the fifths () ruled by a , or &#x27;king of over-kings&#x27;. It is named after the overkingdom of Ulaid, in the east of the province, which was in turn named after the Ulaid folk. The other overkingdoms in Ulster were Airgíalla and Ailech. After the Norman invasion of Ireland in the twelfth century, eastern Ulster was conquered by the Anglo-Normans and became the Earldom of Ulster. By the late fourteenth century the Earldom had collapsed and the O&#x27;Neill dynasty had come to dominate most of Ulster, claiming the title King of Ulster. Ulster became the most thoroughly Gaelic and independent of Ireland&#x27;s provinces. Its rulers resisted English encroachment but were defeated in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1594–1603). King James I then colonised Ulster with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Great Britain, in the Plantation of Ulster. This led to the founding of many of Ulster&#x27;s towns. The inflow of Protestant settlers and migrants also led to bouts of sectarian violence with Catholics, notably during the 1641 rebellion and the Armagh disturbances.

Along with the rest of Ireland, Ulster became part of the United Kingdom in 1801. In the early twentieth century, moves towards Irish self-rule were opposed by many Ulster Protestants, sparking the Home Rule Crisis. In the last all Ireland election (1918 Irish general election) counties Donegal and Monaghan returned large Sinn Féin (nationalist) majorities. Sinn Féin candidates ran unopposed in Cavan. Fermanagh and Tyrone had Sinn Féin/Nationalist Party (Irish Parliamentary Party) majorities. The other four Counties of Ulster had Unionist Party majorities. The home rule crisis and the subsequent Irish War of Independence led to the partition of Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Six Ulster counties became Northern Ireland, a self-governing territory within the United Kingdom, while the rest of Ireland became the Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland.

The term &quot;Ulster&quot; has no official function for local government purposes in either state. However, for the purposes of ISO 3166-2:IE, &quot;Ulster&quot; is used to refer to the three counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan only, which are given country sub-division code &quot;IE-U&quot;. The name is also used by various organisations such as cultural and sporting bodies.

==Terminology==
Ulster&#x27;s name ultimately derives from the , a group of tribes that once dwelt in this part of Ireland. The Norsemen knew the province as , the or &#x27;land&#x27; (a word borrowed from Irish) of the ; this was then taken into English as &quot;Ullister&quot; or &quot;Ulvester&quot;, and later contracted to &quot;Ulster&quot;. Another, less probable explanation is that the suffix -&quot;ster&quot; represents the Old Norse element (&#x27;place&#x27;), found in names like Lybster and Scrabster in Scotland.

Ulster is still known as in Irish, meaning the province (literally &#x27;fifth&#x27;) of the . has historically been anglicised as &quot;Ulagh&quot; or &quot;Ullagh&quot; and Latinised as or . The latter two have yielded the terms &quot;Ulidian&quot; and &quot;Ultonian&quot;. The Irish word for someone or something from Ulster is , and this can be found in the surnames MacNulty, MacAnulty, and Nulty, which all derive from , meaning &#x27;son of the Ulsterman&#x27;.

Northern Ireland is often referred to as &quot;Ulster&quot;, despite including only six of Ulster&#x27;s nine counties. This usage is most common among people in Northern Ireland who are unionist, although it is also used by the media throughout the United Kingdom. Some Irish nationalists object to the use of Ulster in this context.

==Geography and political sub-divisions==

Ulster has a population of just over two million people and an area of . About 62% of the area of Ulster is in the UK while the remaining 38% is in the Republic of Ireland. Ulster&#x27;s biggest city, Belfast, has an urban population of over half a million inhabitants, making it the second-largest city on the island of Ireland and the 10th largest urban area in the UK. 
Six of Ulster&#x27;s nine counties, Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, including the former parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, form Northern Ireland which remained part of the United Kingdom after the partition of Ireland in 1921. Three Ulster counties – Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan – form part of the Republic of Ireland. About half of Ulster&#x27;s population lives in counties Antrim and Down. Across the nine counties, according to the aggregate UK 2011 Census for Northern Ireland, and the ROI 2011 Census for counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan, there is a Roman Catholic majority over Protestant of 50.8% to 42.7%.

While the traditional counties continue to demarcate areas of local government in the Republic of Ireland, this is no longer the case in Northern Ireland. Since 1974, the traditional counties have a ceremonial role only. Local government in Northern Ireland is now demarcated by 11 districts.

==Economy==

The GDP of the province of Ulster is around €50 billion. Salary levels are the lowest on the island of Ireland.


==Physical geography==
The biggest lake in the British Isles, Lough Neagh, lies in eastern Ulster. The province&#x27;s highest point, Slieve Donard (), stands in County Down. The most northerly point in Ireland, Malin Head, is in County Donegal, as are the sixth-highest () sea cliffs in Europe, at Slieve League, and the province&#x27;s largest island, Arranmore. The most easterly point in Ireland is also in Ulster, in County Down, and the most westerly point in the UK is in County Fermanagh. The longest river in the British Isles, the Shannon, rises at the Shannon Pot in County Cavan with underground tributaries from County Fermanagh. Volcanic activity in eastern Ulster led to the formation of the Antrim Plateau and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, one of Ireland&#x27;s three UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Ulster also has a significant drumlin belt. The geographical centre of Ulster lies between the villages of Pomeroy and Carrickmore in County Tyrone. In terms of area, County Donegal is the largest county in all of Ulster.

==Transport==

===Air===
The province&#x27;s main airport is Belfast International Airport (popularly called Aldergrove Airport), which is located at Aldergrove, 11.5 miles northwest of Belfast near Antrim. George Best Belfast City Airport (sometimes referred to as &quot;the City Airport&quot; or &quot;the Harbour Airport&quot;) is another, smaller airport which is located at Sydenham in Belfast. The City of Derry Airport is located at Eglinton, east of the city of Derry. There is also Donegal Airport (), popularly known as Carrickfinn Airport, which is located in The Rosses.

===Rail===
Railway lines are run by NI Railways (NIR). Belfast to Bangor and Belfast to Lisburn are strategically the most important routes on the network with the greatest number of passengers and largest profit margins. The Belfast-Derry railway line connecting Derry~Londonderry railway station, via Coleraine, Ballymoney, Ballymena and Antrim, with Lanyon Place and Belfast Grand Central is a noted scenic route. Belfast is also connected with Carrickfergus and Larne Harbour, Portadown, Newry and onwards, via the Enterprise service jointly operated by NIR and Iarnród Éireann, to Dublin Connolly.

The main railway lines linking to and from Belfast Grand Central and Belfast Lanyon Place are:
*The Derry Line and the Portrush Branch
*The Larne Line
*The Bangor Line
*The Portadown Line

Only five Irish counties, all in Southern and Western Ulster, currently have no mainline railway. The historic Great Northern Railway of Ireland connected them. They are Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Donegal. A plan to re-link Sligo and Derry through Donegal has been postponed until at least 2030.

==Languages and dialects==
Most people in Ulster speak English. English is taught in all schools in the province; Irish (&#x27;) is taught in all schools in the counties that are part of the Republic, and in schools in Northern Ireland, almost exclusively in the Roman Catholic and Irish-medium sectors. In responses to the 2001 census in Northern Ireland 10% of the population had &quot;some knowledge of Irish&quot; and 4.7% could &quot;speak, read, write and understand&quot; Irish. Large parts of County Donegal are Gaeltacht areas where Irish is the first language and some people in west Belfast also speak Irish, especially in the &quot;Gaeltacht Quarter&quot;. The dialect of Irish most commonly spoken in Ulster (especially throughout Northern Ireland and County Donegal) is &#x27; or Donegal Irish, also known as &quot;&quot; or Ulster Irish. Donegal Irish has many similarities to Scottish Gaelic. Polish is the third most common language. Ulster Scots dialects, sometimes known by the neologism &quot;Ullans&quot;, are also spoken in Counties Down, Antrim, Londonderry and Donegal.

==History==

===Early history===
Ulster is one of the four Irish provinces. Its name derives from the Irish language (), meaning &#x27;fifth of the Ulaidh&#x27;, named for the ancient inhabitants of the region.

The province&#x27;s early story extends further back than written records and survives mainly in legends such as the Ulster Cycle.
The archaeology of Ulster, formerly called Ulandia, gives examples of &quot;ritual enclosures&quot;, such as the Giant&#x27;s Ring near Belfast, which is an earth bank about 590 feet (180 m) in diameter and 15 feet (4.5 m) high, in the centre of which there is a dolmen.

The Boyne and its tributary the Blackwater were the traditional southern boundary of the province of Ulster and appear as such in the . According to historian Francis John Byrne the Ulaid &#x27;possibly still ruled directly in Louth as far as the Boyne in the early seventh century&#x27; when Congal Cáech made a bid for the kingship of Tara. In 637, the Battle of Moira, known archaically as the Battle of Magh Rath, was fought by the Gaelic High King of Ireland Domhnall II against his foster son King Congal Cáech of Ulster, supported by his ally Domhnall the Freckled () of Dalriada. The battle was fought near the Woods of Killultagh, just outside the village of Moira in what would become County Down. It was allegedly the largest battle ever fought on the island of Ireland, and resulted in the death of Congal and the retreat of Domhnall Brecc.

In early medieval Ireland, a branch of the Northern Uí Néill, the of the province of Ailech, gradually eroded the territory of the province of Ulaidh until it lay east of the River Bann. The would make (most of which forms modern County Tyrone) their base. Among the High Kings of Ireland were Áed Findliath (died 879), Niall Glúndub (died 919), and Domnall ua Néill (died 980), all of the Cenél nEógain. The province of Ulaidh would survive restricted to the east of modern Ulster until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. It would only once more become a province of Ireland in the mid-14th century after the collapse of the Norman Earldom of Ulster, when the O&#x27;Neills who had come to dominate the Northern Uí Néill stepped into the power vacuum and staked a claim for the first time the title of &quot;king of Ulster&quot; along with the Red Hand of Ulster symbol. It was then that the provinces of Ailech, Airgialla, and Ulaidh would all merge largely into what would become the modern province of Ulster.
Domnall Ua Lochlainn (died 1121) and Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn (died 1166) were of this dynasty. The Meic Lochlainn were in 1241 overthrown by their kin, the clan Ó Néill (see O&#x27;Neill dynasty). The Ó Néill&#x27;s were from then on established as Ulster&#x27;s most powerful Gaelic family.

The Ó Domhnaill (O&#x27;Donnell) dynasty were Ulster&#x27;s second most powerful clan from the early thirteenth-century through to the beginning of the seventeenth-century. The O&#x27;Donnells ruled over Tír Chonaill (most of modern County Donegal) in West Ulster.

After the Norman invasion of Ireland in the twelfth century, the east of the province fell by conquest to Norman barons, first De Courcy (died 1219), then Hugh de Lacy (1176–1243), who founded the Earldom of Ulster based on the modern counties of Antrim and Down.

In the 1600s Ulster was the last redoubt of the traditional Gaelic way of life, and following the defeat of the Irish forces in the Nine Years War (1594–1603) at the battle of Kinsale (1601), Elizabeth I&#x27;s English forces succeeded in subjugating Ulster and all of Ireland.

The Gaelic leaders of Ulster, the O&#x27;Neills and O&#x27;Donnells, finding their power under English suzerainty limited, decamped &quot;en masse&quot; in 1607 (the Flight of the Earls) to Roman Catholic Europe. This allowed the English Crown to plant Ulster with more loyal English and Scottish planters, a process which began in earnest in 1610.

===Plantations and civil wars===

The Plantation of Ulster () was the organised colonisation (or plantation) of Ulster by people from Great Britain (especially Presbyterians from Scotland). Private plantation by wealthy landowners began in 1606, while the official plantation controlled by King James I of England (who was also King James VI of Scots) began in 1609. All land owned by Irish chieftains, the Ó Neills and Ó Donnells (along with those of their supporters), who fought against the English Crown in the Nine Years War, were confiscated and used to settle the colonists. The Counties Tyrconnell, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan, Coleraine and Armagh comprised the official Colony. However, most of the counties, including the most heavily colonised Counties Antrim and Down, were privately colonised. These counties, though not officially designated as subject to Plantation, had suffered violent depopulation during the previous wars and proved attractive to Private Colonialists from nearby Britain. The efforts to attract colonists from England and Scotland to the Ulster Plantation were considerably affected by the existence of British colonies in the Americas, which served as a more attractive destination for many potential emigrants.

The official reason for the Plantation is said to have been to pay for the costly Nine Years&#x27; War, but this view was not shared by all in the English government of the time, most notably the English Crown-appointed Attorney-General for Ireland in 1609, Sir John Davies:

The Plantation of Ulster continued well into the 18th century, interrupted only by the Irish Rebellion of 1641. This Rebellion was initially led by Sir Phelim O&#x27;Neill (), and was intended to overthrow British rule rapidly, but quickly degenerated into attacks on colonists, in which dispossessed Irish slaughtered thousands of the colonists. In the ensuing wars (1641–1653, fought against the background of civil war in England, Scotland and Ireland), Ulster became a battleground between the Colonialists and the native Irish. In 1646, an Irish army under command by Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill () inflicted a defeat on a Scottish Covenanter army at Benburb in County Tyrone, but the native Irish forces failed to follow up their victory and the war lapsed into stalemate. The war in Ulster ended with the defeat of the native army at the Battle of Scarrifholis, near Newmills on the western outskirts of Letterkenny, County Donegal, in 1650, as part of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland conducted by Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army, the aim of which was to expel all native Irish to the province of Connaught.

Forty years later, in 1688–1691, the Williamite War was fought, the belligerents of which were the Williamites and Jacobites. The war was partly due to a dispute over who was the rightful claimant to the British Throne, and thus the supreme monarch of the nascent British Empire. However, the war was also a part of the greater War of the Grand Alliance, fought between King Louis XIV of France and his allies, and a European-wide coalition, the Grand Alliance, led by Prince William of Orange and Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire, supported by the Vatican and many other states. The Grand Alliance was a cross-denominational alliance designed to stop French eastward colonialist expansion under Louis XIV, with whom King James II was allied.

The majority of Irish people were &quot;Jacobites&quot; and supported James II due to his 1687 Declaration of Indulgence or, as it is also known, The Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II&#x27;s promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination. However, James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, and the majority of Ulster Colonialists (Williamites) backed William of Orange. Both the Williamite and Jacobite armies were religiously mixed; William of Orange&#x27;s own elite forces, the Dutch Blue Guards had a papal banner with them during the invasion, many of them being Dutch Roman Catholics.

At the start of the war, Irish Jacobites controlled most of Ireland for James II, with the exception of the Williamite strongholds at Derry and at Enniskillen in Ulster. The Jacobites besieged Derry from December 1688 to July 1689, ending when a Williamite army from Britain relieved the city. The Williamites based in Enniskillen defeated another Jacobite army at the battle of Newtownbutler on 28 July 1689. Thereafter, Ulster remained firmly under Williamite control and William&#x27;s forces completed their conquest of the rest of Ireland in the next two years. The war provided Protestant loyalists with the iconic victories of the Siege of Derry, the Battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690) and the Battle of Aughrim (12 July 1691), all of which the Orange Order commemorate each year.

The Williamites&#x27; victory in this war ensured British rule in Ireland for over 200 years. The Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland excluded most of Ulster&#x27;s population from having any Civil power on religious grounds. Roman Catholics (descended from the indigenous Irish) and Presbyterians (mainly descended from Scottish colonists) both suffered discrimination under the Penal Laws, which gave full political rights only to Anglican Protestants (mostly descended from English settlers). In the 1690s, Scottish Presbyterians became a majority in Ulster, due to a large influx of them into the Province.

===Emigration===
Considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots (who became commonly known as &quot;Scots-Irish&quot; in America) emigrated to the North American colonies throughout the 18th century (160,000 settled in what would become the United States between 1717 and 1770 alone).

Disdaining (or forced out of) the heavily English regions on the Atlantic coast, most groups of Ulster-Scots settlers crossed into the &quot;western mountains&quot;, where their descendants populated the Appalachian regions and the Ohio Valley. Here they lived on the frontiers of America, carving their own world out of the wilderness. The Scots-Irish soon became the dominant culture of the Appalachians from Pennsylvania to Georgia. Author (and US Senator) Jim Webb puts forth a thesis in his book &quot;Born Fighting&quot; to suggest that the character traits he ascribes to the Scots-Irish such as loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and a propensity to bear arms, helped shape the American identity.

In the United States Census, 2000, 4.3 million Americans claimed Scots-Irish ancestry. The areas where the most Americans reported themselves in the 2000 Census only as &quot;American&quot; with no further qualification (e.g. Kentucky, north-central Texas, and many other areas in the Southern US) are largely the areas where many Scots-Irish settled, and are in complementary distribution with the areas which most heavily report Scots-Irish ancestry.

According to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, 400,000 people in the US were of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790 when the first US Census counted 3,100,000 white Americans. According to the encyclopaedia, half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster, and half from the other three provinces of Ireland.

===Republicanism, rebellion and communal strife===

Most of the 18th century saw a calming of sectarian tensions in Ulster. The economy of the province improved, as small producers exported linen and other goods. Belfast developed from a village into a bustling provincial town. However, this did not stop many thousands of Ulster people from emigrating to British North America in this period, where they became known as &quot;Scots Irish&quot; or &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot;.

Political tensions resurfaced, albeit in a new form, towards the end of the 18th century. In the 1790s many Roman Catholics and Presbyterians, in opposition to Anglican domination and inspired by the American and French revolutions joined in the United Irishmen movement. This group (founded in Belfast) dedicated itself to founding a non-sectarian and independent Irish republic. The United Irishmen had particular strength in Belfast, Antrim and Down. Paradoxically however, this period also saw much sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants, principally members of the Church of Ireland (Anglicans, who practised the British state religion and had rights denied to both Presbyterians and Roman Catholics), notably the &quot;Battle of the Diamond&quot; in 1795, a faction fight between the rival &quot;Defenders&quot; (Roman Catholic) and &quot;Peep O&#x27;Day Boys&quot; (Anglican), which led to over 100 deaths and to the founding of the Orange Order. This event, and many others like it, came about with the relaxation of the Penal Laws and Roman Catholics began to be allowed to purchase land and involve themselves in the linen trade (activities which previously had involved many onerous restrictions). Protestants, including some Presbyterians, who in some parts of the province had come to identify with the Roman Catholic community, used violence to intimidate Roman Catholics who tried to enter the linen trade. Estimates suggest that up to 7000 Roman Catholics suffered expulsion from Ulster during this violence. Many of them settled in northern Connacht. These refugees&#x27; linguistic influence still survives in the dialects of Irish spoken in County Mayo, which have many similarities to Ulster Irish not found elsewhere in Connacht. Loyalist militias, primarily Anglicans, also used violence against the United Irishmen and against Roman Catholic and Protestant republicans throughout the province.

In 1798 the United Irishmen, led by Henry Joy McCracken, launched a rebellion in Ulster, mostly supported by Presbyterians. But the British authorities swiftly put down the rebellion and employed severe repression after the fighting had ended. In the wake of the failure of this rebellion, and following the gradual abolition of official religious discrimination after the Act of Union in 1800, Presbyterians came to identify more with the State and with their Anglican neighbours, due to their civil rights now being respected by both the state and their Anglican neighbours.

The 1859 Ulster Revival was a major Christian revival that spread throughout Ulster.

===Industrialisation, Home Rule and partition===

In the 19th century, Ulster had the only large-scale industrialisation and became the most prosperous province on the island. In the latter part of the century, Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the island&#x27;s largest city. Belfast became famous in this period for its huge dockyards and shipbuilding – and notably for the construction of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Sectarian divisions in Ulster became hardened into the political categories of &quot;unionist&quot; (supporters of the Union with Britain; mostly, but not exclusively, Protestant) and &quot;nationalist&quot; (advocates of repeal of the 1800 Act of Union, usually, though not exclusively, Roman Catholic). Northern Ireland&#x27;s current politics originate from these late 19th century disputes over Home Rule that would have devolved some powers of government to Ireland. At least a dozen large scale sectarian disturbances/riots occurred in Belfast during the 19th century. Ulster Protestants usually opposed Home Rule — fearing for their religious rights calling it &quot;Rome Rule&quot; in an autonomous Roman Catholic-dominated Ireland and also not trusting politicians from the agrarian south and west to support the more industrial economy of Ulster. This lack of trust, however, was largely unfounded as during the 19th and early 20th century important industries in the southernmost region of Cork included brewing, distilling, wool and like Belfast, shipbuilding.

Thousands of unionists, led by the Dublin-born barrister Sir Edward Carson and James Craig, signed the &quot;Ulster Covenant&quot; of 1912 pledging to resist Home Rule. This movement also set up the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). In April 1914, the UVF assisted with the landing of 30,000 German rifles with 3,000,000 rounds at Larne by blockading authorities. (See Larne gunrunning). The Curragh Incident showed it would be difficult to use the British army to enforce home rule from Dublin on Ulster&#x27;s unionist minority.

In response, Irish republicans created the Irish Volunteers, part of which became the forerunner of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) – to seek to ensure the passing of the Home Rule Bill. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, 200,000 Irishmen, both Southern and Northern, of all religious sects volunteered to serve in the British Army. This had the effect of interrupting the armed stand-off in Ireland. As the war progressed, in Ireland, opposition to the War grew stronger, reaching its peak in 1918 when the British government proposed laws to extend conscription to all able bodied Irishmen during the Conscription Crisis.

In the aftermath of World War I, the political party Sinn Féin (&quot;Ourselves&quot;) won the majority of votes in the 1918 Irish general election, this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the Sinn Féin campaign Manifesto of 1918, a great deal more than the devolved government/Home Rule advocated by the (I.P.P) Irish Parliamentary Party. Following the Sinn Féin victory in these elections the Irish Declaration of Independence was penned and Irish republicans launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the Irish War of Independence (January 1919 – July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally took the form of street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics (see The Troubles (1920–1922)). The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, with the exception of the south Armagh area, where Frank Aiken led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in County Donegal and the City of Derry, where one of the main Republican leaders was Peadar O&#x27;Donnell. Hugh O&#x27;Doherty, a Sinn Féin politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the First Dáil, which was elected in late 1918, Eoin Mac Néill served as the Sinn Féin T.D. for Londonderry City.

===1920 to present===
Partition of Ireland, first mooted in 1912, was introduced with the enactment of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which gave a form of &quot;Home rule&quot; self-government to two areas, Southern Ireland, with its capital at Dublin, and &quot;Northern Ireland&quot;, consisting of six of Ulster&#x27;s central and eastern counties, both within a continuing United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Dissatisfaction with this led to the Irish War of Independence, which formally ceased on 11 July 1921. Low-level violence, however, continued in Ulster, causing Michael Collins in the south to order a boycott of Northern products in protest at attacks on the Nationalist community there. The Partition was effectively confirmed by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 6 December 1921. One of the primary stipulations of the treaty was the transformation of Ireland into a self-governing British dominion called the Irish Free State (which later became the sovereign Republic of Ireland), but with the option of a continuation of the home rule institution of Northern Ireland, still within the United Kingdom, if the Northern Ireland Parliament (already in existence) chose to opt out of the Irish Free State. All parties knew that this was certain to be the choice of the Ulster Unionists who had a majority in the parliament, and immediately on the creation of the Free State they resolved to leave it.

Following the Anglo Irish treaty, the exact border between the new dominion of the Irish Free State and the future Northern Ireland, if it chose to opt out, was to be decided by the Irish Boundary Commission. This did not announce its findings until 1925, when the line was again drawn around six of Ulster&#x27;s nine counties, with no change from the partition of 1920.

Electorally, voting in the six Northern Ireland counties of Ulster tends to follow religious or sectarian lines; noticeable religious demarcation does not exist in the South Ulster counties of Cavan and Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. County Donegal is largely a Roman Catholic county, but with a large Protestant minority. Generally, Protestants in Donegal vote for the political party Fine Gael (&quot;Family of the Irish&quot;). However, religious sectarianism in politics has largely disappeared from the rest of the Republic of Ireland. This was illustrated when Erskine H. Childers, a Church of Ireland member and Teachta Dála (TD, a member of the lower house of the National Parliament) who had represented Monaghan, won election as President after having served as a long-term minister under Fianna Fáil Taoisigh Éamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch.

The Orange Order freely organises in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, with several Orange parades taking place throughout County Donegal each year. The only major Orange Order march in the Republic of Ireland takes place every July in the village of Rossnowlagh, near Ballyshannon, in the south of County Donegal.

, Northern Ireland has seven Roman Catholic members of parliament, all members of Sinn Féin (of a total of 18 from the whole of Northern Ireland) in the British House of Commons at Westminster; and the other three counties have one Protestant T.D. of the ten it has elected to Dáil Éireann, the Lower House of the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland. At present (August 2007) County Donegal sends six T.D.&#x27;s to Dáil Éireann. The county is divided into two constituencies: Donegal North-East and Donegal South-West, each with three T.D.&#x27;s. County Cavan and County Monaghan form the one constituency called Cavan-Monaghan, which sends five T.D.&#x27;s to the Dáil (one of whom is a Protestant).

The historic Flag of Ulster served as the basis for the Ulster Banner (often referred to as the Flag of Northern Ireland), which was the flag of the Government of Northern Ireland until the proroguing of the Stormont parliament in 1973.

==Sport==
The border has divided association football teams since 1921. The Irish Football Association (the I.F.A.) oversees the sport in N.I., while the Football Association of Ireland (the F.A.I.) oversees the sport in the Republic. As a result, separate international teams are fielded and separate championships take place (Irish Football League in Northern Ireland, League of Ireland in the rest of Ulster and Ireland). Anomalously, Derry City F.C. has played in the League of Ireland since 1985 due to crowd trouble at some of their Irish League matches prior to this. The other major Ulster team in the League of Ireland is Finn Harps of Ballybofey, County Donegal. When Derry City F.C. and Finn Harps play against each other, the game is usually referred to as a &#x27;North-West Derby&#x27;. There have been cup competitions between I.F.A. and F.A.I. clubs, most recently the Setanta Sports Cup.

In Rugby union, the professional rugby team representing the province and the IRFU Ulster Branch, Ulster Rugby, compete in the United Rugby Championship along with teams from Wales, Scotland, Italy, South Africa and the other Irish Provinces (Leinster, Munster and Connacht). They also compete in Europe&#x27;s main club rugby tournament, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which they won (as the Heineken Cup) back in 1999. Notable Ulster rugby players include Willy John McBride, Jack Kyle and Mike Gibson. The former is the most capped British and Irish Lion of all time, having completed four tours with the Lions in the sixties and seventies. At international level players from Ulster join with those from the other 3 provinces to form the island-wide Ireland team.

In Gaelic games (which include Gaelic football and hurling), Ulster counties play the Ulster Senior Football Championship and Ulster Senior Hurling Championship. In football, the main competitions in which they compete with the other Irish counties are the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and National Football League, while the Ulster club champions represent the province in the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship. Hurling teams play in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, National Hurling League and All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship. The whole province fields a team to play the other provinces in the Railway Cup in both football and hurling. Gaelic Football is by far the most popular of the GAA sports in Ulster but hurling is also played, especially in Antrim, Armagh, Derry, and Down.

The Ulster Hockey Union organises field hockey in the province and contributes substantially to the all-island hockey team.

Cricket is also played in Ulster, especially in Northern Ireland and East Donegal. Ulster enters two teams into the Interprovincial Series; the North Knights and the North West Warriors, who are the respective representative teams of the Northern Cricket Union (NCU) and the North West Cricket Union (NWCU).

Golf is, however, by far the most high-profile sport and the sport that Ulster has succeeded at more than any other. Ulster has produced many great players over the years, from Fred Daly winning The Open Championship in 1947 at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake to most recently Rory McIlroy winning the US Open and Darren Clarke winning The Open Championship in 2011. Ulster also has another Major winner in Graeme McDowell, who also won the US Open in 2010. The Open Championship returned to Ulster, after 68 years, in 2019 at Royal Portrush Golf Club.

In horse racing, specifically National Hunt, Ulster has produced the most dominant jockey of all time, Tony McCoy.

The Circuit of Ireland Rally is an annual automobile rally held in Ulster since 1931.

She was commissioned on 9 December 1995. Her temporary home port is Norfolk, Virginia, for her scheduled refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH), which began in 2019. After her overhaul is completed sometime in the 2020s, she is scheduled to return to Bremerton, Washington.

==Mission and capabilities==
The mission of &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; and her air wing (CVW-9) is to conduct sustained combat air operations while forward-deployed. The embarked air wing consists of eight to nine squadrons. Attached aircraft are Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet, EA-18G Growler, MH-60R, MH-60S, and E-2C Hawkeye.

The air wing can engage enemy aircraft, submarines, and land targets, or lay mines hundreds of miles from the ship. &quot;John C. Stennis&quot;″s aircraft are used to conduct strikes, support land battles, protect the battle group or other friendly shipping, and implement a sea or air blockade. The air wing provides a visible presence to demonstrate American power and resolve in a crisis. The ship normally operates as the centerpiece of a carrier battle group commanded by a flag officer embarked upon &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; and consisting of four to six other ships.

&quot;John C. Stennis&quot;″s two nuclear reactors give her virtually unlimited range and endurance and a top speed in excess of 30 knots (56 km/h, 34.5 mph). The ship&#x27;s four catapults and four arresting gear engines enable her to launch and recover aircraft rapidly and simultaneously. The ship carries approximately of fuel for her aircraft and escorts, and enough weapons and stores for extended operations without replenishment. &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; also has extensive repair capabilities, including a fully equipped Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, a micro-miniature electronics repair shop, and numerous ship repair shops.

For defense, in addition to her air wing and accompanying vessels, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; has NATO RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) surface-to-air missile systems, the Phalanx Close-in Weapons System for cruise missile defense, and the AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare System.

==History==
The nuclear-powered USS &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; (CVN 74) was contracted on 29 March 1988, and the keel was laid on 13 March 1991 at Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News, Virginia.

The ship was christened on 11 November 1993, in honor of Senator John Cornelius Stennis (D-Mississippi) who served in the Senate from 1947 to 1989. The daughter of the ship&#x27;s namesake, Mrs. Margaret Stennis-Womble, was the ship&#x27;s sponsor. &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; was commissioned on 9 December 1995 at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, and she conducted flight deck certification in January 1996. The first arrested landing was by a VX-23 F-14B. The ship conducted numerous carrier qualifications and independent steaming exercises off the East Coast throughout the next two years. Included among these events was the first carrier landing of an F/A-18E/F Super Hornet on 18 January 1997.

===1998===
On 26 February 1998 with Carrier Air Wing Seven embarked, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; left Norfolk for her maiden deployment, transiting the Suez Canal on 7 March and arriving in the Persian Gulf on 11 March 1998. The ship traveled in 274 hours, an average speed of to relieve in conducting Operation Southern Watch missions. &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; departed the Persian Gulf on 19 July 1998 for her new home port of Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California, arriving on 26 August 1998. In October 1998, she entered a six-month maintenance and upgrade period at North Island, returning to sea in April 1999. During the maintenance period, a jet blast deflector collapsed, severely injuring two sailors.

===1999===
In May 1999, the ship ran aground in a shallow area adjacent to the turning basin near North Island. Silt clogged the intake pipes to the steam condensing systems for the nuclear reactor plants, causing the carrier&#x27;s two nuclear reactors to be shut down (one reactor by crew, the other automatically) for a period of 45 minutes. She was towed back to her pier for maintenance and observation for the next two days. The cleanup cost was about $2 million.

===2000===
On 7 January 2000, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf to relieve in Operation Southern Watch. During the deployment, the ship made port visits to South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Tasmania and Pearl Harbor, before returning to San Diego on 3 July 2000.

===2001===
On 21 May 2001, the ship served as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and most expensive outdoor theater&quot; for the world premiere of the Disney film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. More than 2,000 people attended the premiere on the ship, which had special grandstand seating and one of the world&#x27;s largest movie screens assembled on the flight deck.

Following the September 11 attacks, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; conducted Noble Eagle missions off the U.S. West Coast. In 2000 and 2001, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; was part of Carrier Group 7.

On 12 November 2001, two months earlier than scheduled, the ship left on her third deployment to the U.S. Fifth Fleet area of responsibility in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, returning to San Diego on 28 May 2002. From June 2002 to January 2003, &quot;JCS&quot; underwent a seven-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA).

===2004===
From 24 May to 1 November 2004, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; conducted her fourth major overseas deployment, participating in Exercise Northern Edge 2004 in the Gulf of Alaska, Rim of the Pacific (RimPac) Exercise off Hawaii, exercises with &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; off Japan and goodwill visits to Japan, Malaysia and Western Australia. Shortly after returning from deployment to San Diego, &quot;JCS&quot; changed her home port to Naval Station Bremerton, Washington, on 19 January 2005. Once at Bremerton, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; underwent an 11-month docking planned incremental availability (DPIA), the first time she had been dry-docked since commissioning. Upgrades included a new mast. The new mast&#x27;s structure is the first of its kind. A new type of steel alloy was used, making it stiffer and thicker than before. The new mast is also heavier and taller, allowing it to support new antennae the old mast would not have been able to support. Other upgrades included the installation of a new integrated bridge system in the pilothouse that will save manpower and provide state-of-the-art displays.

Following the maintenance cycle and pre-deployment training exercises, the carrier returned to Bremerton, Washington, and the carrier was certified surge ready, meaning the ship maintained a high state of readiness in case of an unscheduled deployment.

===2007===
On 16 January 2007, the carrier and her group set sail for the Persian Gulf as part of an increase in US military presence. &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; arrived in the area on 19 February 2007, joining in the United States Fifth Fleet area of operations. This marked the first time since 2003 that there were two aircraft carrier battle groups in the region simultaneously.

On 23 May 2007, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot;, along with eight other warships including the aircraft carrier and amphibious assault ship , passed through the Strait of Hormuz. US Navy officials said it was the largest such move since 2003.

On 31 August 2007 &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; returned to Bremerton.

===2009===
&quot;John C. Stennis&quot; departed Bremerton for a 6-month deployment to the western Pacific on 13 January 2009. On 24 April, the ship arrived in Singapore. That same day, one of the ship&#x27;s sailors was crushed and killed while working from a small harbor boat to secure a drain that discharges oily water from the aircraft catapults.

On 29 April, the ship&#x27;s executive officer, Commander David L. Burnham, was relieved by Rear Admiral Mark A. Vance over unspecified personal conduct. Burnham was reassigned to a base in San Diego, pending an investigation.

After participating in exercises with Japan Maritime Self Defense Force and the Republic of Korea, as well as joint exercise Northern Edge 2009, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; returned from deployment in early July 2009. Carrier Air Wing 9 debarked on 6 July at NAS North Island, prior to the ship&#x27;s arrival at her homeport of Bremerton on 10 July.

===2011===

On 30 March 2011, a VMFAT-101 F/A-18C Hornet suffered an uncontained catastrophic engine failure, exploded and caught fire just before launch from &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; about off the coast of San Diego during launch and recovery training operations. The aircraft was at full power, in tension on the catapult when the accident occurred. Eleven flight deck crewmen were injured while the pilot was unhurt. There was no major damage to the carrier but the aircraft was a total loss.

On 18 December 2011, the final command-and-control mission for U.S. forces over Iraq was flown by an E-2C Hawkeye (&quot;pictured&quot;) from Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 112 (VAW-112), catapulting off the carrier &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; at 7:32 am and returning at 11:04 a.m, both local time. This mission effectively ended U.S. naval support for Operation New Dawn.

===2012===
On 3 January 2012, Iranian General Ataollah Salehi warned &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; &quot;not to return to the Persian Gulf.&quot; The United States dismissed the warning.

On 7 January, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; led the rescue of an Iranian-flagged fishing vessel, &quot;Al Mulahi,&quot; following her seizure by pirates. The pirates ambushed the ship and Iranian flag to search for other ships to hijack, while holding the original crew hostage. When some of the pirates attempted to board a Bahamian-flagged cargo ship, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, she radioed for assistance. &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; dispatched a helicopter and cruiser to assist. A boarding party captured the pirates who attacked &quot;Sunshine&quot;, fed them, then released them temporarily. A helicopter then secretly followed the pirates back to their mother ship, &quot;Al Mulahi&quot;. Crew from the destroyer then boarded the fishing vessel (upon permission in Urdu from the captain), and arrested all of the pirates with no casualties.

On 2 March 2012, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; returned home from her 7-month deployment to homeport Bremerton, Washington.

On 7 July 2012, crew members were informed that &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; would be returning to the Middle East in August, much sooner than expected.

On 27 August 2012, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; departed to the Middle East originally for six months, but was extended to eight.

===2013===

Following that the ship sailed to Pearl Harbor, where she performed a week long tiger cruise to San Diego 

At 12:45 on 3 May 2013, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; arrived at her home port of Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington, the completion of a ten-month, deployment to the western Pacific Ocean. During this deployment, squadron aircraft flew more than 1,300 sorties from the carrier&#x27;s deck in the war in Afghanistan.

On 27 June, the ship entered Dry Dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS &amp; IMF) to begin her scheduled 16 month Docking Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA). Work included preserving and painting the ship&#x27;s hull, upgrading the propulsion plant, refurbishing the crew&#x27;s berthing compartments, and a complete replacement of the ship&#x27;s computer networks and work stations.

===2014===
&quot;John C. Stennis&quot; completed her Docking Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA) on 5 November 2014. After a six-day sea trial, the ship certified on 10 November as a Naval Operational asset.

===2015===

In mid-January 2015, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; departed her home port of Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington, and arrived at Naval Magazine Indian Island to load munitions prior to departing for San Diego to receive aircraft and another 2,000 sailors. On 1 September, the carrier arrived back at Bremerton, Washington.

==Ship&#x27;s seal==

&quot;John C. Stennis&quot;″s seal was produced from the combined efforts of several crew members with historical help from Stennis Center for Public Service, John C. Stennis Space Center and United States Senate Historian. The seal implies peace through strength, just as Senator John C. Stennis was referred to as an &quot;unwavering advocate of peace through strength&quot; by President Ronald Reagan, when the ship&#x27;s name was announced in June 1988.

The circular shape signifies the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier&#x27;s unique capability to circle the world without refueling while providing a forward presence from the sea. The predominant colors are red, white, blue and gold, the same as those of the United States and the Navy. The outer border, taken from one version of a U.S. Senate crest, represents the strength through unity of the ship&#x27;s crew. The four gold bands and eight ties denote John C. Stennis&#x27; four decades (41 years) in the Senate and the eight presidents he served with, from President Truman to President Reagan. The seven stars in the blue border represent his seven terms in the Senate and characterize &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; as the seventh &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier. The red and white stripes inside the blue border represent the American flag and the American people &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; serves. They also honor the courage and sacrifice of the United States&#x27; armed forces.

The eagle and shield is a representation of the gilt eagle and shield overlooking the Old Senate Chamber. The shield represents the United States of America. The twenty stars represent the US&#x27;s twentieth state, Mississippi, the home of John C. Stennis. The three arrows in the eagle&#x27;s talons symbolize the ship&#x27;s and air wing&#x27;s ability to project power. The burst of light emanating from the shield, representative of the emergence of a new nation in the United States Senate Seal, portrays the birth of over 25 major Naval Aviation programs under Senator Stennis&#x27; leadership, including all aircraft carriers from to , and aircraft from the F-4 Phantom to the F/A-18 Hornet. The eagle is representative of John C. Stennis&#x27; stature in the Senate, where he was respected and admired as a &quot;soaring eagle&quot; by some of his colleagues.

The ship herself is pictured in the seal. On the edges of the flight deck are the words &quot;Honor, Courage, Commitment&quot; which are the United States Navy&#x27;s Core Values.

The seal, after selection by the ship&#x27;s crew, was submitted to Mrs. Margaret Stennis Womble, the ship&#x27;s sponsor and daughter of Senator Stennis, and to Mrs. John Hampton Stennis, the matron of honor and wife of Senator Stennis&#x27; son, for their approval. In February 1995 they approved the design.

==Ship&#x27;s name controversy==
The ship&#x27;s name was originally approved by then-president Ronald Reagan in 1988. As of 2021, the ship&#x27;s name was the subject of renewed controversy due to Senator Stennis&#x27;s outspoken opposition to civil rights and racial equality, and his extensive record of legislative support for racial segregation. The controversy is part of a larger reassessment of military bases, ships and other U.S. military assets named after Confederate generals and other persons associated with slavery and racial segregation.

<text>The Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party (GOP), is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States. It emerged as the main political rival of the then-dominant Democratic Party in the 1850s, and the two parties have dominated American politics since then.

The Republican Party was founded in 1854 by anti-slavery activists who opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed for the potential extension of slavery to the western territories. The party supported economic reform geared to industry, supporting investments in manufacturing, railroads, and banking. The party was successful in the North, and by 1858, it had enlisted most former Whigs and former Free Soilers to form majorities in almost every northern state. White Southerners of the planter class became alarmed at the threat to the future of slavery in the United States. With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, the Southern states seceded from the United States. Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress, the Republican Party led the fight to defeat the Confederate States in the American Civil War, thereby preserving the Union and abolishing slavery.

After the war, the party largely dominated national politics until the Great Depression in the 1930s, when it lost its congressional majorities and the Democrats&#x27; New Deal programs proved popular. Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s election in 1952 was a rare break between Democratic presidents and he presided over a period of increased economic prosperity after World War II. Following the 1960s era of civil rights legislation, enacted by Democrats, the South became more reliably Republican, and Richard Nixon carried 49 states in the 1972 election, with what he touted as his &quot;silent majority&quot;. The 1980 election of Ronald Reagan realigned national politics, bringing together advocates of free-market economics, social conservatives, and Cold War foreign policy hawks under the Republican banner. Since 2009, the party has faced significant factionalism within its own ranks and shifted towards right-wing populism. Following the 2016 presidential election of Donald Trump, the party has pivoted towards Trumpism.

In the 21st century, the Republican Party receives its strongest support from rural voters, White Southerners, evangelical Christians, men, senior citizens, and voters without college degrees. On economic issues, the party has maintained a pro-business attitude since its inception. It supports low taxes and deregulation while opposing socialism, labor unions, and single-payer healthcare. The party&#x27;s dominant populist wing also supports economic protectionism, including tariffs on imports. On social issues, it advocates for restricting abortion, supports tough on crime policies, such as capital punishment and the prohibition of recreational drug use, promotes gun ownership and easing gun restrictions, and opposes transgender rights. The party favors limited legal immigration but strongly opposes illegal immigration and favors the deportation of those without permanent legal status, such as undocumented immigrants and those with temporary protected status. In foreign policy, the party supports U.S. aid to Israel but opposes aid to Ukraine, and [[[[Russophilia|supports improving]] [[Russia–United States relations|relations with Russia]], with Trump&#x27;s ascent empowering an [[isolationism|isolationist]] &quot;[[America First (policy)|America First]]&quot; foreign policy agenda.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
====Founding and U.S. Civil War====


In 1854, the Republican Party was founded in the [[Northern United States]] by forces opposed to the expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], ex-[[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], and ex-[[Free Soilers]]. The Republican Party rapidly became the principal opposition to [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|the dominant Democratic Party]] and the briefly popular [[Know Nothing]] Party. The party grew out of opposition to the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]] and opened [[Kansas Territory|the Kansas]] and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska Territories]] to slavery and future admission as slave states. They denounced the expansion of slavery as a great evil, but did not call for complete [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]], including in the Southern states. While opposition to the expansion of slavery was the most impactful founding principle of the party, like the Whig Party it replaced, Republicans also called for economic and social [[modernization]].

At the first public meeting of the [[anti-Nebraska movement]] on March 20, 1854, at the [[Little White Schoolhouse]] in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]], the name &quot;Republican&quot; was proposed as the name of the party. The name was partly chosen to pay homage to [[Thomas Jefferson]]&#x27;s [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. The first official party convention was held on July 6, 1854, in [[Jackson, Michigan]].

The party emerged from the great political realignment of the mid-1850s, united in pro-capitalist stances with members often valuing [[Radicalism in the United States|radicalism]]. The realignment was powerful because it forced voters to switch parties, as typified by the rise and fall of the [[Know Nothing Party]], the rise of the Republican Party and the splits in the Democratic Party.

At the Republican Party&#x27;s [[1856 Republican National Convention|first National Convention in 1856]], the party adopted a national platform emphasizing opposition to the expansion of slavery into the free territories. Although Republican nominee [[John C. Frémont]] lost [[1856 United States presidential election|that year&#x27;s presidential election]] to Democrat [[James Buchanan]], Buchanan managed to win only four of the fourteen northern states. Despite the loss of the presidency and the lack of a majority in the [[U.S. Congress]], Republicans were able to orchestrate a Republican [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], the office going to [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. Historian [[James M. McPherson]] writes regarding Banks&#x27; speakership that &quot;if any one moment marked the birth of the Republican party, this was it.&quot;

The Republicans were eager for [[1860 United States elections|the 1860 elections]]. Former [[Illinois]] U.S. representative [[Abraham Lincoln]] spent several years building support within the party, campaigning heavily for Frémont in 1856 and [[1859 United States Senate election in Illinois|making a bid for the Senate in 1858]], losing to Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]] but gaining national attention from the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates]] it produced. At the [[1860 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln consolidated support among opponents of [[New York (state)|New York]] U.S. senator [[William H. Seward]], a fierce abolitionist who some Republicans feared would be too radical for crucial states such as Pennsylvania and [[Indiana]], as well as those who disapproved of his support for Irish immigrants. Lincoln was elected president in [[1860 United States presidential election|the general election]]. This election result helped kickstart the [[American Civil War]], which lasted from 1861 until 1865.

[[1864 United States presidential election|The 1864 presidential election]] united [[War Democrats]] with the GOP in support of Lincoln and [[Tennessee]] Democratic senator [[Andrew Johnson]], who ran for president and vice president on [[National Union Party (United States)|the National Union Party]] ticket; Lincoln was re-elected. Under Republican congressional leadership, the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]—which banned slavery, except as punishment for a crime—was ratified in 1865.

====Reconstruction====

Following the [[assassination of Lincoln]], Johnson ascended to the presidency. Johnson was vitriolic in his criticisms of the [[Radical Republicans]] during a national tour ahead of [[1866 United States elections|the 1866 elections]]. Anti-Johnson Republicans won a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress following the elections, which helped lead the way toward [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|his impeachment]] and near ouster from office in 1868, the same year [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was [[1868 United States presidential election|elected as the next Republican president]].

Grant was a Radical Republican, which created some division within the party. [[Massachusetts]] senator [[Charles Sumner]] and Illinois senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] opposed most of his [[Reconstruction era|Reconstructionist]] policies. Others took issue with the [[Scandals of the Ulysses S. Grant administration|large-scale corruption]] present in the [[Grant administration]], with the emerging [[Stalwarts (politics)|Stalwart faction]] defending Grant and the [[spoils system]], and [[Half-Breeds (politics)|the Half-Breeds]] advocating reform of the [[civil service]]. Republicans who opposed Grant branched off to form [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|the Liberal Republican Party]], nominating [[Horace Greeley]] in [[1872 United States presidential election|the 1872 presidential election]]. The Democratic Party attempted to capitalize on this divide in the GOP by co-nominating Greeley under their party banner. Greeley&#x27;s positions proved inconsistent with the Liberal Republican Party that nominated him, with Greeley supporting high [[Tariff in United States history|tariffs]] despite the party&#x27;s opposition. Grant was easily re-elected.

[[1876 United States presidential election|The 1876 presidential election]] saw a contentious conclusion as both parties claimed victory despite three southern states not officially declaring a winner at the end of election day. [[Voter suppression in the United States|Voter suppression]] in the South gave Republican-controlled [[returning officer]]s enough of a reason to declare that fraud, intimidation and violence had soiled the states&#x27; results. They proceeded to throw out enough Democratic votes for Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to be declared the winner. Democrats refused to accept the results and [[Electoral Commission (United States)|the Electoral Commission]] made up of members of Congress was established to decide who would be awarded the states&#x27; electors. After the Commission voted along party lines in Hayes&#x27; favor, Democrats threatened to delay the counting of electoral votes indefinitely so no president would be inaugurated on March 4. This resulted in the [[Compromise of 1877]] and Hayes finally became president.

====Gilded Age====
Hayes doubled down on the [[gold standard]], which had been signed into law by Grant with the [[Coinage Act of 1873]], as a solution to the depressed American economy in the aftermath of [[Panic of 1873|that year&#x27;s panic]]. Ahead of [[1880 United States presidential election|the 1880 presidential election]], both [[James G. Blaine]] and opponent [[John Sherman]] failed to win the Republican nomination; each then backed [[James A. Garfield]] for president. Garfield won the 1880 presidential election, but was [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|assassinated early in his term]]. His death helped create support for the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], which was passed in 1883; the bill was signed into law by Republican president [[Chester A. Arthur]], who succeeded Garfield.

In 1884, Blaine won the Republican presidential nomination, but lost [[1884 United States presidential election|the general election]] to Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]]. Cleveland was the first Democrat to be elected president since James Buchanan. Dissident Republicans, known as [[Mugwumps]], had defected from Blaine due to the corruption which had plagued his political career.

Republican [[Benjamin Harrison]] defeated Cleveland in [[1888 United States presidential election|the 1888 election]]. During his presidency, Harrison signed the [[Dependent and Disability Pension Act]], which established pensions for all veterans of the Union who had served for more than 90 days and were unable to perform manual labor. Following his loss to Cleveland in [[1892 United States presidential election|the 1892 presidential election]], Harrison unsuccessfully attempted to pass a treaty annexing [[Hawaii]] before Cleveland could be inaugurated. Most Republicans supported the proposed annexation, but Cleveland [[Opposition to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|opposed]] it.

In [[1896 United States presidential election|the 1896 presidential election]], Republican [[William McKinley]]&#x27;s platform supported the gold standard and high tariffs, having been the creator and namesake for the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890. Though having been divided on the issue prior to [[1896 Republican National Convention|that year&#x27;s National Convention]], McKinley decided to heavily favor the gold standard over [[free silver]] in his campaign messaging, but promised to continue [[bimetallism]] to ward off continued skepticism over the gold standard, which had lingered since the [[Panic of 1893]]. Democrat [[William Jennings Bryan]] proved to be a devoted adherent to the free silver movement, which cost Bryan the support of Democratic institutions such as [[Tammany Hall]], the &quot;[[New York World]]&quot; and a large majority of the Democratic Party&#x27;s upper and middle-class support. McKinley defeated Bryan and returned the presidency to Republican control until [[1912 United States presidential election|the 1912 presidential election]].

=== 20th century ===
====Progressives vs. Standpatters====

[[1896 United States presidential election|The 1896 realignment]] cemented the Republicans as the party of big businesses while president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] added more small business support by his embrace of [[trust busting]]. He handpicked his successor [[William Howard Taft]] in [[1908 United States presidential election|the 1908 election]], but they became enemies as the party split down the middle. Taft defeated Roosevelt for [[1912 Republican Party presidential primaries|the 1912 nomination]]. Roosevelt ran on the ticket of [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912–1920)|his new Progressive Party]]. He called for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|social reforms]], many of which were later championed by [[New Deal Democrats]] in the 1930s. He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they found they did not agree with the new [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative economic thinking]], leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party.

The Republicans returned to the presidency in the 1920s, winning on [[Return to normalcy|platforms of normalcy]], business-oriented efficiency, and high tariffs. The national party platform avoided mention of prohibition, instead issuing a vague commitment to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. [[Warren G. Harding]] died in 1923 and [[Calvin Coolidge]] easily defeated the splintered opposition in 1924. The pro-business policies of the decade produced an unprecedented prosperity until the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] heralded the Great Depression.

==== Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal era ====

The New Deal coalition forged by Democratic president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excluding the presidency of Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the 1950s. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, [[New Deal]] legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933. [[1934 United States elections|The 1934 elections]] left the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats. The House likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities.

The Republican Party factionalized into [[Old Right (United States)|a majority Old Right]], based predominantly in [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]], and a liberal wing based in [[Northeastern United States|the Northeast]] that supported much of the New Deal. The Old Right sharply attacked the [[Second New Deal]], saying it represented [[class warfare]] and [[Socialism in the United States|socialism]]. Roosevelt was [[1936 United States presidential election|easily re-elected president in 1936]]; however, as his second term began, [[Recession of 1937–1938|the economy declined]], strikes soared, and he [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|failed to take control of the Supreme Court]] and purge [[Conservative Democrat#1932–1948: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal coalition|the Southern conservatives]] from the Democratic Party. Republicans made a major comeback in [[1938 United States House of Representatives elections|the 1938 House elections]]. Southern conservatives joined with most Republicans to form the [[conservative coalition]], which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964. By the time of [[World War II]], both parties split on foreign policy issues, with the anti-war [[isolationists]] dominant in the Republican Party and [[Interventionism (politics)|the interventionists]] dominant in the Democratic Party. Roosevelt [[1940 United States presidential election|won a third term in 1940]] and [[1944 United States presidential election|a fourth in 1944]]. Conservatives abolished most of the New Deal during the war, but they did not attempt to do away with [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] or the agencies that regulated business.

Historian [[George H. Nash]] argues: Unlike the &quot;moderate&quot;, internationalist, largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted (or at least tolerated) some of the &quot;Roosevelt Revolution&quot; and the essential premises of President [[Harry S. Truman]]&#x27;s foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary. Anti-collectivist, [[anti-Communist]], anti-New Deal, passionately committed to [[limited government]], [[free market economics]], and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and &quot;me-too&quot; Republicans from within.

After 1945, the internationalist wing of the GOP cooperated with Truman&#x27;s [[Cold War]] foreign policy, funded the [[Marshall Plan]] and supported [[NATO]], despite the continued isolationism of the Old Right.

==== Eisenhower era ====

Eisenhower had defeated conservative leader senator [[Robert A. Taft]] for [[1952 Republican National Convention|the 1952 Republican presidential nomination]], but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the [[Eisenhower administration]]. Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position.
==== From Goldwater to Reagan ====

Historians cite [[1964 United States presidential election|the 1964 presidential election]] and [[1964 Republican National Convention|its respective National Convention]] as a significant shift, which saw the conservative wing, helmed by [[Arizona]] senator [[Barry Goldwater]], battle liberal New York governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and his eponymous [[Rockefeller Republican]] faction for the nomination. With Goldwater poised to win, Rockefeller, urged to mobilize his liberal faction, retorted, &quot;You&#x27;re looking at it, buddy. I&#x27;m all that&#x27;s left.&quot;

Following the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the southern states became more reliably Republican in presidential politics, while northeastern states became more reliably Democratic.

The GOP went on to control the White House from 1969 to 1974 under 37th president [[Richard Nixon]], and when he resigned due to the [[Watergate scandal]], [[Gerald Ford]] became the 38th president, serving until 1977. [[Ronald Reagan]] defeated incumbent Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1980 United States presidential election]].

====Reagan era====

The [[Reagan presidency]], lasting from 1981 to 1989, constituted what is known as &quot;[[Reagan era|the Reagan Revolution]]&quot;. It was seen as a fundamental shift from the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s, with the introduction of [[Reagan&#x27;s economic policies]] intended to cut taxes, prioritize government [[deregulation]] and shift funding from the domestic sphere into the military to check the [[Soviet Union]] by utilizing [[deterrence theory]]. During a visit to then-[[West Berlin]] in June 1987, he addressed Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during a speech at the [[Berlin Wall]], demanding that he &quot;[[Tear down this wall!]]&quot;. The remark was later seen as influential in the [[fall of the wall]] in 1989, and was retroactively seen as a defining achievement. The Soviet Union was [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved in 1991]]. Following Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Republican presidential candidates often claimed to share Reagan&#x27;s views and aimed to portray themselves and their policies as heirs to his legacy.

Reagan&#x27;s vice president, [[George H. W. Bush]], won the presidency in a landslide in [[1988 United States presidential election|the 1988 election]]. However, his term was characterized by division within the Republican Party. Bush&#x27;s vision of [[economic liberalization]] and international cooperation with foreign nations saw the negotiation and, during the presidency of Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] in the 1990s, the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the conceptual beginnings of the [[World Trade Organization]].

Bush [[1992 United States presidential election|lost his re-election bid in 1992]]. While there is debate about whether Perot&#x27;s candidacy cost Bush re-election, [[Charlie Cook]] asserted that Perot&#x27;s messaging carried weight with Republican and conservative voters.

==== Gingrich Revolution ====

In [[1994 United States elections|the 1994 elections]], the Republican Party, led by House minority whip [[Newt Gingrich]], who campaigned on the &quot;[[Contract with America]]&quot;, [[Republican Revolution|won majorities in both chambers of Congress, gained 12 governorships, and regained control of 20 state legislatures]]. The Republican Party won control of the House of Representatives for the first time [[1952 United States House of Representatives elections|in 40 years]], and won a majority of U.S. House seats in the South for the first time since Reconstruction.

However, most voters had not heard of the Contract and the Republican victory was attributed to traditional mid-term anti-incumbent voting and Republicans becoming the majority party in the South for the first time since Reconstruction, winning many former [[Southern Democrats]]. Gingrich was made speaker, and within the first 100 days of the Republican majority, every proposition featured in the Contract was passed, with the exception of term limits for members of Congress. One key to Gingrich&#x27;s success in 1994 was nationalizing the election, which in turn led to his becoming a national figure during [[1996 United States House of Representatives elections|the 1996 House elections]], with many Democratic leaders proclaiming Gingrich was a zealous radical. Gingrich&#x27;s strategy of &quot;[[constitutional hardball]]&quot; resulted in increasing [[Political polarization in the United States|political polarization]] driven primarily by Republicans. The Republicans maintained their majority for the first time [[1928 United States House of Representatives elections|since 1928]] despite [[Bob Dole]] losing handily to Clinton in [[1996 United States presidential election|the presidential election]]. However, Gingrich&#x27;s national profile proved a detriment to the Republican Congress, which enjoyed majority approval among voters in spite of Gingrich&#x27;s relative unpopularity.

After Gingrich and the Republicans struck a deal with Clinton on the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]], which included tax cuts, the Republican House majority had difficulty convening on a new agenda ahead of [[1998 United States House of Representatives elections|the 1998 elections]]. During the ongoing [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] in 1998, Gingrich decided to make Clinton&#x27;s misconduct the party message heading into the elections, believing it would add to their majority. The strategy proved mistaken and the Republicans lost five seats, though whether it was due to poor messaging or Clinton&#x27;s popularity providing a [[coattail effect]] is debated. Gingrich was ousted from party power due to the performance, ultimately deciding to resign from Congress altogether. For a short time afterward, it appeared [[Louisiana]] representative [[Bob Livingston]] would become his successor; Livingston, however, stepped down from consideration and resigned from Congress after damaging reports of affairs threatened the Republican House&#x27;s legislative agenda if he were to serve as speaker. Illinois representative [[Dennis Hastert]] was promoted to speaker in Livingston&#x27;s place, serving in that position until 2007.

=== 21st century ===
==== George W. Bush ====
Republican [[George W. Bush]] won [[2000 United States presidential election|the 2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential elections]]. He campaigned as a &quot;[[compassionate conservative]]&quot; in 2000, wanting to better appeal to immigrants and minority voters. The goal was to prioritize drug rehabilitation programs and aid for prisoner reentry into society, intending to capitalize on President Clinton&#x27;s tougher crime initiatives such as his [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act|1994 crime bill]]. The platform failed to gain much traction among members of the party during his presidency.

The Republican Party remained fairly cohesive for much of the 2000s, as both strong [[economic libertarians]] and [[social conservatives]] opposed the Democrats, whom they saw as the party of bloated, secular, and liberal government. This period saw the rise of &quot;pro-government conservatives&quot;—a core part of the Bush&#x27;s base—a considerable group of the Republicans who advocated for increased government spending, greater regulation, and an activist and interventionist foreign policy. Survey groups such as the [[Pew Research Center]] found that social conservatives and free market advocates remained the other two main groups within the party&#x27;s coalition of support, with all three roughly equal in number. However, [[Libertarian Republican|libertarians]] and [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarian-leaning conservatives]] increasingly found fault with what they saw as Republicans&#x27; restricting of vital [[Civil liberties in the United States|civil liberties]] while [[corporate welfare]] and [[National debt of the United States|the national debt]] hiked considerably under Bush&#x27;s tenure. In contrast, some social conservatives expressed dissatisfaction with the party&#x27;s support for economic policies that conflicted with their moral values.

Democrats gained control of the Senate on June 6, 2001. The Republicans regained the Senate majority in [[2002 United States Senate elections|the 2002 elections]], helped by Bush&#x27;s surge in popularity following the [[September 11 attacks]], and Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained control of both chambers in [[2006 United States elections|the 2006 elections]], largely due to increasing opposition to the [[Iraq War]].

In [[2008 United States presidential election|the 2008 presidential election]], Arizona Republican senator [[John McCain]] was defeated by Illinois Democratic senator [[Barack Obama]].

==== Tea Party movement ====

The Republicans experienced electoral success in [[2010 United States elections|the 2010 elections]]. The 2010 elections coincided with the ascendancy of the [[Tea Party movement]], an [[anti-Obama protest]] movement of [[fiscal conservatives]]. Members of the movement called for lower [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]], and a reduction of the national debt and [[federal budget deficit]] through decreased [[United States federal budget|government spending]]. The Tea Party movement was also described as a popular constitutional movement comprising [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]], [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]], and conservative activism.

The Tea Party movement&#x27;s electoral success began with [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]]&#x27;s upset win in the [[2010 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts|January Senate special election in Massachusetts]]; the seat had been held for decades by Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]]. In November, Republicans [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections|recaptured control of the House]], [[2010 United States Senate elections|increased their number of seats in the Senate]], and [[2010 United States gubernatorial elections|gained a majority of governorships]]. The Tea Party would go on to strongly influence the Republican Party, in part due to the replacement of establishment Republicans with Tea Party-style Republicans.

When Obama [[2012 United States presidential election|was re-elected president in 2012]], defeating Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the Republican Party [[2012 United States House of Representatives elections|lost seven seats in the House]], but still retained control of that chamber. However, Republicans were [[2012 United States Senate elections|unable to gain control of the Senate]]. In the aftermath of the loss, some prominent Republicans spoke out against their own party. A 2012 election post-mortem by the Republican Party concluded that the party needed to do more on the national level to attract votes from minorities and young voters. In March 2013, Republican National Committee chairman [[Reince Priebus]] issued a report on the party&#x27;s electoral failures in 2012, calling on Republicans to reinvent themselves and officially endorse immigration reform. He proposed 219 reforms, including a $10 million marketing campaign to reach women, minorities, and gay people; the setting of a shorter, more controlled primary season; and the creation of better data collection facilities.

Following [[2014 United States elections|the 2014 elections]], the Republican Party [[2014 United States Senate elections|took control of the Senate]] by gaining nine seats. With 247 seats in the House and 54 seats in the Senate, the Republicans ultimately achieved their largest majority in the Congress since [[71st United States Congress|the 71st Congress]] in 1929.

==== Trump era ====
In [[2016 United States presidential election|the 2016 presidential election]], Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] defeated Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]. The result was unexpected; polls leading up to the election showed Clinton leading the race. Trump&#x27;s victory was fueled by narrow victories in three states—[[Michigan]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wisconsin]]—that had been part of the [[Blue wall (U.S. politics)|Democratic blue wall]] for decades. It was attributed to strong support amongst working-class white voters, who felt dismissed and disrespected by the political establishment. Trump became popular with them by abandoning Republican establishment orthodoxy in favor of a broader nationalist message. His election accelerated the Republican Party&#x27;s shift towards right-wing populism and resulted in decreasing influence among its conservative factions.

After [[2016 United States elections|the 2016 elections]], Republicans [[2016 United States Senate elections|maintained their majority in the Senate]], [[2016 United States House of Representatives elections|the House]], and [[2016 United States gubernatorial elections|governorships]], and wielded newly acquired executive power with Trump&#x27;s election. The Republican Party controlled 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017, the most it had held in history. The Party also held 33 governorships, the most it had held since 1922. The party had total control of government in 25 states, the most since 1952. The opposing Democratic Party held full control of only five states in 2017. In [[2018 United States elections|the 2018 elections]], Republicans lost control of the House, but strengthened their hold on the Senate.

Over the course of his presidency, Trump appointed three justices to [[Supreme Court of the United States|the Supreme Court]]: [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]]. Trump [[List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump|appointed 260 judges]] in total, creating [[Judicial appointment history for United States federal courts|overall Republican-appointed majorities on every branch of the federal judiciary]] except for the [[Court of International Trade]] by the time he left office, shifting the court system to the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. Other notable achievements during his presidency included the passing of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] in 2017; the creation of the [[U.S. Space Force]], the first new independent military service since 1947; and the brokering of the [[Abraham Accords]], a series of normalization agreements between [[Israel]] and various [[Arab states]]. The second half of his term was increasingly controversial, as he implemented a [[Trump administration family separation policy|family separation policy for migrants]], deployed [[2020 deployment of federal forces in the United States|federal law enforcement forces]] in response to [[George Floyd protests|racial protests]] and reacted slowly to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]] before clashing with health officials over testing and treatment. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On February 5, 2020, the Senate voted to acquit him.

Trump lost [[2020 United States presidential election|the 2020 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Joe Biden]]. He refused to concede the race, claiming widespread electoral fraud and [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election|attempting to overturn the results]]. On January 6, 2021, the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack|United States Capitol was attacked by Trump supporters]] following a rally at which Trump spoke. After the attack, the House [[Second impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached Trump for a second time]] on the charge of [[Sedition|incitement of insurrection]], making him the only federal officeholder to be impeached twice. Trump left office on January 20, 2021. His impeachment trial continued into the early weeks of the [[Biden presidency]], and he was [[Second impeachment trial of Donald Trump|acquitted on February 13, 2021]]. Since the 2020 election, [[Election denial movement in the United States|election denial]] has become increasingly mainstream in the party, with the majority of 2022 Republican candidates being election deniers. The party also made [[Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election|efforts to restrict voting]] based on false claims of fraud. By 2020, the Republican Party had greatly shifted towards [[Illiberal democracy|illiberalism]] following the election of Trump, and research conducted by the [[V-Dem Institute]] concluded that the party was more similar to Europe&#x27;s most right-wing parties such as [[Law and Justice]] in Poland or [[Fidesz]] in Hungary.

In 2022 and 2023, Supreme Court justices appointed by Trump proved decisive in landmark decisions on [[New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen|gun rights]], [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization|abortion]], and [[Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard|affirmative action]]. The party went into the [[2022 United States elections|2022 elections]] confident and with analysts predicting a [[Wave elections in the United States|red wave]], but it ultimately underperformed expectations, with voters in [[swing state]]s and competitive districts joining Democrats in rejecting candidates who had been endorsed by Trump or who had denied the results of the 2020 election. The party won control of the House with a narrow majority, but lost the Senate and several state legislative majorities and governorships. The results led to a number of Republicans and conservative thought leaders questioning whether Trump should continue as the party&#x27;s main figurehead and leader.

Despite the 2022 midterm disappointments, Trump [[2024 Republican Party presidential primaries|easily won the nomination]] to be the party&#x27;s candidate in [[2024 United States presidential election|2024]], marking the third straight election he was the GOP nominee. Trump - who survived two assassination attempts during the campaign - achieved victory against Vice President [[Kamala Harris]], who replaced President Biden on the Democratic ticket after his withdrawal in July, winning the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]] 312–226, becoming the first Republican to win the popular vote since [[George W. Bush]] in 2004, and (relative to the 2020 election) improving his vote share among [[Working class in the United States|working class]] voters, particularly among young men, those without college degrees, and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] voters. The Republicans also held the House (albeit with a slim majority) and retook control of the Senate, securing the first [[Government trifecta|Republican federal trifecta]] since Trump&#x27;s first presidency in 2017.

==== Current status ====
As of 2025, the GOP holds the presidency, and majorities in both the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[U.S. Senate]], giving them a federal [[government trifecta]]. It also holds 27 [[List of United States governors|state governorships]], 28 [[List of United States state legislatures|state legislatures]], and 23 state government trifectas. Six of the nine current [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices were appointed by Republican presidents. There have been 19 Republicans who have served as president, the most from any one political party, the most recent being current president [[Donald Trump]], who became the 47th president on January 20, 2025. Trump also served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.

== Name and symbols ==
The Republican Party&#x27;s founding members chose its name as homage to the values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] promoted by Democratic-Republican Party, which its founder, Thomas Jefferson, called the &quot;Republican Party&quot;. The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party&#x27;s leading publicist, Horace Greeley, who called for &quot;some simple name like &#x27;Republican&#x27; [that] would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery&quot;. The name reflects the 1776 republican values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption. &quot;Republican&quot; has a variety of meanings around the world, and the Republican Party has evolved such that the meanings no longer always align.

The term &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party, and the abbreviation &quot;GOP&quot; is a commonly used designation. The term originated in 1875 in the &quot;[[Congressional Record]]&quot;, referring to the party associated with the successful military defense of the Union as &quot;this gallant old party&quot;. The following year in an article in the &quot;[[Cincinnati Commercial]]&quot;, the term was modified to &quot;grand old party&quot;. The first use of the abbreviation is dated 1884.

The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant. A political cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]], published in &quot;[[Harper&#x27;s Weekly]]&quot; on November 7, 1874, is considered the first important use of the symbol. An alternate symbol of the Republican Party in states such as Indiana, New York and Ohio is the bald eagle as opposed to the Democratic rooster or the Democratic five-pointed star. In [[Kentucky]], the [[log cabin]] is a symbol of the Republican Party.

Traditionally the party had no consistent color identity. After the 2000 presidential election, the color [[Political colour|red became associated]] with Republicans. During and after the election, the major broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: states won by Republican nominee George W. Bush were colored red and states won by Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]] were colored blue. Due to the weeks-long [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|dispute over the election results]], these color associations became firmly ingrained, persisting in subsequent years. Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal, the media has come to represent the respective political parties using these colors. The party and its candidates have also come to embrace the color red.

== Factions ==
=== Civil War and Reconstruction era ===

The [[Radical Republicans]] were a major factor of the party from its inception in 1854 until the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] in 1877. They strongly opposed [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], were hard-line [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]], and later advocated equal rights for the [[freedmen]] and women. They were heavily influenced by religious ideals and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]]. Radical Republicans pressed for abolition as a major war aim and they opposed the moderate Reconstruction plans of Abraham Lincoln as both too lenient on the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] and not going far enough to help former slaves. After the war&#x27;s end and Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, the Radicals clashed with [[Andrew Johnson]] over Reconstruction policy. Radicals led efforts to establish civil rights for former slaves and fully implement emancipation, pushing the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] for statutory protections through [[United States Congress|Congress]]. They opposed allowing ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officers to retake political power in the [[Southern U.S.]], and emphasized liberty, equality, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] which provided [[voting rights]] for the [[Freedman#United States|freedmen]]. Many later became [[Stalwarts]], who supported machine politics.

[[Moderate Republicans (Reconstruction era)|Moderate Republicans]] were known for their loyal support of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]&#x27;s war policies and expressed antipathy towards the more militant stances advocated by the Radical Republicans. In contrast to Radicals, Moderate Republicans were less enthusiastic on the issue of Black suffrage even while embracing civil equality and the expansive federal authority observed throughout the [[American Civil War]]. They were also skeptical of the lenient, conciliatory Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson. Members of the Moderate Republicans comprised in part of previous Radical Republicans who became disenchanted with the alleged corruption of the latter faction. They generally opposed efforts by Radical Republicans to rebuild the Southern U.S. under an economically mobile, [[Free market|free-market]] system.

=== 20th century ===

The 20th century saw the Republican party split into an [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and a moderate-liberal faction in the Northeast that eventually became known as [[Rockefeller Republicans]]. Opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s [[New Deal]] saw the formation of the [[conservative coalition]]. The 1950s saw [[fusionism]] of traditionalist and social conservatism and right-libertarianism, along with the rise of the [[New Right#United States|First New Right]] to be followed in 1964 with a more populist [[New Right#Second New Right|Second New Right]].

The rise of the [[Reagan coalition]] in the 1980s began what has been called the [[Reagan era]]. Reagan&#x27;s rise displaced the liberal-moderate faction of the GOP and established Reagan-style conservatism as the prevailing ideological faction of the Party for the next thirty years, until the rise of the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] faction. Reagan conservatives generally supported policies that favored [[limited government]], [[individualism]], [[tradition]]alism, [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], and limited [[Federal government of the United States|federal governmental]] power [[States&#x27; rights|in relation]] to [[U.S. state|the states]].

=== 21st century ===
Republicans began the 21st century with the election of [[George W. Bush]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election]] and saw the peak of a [[neoconservative]] faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the [[September 11 attacks]] through the [[War on Terror]]. The election of [[Barack Obama]] saw the formation of the [[Tea Party movement]] in 2009 that coincided with a global rise in [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] movements from the 2010s to 2020s. The global rise in right-wing populism has been attributed to factors including higher educational attainment, a decline in organized religion, and backlash to globalization.

Right-wing populism became an increasingly dominant ideological faction within the GOP throughout the 2010s and helped lead to the election of [[Donald Trump]] in 2016. Starting in the 1970s and accelerating in the 2000s, American right-wing interest groups invested heavily in external mobilization vehicles that led to the organizational weakening of the GOP establishment. The outsize role of conservative media, in particular [[Fox News]], led to it being followed and trusted more by the Republican base over traditional party elites. The depletion of organizational capacity partly led to Trump&#x27;s victory in the Republican primaries against the wishes of a very weak party establishment and traditional power brokers. Trump&#x27;s election exacerbated internal schisms within the GOP, and saw the GOP move from a center coalition of moderates and conservatives to a solidly right-wing party hostile to liberal views and any deviations from the party line.

The Party has since faced intense factionalism. These factions are particularly apparent in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], where three Republican House leaders ([[Eric Cantor]], [[John Boehner]], and [[Kevin McCarthy]]) have been ousted since 2009. All three of the top Republican elected officials during Trump&#x27;s first term (Vice President, Speaker of the House, and Senate Republican leader) were ousted or stepped down by Trump&#x27;s second term.

The victory of Trump in the 2024 presidential election saw the party increasingly shift towards [[Trumpism]], and party criticism of Trump was described as being muted to non-existent. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as a &quot;hostile takeover&quot;, and a victory of right-wing populism over the old conservative establishment. Polling found that 53% of Republican voters saw loyalty to Trump as central to their political identity and what it means to be a Republican. During Trump&#x27;s second presidency, Republican members of Congress were described by [[The New Republic]] magazine as submissive to Trump, letting him dictate policies without pushback.

==== Conservatives ====

Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential election in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] established Reagan-style [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] as the dominant ideological faction of the Republican Party until the election of Donald Trump in 2016. Trump&#x27;s 2016 election split both the GOP and larger conservative movement into [[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)#Trumpists|Trumpist]] and [[Never Trump movement|anti-Trump]] factions. Demographically, the party has lost majority support from white voters with college degrees, while continuing to gain among voters without college degrees.

The party&#x27;s [[The Establishment#United States|establishment]] conservative faction has lost all of its influence, except for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Many conservatives critical of the Trumpist faction have also lost influence within the party, with no former Republican presidential or vice presidential nominees attending the [[2024 Republican National Convention]].

Trump&#x27;s first vice president [[Mike Pence]] has since distanced himself from Trump and did not endorse him in the 2024 presidential election. Likewise, Trump decided not to have Pence as his vice president again, instead choosing JD Vance. [[Mitch McConnell]], who previously served as Senate Republican leader for 18 years (2007–2025), stepped down as leader in 2025 and will retire in 2026 due to declining health and age, as well as disagreements with Trump. McConnell was described as the last powerful member of the Republican establishment, with his retirement marking its end.

The [[Roberts Court]] (2005–present), three of whose members were appointed by Trump as of 2024, has been described as the most conservative Supreme Court since the [[Vinson Court]] (1946-1953). It represents the last of the Republican establishment, with [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] the only Republican leader before Trump to have maintained office during Trump&#x27;s second term.

The party still maintains long-time ideologically conservative positions on many issues. Traditional modern conservatives combine support for free-market economic policies with [[social conservatism]] and a hawkish approach to foreign policy. Other parts of the conservative movement are composed of [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]] and [[deficit hawk]]s.

In foreign policy, [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] are a small faction of the GOP that support an [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] and increased military spending. They previously held significant influence in the early 2000s in planning the initial response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] through the [[War on Terror]]. Since the election of Trump in 2016, neoconservatism has declined and [[non-interventionism]] and [[isolationism]] has grown among elected federal Republican officeholders.

Long-term shifts in conservative thinking following the elections of Trump have been described as a &quot;new fusionism&quot; of traditional conservative ideology and right-wing populist themes. These have resulted in shifts towards greater support for [[national conservatism]], [[protectionism]], [[cultural conservatism]], a more [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] foreign policy, a conspiracist sub-culture, a repudiation of [[neoconservatism]], reduced efforts to roll back entitlement programs, and a disdain for traditional checks and balances. There are significant divisions within the party on the issues of [[abortion]] and LGBT rights.

Conservative caucuses include the [[Republican Study Committee]] and [[Freedom Caucus]].

==== Right-wing populists ====


[[Right-wing populism]] is the dominant political faction of the GOP. Sometimes referred to as the [[Make America Great Again|MAGA]] or &quot;[[America First (policy)|America First]]&quot; movement, Republican populists have been described as consisting of a range of right-wing ideologies including but not limited to right-wing populism, [[national conservatism]], [[neo-nationalism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhou_12/8/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trumpism]].

The Republican Party&#x27;s right-wing populist movements emerged in concurrence with a global increase in populist movements in the 2010s and 2020s, coupled with entrenchment and increased partisanship within the party since 2010. This included the rise of the [[Tea Party movement]], which has also been described as far-right.

Businessman [[Elon Musk]], the wealthiest individual in the world, is a notable proponent of right-wing populism. Since acquiring Twitter in 2022, Musk has shared far-right misinformation and numerous [[conspiracy theories]], and his views are described as right-wing to far-right.

According to political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins, the Republican Party&#x27;s gains among white voters without college degrees and corresponding losses among white voters with college degrees contributed to the rise of right-wing populism. Until 2016, white voters with college degrees were a Republican-leaning group, but have since become a Democratic-leaning group. In the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], [[Joe Biden]] became the first Democratic president to win a majority of white voters with college degrees (51–48%) since [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], while Trump won white voters without college degrees 67–32%. Right-wing populism has broad appeal across income and wealth, but is extremely polarized with respect to educational attainment among White voters, and has little appeal to African American voters.

According to historian [[Gary Gerstle]], Trumpism gained support in opposition to [[neoliberalism]], including opposition to [[free trade]], [[Opposition to immigration|immigration]], [[Globalization#Economic globalization|globalization]], and [[Liberal internationalism|internationalism]]. Trump won the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections by winning states in the [[Rust Belt]] that had suffered from [[population decline]] and [[deindustrialization]], specifically [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. Compared to other Republicans, the populist faction is more likely to oppose [[immigration|legal immigration]], free trade, [[neoconservatism]], and [[Environmentalism|environmental protection laws]]. It has been described as featuring [[anti-intellectualism]] and overtly racial appeals.

In international relations, populists support U.S. aid to Israel but not to Ukraine. They are generally [[Russophilia|supportive of improving relations with Russia]], and favor an [[isolationism|isolationist]] &quot;[[America First (policy)|America First]]&quot; foreign policy agenda.

The party&#x27;s far-right faction includes members of the [[Freedom Caucus]]. Former representative [[Matt Gaetz]], who is affiliated with the populist faction, led [[Removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House|the 2023 rebellion against then-Speaker of the House]] [[Kevin McCarthy]]. Former Democratic Representative [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who joined the Republican Party in 2024, has also been described as embracing populist policies. They generally reject compromise within the party and with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and are willing to oust fellow Republican office holders they deem to be too moderate. According to sociologist [[Joe Feagin]], political polarization by racially extremist Republicans as well as their increased attention from conservative media has perpetuated the near extinction of moderate Republicans and created legislative paralysis at numerous government levels in the last few decades.

[[Julia Azari]], an associate professor of political science at [[Marquette University]], noted that not all populist Republicans are public supporters of Donald Trump, and that some Republicans such as [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Glenn Youngkin]] endorse Trump policies while distancing themselves from Trump as a person. The continued dominance of Trump within the GOP has limited the success of this strategy. In 2024, Trump led a takeover of the [[Republican National Committee]], installing [[Lara Trump]] as its new co-chair.

A &quot;[[FiveThirtyEight]]&quot; analysis found that of the 293 Republican members of Congress on January 20, 2017 (52 Senators and 241 Representatives), just 121 (41%) were left on January 20, 2025. There were many reasons for the turnover, including retirements and deaths, losing general and primary elections, seeking other office, etc., but the extent of the change is still stark. There were 273 Republican members of Congress on January 20, 2025 (53 Senators and 220 Representatives). Trump also changed his vice president, from Mike Pence to JD Vance, and both houses of Congress had changed their top leadership, from Paul Ryan to Mike Johnson in the House and Mitch McConnell to John Thune in the Senate.

==== Christian right ====


Since the rise of the [[Christian right]] in the 1970s, the Republican Party has drawn significant support from [[evangelicals]], [[Mormons]], and [[Traditionalist Catholicism|traditionalist]] [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholics]], partly due to [[opposition to abortion]] after &quot;[[Roe v. Wade]].&quot; The Christian right faction is characterized by strong support of [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] and [[Christian nationalism|Christian nationalist]] policies. Christian conservatives seek to use the teachings of [[Christianity]] to influence law and public policy. Compared to other Republicans, the socially conservative [[Religious right in the United States|Christian right]] faction of the party is more likely to oppose [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|marijuana legalization]], and support [[Abortion law in the United States by state|significantly restricting the legality of abortion]].

The Christian right is strongest in the [[Bible Belt]], which covers most of the [[Southern United States]]. [[Mike Pence]], Donald Trump&#x27;s vice president from 2017 to 2021, was a member of the Christian right. In October 2023, a member of the Christian right faction, Louisiana representative [[Mike Johnson]], was elected the 56th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

==== Libertarians ====
The Republican Party has a [[right-libertarian|libertarian]] faction. This faction of the party is most popular in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Western United States]]. Libertarianism emerged from [[fusionism]] in the 1950s and 60s. [[Barry Goldwater]] had a substantial impact on the conservative-libertarian movement of the 1960s. Compared to other Republicans, they are more likely to favor the [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalization of marijuana]], [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] such as [[same-sex marriage]], [[gun rights]], oppose [[Surveillance|mass surveillance]], and support reforms to current laws surrounding [[Civil forfeiture in the United States|civil asset forfeiture]]. Right-wing libertarians are [[Libertarian perspectives on abortion|strongly divided on the subject of abortion]]. Prominent libertarian conservatives within the Republican Party include [[Rand Paul]], a U.S. senator from [[Kentucky]], [[Kentucky&#x27;s 4th congressional district]] congressman [[Thomas Massie]], and Utah senator [[Mike Lee]].

During the [[2024 United States elections]], the Republican Party adopted pro-[[cryptocurrency]] policies, which were originally advocated by the libertarian wing of the party. As the Republican presidential nominee, [[Donald Trump]] addressed the [[2024 Libertarian National Convention]], pledging support for cryptocurrency, opposing [[central bank digital currency]] and expressing support for the commutation of [[Ross Ulbricht]]. Trump&#x27;s 2024 campaign featured greater influence from [[technolibertarian]] elements, particularly [[Elon Musk]], who was subsequently nominated to lead the [[Department of Government Efficiency]] (DOGE).

==== Moderates ====
Moderates in the Republican Party are an ideologically centrist group that predominantly come from the [[Northeastern United States]], and are typically located in [[swing state]]s or [[Red states and blue states|blue states]]. Moderate Republican voters are typically highly educated, affluent, fiscally conservative, socially moderate or liberal and often [[Never Trump movement|&quot;Never Trump&quot;]]. While they sometimes share the economic views of other Republicans (i.e. [[tax cuts|lower taxes]], [[deregulation]], and [[welfare reform]]), moderate Republicans differ in that some are for [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]], [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights and same-sex marriage]], legal access to and even public funding for [[abortion debate|abortion]], [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] laws, more [[environmental regulation]] and action on [[climate change]], fewer restrictions on [[immigration]] and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. In the 21st century, some former Republican moderates have switched to the Democratic Party, and the faction is in decline.

Notable moderate Republicans include Senators [[Lisa Murkowski]] of Alaska and [[Susan Collins]] of Maine, Nevada governor [[Joe Lombardo]], Vermont governor [[Phil Scott]], New Hampshire governor [[Kelly Ayotte]], and former Maryland governor [[Larry Hogan]].

== Political positions ==
=== Economic policies ===
Republicans believe that [[free market]]s and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity. Reduction in income taxes, especially for those with higher incomes, is a core component of Republicans&#x27; fiscal agenda.

====Taxes====
Tax cuts have been at the core of Republican economic policy since 1980. At the national level and state level, Republicans tend to pursue policies of tax cuts and deregulation. Modern Republicans advocate the theory of [[supply side economics|supply-side economics]], which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth. Many Republicans oppose [[progressive taxation|higher tax rates for higher earners]], which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth. They believe private spending is more efficient than government spending. Republican lawmakers have also sought to limit funding for tax enforcement and [[Revenue service|tax collection]].

As per a 2021 study that measured Republicans&#x27; congressional votes, the modern Republican Party&#x27;s economic policy positions tend to align with business interests and the affluent.

====Spending====
Republicans advocate in favor of [[fiscal conservatism]]. Republican administrations have, since the late 1960s, supported underfunded sectors like national defense, veterans affairs, and infrastructure.

====Entitlements====
Republicans believe individuals should take responsibility for their own circumstances. They also believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor through [[Charity (practice)|charity]] than the government is through welfare programs and that social assistance programs often cause government dependency. As of November 2022, all 11 states that had not expanded Medicaid had Republican-controlled [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]].

====Labor unions and the minimum wage====
The Republican Party is generally opposed to labor unions. Republicans believe corporations should be able to establish their own employment practices, including benefits and wages, with the free market deciding the price of work. Since the 1920s, Republicans have generally been opposed by [[Trade union|labor union]] organizations and members. At the national level, Republicans supported the [[Taft–Hartley Act]] of 1947, which gives workers the right not to participate in unions. Modern Republicans at the state level generally support various [[right-to-work laws]].

Most Republicans also oppose increases in the [[minimum wage]].

====Trade====
The Republican Party has taken widely varying views on [[international trade]] throughout its history, but has usually been in favor of protectionism. The official Republican Party platform adopted in 2024 opposes free trade and supports enacting [[history of tariffs in the United States|tariffs]] on imports.

In both of his terms as president, Trump enacted tariffs on imports to the United States. In particular, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China in February 2025. Trump has expressed his admiration for Republican [[William McKinley]]&#x27;s trade policies. McKinley was the author of the [[McKinley Tariff|Tariff Act of 1890]], and both Trump and McKinley nicknamed themselves as a &quot;[[Tariff Man]]&quot;.

At its inception, the Republican Party supported [[Tariffs in United States history|protective tariffs]]. Abraham Lincoln enacted tariffs during the Civil War. The great battle over the high [[Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act]] in 1910 caused a split in the party. The [[Reciprocal Tariff Act]] of 1934 marked a sharp departure from the era of [[protectionism]] in the United States. American duties on foreign products declined from an average of 46% in 1934 to 12% by 1962, which included the presidency of Republican president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After World War II, the U.S. promoted the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) established in 1947, to minimize tariffs and other restrictions, and to liberalize trade among all capitalist countries.
During the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] administrations, Republicans abandoned protectionist policies and came out against quotas and in favor of the GATT and the [[World Trade Organization]] policy of minimal economic barriers to global trade. Free trade with Canada came about as a result of the [[Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] of 1987, which led in 1994 to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) based on Reagan&#x27;s plan to enlarge the scope of the market for American firms to include Canada and Mexico. President [[Bill Clinton]], with strong Republican support in 1993, pushed NAFTA through Congress over the vehement objection of labor unions.

The 2016 election marked a return to supporting protectionism, beginning with [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump&#x27;s first presidency]]. In 2017, only 36% of Republicans agreed that free trade agreements are good for the [[United States]], compared to 67% of Democrats. When asked if free trade has helped respondents specifically, the approval numbers for Democrats drop to 54%, however approval ratings among Republicans remain relatively unchanged at 34%. During his presidency, Trump withdrew the United States from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]], initiated a [[China-United States trade war|trade war]] with China, and negotiated the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement|USMCA]] as a successor to NAFTA.

Trump also blocked appointments to the [[Appellate Body]] of the [[World Trade Organization]], rendering it unable to enforce and punish violators of WTO rules. Subsequently, disregard for trade rules has increased, leading to more trade protectionist measures. The [[Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration|Biden administration]] has maintained Trump&#x27;s freeze on new appointments.

==== Environmental policies ====

Historically, [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] leaders in the Republican Party supported [[environmental protection]]. Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a prominent [[Conservation (ethic)|conservationist]] whose policies eventually led to the creation of the [[National Park Service]]. While Republican President [[Richard Nixon]] was not an environmentalist, he signed legislation to create the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970 and had a comprehensive environmental program. However, this position has changed since the 1980s and the administration of President [[Ronald Reagan]], who labeled environmental regulations a burden on the economy. Since then, Republicans have increasingly taken positions against environmental regulation, with many Republicans rejecting the [[scientific consensus on climate change]]. Republican voters are divided over the human causes of climate change and global warming. Since 2008, many members of the Republican Party have been criticized for being [[Anti-environmentalism|anti-environmentalist]] and promoting [[climate change denial]] in opposition to the general [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]], making them unique even among other worldwide conservative parties.

In 2006, then-[[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] broke from Republican orthodoxy to sign several bills imposing caps on [[carbon emissions]] in California. Then-President [[George W. Bush]] opposed mandatory caps at a national level. Bush&#x27;s decision not to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant was [[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency|challenged in the Supreme Court by 12 states]], with the court ruling against the Bush administration in 2007. Bush also publicly opposed ratification of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]s which sought to limit greenhouse gas emissions and thereby [[climate change mitigation|combat climate change]]; his position was heavily criticized by climate scientists.

The Republican Party rejects [[Emissions trading|cap-and-trade]] policy to limit carbon emissions. In the 2000s, Senator [[John McCain]] proposed bills (such as the [[McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act]]) that would have regulated carbon emissions, but his position on climate change was unusual among high-ranking party members. Some Republican candidates have supported the development of [[alternative fuel]]s in order to achieve [[U.S. energy independence|energy independence for the United States]]. Some Republicans support increased [[oil well|oil drilling]] in protected areas such as the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], a position that has drawn criticism from activists.

Many Republicans during the [[presidency of Barack Obama]] opposed his administration&#x27;s new environmental regulations, such as those on carbon emissions from coal. In particular, many Republicans supported building the [[Keystone Pipeline]]; this position was supported by businesses, but opposed by indigenous peoples&#x27; groups and environmental activists.

According to the [[Center for American Progress]], a non-profit liberal advocacy group, more than 55% of congressional Republicans were [[climate change denial|climate change deniers]] in 2014. [[PolitiFact]] in May 2014 found &quot;relatively few Republican members of Congress ... accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that [[global warming]] is both real and man-made.&quot; The group found eight members who acknowledged it, although the group acknowledged there could be more and that not all members of Congress have taken a stance on the issue.

From 2008 to 2017, the Republican Party went from &quot;debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist&quot;, according to &quot;[[The New York Times]]&quot;. In January 2015, the Republican-led U.S. Senate voted 98–1 to pass a resolution acknowledging that &quot;climate change is real and is not a hoax&quot;; however, an amendment stating that &quot;human activity significantly contributes to climate change&quot; was supported by only five Republican senators.

==== Health care ====
The party opposes a [[single-payer health care]] system, describing it as [[socialized medicine]]. It also opposes the [[Affordable Care Act]] and expansions of Medicaid. Historically, there have been diverse and overlapping views within both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party on the role of government in health care, but the two parties became highly polarized on the topic during 2008–2009 and onwards.

Both Republicans and Democrats made various proposals to establish federally funded aged health insurance prior to the bipartisan effort to establish [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965. No Republican member of Congress voted for the [[Affordable Care Act]] in 2009, and after it passed, the party made frequent attempts to repeal it. At the state level, the party has tended to adopt a position against [[Medicaid expansion]].

By 2020, Republican officials have increasingly adopted [[anti-vaccine activism]] and policy.

=== Foreign policy ===
The Republican Party has a persistent history of skepticism and opposition to [[multilateralism]] in American foreign policy. [[Neoconservatism]], which supports [[unilateralism]] and emphasizes the use of force and hawkishness in American foreign policy, has had some influence in all Republican presidential administration since Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency. Some, including [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], call for [[non-interventionism]] and an [[isolationism|isolationist]] &quot;[[America First (policy)|America First]]&quot; foreign policy agenda. This faction gained strength starting in 2016 with the rise of Donald Trump, demanding that the United States reset its previous [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy and encourage allies and partners to take greater responsibility for their own defense.

==== Israel ====
During the 1940s, Republicans predominantly opposed the cause of an independent Jewish state due to the influence of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]]. In 1948, Democratic President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] became the first world leader to recognize an independent state of Israel, though Truman&#x27;s pro-Israel stance had the notable support of [[Robert A. Taft]], a leading Senate Republican and an early advocate for military support to Israel.

The rise of [[neoconservatism]] saw the Republican Party become predominantly pro-Israel by the 1990s and 2000s, although notable anti-Israel sentiment persisted through [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] figures such as [[Pat Buchanan]]. As president, Donald Trump generally supported Israel during most of his term, but became increasingly critical of Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] towards the end of it. After the [[7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel]], Trump blamed Netanyahu for having failed to prevent the attack. Trump previously criticized the [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[West Bank]] and expressed doubt about whether Netanyahu truly desired peace with the Palestinians. According to &quot;[[I24NEWS (Israeli TV channel)|i24NEWS]]&quot;, the 2020s have seen declining support for Israel among nationalist Republicans, led by individuals such as [[Tucker Carlson]]. Nevertheless, the 2024 Republican Party platform reaffirmed the party would &quot;stand with Israel&quot; and called for the deportation of &quot;pro-[[Hamas]] radicals&quot;, while expressing a desire for peace in the Middle East. Although the Republican Party has often positioned itself as an opponent of antisemitism and denounced Democrats as insufficiently supportive of Israel, many members of the [[Christian right]] support Israel primarily due to [[Christian Zionism|theological beliefs]] about the centrality of Israel to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Jesus Christ]] and the conversion or [[Hell in Christianity|damnation]] of Jews and other non-Christians.

==== Taiwan ====
In the party&#x27;s 2016 platform, its stance on [[Taiwan]] is: &quot;We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island&#x27;s future must be resolved peacefully, through dialogue, and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan.&quot; In addition, if &quot;China were to violate those principles, the United States, in accord with the [[Taiwan Relations Act]], will help Taiwan defend itself&quot;.

====War on terror====

Since the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]], neoconservatives in the party have supported the War on Terror, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]]. The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] took the position that the [[Geneva Conventions]] do not apply to [[unlawful combatant]]s, while other prominent Republicans, such as [[Ted Cruz]], strongly oppose the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], which they view as torture. In the 2020s, Trumpist Republicans such as [[Matt Gaetz]] supported reducing U.S. military presence abroad and ending [[American military intervention in Somalia (2007–present)|intervention in countries such as Somalia]].

====Europe, Russia and Ukraine====

The 2016 Republican platform eliminated references to giving weapons to [[Ukraine]] in its fight with [[Russia]] and [[Separatist forces of the war in Donbass|rebel forces]]; the removal of this language reportedly resulted from intervention from staffers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. However, the Trump administration approved a new sale of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in 2017. Republicans generally question European [[NATO]] members&#x27; alleged insufficient investment in defense funding, and some are dissatisfied with U.S. aid to Ukraine. Some Republican members of the U.S. Congress support foreign aid to Israel but not to Ukraine, and have been described by U.S. media as [[pro-Russian]].

Amid the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], several prominent Republicans criticized some colleagues and conservative media outlets for echoing Russian propaganda. [[Liz Cheney]], formerly the third-ranking House Republican, said &quot;a [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] wing of the Republican Party&quot; had emerged. Republican Senator [[Mitt Romney]] characterized pro-Putin sentiments expressed by some Republicans as &quot;almost treasonous.&quot; Former vice president [[Mike Pence]] said, &quot;There is no room in the Republican Party for apologists for Putin.&quot; [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] chairman [[Michael McCaul]] asserted that Russian propaganda had &quot;infected a good chunk of my party&#x27;s base&quot;, attributing the cause to &quot;nighttime entertainment shows&quot; and &quot;conspiracy-theory outlets that are just not accurate, and they actually model Russian propaganda.&quot; [[House Intelligence Committee]] chairman [[Mike Turner]] confirmed McCaul&#x27;s assessment, asserting that some propaganda coming directly from Russia could be heard on the House floor. Republican senator [[Thom Tillis]] characterized the influential conservative commentator [[Tucker Carlson]], who frequently expresses pro-Russia sentiments, as Russia&#x27;s &quot;[[useful idiot]]&quot;.

In April 2024, a majority of Republican members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] voted against a military aid package to Ukraine. Both Trump and Senator [[JD Vance]], the 2024 Republican presidential nominee and vice presidential nominee respectively, have been vocal critics of military aid to Ukraine and advocates of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The 2024 Republican Party platform did not mention Russia or Ukraine, but stated the party&#x27;s objectives to &quot;prevent World War III&quot; and &quot;restore peace to Europe&quot;.

In February 2025, during the [[2025 Trump–Zelenskyy meeting|Trump–Zelenskyy meeting]], Trump and Vance hostilely berated Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]].

====Foreign relations and aid====
In a 2014 poll, 59% of Republicans favored doing less abroad and focusing on the country&#x27;s own problems instead.

Republicans have frequently advocated for restricting [[United States foreign aid|foreign aid]] as a means of asserting the national security and immigration interests of the United States.

A survey by the [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] shows that &quot;Trump Republicans seem to prefer a US role that is more independent, less cooperative, and more inclined to use military force to deal with the threats they see as the most pressing&quot;.

=== Social issues ===
The Republican Party is generally associated with [[social conservative]] policies, although it does have dissenting centrist and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] factions. The social conservatives support laws that uphold their [[traditional values]], such as [[opposition to same-sex marriage in the United States|opposition to same-sex marriage]], abortion, and marijuana. The Republican Party&#x27;s positions on social and cultural issues are in part a reflection of the influential role that the [[Christian right]] has had in the party since the 1970s. Most conservative Republicans also oppose [[gun control]], [[affirmative action]], and [[illegal immigration]].

==== Abortion and embryonic stem cell research ====
The Republican position on [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] has changed significantly over time. During the 1960s and early 1970s, opposition to abortion was concentrated among members of the political left and the Democratic Party; most liberal Catholics — which tended to vote for the Democratic Party — opposed expanding abortion access while most conservative evangelical Protestants supported it.

During this period, Republicans generally favored legalized abortion more than Democrats, although significant heterogeneity could be found within both parties. Leading Republican political figures, including [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H. W. Bush]], took pro-choice positions until the early 1980s. However, starting at this point, both George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan described themselves as pro-life during their presidencies.

In the 21st century, both [[George W. Bush]] and [[Donald Trump]] described themselves as &quot;[[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]]&quot; during their terms. However, Trump stated that he supported the legality and ethics of abortion before his candidacy in 2015.

Summarizing the rapid shift in the Republican and Democratic positions on abortion, Sue Halpern writes:...in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many Republicans were behind efforts to liberalize and even decriminalize abortion; theirs was the party of reproductive choice, while Democrats, with their large Catholic constituency, were the opposition. Republican governor Ronald Reagan signed the California Therapeutic Abortion Act, one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country, in 1967, legalizing abortion for women whose mental or physical health would be impaired by pregnancy, or whose pregnancies were the result of rape or incest. The same year, the Republican strongholds of North Carolina and Colorado made it easier for women to obtain abortions. New York, under Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], a Republican, eliminated all restrictions on women seeking to terminate pregnancies up to twenty-four weeks gestation... Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. Bush were all pro-choice, and they were not party outliers. In 1972, a Gallup poll found that 68 percent of Republicans believed abortion to be a private matter between a woman and her doctor. The government, they said, should not be involved... Since the 1980s, opposition to abortion has become strongest in the party among [[Traditionalist Catholicism|traditionalist Catholics]] and conservative Protestant evangelicals. Initially, evangelicals were relatively indifferent to the cause of abortion and overwhelmingly viewed it as a concern that was [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Historian [[Randall Balmer]] notes that [[Billy Graham]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Christianity Today]]&quot; published in 1968 a statement by theologian [[Bruce Waltke]] that: &quot;God does not regard the fetus as a soul, no matter how far gestation has progressed. The Law plainly exacts: &quot;If a man kills any human life he will be put to death&quot; (Lev. 24:17). But according to Exodus 21:22–24, the destruction of the fetus is not a capital offense. ... Clearly, then, in contrast to the mother, the fetus is not reckoned as a soul.&quot; Typical of the time, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; &quot;refused to characterize abortion as sinful&quot; and cited &quot;individual health, family welfare, and social responsibility&quot; as &quot;justifications for ending a pregnancy.&quot; Similar beliefs were held among conservative figures in the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], including [[W. A. Criswell]], who is partially credited with starting the &quot;[[Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence|conservative resurgence]]&quot; within the organization, who stated: &quot;I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person and it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.&quot; Balmer argues that evangelical American Christianity being inherently tied to opposition to abortion is a relatively new occurrence. After the late 1970s, he writes, opinion against abortion among evangelicals rapidly shifted in favor of its prohibition.

Today, opinion polls show that Republican voters are heavily divided on the legality of abortion, although vast majority of the party&#x27;s national and state candidates are [[anti-abortion]] and oppose elective [[abortion]] on religious or moral grounds. While many advocate exceptions in the case of [[incest]], rape or the mother&#x27;s life being at risk, in 2012 the party approved a platform advocating banning abortions without exception. There were not highly polarized differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party prior to the &quot;[[Roe v. Wade]]&quot; 1973 Supreme Court ruling (which made prohibitions on abortion rights unconstitutional), but after the Supreme Court ruling, opposition to abortion became an increasingly key national platform for the Republican Party. As a result, Evangelicals gravitated towards the Republican Party. Most Republicans oppose government funding for abortion providers, notably [[Planned Parenthood]]. This includes support for the [[Hyde Amendment]].

Until its dissolution in 2018, [[Republican Majority for Choice]], an abortion rights PAC, advocated for amending the GOP platform to include pro-abortion rights members.

The Republican Party has pursued policies at the national and state-level to restrict [[embryonic stem cell]] research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human [[embryo]]s.

After [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization|the overturning]] of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 2022, a majority of Republican-controlled states [[Abortion law in the United States by state|passed near-total bans]] on [[abortion]], rendering it largely illegal throughout much of the United States.

==== Affirmative action ====

Republicans generally oppose [[affirmative action]], often describing it as a &quot;[[racial quota|quota system]]&quot; and believing that it is not [[meritocratic]] and is counter-productive socially by only further promoting [[discrimination]]. According to a 2023 ABC poll, a majority of Americans (52%) and 75% of Republicans supported the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in [[Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard]] prohibiting race as a factor in college admissions, compared to only 26% of Democrats.

The 2012 Republican national platform stated, &quot;We support efforts to help low-income individuals get a fair chance based on their potential and individual merit; but we reject preferences, quotas, and set-asides, as the best or sole methods through which fairness can be achieved, whether in government, education or corporate boardrooms...Merit, ability, aptitude, and results should be the factors that determine advancement in our society.&quot;

==== Gun ownership ====
Republicans generally support [[Gun politics in the United States|gun ownership rights]] and oppose [[Gun law in the United States|laws regulating guns]]. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, 45% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents personally own firearms, compared to 32% for the general public and 20% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.

The [[National Rifle Association of America]], a [[advocacy group|special interest group]] in support of gun ownership, has consistently aligned itself with the Republican Party. Following gun control measures under the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], such as the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]], the Republicans allied with the NRA during the [[Republican Revolution]] in [[1994 United States elections|1994]]. Since then, the NRA has consistently backed Republican candidates and contributed financial support, such as in the [[2013 Colorado recall election]] which resulted in the ousting of two pro-gun control Democrats for two anti-gun control Republicans.

In contrast, [[George H. W. Bush]], formerly a lifelong NRA member, was highly critical of the organization following their response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] authored by CEO [[Wayne LaPierre]], and publicly resigned in protest.

==== Criminal justice====

The Republican Party has generally promoted strict anti-crime policies, such as [[mandatory minimum sentences]] and the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]. In the 2010’s, however, prominent Republicans demonstrated some interest in [[Criminal justice reform in the United States|criminal justice reform]] designed to combat [[Incarceration in the United States|mass incarceration]], with President Trump signing the [[First Step Act]], which expanded good behavior credits for perpetrators of most nonviolent crimes and required the U.S. Attorney General to develop a system to assess the recidivism risk of all federal prisoners. By 2024, however, the Republican Party and its leaders had largely left behind its prior support for reform of the justice system. 
Republican elected officials have historically supported the [[War on Drugs]]. They generally oppose [[legalization of drugs|legalization]] or decriminalization of drugs such as [[Cannabis in the United States|marijuana]].

Opposition to the legalization of marijuana has softened significantly over time among Republican voters and politicians. A 2021 [[Quinnipiac University|&quot;Quinnipiac&quot;]] poll found that 62% of Republicans supported the legalization of recreational marijuana use and that net support for the position was +30 points. Some Republican-controlled states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana in recent years. In September 2024, then-candidate Donald Trump endorsed the legalization of recreational marijuana.

==== Immigration ====

The Republican Party has taken widely varying views on immigration throughout its history. In the period between 1850 and 1870, the Republican Party was more opposed to immigration than the Democrats. The GOP&#x27;s opposition was, in part, caused by its reliance on the support of anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant parties such as the [[Know Nothing|Know-Nothings]]. In the decades following the Civil War, the Republican Party grew more supportive of immigration, as it represented manufacturers in the northeast (who wanted additional labor); during this period, the Democratic Party came to be seen as the party of labor (which wanted fewer laborers with which to compete). Starting in the 1970s, the parties switched places again, as the Democrats grew more supportive of immigration than Republicans.

In 2006, the Republican-led Senate passed [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006|comprehensive immigration reform]] that would eventually have allowed millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens. Despite the support of Republican President George W. Bush, the House of Representatives (also led by Republicans) did not advance the bill. After Republican Mitt Romney was defeated in the 2012 presidential election, particularly due to a lack of support among Latinos, several Republicans advocated a friendlier approach to immigrants that would allow for more migrant workers and a [[path to citizenship]] for illegal immigrants. The [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013]] passed the Senate 68–32, but was not brought to a vote in the House and died in the [[113th Congress]]. In a 2013 poll, 60% of Republicans supported the pathway to citizenship concept.

In 2016, [[Donald Trump]] proposed to build [[Mexico–United States border wall|a wall]] along the southern border of the United States. Trump [[Immigration policy of the first Donald Trump administration|immigration policies during his administration]] included a [[Executive Order 13769|travel ban]] from multiple Muslim-majority countries, a [[Remain in Mexico]] policy for asylum-seekers, [[Trump administration family separation policy|a controversial family separation policy]], and attempting to end [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|DACA]]. During the tenure of Democratic President Joe Biden, the Republican Party has continued to take a hardline stance against illegal immigration. The Party largely opposes immigration reform, although there are widely differing views on immigration within the Party. The Party&#x27;s proposed 2024 platform was opposed to immigration, and called for the mass deportation of all illegal immigrants in the United States. A 2024 Pew Research Center poll found that 88% of Donald Trump&#x27;s supporters favored mass deportation of all illegal immigrants, compared to 27% of Kamala Harris supporters.

==== LGBT issues ====

Similar to the Democratic Party, the Republican position on [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] has changed significantly over time, with continuously increasing support among both parties on the issue. The [[Log Cabin Republicans]] is a group within the Republican Party that represents [[LGBT conservatism|LGBT conservatives]] and allies and advocates for LGBT rights.

From the early-2000s to the mid-2010s, Republicans opposed [[same-sex marriage]], while being divided on the issue of [[civil union]]s and [[domestic partnership]]s for same-sex couples. During the 2004 election, [[George W. Bush]] campaigned prominently on a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage; many believe it helped Bush win re-election. In both [[108th United States Congress|2004]] and [[109th United States Congress|2006]], President Bush, Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]], and House Majority Leader [[John Boehner]] promoted the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] couples. In both attempts, the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke [[cloture]] and thus ultimately was never passed. As more states legalized same-sex marriage in the 2010s, Republicans increasingly supported allowing each state to decide its own marriage policy. As of 2014, most state GOP platforms expressed opposition to same-sex marriage. The 2016 [[2016 Republican National Convention|GOP Platform]] defined marriage as &quot;natural marriage, the union of one man and one woman,&quot; and condemned the Supreme Court&#x27;s [[Obergefell v. Hodges|ruling]] legalizing same-sex marriages. The 2020 platform, which reused the 2016 platform, retained the statements against same-sex marriage.

Following his election as president in 2016, Donald Trump stated that he had no objection to same-sex marriage or to the Supreme Court decision in &quot;[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]&quot;, but had previously promised to consider appointing a Supreme Court justice to roll back the constitutional right. In office, Trump was the first sitting Republican president to recognize [[Gay pride|LGBT Pride Month]]. Conversely, the Trump administration banned transgender individuals from service in the United States military and rolled back other protections for transgender people which had been enacted during the previous Democratic presidency. However, other Republicans,such as [[Vivek Ramaswamy]], do not support such a ban,

The Republican Party platform previously opposed the [[Sexual orientation and the United States military|inclusion of gay people in the military]] and opposed adding sexual orientation to the list of protected classes since 1992. The Republican Party opposed the inclusion of [[sexual preference]] in anti-discrimination statutes from 1992 to 2004. The 2008 and 2012 Republican Party platform supported anti-discrimination statutes based on sex, race, age, religion, creed, disability, or national origin, but both platforms were silent on [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]. The 2016 platform was opposed to sex discrimination statutes that included the phrase &quot;sexual orientation&quot;. The same 2016 platform rejected &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, and was also used for the party&#x27;s 2020 platform. In the early 2020s, numerous Republican-led states [[2020s anti-LGBT movement in the United States|proposed or passed laws]] that have been described as anti-trans by critics, as well as laws limiting or banning [[Drag panic|public performances of drag shows]], and teaching schoolchildren about LGBT topics.

On November 6, 2021, RNC Chair [[Ronna McDaniel]] announced the creation of the &quot;RNC Pride Coalition&quot;, in partnership with the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], to promote outreach to LGBTQ voters. However, after the announcement, McDaniel apologized for not having communicated the announcement in advance and emphasized that the new outreach program did not alter the 2016 GOP Platform.

As of 2023, a majority of Republican voters support [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. According to &quot;[[FiveThirtyEight]]&quot;, as of 2022, Republican voters are consistently more open to same-sex marriage than their representatives. The party platform approved at the [[2024 Republican National Convention]] no longer states that marriage should be between &quot;one man and one woman&quot;, though it did oppose the inclusion of [[Trans woman|transgender women]] in women&#x27;s sports and teaching about LGBT topics in schools. According to a 2023 &quot;[[YouGov]]&quot; poll, Republicans are slightly more likely to oppose [[Intersex medical interventions|intersex medical alterations]] than Democrats.

In November 2024, Trump nominated [[Scott Bessent]] for [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|United States secretary of the treasury]]. If confirmed by the [[United States Senate]], he will be the [[List of first openly LGBTQ politicians in the United States|second openly gay man]] to serve in the [[Cabinet of the United States]] (after [[Pete Buttigieg]]) and the [[List of first openly LGBTQ politicians in the United States|fourth openly gay man]] to serve in a [[Cabinet of the United States#Cabinet-level officials|cabinet-level]] office (after [[Demetrios Marantis]], [[Richard Grenell]] and Buttigieg). As the secretary of the treasury is [[United States presidential line of succession#Current order of succession|fifth]] in the [[United States presidential line of succession]], he will become the [[List of first openly LGBTQ politicians in the United States|highest-ranking openly LGBT person in American history]].

==== Voting rights ====
Virtually all restrictions on voting have in recent years been implemented by Republicans. Republicans, mainly at the state level, argue that the restrictions (such as the purging of [[Electoral roll|voter rolls]], limiting voting locations, and limiting [[early voting|early]] and [[Postal voting|mail-in]] voting) are vital to prevent [[voter fraud]], saying that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections. Polling has found majority support for early voting, automatic voter registration and [[Voter identification laws in the United States|voter ID laws]] among the general population.

In defending their restrictions to voting rights, Republicans have made false and exaggerated claims about the extent of voter fraud in the United States; all existing research indicates that it is extremely rare, and civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party&#x27;s favor. Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court, with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of establishing them with partisan purpose.

After the Supreme Court decision in &quot;[[Shelby County v. Holder]]&quot; rolled back aspects of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], Republicans introduced cuts to early voting, purges of voter rolls and imposition of strict voter ID laws. The 2016 Republican platform advocated proof of citizenship as a prerequisite for registering to vote and photo ID as a prerequisite when voting.

After Donald Trump and his [[Republican reactions to Donald Trump&#x27;s claims of 2020 election fraud|Republican allies made false claims of fraud]] during the 2020 presidential election, Republicans launched a nationwide effort to [[Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election|impose tighter election laws at the state level]]. Such bills are centered around limiting mail-in voting, strengthening voter ID laws, shortening early voting, eliminating [[Voter registration in the United States#Automatic|automatic]] and [[Voter registration in the United States#Election Day / same-day|same-day voter registration]], curbing the use of [[ballot drop box]]es, and allowing for increased purging of voter rolls. Republicans in at least eight states have also introduced bills that would give lawmakers greater power over election administration, after they were unsuccessful in their attempts to overturn election results in [[swing state]]s won by Biden.

Supporters of the bills argue they would improve election security and reverse temporary changes enacted during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; they point to false claims of significant election fraud, as well as the substantial public distrust of the integrity of the 2020 election those claims have fostered, as justification. Political analysts say that the efforts amount to [[voter suppression]], are intended to advantage Republicans by reducing the number of people who vote, and would disproportionately affect [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|minority]] voters.

== Composition ==
According to a 2025 [[Gallup poll]], 46% of Americans identify or lean towards Republicans, and 45% identify or lean towards Democrats. Republicans have held an edge since 2022, while the Democratic Party had previously held an overall edge in party identification from 1992 to 2021, since Gallup began polling on the issue in 1991. In 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the party was strongest in the [[Southern United States|South]], most of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Mountain States]], and [[Alaska]].

The Republican party&#x27;s core voting demographics are White voters without college degrees and [[White Southerners]]. Racial polarization is extremely high in the Southern United States, with [[White Southerners]] almost entirely voting for the Republican Party and [[Black Southerners]] almost entirely voting for the Democratic Party.

As of 2024, the Republican Party has support from a majority of [[Arab Americans|Arab]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native]], and [[White Americans|White]] voters, and increasingly among [[Hispanic]]s and [[Asian people|Asians]].

A majority of [[Working class in the United States|working-class]], [[Urban–rural political divide|rural]], [[Man|men]], individuals without [[educational attainment in the United States|college degrees]], and [[Developing country|lower income]] voters vote for the party. Traditionalist religious voters, including [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter-Day Saints]], [[Muslims]], and [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] voters lean towards the Republicans. The party has made gained significantly among the [[Working class|white working class]], [[Asian Americans|Asians]], [[Arabs]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], but lost support among [[Upper middle class in the United States|upper middle class]] and [[Postgraduate education|college-educated]] whites.

Until 2016, higher income was strongly correlated to voting for the Republican Party among the general electorate. However, in all three of Trump&#x27;s elections in 2016, 2020, and 2024, the previous correlation between higher incomes and voting for the Republican Party was largely eliminated among the electorate as a whole. For White voters, instead higher educational attainment was strongly correlated with higher support for the Democratic Party. According to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, homeowners are slightly more likely to be Republicans (51-45%), while renters are much more likely to be Democrats (64-32%).

In the 2024 presidential election, Trump did better among lower-income voters than high-income voters, the first time ever for the Republican nominee in modern American political history. Among White voters in 2024, income was negatively correlated with support for Donald Trump. Specifically, Trump won White voters making less than $30,000 (63-34%), those making between $30,000 to $49,999 (62-37%), and those making $50,000 to $99,999 (56-42%). Trump narrowly won White voters making $100,000 to $199,999 (50-49%) and those making more than $200,000 (51-48%).

==== Region ====
Some of the oldest Republican strongholds in the country are in the [[Southern United States]], particularly majority-White [[Southern Unionist|Unionist]] counties in [[Appalachia]]. The Republican Party gradually gained power in the [[Southern United States]] since [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Although [[Richard Nixon]] carried 49 states in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], including every Southern state, the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state levels across the entire South for decades. Republicans first won a majority of U.S. House seats in the South in the [[1994 United States elections|1994]] &quot;[[Republican Revolution]]&quot;, and only began to dominate the South after the [[2010 United States elections|2010 elections]].

Since the 2010s, [[White Southerners]] are the Republican Party&#x27;s strongest racial demographic, in some [[Deep South]] states voting nearly as Republican as African Americans vote Democratic. This is partially attributable to religiosity, with White [[evangelical Christianity|evangelical Christians]] in the [[Bible Belt]], which covers most of the South, being the Republican Party&#x27;s strongest religious demographic. White Southerners with college degrees remain strongly Republican. In particular, in 2024 Trump won every state with a significant presence in the Bible Belt except Virginia, because [[Northern Virginia]] is part of the heavily Democratic [[Washington metropolitan area]].

==== Gender ====

Since 1980, a &quot;gender gap&quot; has seen stronger support for the Republican Party among men than among women. Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Democrat [[John Kerry]] than for Republican [[George W. Bush]] in the 2004 presidential election. Exit polls from the 2012 elections revealed a continued weakness among unmarried women for the GOP, a large and growing portion of the electorate. Although women supported Obama over [[Mitt Romney]] by a margin of 55–44% in 2012, Romney prevailed amongst married women, 53–46%. Obama won unmarried women 67–31%.

However, according to a December 2019 study, &quot;White women are the only group of female voters who support Republican Party candidates for president. They have done so by a majority in all but 2 of the last 18 elections&quot;.

==== Education ====
In all three of Donald Trump&#x27;s elections in 2016, 2020, and 2024, for White voters lower educational attainment was strongly correlated with higher support for Trump. When controlling for educational attainment among White voters, there still remain large variations by state and region. In particular, college-educated [[White Southerners]] remain strongly Republican.

The Republican Party has steadily increased the percentage of votes it receives from white voters without college degrees since the 1970s, while the [[educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] of the United States has steadily increased. White voters without college degrees are more likely to live in rural areas.

Voters with college degrees as a whole were a Republican-voting group until the 1990s. Despite losing in a landslide, Republican nominee [[Barry Goldwater]] nearly won a majority of voters with college degrees 48–52% in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Republican president [[Gerald Ford]] won voters with college degrees 55-43% in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], while narrowly losing to [[Jimmy Carter]]. Since the 1990s, a majority of voters with graduate degrees have consistently voted for the Democratic Party. For example, [[George W. Bush]] won voters with just a bachelor&#x27;s degree 52-46% while losing voters with a graduate degree 44–55%, while winning re-election in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]].

Until 2016, white voters with college degrees were a Republican-leaning group. Despite Obama&#x27;s decisive [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] victory, Republican nominee [[John McCain]] won a majority of white voters with college degrees 51-47% and white voters without college degrees 58-40%. In [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], Republican nominee [[Mitt Romney]] won white voters with college degrees 56-42%, though Obama won voters with college degrees as a whole 50-48% while winning re-election. Since the 2010s, white voters with college degrees have been increasingly voting for the Democratic Party. Following the 2016 presidential election, exit polls indicated that &quot;Donald Trump attracted a large share of the vote from Whites without a college degree, receiving 72 percent of the White non-college male vote and 62 percent of the White non-college female vote.&quot; Overall, 52% of voters with college degrees voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while 52% of voters without college degrees voted for Trump.

In the [[2020 United States presidential election]], Donald Trump won white voters without college degrees 67-32%, while losing white voters with a college degree 48–51%. In the [[2024 United States presidential election]], Trump maintained his margins among white voters without college degrees 66-32% and lost white voters with a college degree 45-52%. In 2024, Trump won 56% of voters without a college degree, compared to 42% of voters with a college degree.

==== Ethnicity ====

Republicans have consistently won the White vote in every presidential election after the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]]. There exist large variations among White voters by region and state. In particular, Republicans lose White voters in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], parts of the [[Upper Midwest]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Republicans are strongest with [[White Southerners]], particularly White [[evangelical Christianity|evangelical Christians]] in the [[Bible Belt]], which covers most of the [[Southern United States]]. White Southerners with college degrees remain strongly Republican. In some [[Deep South]] states, Whites vote nearly as Republican as African Americans vote Democratic. In the 2024 presidential election, Trump won White Southerners 67-32%.

Republicans have been winning under 15% of the African American vote in national elections since 1980. Until the [[New Deal]] of the 1930s, Black people supported the Republican Party by large margins. Black delegates were a sizable share of southern delegates to the national Republican convention from Reconstruction until the start of the 20th century when their share began to decline. Black people shifted in large margins to the Democratic Party in the 1930s, when Black politicians such as Arthur Mitchell and William Dawson supported the New Deal because it would better serve the interest of Black Americans. Black voters would become one of the core components of the [[New Deal coalition]]. In the South, after the [[Voting Rights Act]] to prohibit racial discrimination in elections was passed by a bipartisan coalition in 1965, Black people were able to vote again and ever since have formed a significant portion (20–50%) of the Democratic vote in that region.

In the 2010 elections, two African American Republicans, [[Tim Scott]] and [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]], were elected to the House of Representatives. As of January 2023, there are four African-American Republicans in the House of Representatives and one African American Republican in the United States Senate. In recent decades, Republicans have been moderately successful in gaining support from [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian American]] voters. George W. Bush, who campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes, received 35% of their vote in 2000 and 44% in 2004. The party&#x27;s strong anti-communist stance has made it popular among some minority groups from current and former Communist states, in particular [[Cuban American]]s, [[Korean American]]s, [[Chinese American]]s and [[Vietnamese American]]s. The 2007 election of [[Bobby Jindal]] as Governor of Louisiana was hailed as pathbreaking. Jindal became the first elected minority governor in [[Louisiana]] and the first state governor of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] descent.

Republicans have gained support among racial and ethnic minorities, particularly among those who are working class, Hispanic or Latino, or Asian American since the 2010s. According to [[John Avlon]], in 2013, the Republican party was more ethnically diverse at the statewide elected official level than the Democratic Party was; GOP statewide elected officials included Latino Nevada Governor [[Brian Sandoval]] and African-American U.S. senator [[Tim Scott]] of South Carolina.

In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] won 55% of White votes, 35% of Asian votes, 31% of Hispanic votes and 4% of African American votes. In 2012, 88% of Romney voters were White while 56% of Obama voters were White. In the [[2024 United States presidential election|2024 presidential election]], Trump won 57% of White voters, 46% of Hispanic voters, 39% of Asian voters, and 13% of African American voters.

[[Donald Trump]] won the popular vote in the [[2024 United States presidential election]] as White voters without college degrees still strongly backed him, in addition to the gains made with Asian and Latino voters in comparison to the [[2020 United States presidential election]]. As a whole, 84% of Trump voters were White.

==== Religious communities ====
Religion has always played a major role for both parties, but in the course of a century, the parties&#x27; religious compositions have changed. Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], with Catholics, Jews, and southern Protestants heavily Democratic and northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 1980s that undercut the New Deal coalition. Since 1980, a large majority of [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] has voted Republican; 70–80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004 and 70% for Republican House candidates in [[United States general elections, 2006|2006]].

Members of the Mormon faith had a mixed relationship with Donald Trump during his tenure, despite 67% of them voting for him in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] and 56% of them supporting his presidency in [[2018 United States elections|2018]], disapproving of his personal behavior such as that shown during the [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape|&quot;Access Hollywood&quot; controversy]]. In the [[2020 United States presidential election in Utah]], Trump won the state by about 21.5%, by a margin more than 20% lower compared to Mitt Romney (who is Mormon) in [[2012 United States presidential election in Utah|2012]] and George W. Bush in [[2004 United States presidential election in Utah|2004]]. Their opinion on Trump had not affected their party affiliation, however, as 76% of Mormons in 2018 expressed preference for generic Republican congressional candidates. Similarly, while Trump again won majority-Mormon [[2024 United States presidential election in Utah|Utah in 2024]], the state had one of the smallest swings to the right and Trump&#x27;s 22% margin was well below that of prior Republican presidential nominees.
Jews continue to vote 70–80% Democratic; however, a slim majority of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] voted for the Republican Party in 2016, following years of growing Orthodox Jewish support for the party due to its social conservatism and increasingly pro-Israel foreign policy stance. Over 70% of Orthodox Jews identify as Republican or Republican leaning as of 2021. An exit poll conducted by the [[Associated Press]] for 2020 found 35% of [[Muslims]] voted for Donald Trump. The mainline traditional Protestants (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Disciples) have dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968). Democrats have close links with the African American churches, especially the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptists]], while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54–46 in the 2010 midterms.

Although once strongly Democratic, [[Catholic Church in the United States|American Catholic]] voters have been politically divided in the 21st century with 52% of Catholic voters voting for Trump in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] and 52% voting for Biden in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]]. While Catholic Republican leaders try to stay in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church on subjects such as abortion, contraception, euthanasia, and embryonic stem cell research, they tend to differ on the death penalty and same-sex marriage.

==== Members of the business community ====
The Republican Party has traditionally been a pro-business party. It garners major support from a wide variety of industries. Republicans are 24 percent more likely to be business owners than Democrats. Prominent business [[lobbying group]]s have traditionally supported Republican candidates and economic policies. Although both major parties support [[capitalism]], the Republican Party is more likely to favor [[private property]] rights.

<text>The USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident was an attack on a United States Navy technical research ship (a spy ship), , by Israeli Air Force jet fighter aircraft and Israeli Navy motor torpedo boats, on 8 June 1967, during the Six-Day War. The combined air and sea attack killed 34 crew members (naval officers, seamen, two marines, and one civilian NSA employee), wounded 171 crew members, and severely damaged the ship. At the time, the ship was in international waters north of the Sinai Peninsula, about northwest from the Egyptian city of Arish.

Israel apologized for the attack, saying that USS &quot;Liberty&quot; had been attacked in error after being mistaken for an Egyptian ship. Both the Israeli and United States governments conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the ship&#x27;s identity. Others, including survivors of the attack, have rejected these conclusions and maintain that the attack was deliberate. Thomas Hinman Moorer, the 7th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accused President Lyndon B. Johnson of having covered up that the attack was a deliberate act.

In May 1968, the Israeli government paid (equivalent to in ) to the in compensation for the families of the 34 men killed in the attack. In March 1969, Israel paid a further $ ($ in ) to the men who had been wounded. In December 1980, it agreed to pay $ ($ in ) as the final settlement for material damage to the ship plus 13 years of interest.

==USS &quot;Liberty&quot;==

 was originally the light civilian cargo vessel &quot;Simmons Victory&quot;, a mass-produced, standard-design Victory ship, the follow-on series to the famous Liberty ships that supplied the Allies with cargo during World War II. It was acquired by the United States Navy and converted to an auxiliary technical research ship (AGTR), a cover name for National Security Agency (NSA) &quot;spy ships&quot; carrying out signals intelligence missions. It carried out five operations in waters off the west coast of Africa leading up to 1967.

==Attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot;==
===Events leading to the attack===
During the Six-Day War between Israel and several Arab nations, the United States maintained a neutral country status. Several days before the war began, USS &quot;Liberty&quot; was ordered to proceed to the eastern Mediterranean area to perform a signals intelligence collection mission in international waters near the north coast of Sinai, Egypt. After the war erupted, due to concerns about its safety as it approached its patrol area, several messages were sent to &quot;Liberty&quot; to increase its allowable closest point of approach (CPA) to Egypt&#x27;s and Israel&#x27;s coasts from , respectively, to , and then later to for both countries, thereby reducing proximity. However, due to ineffective message handling and routing, these messages were not received until after the attack.

According to Israeli sources, at the start of the war on 5 June, General Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Air Force (IAF) chief of staff informed Commander Ernest Carl Castle, the American naval attaché in Tel Aviv, that Israel would defend its coast with every means at its disposal, including sinking unidentified ships. He asked the U.S. to keep its ships away from Israel&#x27;s shore or at least inform Israel of their exact positions.

American sources said that no inquiry about ships in the area was made until after the attack on &quot;Liberty&quot;. In a message sent from U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk to U.S. Ambassador Walworth Barbour in Tel Aviv, Israel, Rusk asked for &quot;urgent confirmation&quot; of Israel&#x27;s statement. Barbour responded: &quot;No request for info on U.S. ships operating off Sinai was made until after &quot;Liberty&quot; incident.&quot; Further, Barbour stated: &quot;Had Israelis made such an inquiry it would have been forwarded immediately to the chief of naval operations and other high naval commands and repeated to dept [Department of State].&quot;

With the outbreak of war, Captain William L. McGonagle of &quot;Liberty&quot; immediately asked Vice Admiral William I. Martin at the United States Sixth Fleet headquarters to send a destroyer to accompany &quot;Liberty&quot; and serve as its armed escort and as an auxiliary communications center. The following day, Admiral Martin replied: &quot;&quot;Liberty&quot; is a clearly marked United States ship in international waters, not a participant in the conflict and not a reasonable subject for attack by any nation. Request denied.&quot; He promised, however, that in the unlikely event of an inadvertent attack, jet fighters from the Sixth Fleet would be overhead in ten minutes.

Meanwhile, at the United Nations on 6 June, U.S. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg told the United Nations Security Council that vessels of the Sixth Fleet were several hundred miles from the conflict, in response to Egyptian complaints that the United States was supporting Israel in the conflict. When this statement was made, it was in fact true; &quot;Liberty&quot;, now assigned to the Sixth Fleet, was in the central Mediterranean Sea, passing between Libya and Crete. It would ultimately steam to about north of the Sinai Peninsula.

On the night of 7 June Washington time, early morning on 8 June, 01:10 Zulu or 03:10 local time, the Pentagon issued an order to Sixth Fleet headquarters to tell &quot;Liberty&quot; to come no closer than to Israel, Syria, or the Sinai coast (Oren, p. 263). According to the Naval Court of Inquiry and the National Security Agency official history, the order to withdraw was not sent on the radio frequency that &quot;Liberty&quot; monitored for her orders until 15:25 Zulu, several hours after the attack, due to a long series of administrative and message routing problems. The Navy said a large volume of unrelated high-precedence traffic, including intelligence intercepts related to the conflict, were being handled at the time; and that this combined with a shortage of qualified radiomen contributed to the delayed transmission of the withdrawal message.

===Visual contact===
Official testimony combined with &quot;Liberty&quot;″s deck log establish that throughout the morning of the attack, 8 June, the ship was overflown, at various times and locations, by IAF aircraft. The primary aircraft type was the Nord Noratlas; there were also two unidentified delta-wing jets at about 09:00 Sinai time (GMT+2). &quot;Liberty&quot; crewmembers say that one of the Noratlas aircraft flew so close to &quot;Liberty&quot; that noise from its propellers rattled the ship&#x27;s deck plating, and that the pilots and crewmembers waved to each other. It was later reported, based on information from IDF sources, that the over-flights were coincidental, and that the aircraft were hunting for Egyptian submarines that had been spotted near the coast.

At about 05:45 Sinai time, a ship-sighting report was received at Israeli Central Coastal Command (CCC) in respect of &quot;Liberty&quot;, identified by an aerial naval observer as &quot;apparently a destroyer, sailing west of Gaza&quot;. The vessel&#x27;s location was marked on a CCC control table, using a red marker, indicating an unidentified vessel. At about 06:00, the aerial naval observer, Major Uri Meretz, reported that the ship appeared to be a U.S. Navy supply ship; at about 09:00 the red marker was replaced with a green marker to indicate a neutral vessel. About the same time, an Israeli jet fighter pilot reported that a ship north of Arish had fired at his aircraft after he tried to identify the vessel. Israeli naval command dispatched two destroyers to investigate, but they were returned to their previous positions at 09:40 after doubts emerged during the pilot&#x27;s debriefing. After the naval observer&#x27;s Noratlas landed and he was debriefed, the ship he saw was further identified as USS &quot;Liberty&quot;, based on its &quot;GTR-5&quot; hull markings. USS &quot;Liberty&quot; marker was removed from CCC&#x27;s Control Table at 11:00, due to its positional information being considered out of date.

At 11:24, the Israeli chief of naval operations received a report that Arish was being shelled from the sea. An inquiry into the source of the report was ordered to determine its validity. The report came from an air support officer in Arish. Additionally, at 11:27 the Israeli Supreme Command head of operations received a report stating that a ship had been shelling Arish, but the shells had fallen short. (The investigative journalist James Bamford points out that &quot;Liberty&quot; had only four .50 caliber machine guns mounted on her decks and thus could not have shelled the coast.) The Head of Operations ordered that the report be verified, and that it be determined whether or not Israeli Navy vessels were off the coast of Arish. At 11:45, another report arrived at Supreme Command saying two ships were approaching the Arish coast.
The shelling and ship reports were passed from Supreme Command to Fleet Operations control center. The chief of naval operations took them seriously, and at 12:05 torpedo boat Division 914 was ordered to patrol in the direction of Arish. Division 914, codenamed &quot;Pagoda&quot;, was under the command of Commander Moshe Oren. It consisted of three torpedo boats numbered: T-203, T-204 and T-206. At 12:15, Division 914 received orders to patrol a position north of Arish. As Commander Oren headed toward Arish, he was informed by Naval Operations of the reported shelling of Arish and told that IAF aircraft would be dispatched to the area after the target had been detected. Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin was concerned that the supposed Egyptian shelling was the prelude to an amphibious landing that could outflank Israeli forces. Rabin reiterated the standing order to sink any unidentified ships in the area, but advised caution, as Soviet vessels were reportedly operating nearby. At 13:41, the torpedo boats detected an unknown vessel 20 miles northwest of Arish and off the coast of Bardawil. The ship&#x27;s speed was estimated on their radars. The combat information center officer on T-204, Ensign Aharon Yifrah, reported to Oren that the target had been detected at a range of , that her speed had been tracked for a few minutes, after which he had determined that the target was moving westward at a speed of . These data were forwarded to the Fleet Operations control center.

The speed of the target was significant because it indicated that the target was a combat vessel. Moreover, Israeli forces had standing orders to fire on any unknown vessels sailing in the area at over , a speed which, at the time, could be attained only by warships. The chief of naval operations asked the torpedo boats to double-check their calculations. Yifrah twice recalculated and confirmed his assessment. A few minutes later, Commander Oren reported that the target, now from his position, was moving at a speed of on a different heading. Bamford, however, points out that &quot;Liberty&quot;″s top speed was far below 28 knots. His sources say that at the time of the attack &quot;Liberty&quot; was following her signal-intercept mission course along the northern Sinai coast, at about speed.

The data on the ship&#x27;s speed, together with its direction, gave the impression that it was an Egyptian destroyer fleeing toward port after shelling Arish. The torpedo boats gave chase, but did not expect to overtake their target before it reached Egypt. Commander Oren requested that the Israeli Air Force dispatch aircraft to intercept. At 13:48, the chief of naval operations requested dispatch of fighter aircraft to the ship&#x27;s location.
The IAF dispatched a flight of two Mirage III fighter jets codenamed Kursa flight which arrived at &quot;Liberty&quot; at about 14:00. The formation leader, Captain Iftach Spector, attempted to identify the ship. He radioed to one of the torpedo boats his observation that the ship looked like a military ship with one smokestack and one mast. He also communicated, in effect, that the ship appeared to him like a destroyer or another type of small ship. In a post-attack statement, the pilots said they saw no distinguishable markings or flag on the ship.

At this point, a recorded exchange took place between a command headquarters weapons systems officer, one of the air controllers, and the chief air controller questioning a possible American presence. Immediately after the exchange, at 13:57, the chief air controller, Lieutenant-Colonel Shmuel Kislev, cleared the Mirages to attack.

===Air and sea attacks===
After being cleared to attack, the Mirages dove on the ship and attacked with 30-mm cannons and rockets. The attack came a few minutes after the crew completed a chemical attack drill, with Captain McGonagle on the command bridge. The crew was in &quot;stand-down mode&quot;, with their helmets and life jackets removed. Battle readiness &quot;modified condition three&quot; was set, which meant that the ship&#x27;s four .50 caliber machine guns were manned and ammunition was ready for loading and firing. Eight crewmen either were killed immediately or received fatal injuries and died later, and 75 were wounded. Among the wounded was McGonagle, who was hit in the right thigh and arm. During the attack, antennas were severed, gas drums caught fire, and the ship&#x27;s flag was knocked down. McGonagle sent an urgent request for help to the Sixth Fleet, &quot;Under attack by unidentified jet aircraft, require immediate assistance&quot;.

The Mirages left after expending their ammunition, and were replaced by a flight of two Dassault Super Mystères codenamed Royal flight. The Mysteres were armed with napalm bombs, and were flown by Captain Yossi Zuk and his wingman, Yaakov Hamermish. The Mysteres released their payloads over the ship and strafed it with their cannons. Much of the ship&#x27;s superstructure caught fire. The Mysteres were readying to attack again when the Israeli Navy, alerted by the absence of return fire, warned Kislev that the target could be Israeli. Kislev told the pilots not to attack if there was any doubt about identification, and the Israeli Navy quickly contacted all of its vessels in the area. The Israeli Navy found that none of its vessels were under fire, and the aircraft were cleared to attack. However, Kislev was still disturbed by a lack of return fire and requested one last attempt to identify the ship. Captain Zuk made an attempt at identification while strafing the ship. He reported seeing no flag, but saw the ship&#x27;s GTR-5 marking. Kislev immediately ordered the attack stopped. Kislev guessed that the ship was American.

The fact that the ship had Latin alphabet markings led Chief of Staff Rabin to fear that the ship was Soviet. Though Egyptian warships were known to disguise their identities with Western markings, they usually displayed Arabic letters and numbers only. Rabin ordered the torpedo boats to remain at a safe distance from the ship, and sent in two Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon helicopters to search for survivors. These radio communications were recorded by Israel. The order was also recorded in the torpedo boat&#x27;s log, although Commander Oren claimed not to have received it. The order to cease fire was given at 14:20, twenty-four minutes before the torpedo boats arrived at the &quot;Liberty&quot;″s position.

During the interval, crewmen aboard &quot;Liberty&quot; hoisted a large American flag. During the early part of the air attack and before the torpedo boats were sighted, &quot;Liberty&quot; sent a distress message that was received by Sixth Fleet aircraft carrier . Aircraft carrier dispatched eight aircraft. The carrier had been in the middle of strategic exercises. Vice-Admiral William I. Martin recalled the aircraft minutes later.

McGonagle testified at the naval court of inquiry that during McGonagle testified that he &quot;believed that the time of initial sighting of the torpedo boats ... was about 14:20&quot;, and that the &quot;boats appeared to be in a wedge type formation with the center boat the lead point of the wedge. Estimated speed of the boats was about &quot;, and that it &quot;appeared that they were approaching the ship in a torpedo launch attitude&quot;.

When the torpedo boats arrived, Commander Oren could see that the ship could not be the destroyer that had supposedly shelled Arish or any ship capable of speed. According to Michael Limor, an Israeli naval reservist serving on one of the torpedo boats, they attempted to contact the ship by heliograph and radio, but received no response. At , T-204 paused and signalled &quot;AA&quot;, which means &quot;identify yourself&quot;. Due to damaged equipment, McGonagle could only reply using a handheld Aldis lamp. Oren recalled receiving a similar response from the &quot;Ibrahim el Awal&quot;, an Egyptian destroyer captured by Israel during the Suez Crisis, and was convinced that he was facing an enemy ship. He consulted an Israeli identification guide to Arab fleets and concluded the ship was the Egyptian supply ship &quot;El Quseir&quot;, based on observing its deckline, midship bridge and smokestack. The captain of boat T-203 reached the same conclusion independently. The boats moved into battle formation, but did not attack.
As the torpedo boats rapidly approached, McGonagle ordered a sailor to proceed to machine gun Mount 51 and open fire. However, he then noticed that the boats appeared to be flying an Israeli flag, and &quot;realized that there was a possibility of the aircraft having been Israeli and the attack had been conducted in error&quot;. McGonagle ordered the man at gun mount 51 to hold fire, but a short burst was fired at the torpedo boats before the man understood the order.

McGonagle observed that machine gun Mount 53 began firing at the center torpedo boat at about the same time gun mount 51 fired, and that its fire was &quot;extremely effective and blanketed the area and the center torpedo boat&quot;. Machine gun mount 53 was located on the starboard amidships side, behind the pilot house. McGonagle could not see or &quot;get to mount 53 from the starboard wing of the bridge&quot;. So, he &quot;sent Mr. Lucas around the port side of the bridge, around to the skylights, to see if he could tell [Seaman] Quintero, whom [he] believed to be the gunner on Machine gun 53, to hold fire&quot;. Lucas &quot;reported back in a few minutes in effect that he saw no one at mount 53&quot;. Lucas, who had left the command bridge during the air attack and returned to assist McGonagle, believed that the sound of gunfire was likely from ammunition cooking off, due to a nearby fire. Previously, Lucas had granted a request from Quintero to fire at the torpedo boats, before heat from a nearby fire chased him from gun mount 53. McGonagle later testified, at the Court of Inquiry, that this was likely the &quot;extremely effective&quot; firing event he had observed.

After coming under fire, the torpedo boats returned fire with their cannons, killing &quot;Liberty&quot; helmsman. The torpedo boats then launched five torpedoes at the &quot;Liberty&quot;. At 12:35Z (14:35 local time) one torpedo hit &quot;Liberty&quot; on the starboard side forward of the superstructure, creating a wide hole in what had been a cargo hold converted to the ship&#x27;s research spaces and killing 25 servicemen, almost all of them from the intelligence section, and wounding dozens. It has been said the torpedo hit a major hull frame that absorbed much of the energy; crew members reported that if the torpedo had missed the frame the &quot;Liberty&quot; would have split in two. The other four torpedoes missed the ship.

The torpedo boats then closed in and strafed the ship&#x27;s hull with their cannons and machine guns. According to some crewmen, the torpedo boats fired at damage control parties and sailors preparing life rafts for launch. (See disputed details below.) A life raft which floated from the ship was picked up by T-203 and found to bear U.S. Navy markings. T-204 then circled &quot;Liberty&quot;, and Oren spotted the designation GTR-5, but saw no flag. It took until 15:30 to establish the ship&#x27;s identity. Shortly before the &quot;Liberty&quot;″s identity was confirmed, the &quot;Saratoga&quot; launched eight aircraft armed with conventional weapons towards &quot;Liberty&quot;. After the ship&#x27;s identity was confirmed, the General Staff was notified and an apology was sent to naval attaché Castle. The aircraft approaching &quot;Liberty&quot; were recalled to the &quot;Saratoga&quot;.

===Aftermath of the attack===
According to transcripts of intercepted radio communications, published by the U.S. National Security Agency, at about 14:30, near the beginning of the torpedo boat attack, two IAF helicopters were dispatched to &quot;Liberty&quot;″s location. The helicopters arrived at about 15:10, about 35 minutes after the torpedo hit the ship. After arriving, one of the helicopter pilots was asked by his ground-based controller to verify that the ship was flying an American flag. The helicopters conducted a brief search for crew members of the ship who might have fallen overboard during the air attack. No one was found. The helicopters left the ship at about 15:20.

At about 16:00, two hours after the attack began, Israel informed the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv that its military forces had mistakenly attacked a U.S. Navy ship. When the ship was &quot;confirmed to be American&quot; the torpedo boats returned at about 16:40 to offer help; it was refused by the &quot;Liberty&quot;. Later, Israel provided a helicopter to fly U.S. naval attaché Commander Castle to the ship. (pp. 32, 34)

In Washington, President Lyndon B. Johnson had received word from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that &quot;Liberty&quot; had been torpedoed by an unknown vessel at 09:50 eastern time. Johnson assumed that the Soviets were involved, and hotlined Moscow with news of the attack and the dispatch of jets from &quot;Saratoga&quot;. He chose not to make any public statements and delegated this task to Phil G. Goulding, who was an assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs at the time. Soon afterward, the Israelis said that they had mistakenly attacked the ship. The Johnson administration conveyed &quot;strong dismay&quot; to Israeli ambassador Avraham Harman. Meanwhile, apologies were soon sent by Israeli prime minister Levi Eshkol, Foreign Minister Abba Eban, and chargé d&#x27;affaires Ephraim Evron. Within 48 hours, Israel offered to compensate the victims and their families.

Though &quot;Liberty&quot; was severely damaged, with a 39 ft wide by 24 ft high (12 m × 7.3 m) hole and a twisted keel, her crew kept her afloat, and she was able to leave the area under her own power. &quot;Liberty&quot; was first met by Soviet Kildin class guided missile destroyer (DDG 626/4), which offered help. Subsequently it was met by the destroyers and , and the cruiser . Medical personnel were transferred to &quot;Liberty&quot;, and she was escorted to Malta, where she was given interim repairs. After these were completed in July 1967, &quot;Liberty&quot; returned to the U.S. She was decommissioned in June 1968 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. &quot;Liberty&quot; was transferred to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) in December 1970 and sold for scrap in 1973.

From the start, the response to Israeli statements of mistaken identity ranged between frank disbelief to unquestioning acceptance within the administration in Washington. A communication to the Israeli ambassador on 10 June, by Secretary Rusk stated, among other things:


George Lenczowski notes: &quot;It was significant that, in contrast to his secretary of state, President Johnson fully accepted the Israeli version of the tragic incident.&quot; He notes that Johnson himself included only one small paragraph about the &quot;Liberty&quot; in his autobiography, in which he accepted the Israeli explanation, minimized the affair and distorted the number of dead and wounded, by lowering them from 34 to 10 and 171 to 100, respectively. Lenczowski further states: &quot;It seems Johnson was more interested in avoiding a possible confrontation with the Soviet Union, ... than in restraining Israel.&quot;

McGonagle received the Medal of Honor, the highest U.S. medal, for his actions. The Medal of Honor is generally presented by the president of the United States in the White House, but this time it was awarded at the Washington Navy Yard by the Secretary of the Navy in an unpublicized ceremony. Other &quot;Liberty&quot; sailors received decorations for their actions during and after the attack, but most of the award citations omitted mention of Israel as the perpetrator. In 2009, however, a Silver Star was awarded to crewmember Terry Halbardier, who braved machine-gun and cannon fire to repair a damaged antenna that restored the ship&#x27;s communication; in his award citation Israel was named as the attacker.

===U.S. government investigations===

American inquiries, memoranda, records of testimony, and various reports involving or mentioning the &quot;Liberty&quot; attack include, but are not limited to, the following:
* U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry of June 1967
* Joint Chief of Staff&#x27;s Report of June 1967
* CIA Intelligence Memorandums of June 1967
* Clark Clifford Report of July 1967
* Senate Foreign Relations Committee Testimony during hearings of the 1967 Foreign Aid Authorization bill, July 1967
* House Armed Services Committee Investigation of 1971
* The NSA History Report of 1981

The U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry record contains testimony by &quot;Liberty&quot; crew members, exhibits of attack damage photographs, and various reports. The court concluded that the testimony record revealed &quot;a shallow investigation, plagued by myriad disagreements between the captain and his crew&quot;. According to the Navy Court of Inquiry&#x27;s record of proceedings, four days were spent hearing testimony: two days for fourteen survivors of the attack and several U.S. Navy expert witnesses, and two partial days for two expert U.S. Navy witnesses. No testimony was heard from Israeli personnel involved.

The official U.S. records of the Liberty incident were designated top-secret and closed to the general public. The U.S. government and Israel jointly stated: &quot;That the Israeli attack upon the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; had been the result of error, and nothing more.&quot; Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, Chief of Naval Operations after the &quot;Liberty&quot; incident, said that he &quot;cannot accept the claim by the Israelis that this was a case of mistaken identity&quot;.

The CIA Memoranda consists of two documents: one dated June 13, 1967, and the other dated June 21, 1967. The June 13 memorandum is an &quot;account of circumstances of the attack ... compiled from all available sources&quot;. The June 21 memorandum is a point-by-point analysis of the Israeli inquiry findings of fact. It concludes: &quot;The attack was not made in malice toward the U.S. and was by mistake, but the failure of the IDF Headquarters and the attacking aircraft to identify the &quot;Liberty&quot; and the subsequent attack by torpedo boats were both incongruous and indicative of gross negligence.&quot;

The Clark Clifford report concluded: &quot;The unprovoked attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot; constitutes a flagrant act of gross negligence for which the Israeli Government should be held completely responsible, and the Israeli military personnel involved should be punished.&quot;

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee testimony contains, as an aside during hearings concerning a foreign aid authorization bill, questions and statements from several senators and responses from then Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, about the &quot;Liberty&quot; attack. For the most part, the senators were dismayed about the attack, as expressed by Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper: &quot;From what I have read I can&#x27;t tolerate for one minute that this [attack] was an accident.&quot; There was concern about obtaining more information on the attack, as expressed by committee chairman J. William Fulbright: &quot;We asked for [the attack investigation report] about two weeks ago and have not received it yet from Secretary Rusk. ... By the time we get to it we will be on some other subject.&quot; Secretary McNamara promised fast delivery of the investigation report, &quot;... you will have it in four hours&quot;, and concluded his remarks by saying: &quot;I simply want to emphasize that the investigative report does not show any evidence of a conscious intent to attack a U.S. vessel.&quot;

The House Armed Services Committee investigation report, &quot;Review of Department of Defense Worldwide Communications&quot; was not an investigation focused on the &quot;Liberty&quot; attack, although it contains a section describing the flow of communications connected with the &quot;Liberty&quot; incident.

The National Security Agency (NSA) history report on the event included declassified documents which stated: &quot;Every official interview of numerous &quot;Liberty&quot; crewmen gave consistent evidence that indeed the &quot;Liberty&quot; was flying an American flag—and, further, the weather conditions were ideal to ensure its easy observance and identification.&quot;

The USS &quot;Liberty&quot; Veterans Association, composed of veterans from the ship, states that U.S. congressional investigations and other U.S. investigations were not actually investigations into the attack, but rather reports using evidence only from the U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry, or investigations unrelated to culpability that involved issues such as communications. In their view, the U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry is the only actual investigation on the incident to date. They say it was hastily conducted, in only ten days, even though the court&#x27;s president, Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd, said that it would take six months to conduct properly. The inquiry&#x27;s terms of reference were limited to whether any shortcomings on the part of the &quot;Liberty&quot;″s crew had contributed to the injuries and deaths that resulted from the attack.

Michael Oren (a former Israeli ambassador to the United States) contends that &quot;the United States National Archives contain no evidence to suggest that information obtained by the &quot;Liberty&quot; augmented Washington&#x27;s already detailed picture of events on the Golan front and of Israel&#x27;s intentions there.&quot;

===Israeli government investigations===
According to an Israel Foreign Ministry letter to the Israeli Embassy in Washington: 

Two subsequent Israeli inquiry reports and a historical report concluded the attack was conducted because &quot;Liberty&quot; was confused with an Egyptian vessel and because of failures in communications between Israel and the U.S. The three Israeli reports were:
* Fact Finding Inquiry by Colonel Ram Ron (&quot;Ram Ron Report&quot;—June 1967)
* Preliminary Inquiry (Hearing) by Examining Judge Yeshayahu Yerushalmi (&quot;Yerushalmi Report&quot;—July 1967) (Adjudication of IDF negligence complaints.)
* Historical Report &quot;The &quot;Liberty&quot; Incident&quot;—IDF History Department report (1982)

In the historical report, it was acknowledged that IDF naval headquarters knew at least three hours before the attack that the ship was &quot;an electromagnetic audio-surveillance ship of the U.S. Navy&quot; but concluded that this information had simply &quot;gotten lost, never passed along to the ground controllers who directed the air attack nor to the crews of the three Israeli torpedo boats&quot;.

The Israeli government said that three crucial errors were made: the refreshing of the status board (removing the ship&#x27;s classification as American, so that the later shift did not see it identified), the erroneous identification of the ship as an Egyptian vessel, and the lack of notification from the returning aircraft informing Israeli headquarters of markings on the front of the hull (markings that would not be found on an Egyptian ship). As a common root of these problems, Israel blamed the combination of alarm and fatigue experienced by the Israeli forces at that point of the war when pilots were severely overworked.

After conducting his own fact-finding inquiry and reviewing evidence, Judge Yerushalmi&#x27;s decision was: &quot;I have not discovered any deviation from the standard of reasonable conduct which would justify committal of anyone for trial.&quot; In other words, he found no negligence by any IDF member associated with the attack.

==Ongoing controversy and unresolved questions==
Some intelligence and military officials dispute Israel&#x27;s explanation. Dean Rusk, U.S. Secretary of State at the time of the incident, wrote:

Retired naval Lieutenant Commander James Ennes, a junior officer (and off-going Officer of the Deck) on &quot;Liberty&quot;″s bridge at the time of the attack, authored a book titled &quot;Assault on the Liberty&quot; describing the incident and saying, among other things, that the attack was deliberate. Ennes and Joe Meadors, also a survivor of the attack, run a website about the incident. Meadors states that the classification of the attack as deliberate is the official policy of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; Veterans Association, to which survivors and other former crew members belong. Other survivors run several additional websites. Citing Ennes&#x27;s book, Lenczowski notes: &quot;Liberty&quot;″s personnel received firm orders not to say anything to anybody about the attack, and the naval inquiry was conducted in such a way as to earn it the name of &quot;coverup&quot;.

In 2002, Captain Ward Boston, JAGC, U.S. Navy, senior counsel for the Court of Inquiry, said that the Court of Inquiry&#x27;s findings were intended to cover up what was a deliberate attack by Israel on a ship that the Israelis knew to be American. In 2004, in response to the publication of A. Jay Cristol&#x27;s book &quot;The Liberty Incident&quot;, which Boston said was an &quot;insidious attempt to whitewash the facts&quot;, Boston prepared and signed an affidavit in which he said that Admiral Kidd had told him that the government ordered Kidd to falsely report that the attack was a mistake, and that Boston and Kidd both believed the attack was deliberate. Cristol wrote about Boston&#x27;s professional qualifications and integrity, on page 149 of his book:

Cristol said he believes that Boston is not telling the truth about Kidd&#x27;s views and any pressure from the U.S. government. Cristol, who also served as an officer of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Judge Advocate General, suggests that Boston was responsible in part for the original conclusions of the Court of Inquiry and, that by later declaring that they were false, Boston has admitted to &quot;lying under oath&quot;. Cristol also notes that Boston&#x27;s statements about pressure on Kidd were hearsay, and that Kidd was not alive to confirm or deny them and that Boston did not maintain, prior to his affidavit and comments related to it, that Kidd spoke of such instructions to Boston or to others. Cristol also provides a handwritten 1991 letter from Admiral Kidd that, according to Cristol, &quot;suggest that Ward Boston has either a faulty memory or a vivid imagination&quot;. According to James Ennes, however, Admiral Kidd urged Ennes and his group to keep pressing for an open congressional probe.

The following arguments, found in official reports or other sources, were published to support the hypothesis that the attack was due to mistaken identity:
* Accidents and mistakes do occur in wartime. Journalist Ze&#x27;ev Schiff gave an example of a friendly fire incident where Israeli aircraft had bombed an Israeli armored column south of the West Bank town of Jenin the day before the attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot;. Also given as an example was a similar incident that took place during the Suez Crisis in 1956, when Israeli aircraft attacked and damaged the British frigate HMS &quot;Crane&quot; after mistaking it for an Egyptian warship, at a time when Britain and Israel were fighting together.
* The incident took place during the Six-Day War when Israel was engaged in battles with two Arab countries and preparing to attack a third, creating an environment where mistakes and confusion were prevalent. For example, at 11:45, a few hours before the attack, there was a large explosion on the shores of El-Arish followed by black smoke, probably caused by the destruction of an ammunition dump by retreating Egyptian forces. The Israeli army thought the area was being bombarded, and that an unidentified ship offshore was responsible.
* As the torpedo boats approached, &quot;Liberty&quot; opened fire on them. McGonagle said that he felt sure the torpedo boat captains believed they were under fire from the &quot;Liberty&quot;. Ensign Lucas, testified that he gave permission for the firing of the 03 level machine gun after the torpedo boats began firing at &quot;Liberty&quot;. Later, when the gun was unmanned, heat from a nearby fire apparently caused machine gun rounds at the gun to explode.
* Admiral Shlomo Erell, head of the Israeli Navy in 1967, stated that no successful argument of benefit has been presented for Israel purposely attacking an American warship, especially considering the high cost of predictable complications that would follow an attack on a powerful ally. He also pointed out that Israel notified the American embassy immediately after the attack.
Several books and the BBC documentary &quot;USS Liberty: Dead in the Water&quot; argued that &quot;Liberty&quot; was attacked in order to prevent the U.S. from knowing about the forthcoming attack in the Golan Heights, which would violate a cease-fire to which Israel&#x27;s government had agreed. However, Syria did not accept the cease fire until 9 June, after the attack on &quot;Liberty&quot;. Russian author Joseph Daichman, in his book &quot;History of the Mossad&quot;, states Israel was justified in attacking the &quot;Liberty&quot;. Israel knew that American radio signals were intercepted by the Soviet Union and that the Soviets would certainly inform Egypt of the fact that, by moving troops to the Golan Heights, Israel had left the Egyptian border undefended.

Lenczowski notes that while the Israeli decision to &quot;attack and destroy&quot; the ship &quot;may appear puzzling&quot;, the explanation seems to be found in &quot;Liberty&quot;″s nature and its task to monitor communications from both sides in the war zone. He writes that timely knowledge of their decision to invade Syria and preparatory moves toward it &quot;might have frustrated Israeli designs for the conquest of Syria&#x27;s Golan Heights&quot; and, in the sense of Ennes&#x27;s accusations, provides &quot;a plausible thesis that Israel deliberately decided to incapacitate the signals-collecting American ship and leave no one alive to tell the story of the attack&quot;.

The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Barbour, had reported on the day of the &quot;Liberty&quot; attack that he &quot;would not be surprised&quot; by an Israeli attack on Syria, and the IDF Intelligence chief told a White House aide then in Israel that &quot;there still remained the Syria problem and perhaps it would be necessary to give Syria a blow&quot;.

The 1981 book &quot;Weapons&quot; by Russell Warren Howe says that &quot;Liberty&quot; was accompanied by the Polaris ballistic missile-armed &quot;Lafayette&quot;-class submarine , which filmed the entire episode through its periscope but was unable to provide assistance.

James Bamford, a former ABC News producer, says in his 2001 book &quot;Body of Secrets&quot;, that Israel deliberately attacked &quot;Liberty&quot; to prevent the discovery of what he described as war crimes, including the killing of Egyptian prisoners of war by the IDF that he alleges was taking place around the same time in the nearby town of El-Arish. However, according to CAMERA, his claim that 400 Egyptians were executed has been cast into doubt since reporters present in the town claimed that there had been a large battle and this was the main cause of casualties. Bamford also stated that eyewitness Gabi Bron had claimed he saw 150 people executed by Israeli troops at El-Arish. However, Gabi Bron claimed to have only seen 5 people executed by Israeli troops.

The press release for the BBC documentary film &quot;Dead in the Water&quot; states that new recorded and other evidence suggests the attack was a &quot;daring ploy by Israel to fake an Egyptian attack&quot; to give America a reason to enter the war against Egypt. It claimed that President Lyndon B. Johnson launched allegedly nuclear-armed aircraft targeted against Cairo from a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. The aircraft were recalled only just in time, when it was clear the &quot;Liberty&quot; had not been sunk and that Israel had carried out the attack. An information source for the aircraft being nuclear-armed, James Ennes later stated:

The video also reports hearsay of a covert alliance of U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies.

Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a critic of the official U.S. government version of events, chaired a non-governmental investigation into the attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot; in 2003. The committee, which included former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia James E. Akins, found Israel to be culpable and suggested several theories for Israel&#x27;s possible motives, including the desire to blame Egypt and so bring the U.S. into the Six-Day War.

According to John Loftus and Mark Aarons in their book, &quot;The Secret War Against the Jews&quot;, &quot;Liberty&quot; was attacked because the Israelis knew that the ship&#x27;s mission was to monitor radio signals from Israeli troops and pass troop movement information to the Egyptians.

==NSA tapes and subsequent developments==
The NSA reported that there had been no radio intercepts of the attack made by the &quot;Liberty&quot; herself, nor had there been any radio intercepts made by the U.S. submarine . Within an hour of learning that the &quot;Liberty&quot; had been torpedoed, the director of the NSA, LTG Marshall S. Carter, sent a message to all intercept sites requesting a search of communications that might be connected to the attack or any reaction to it. The only such communication reported was intercepted by a U.S. Navy EC-121 aircraft that flew near the attacks from 14:30 to 15:27, Sinai time (12:30 to 13:27 Z); it had collected voice conversations between two Israeli helicopter pilots and the control tower at Hatzor Airfield following the attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot;.

On 2 July 2003, the NSA released copies of these recordings and their translations and summaries. These revelations were elicited as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Florida bankruptcy judge and retired naval aviator Jay Cristol. Two linguists who were aboard the EC-121 when the recordings were made said separately that at least two additional tapes were made that had been withheld. English language translations of the released tapes indicate that the Israelis spoke of hitting an Egyptian supply ship even after the end of attack. The rescue helicopters relayed urgent requests that the rescuers ask the first survivor pulled out of the water what his nationality is; there was discussion as to whether the survivors would speak Arabic.

A summary of the NSA-translated tapes indicates that at 12:34Z Hatzor air control began directing two Israeli Air Force helicopters to an Egyptian warship, to rescue its crew: &quot;This ship has now been identified as Egyptian.&quot; The helicopters arrived near the ship at about 13:03Z: &quot;I see a big vessel, near it are three small vessels ...&quot; At 13:08Z, Hatzor air control indicated concern about the nationality of the ship&#x27;s crew: &quot;The first matter to clarify is to find out what their nationality is.&quot; At 13:10Z, one of the helicopter pilots asked the nearby torpedo boats&#x27; Division Commander about the meaning of the ship&#x27;s hull number: &quot;GTR5 is written on it. Does this mean something?&quot; The response was: &quot;Negative, it doesn&#x27;t mean anything.&quot; At 13:12Z, one of the helicopter pilots was asked by air control: &quot;Did you clearly identify an American flag?&quot; No answer appears in the transcript, but the air controller then says: &quot;We request that you make another pass and check once more if this is really an American flag.&quot; Again, no response appears in the transcript. At about 13:14Z, the helicopters were directed to return home.

On 10 October 2003, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; ran an interview with Yiftah Spector, one of the pilots who participated in the attack. Spector said the ship was assumed to be Egyptian, stating that: &quot;there was positively no flag&quot;. The interview also contains the transcripts of the Israeli communications about the &quot;Liberty&quot;. However, the journalist who transcribed the tapes for that article, Arieh O&#x27;Sullivan, later confirmed that &quot;the Israeli Air Force tapes he listened to contained blank spaces&quot;. The &quot;Liberty&quot;″s survivors contradict Spector. According to subsequently declassified NSA documents: &quot;Every official interview of numerous &quot;Liberty&quot; crewmen gave consistent evidence that the &quot;Liberty&quot; was flying an American flag—and, further, the weather conditions were ideal to ensure its easy observance and identification.&quot;

On 8 June 2005, the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; Veterans Association filed a &quot;Report of War Crimes Committed Against the U.S. Military, June 8, 1967&quot; with the Department of Defense (DoD). They say Department of Defense Directive 2311.01E requires the Department of Defense to conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations contained in their report. DoD has responded that a new investigation would not be conducted since a Navy Court of Inquiry had already investigated the facts and circumstances surrounding the attack.

As of 2006, the NSA had yet to declassify &quot;boxes and boxes&quot; of &quot;Liberty&quot; documents. Numerous requests under both declassification directives and the Freedom of Information Act are pending with various agencies including the NSA, Central Intelligence Agency, and Defense Intelligence Agency. &quot;On 8 June 2007, the National Security Agency released hundreds of additional declassified documents on the Israeli attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot;, a communications interception vessel, on 8 June 1967.&quot;

On 2 October 2007, &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; published a special report into the attack, containing numerous previously unreported quotes from former military personnel with first-hand knowledge of the incident. Many of these quotes directly contradict the NSA&#x27;s position that it never intercepted the communications of the attacking Israeli pilots, saying that not only did transcripts of those communications exist, but also that it showed the Israelis knew they were attacking an American naval vessel.

Two diplomatic cables written by Avraham Harman, Israel&#x27;s ambassador in Washington, to Abba Eban, Israel&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, have been declassified by Israel and obtained from the Israel State Archive. The first cable, sent five days after the attack, informs Eban that a U.S. informant told Harman there was &quot;clear proof that from a certain stage the pilot discovered the identity of the ship and continued the attack anyway&quot;. The second cable, sent three days later, added that the White House is &quot;very angry&quot; because &quot;the Americans probably have findings showing that our pilots indeed knew that the ship was American&quot;. Documents of the Israeli General Staff meetings, declassified in October 2008, show no discussion of a planned attack on an American ship.

On 30 October 2014, Al Jazeera broadcast a documentary film containing recent first-hand accounts by several survivors of the incident. The documentary argues that Israel knew the ship was American, and planned to blame its sinking on Egypt in order to draw the United States into the war on the Israeli side.

==Details in dispute==


Various details regarding the attack are the subject of controversy:
* &quot;Visibility of American flag:&quot; The official Israeli reports say that the reconnaissance and fighter aircraft pilots, and the torpedo boat captains did not see any flag on the &quot;Liberty&quot;. Official American reports say that the &quot;Liberty&quot; was flying her American flag before, during and after the attack; the only exception being a brief period in which one flag had been shot down and was replaced with a larger flag. The helicopters sent to the attack site to provide assistance after the air attack noticed an American flag flying from the ship almost immediately upon their arrival at the attack site and informed their controller.
* &quot;U.S. crewmen&#x27;s perceptions of intent&quot;: Surviving crewmembers of the &quot;Liberty&quot; say that Israel&#x27;s attack on the ship was &quot;deliberate&quot; and with full knowledge that the vessel was American. Israeli investigation and history reports agree that the attack was deliberate—but against what they believed was an Egyptian vessel.
* &quot;Distinctiveness of USS Liberty&#x27;s appearance&quot;: It is disputed whether the &quot;Liberty&quot; would have been immediately recognizable as a different vessel from the Egyptian ship &quot;El Quseir&quot;. Admiral Thomas H. Moorer stated that the &quot;Liberty&quot; was the most identifiable ship in the U.S. Navy and in an interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; stated that it was &quot;ridiculous&quot; to suggest that it would not be identified as such. Israel states in its inquiry and history reports that the identification as the &quot;El Quseir&quot; was made by the torpedo boats while the &quot;Liberty&quot; was enveloped in smoke and was based on &quot;The Red Book&quot;, a guide to Arab fleets that did not include U.S. vessels.
* &quot;Identification markings&quot;: &quot;Liberty&quot; bore an eight-foot-high &quot;5&quot; and a four-foot-high &quot;GTR&quot; along either bow, clearly displaying her hull (or &quot;pennant&quot;) number (AGTR-5) to indicate she was a technical research ship. She also had -high letters spelling the vessel&#x27;s name across her stern. These markings were not cursive Arabic script but in the Latin alphabet. Israeli pilots initially said they were primarily concerned with ensuring the ship was not an Israeli warship and that they ended the air attack when they noticed the Latin alphabet markings.
* &quot;Ship&#x27;s identification known during attack&quot;: A James Bamford book published in 2001 said that secret NSA intercepts indicate that Israeli pilots had full knowledge they were attacking a U.S. vessel. 
* &quot;Effort for identification&quot;: The American crew says the attacking aircraft did not make identification runs over &quot;Liberty&quot;, but began to strafe immediately. Israel says several identification passes were made. The Naval Court of Enquiry, based on the Israeli timeline of events, found: &quot;One may infer from the fact that within a period of approximately 15 minutes, the request was transmitted (for aircraft to be dispatched), received, a command decision made, aircraft dispatched, and the attack launched, that no significant time was expended in an effort to identify the ship from the air before the attack was launched.&quot;
* &quot;Speed of the vessel&quot;: According to Israeli accounts, the torpedo boat made erroneous measurements that indicated that &quot;Liberty&quot; was steaming at . Israeli naval doctrine at the time required that a ship traveling at that speed must be presumed to be a warship. A second boat calculated &quot;Liberty&quot;″s speed to be . The maximum sustained speed of &quot;Liberty&quot; was only , . According to the Court of Enquiry findings the ship was steaming at at the time of the attack.
* &quot;Motive&quot;: James Bamford, among others, says one possible motive was to prevent the United States from eavesdropping on Israeli military activities and monitoring the events taking place in nearby Gaza. In a study of the incident concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support either accidental or deliberate attack, Colonel Peyton E. Smith wrote: &quot;The attack was most likely deliberate for reasons far too sensitive to be disclosed by the U.S. (or) Israeli government and that the truth may never be known&quot;. Author and former crew member James M. Ennes theorized, in the epilogue of his book &quot;Assault on the Liberty&quot;, that the motive was to prevent the ship&#x27;s crew from monitoring radio traffic that might reveal Israel as the aggressor in its impending invasion of Syria, which the White House opposed. According to the Anti Defamation League &quot;the argument that Israel knowingly attacked an American ship has always lacked a convincing motive&quot;.
* &quot;Israeli aircraft markings&quot;: The USS &quot;Liberty&quot; Veterans Association says that the attacking Israeli aircraft were not marked, but a crewmember recalls watching a Jewish officer cry on seeing the blue Star of David on their fuselages. The torpedo boats that attacked &quot;Liberty&quot; flew the Israeli flag.
* &quot;Jamming&quot;: During U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry testimony, Wayne L. Smith, Radioman Chief, testified that radio communications were intermittently jammed. Rear Admiral Kidd (a senior member of Naval Court of Inquiry) reported: &quot;&quot;Liberty&quot; reported apparent discriminate jamming on certain CW and voice circuits just before and during each aircraft&#x27;s individual attack.&quot; None of the Israeli Defense Forces&#x27; investigations or reports confirm or deny radio frequency jamming.
* &quot;Jamming as a motive&quot;: A UPI report published by &quot;The Washington Star&quot; on 19 September 1977 indicated CIA documents obtained by the American Palestine Committee suggested Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan ordered the attack, because &quot;Liberty&quot; was jamming Israeli communications. A CIA document dated 23 June 1967 said &quot;Liberty&quot; had been jamming Israeli communications. Another CIA document dated 9 November 1967 quoted unidentified agency informants as saying Dayan personally ordered the attack; the CIA said the documents were &quot;unevaluated for accuracy&quot;.
* &quot;Israeli ships&#x27; actions after the torpedo hit&quot;: Officers and men of &quot;Liberty&quot; say that after the torpedo attack and the abandon ship order, motor torpedo boats strafed the ship&#x27;s topside with automatic gunfire preventing men from escaping from below, and either machine-gunned or confiscated the empty life rafts that had been set afloat. The IDF says that &quot;Liberty&quot; was not fired upon after the torpedo attack and that a rescue raft was fished from the water while searching for survivors.
* &quot;Israeli offers of help&quot;: The &quot;Liberty&quot;″s captain, several of the &quot;Liberty&quot;″s crewmen and the Israelis stated that help was offered, but at different times. The &quot;Liberty&quot;″s Deck Log, signed by the captain, has an entry at 15:03 stating: &quot;One MTB returned to the ship and signaled, &#x27;Do you need help.&#x27;&quot; The Israel Defense Forces&#x27;s History Report and the Ram Ron report both say that help was offered at 16:40 and the offer was rejected.

<text>Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard, developed by USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), that allows data exchange and delivery of power between many types of electronics. It specifies its architecture, in particular its physical interface, and communication protocols for data transfer and power delivery to and from &quot;hosts&quot;, such as personal computers, to and from peripheral &quot;devices&quot;, e.g. displays, keyboards, and mass storage devices, and to and from intermediate &quot;hubs&quot;, which multiply the number of a host&#x27;s ports.

Introduced in 1996, USB was originally designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to computers, replacing various interfaces such as serial ports, parallel ports, game ports, and ADB ports. Early versions of USB became commonplace on a wide range of devices, such as keyboards, mice, cameras, printers, scanners, flash drives, smartphones, game consoles, and power banks. USB has since evolved into a standard to replace virtually all common ports on computers, mobile devices, peripherals, power supplies, and manifold other small electronics.

In the current standard, the USB-C connector replaces the many various connectors for power (up to 240 W), displays (e.g. DisplayPort, HDMI), and many other uses, as well as all previous USB connectors.

 USB consists of four generations of specifications: USB 1.&quot;x&quot;, USB 2.0, USB 3.&quot;x&quot;, and USB4. USB4 enhances the data transfer and power delivery functionality with a connection-oriented tunneling architecture designed to combine multiple protocols onto a single physical interface so that the total speed and performance of the USB4 Fabric can be dynamically shared.

USB4 particularly supports the tunneling of the Thunderbolt 3 protocols, namely PCI Express (PCIe, load/store interface) and DisplayPort (display interface). USB4 also adds host-to-host interfaces.

Each specification sub-version supports different signaling rates from 1.5 and 12 Mbit/s half-duplex in USB 1.0/1.1 to 80 Gbit/s full-duplex in USB4 2.0. USB also provides power to peripheral devices; the latest versions of the standard extend the power delivery limits for battery charging and devices requiring up to 240 watts as defined in USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) Rev. V3.1. Over the years, USB(-PD) has been adopted as the standard power supply and charging format for many mobile devices, such as mobile phones, reducing the need for proprietary chargers.

== Overview ==
USB was designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to personal computers, both to exchange data and to supply electric power. It has largely replaced interfaces such as serial ports and parallel ports and has become commonplace on various devices. Peripherals connected via USB include computer keyboards and mice, video cameras, printers, portable media players, mobile (portable) digital telephones, disk drives, and network adapters.

USB connectors have been increasingly replacing other types of charging cables for portable devices.

USB connector interfaces are classified into three types: the many various &quot;legacy&quot; Type-A (upstream) and Type-B (downstream) connectors found on &quot;hosts&quot;, &quot;hubs&quot;, and &quot;peripheral devices&quot;, and the modern Type-C (USB-C) connector, which replaces the many legacy connectors as the only applicable connector for USB4.

The Type-A and Type-B connectors came in Standard, Mini, and Micro sizes. The standard format was the largest and was mainly used for desktop and larger peripheral equipment. The Mini-USB connectors (Mini-A, Mini-B, Mini-AB) were introduced for mobile devices. Still, they were quickly replaced by the thinner Micro-USB connectors (Micro-A, Micro-B, Micro-AB). The Type-C connector, also known as USB-C, is not exclusive to USB, is the only current standard for USB, is required for USB4, and is required by other standards, including modern DisplayPort and Thunderbolt. It is reversible and can support various functionalities and protocols, including USB; some are mandatory, and many are optional, depending on the type of hardware: host, peripheral device, or hub.

USB specifications provide backward compatibility, usually resulting in decreased signaling rates, maximal power offered, and other capabilities. The USB 1.1 specification replaces USB 1.0. The USB 2.0 specification is backward-compatible with USB 1.0/1.1. The USB 3.2 specification replaces USB 3.1 (and USB 3.0) while including the USB 2.0 specification. USB4 &quot;functionally replaces&quot; USB 3.2 while retaining the USB 2.0 bus operating in parallel.

The USB 3.0 specification defined a new architecture and protocol named &quot;SuperSpeed&quot; (aka &quot;SuperSpeed USB&quot;, marketed as &quot;SS&quot;), which included a new lane for a new signal coding scheme (8b/10b symbols, 5 Gbit/s; later also known as &quot;Gen 1&quot;) providing full-duplex data transfers that physically required five additional wires and pins, while preserving the USB 2.0 architecture and protocols and therefore keeping the original four pins/wires for the USB 2.0 backward-compatibility resulting in 9 wires (with 9 or 10 pins at connector interfaces; ID-pin is not wired) in total.

The USB 3.1 specification introduced an &quot;Enhanced SuperSpeed System&quot; – while preserving the &quot;SuperSpeed&quot; architecture and protocol (&quot;SuperSpeed USB&quot;) – with an additional &quot;SuperSpeedPlus&quot; architecture and protocol (aka &quot;SuperSpeedPlus USB&quot;) adding a new coding schema (128b/132b symbols, 10 Gbit/s; also known as &quot;Gen 2&quot;); for some time marketed as &quot;SuperSpeed+&quot; (&quot;SS+&quot;).

The USB 3.2 specification added a second lane to the &quot;Enhanced SuperSpeed System&quot; besides other enhancements so that the &quot;SuperSpeedPlus USB&quot; system part implements the &quot;Gen 1×2&quot;, &quot;Gen 2×1,&quot; and &quot;Gen 2×2&quot; operation modes. However, the &quot;SuperSpeed USB&quot; part of the system still implements the one-lane &quot;Gen 1×1&quot; operation mode. Therefore, two-lane operations, namely &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 1×2 &quot;(10 Gbit/s) and &quot;Gen 2×2 &quot;(20 Gbit/s), are only possible with Full-Featured USB-C. As of 2023, they are somewhat rarely implemented; Intel, however, started to include them in its 11th-generation SoC processor models, but Apple never provided them. On the other hand, &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 1(×1)&quot; (5 Gbit/s) and &quot;Gen 2(×1)&quot; (10 Gbit/s) have been quite common for some years.

===Connector type quick reference===

Each USB connection is made using two connectors: a &quot;receptacle&quot; and a &quot;plug&quot;. Pictures show only receptacles:

=== Objectives ===
The Universal Serial Bus was developed to simplify and improve the interface between personal computers and peripheral devices, such as cell phones, computer accessories, and monitors, when compared with previously existing standard or &quot;ad hoc&quot; proprietary interfaces.

From the computer user&#x27;s perspective, the USB interface improves ease of use in several ways:
* The USB interface is self-configuring, eliminating the need for the user to adjust the device&#x27;s settings for speed or data format, or configure interrupts, input/output addresses, or direct memory access channels.
* USB connectors are standardized at the host, so any peripheral can use most available receptacles.
* USB takes full advantage of the additional processing power that can be economically put into peripheral devices so that they can manage themselves. As such, USB devices often do not have user-adjustable interface settings.
* The USB interface is hot-swappable (devices can be exchanged without shutting the host computer down).
* Small devices can be powered directly from the USB interface, eliminating the need for additional power supply cables.
* Because the use of the USB logo is only permitted after compliance testing, the user can have confidence that a USB device will work as expected without extensive interaction with settings and configuration.
* The USB interface defines protocols for recovery from common errors, improving reliability over previous interfaces.
* Installing a device that relies on the USB standard requires minimal operator action. When a user plugs a device into a port on a running computer, it either entirely automatically configures using existing device drivers, or the system prompts the user to locate a driver, which it then installs and configures automatically.

The USB standard also provides multiple benefits for hardware manufacturers and software developers, specifically in the relative ease of implementation:
* The USB standard eliminates the requirement to develop proprietary interfaces to new peripherals.
* The wide range of transfer speeds available from a USB interface suits devices ranging from keyboards and mice up to streaming video interfaces.
* A USB interface can be designed to provide the best available latency for time-critical functions or can be set up to do background transfers of bulk data with little impact on system resources.
* The USB interface is generalized with no signal lines dedicated to only one function of one device.

===Limitations===
As with all standards, USB possesses multiple limitations to its design:
* USB cables are limited in length, as the standard was intended for peripherals on the same tabletop, not between rooms or buildings. However, a USB port can be connected to a gateway that accesses distant devices.
* USB data transfer rates are slower than those of other interconnects such as 100 Gigabit Ethernet.
* USB has a strict tree network topology and master/slave protocol for addressing peripheral devices; slave devices cannot interact with one another except via the host, and two hosts cannot communicate over their USB ports directly. Some extension to this limitation is possible through USB On-The-Go, Dual-Role-Devices and protocol bridge.
* A host cannot broadcast signals to all peripherals at once; each must be addressed individually.
* While converters exist between certain legacy interfaces and USB, they might not provide a full implementation of the legacy hardware. For example, a USB-to-parallel-port converter might work well with a printer, but not with a scanner that requires bidirectional use of the data pins.

For a product developer, using USB requires the implementation of a complex protocol and implies an &quot;intelligent&quot; controller in the peripheral device. Developers of USB devices intended for public sale generally must obtain a USB ID, which requires that they pay a fee to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). Developers of products that use the USB specification must sign an agreement with the USB-IF. Use of the USB logos on the product requires annual fees and membership in the organization.

== History ==
A group of seven companies began the development of USB in 1995: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. The goal was to make it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors at the back of PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB, as well as permitting greater data transfer rates for external devices and plug and play features. Concepts of the 1979 Atari SIO serial bus, of the 8-bit Atari commuters, and the 1980 IEEE-488 derived Commodore bus, and Hewlett Packard&#x27;s HP-IL bus pioneered this approach. A consortium lead by Apple, and containing Sony, Panasonic (Matsushita), LG, Toshiba, Hitachi, Cannon, Philips Electronics, Compaq, Thomson and Texas Instruments, would develop the concept further, from 1986, as the IEEE 1394 firewire standard and patent pool. Joseph C. Decuir, originally of Atari, then Commodore, and a designer of the Atari SIO common bus, would work on the USB project, for Microsoft, obtaining one of the related US patents. Ajay Bhatt and his team worked on the standard at Intel; the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in 1995.

=== USB 1.&quot;x&quot; ===

Released in January 1996, USB 1.0 specified signaling rates of 1.5 Mbit/s (&quot;Low Bandwidth&quot; or &quot;Low Speed&quot;) and 12 Mbit/s (&quot;Full Speed&quot;). It did not allow for extension cables, due to timing and power limitations. Few USB devices made it to the market until USB 1.1 was released in August 1998. USB 1.1 was the earliest revision that was widely adopted and led to what Microsoft designated the &quot;Legacy-free PC&quot;.

Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 specified a design for any connector smaller than the standard type A or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturized type B connector appeared on many peripherals, conformity to the USB 1.&quot;x&quot; standard was hampered by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors as though they had a tethered connection (that is: no plug or receptacle at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (revision 1.01) introduced one.

=== USB 2.0 ===
USB 2.0 was released in April 2000, adding a higher maximum signaling rate of 480 Mbit/s (maximum theoretical data throughput 53 MByte/s) named &quot;High Speed&quot; or &quot;High Bandwidth&quot;, in addition to the USB 1.&quot;x&quot; &quot;Full Speed&quot; signaling rate of 12 Mbit/s (maximum theoretical data throughput 1.2 MByte/s).

Modifications to the USB specification have been made via engineering change notices (ECNs). The most important of these ECNs are included into the USB 2.0 specification package available from USB.org:

* &quot;Mini-A and Mini-B Connector&quot;
* &quot;Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification 1.01&quot;
* &quot;InterChip USB Supplement&quot;
* &quot;On-The-Go Supplement 1.3&quot; USB On-The-Go makes it possible for two USB devices to communicate with each other without requiring a separate USB host
* &quot;Battery Charging Specification 1.1&quot; Added support for dedicated chargers, host chargers behavior for devices with dead batteries
* &quot;Battery Charging Specification 1.2&quot;: with increased current of 1.5 A on charging ports for unconfigured devices, allowing high-speed communication while having a current up to 1.5 A
* &quot;Link Power Management Addendum ECN&quot;, which adds a &quot;sleep&quot; power state

=== USB 3.&quot;x&quot; ===

The USB 3.0 specification was released on 12 November 2008, with its management transferring from USB 3.0 Promoter Group to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) and announced on 17 November 2008 at the SuperSpeed USB Developers Conference.

USB 3.0 adds a new architecture and protocol named &quot;SuperSpeed&quot;, with associated backward-compatible plugs, receptacles, and cables. SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles are identified with a distinct logo and blue inserts in standard format receptacles.

The SuperSpeed architecture provides for an operation mode at a rate of 5.0 Gbit/s, in addition to the three existing operation modes. Its efficiency is dependent on a number of factors including physical symbol encoding and link-level overhead. At a 5 Gbit/s signaling rate with 8b/10b encoding, each byte needs 10 bits to transmit, so the raw throughput is 500 MB/s. When flow control, packet framing and protocol overhead are considered, it is realistic for about two-thirds of the raw throughput, or 330 MB/s to transmit to an application. SuperSpeed&#x27;s architecture is full-duplex; all earlier implementations, USB 1.0-2.0, are all half-duplex, arbitrated by the host.

Low-power and high-power devices remain operational with this standard, but devices implementing SuperSpeed can provide an increased current of between 150 mA and 900 mA, by discrete steps of 150 mA.

USB 3.0 also introduced the USB Attached SCSI Protocol (UASP), which provides generally faster transfer speeds than the BOT (Bulk-Only-Transfer) protocol.

USB 3.1, released in July 2013 has two variants. The first one preserves USB 3.0&#x27;s &quot;SuperSpeed&quot; architecture and protocol and its operation mode is newly named &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 1&quot;, and the second version introduces a distinctively new &quot;SuperSpeedPlus&quot; architecture and protocol with a second operation mode named as &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 2&quot; (marketed as &quot;SuperSpeed+ USB&quot;). SuperSpeed+ doubles the maximum signaling rate to 10 Gbit/s (later marketed as &quot;SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps&quot; by the USB 3.2 specification), while reducing line encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b.

USB 3.2, released in September 2017, preserves existing USB 3.1 &quot;SuperSpeed&quot; and &quot;SuperSpeedPlus&quot; architectures and protocols and their respective operation modes, but introduces two additional &quot;SuperSpeedPlus&quot; operation modes (&quot;USB 3.2 Gen 1×2&quot; and &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2×2&quot;) with the new USB-C Fabric with signaling rates of 10 and 20 Gbit/s (raw data rates of 1212 and 2424 MB/s). The increase in bandwidth is a result of two-lane operation over existing wires that were originally intended for flip-flop capabilities of the USB-C connector.

==== Naming scheme ====
Starting with the USB 3.2 specification, USB-IF introduced a new naming scheme. To help companies with the branding of the different operation modes, USB-IF recommended branding the 5, 10, and 20 Gbit/s capabilities as &quot;SuperSpeed USB 5Gbps&quot;, &quot;SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps&quot;, and &quot;SuperSpeed USB 20 Gbps&quot;, respectively.

In 2023, they were replaced again, removing &quot;SuperSpeed&quot;, with &quot;USB 5Gbps&quot;, &quot;USB 10Gbps&quot;, and &quot;USB 20Gbps&quot;. With new &quot;Packaging&quot; and &quot;Port&quot; logos.
=== USB4===



The USB4 specification was released on 29 August 2019 by the USB Implementers Forum.

The USB4 2.0 specification was released on 1 September 2022 by the USB Implementers Forum.

USB4 is based on the Thunderbolt 3 protocol. It supports 40 Gbit/s throughput, is compatible with Thunderbolt 3, and backward compatible with USB 3.2 and USB 2.0. The architecture defines a method to share a single high-speed link with multiple end device types dynamically that best serves the transfer of data by type and application.

During CES 2020, USB-IF and Intel stated their intention to allow USB4 products that support all the optional functionality as Thunderbolt 4 products.

USB4 2.0 with 80 Gbit/s speeds was to be revealed in November 2022. Further technical details were to be released at two USB developer days scheduled for November 2022.

The USB4 specification states that the following technologies shall be supported by USB4:

==== September 2022 naming scheme ====

Because of the previous confusing naming schemes, USB-IF decided to change it once again. As of 2 September 2022, marketing names follow the syntax &quot;USB &quot;x&quot;Gbps&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is the speed of transfer in Gbit/s. Overview of the updated names and logos can be seen in the adjacent table.

The operation modes USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 and USB4 Gen 2×2 – or: USB 3.2 Gen 2×1 and USB4 Gen 2×1 – are not interchangeable or compatible; all participating controllers must operate with the same mode.

=== Version history ===

==== Release versions ====
==== Power-related standards ====
== System design ==
A USB system consists of a host with one or more downstream facing ports (DFP), and multiple peripherals, forming a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may be included, allowing up to five tiers. A USB host may have multiple controllers, each with one or more ports. Up to 127 devices may be connected to a single host controller. USB devices are linked in series through hubs. The hub built into the host controller is called the &quot;root hub&quot;.

A USB device may consist of several logical sub-devices that are referred to as &quot;device functions&quot;. A &quot;composite device&quot; may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). An alternative to this is a &quot;compound device,&quot; in which the host assigns each logical device a distinct address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.

USB device communication is based on &quot;pipes&quot; (logical channels). A pipe connects the host controller to a logical entity within a device, called an &quot;endpoint&quot;. Because pipes correspond to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Each USB device can have up to 32 endpoints (16 &quot;in&quot; and 16 &quot;out&quot;), though it is rare to have so many. Endpoints are defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called &quot;enumeration&quot;) and so are relatively permanent, whereas pipes may be opened and closed.

There are two types of pipe: stream and message.
* A &quot;message&quot; pipe is bi-directional and is used for &quot;control&quot; transfers. Message pipes are typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and for status responses from the device, used, for example, by the bus control pipe number 0.
* A &quot;stream&quot; pipe is a uni-directional pipe connected to a uni-directional endpoint that transfers data using an &quot;isochronous&quot;, &quot;interrupt&quot;, or &quot;bulk&quot; transfer:
*;Isochronous transfers: At some guaranteed data rate (for fixed-bandwidth streaming data) but with possible data loss (e.g., realtime audio or video)
*;Interrupt transfers: Devices that need guaranteed quick responses (bounded latency) such as pointing devices, mice, and keyboards
*;Bulk transfers: Large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth, but with no guarantees on bandwidth or latency (e.g., file transfers)

When a host starts a data transfer, it sends a TOKEN packet containing an endpoint specified with a tuple of &quot;(device_address, endpoint_number)&quot;. If the transfer is from the host to the endpoint, the host sends an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) with the desired device address and endpoint number. If the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer&#x27;s designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer&#x27;s designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.

Endpoints are grouped into &quot;interfaces&quot; and each interface is associated with a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a &quot;composite device&quot;. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.

When a USB device is first connected to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The signaling rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device&#x27;s information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device is supported by the host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.

The host controller directs traffic flow to devices, so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB 2.0, the host controller polls the bus for traffic, usually in a round-robin fashion. The throughput of each USB port is determined by the slower speed of either the USB port or the USB device connected to the port.

High-speed USB 2.0 hubs contain devices called transaction translators that convert between high-speed USB 2.0 buses and full and low speed buses. There may be one translator per hub or per port.

Because there are two separate controllers in each USB 3.0 host, USB 3.0 devices transmit and receive at USB 3.0 signaling rates regardless of USB 2.0 or earlier devices connected to that host. Operating signaling rates for earlier devices are set in the legacy manner.

== Device classes ==
The functionality of a USB device is defined by a class code sent to a USB host. This allows the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.

Device classes include:

=== USB mass storage / USB drive ===


The USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS) standardizes connections to storage devices. At first intended for magnetic and optical drives, it has been extended to support flash drives and SD card readers. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.

Though most personal computers since early 2005 can boot from USB mass storage devices, USB is not intended as a primary bus for a computer&#x27;s internal storage. However, USB has the advantage of allowing hot-swapping, making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds.

Several manufacturers offer external portable USB hard disk drives, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, limited by the number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include eSATA, ExpressCard, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and most recently Thunderbolt.

Another use for USB mass storage devices is the portable execution of software applications (such as web browsers and VoIP clients) with no need to install them on the host computer.

=== Media Transfer Protocol ===
Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was designed by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device&#x27;s filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP was designed for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol—an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.

=== Human interface devices ===
A USB mouse or keyboard can usually be used with older computers that have PS/2 ports with the aid of a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, a passive adapter that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the USB hardware in the keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Active converters that connect USB keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to PS/2 ports also exist.

=== Device Firmware Upgrade mechanism ===
&quot;Device Firmware Upgrade&quot; (DFU) is a generic mechanism for upgrading the firmware of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) a way to deploy firmware bug fixes. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications. Doing so allows use of DFU-compatible host tools to update the device.

DFU is sometimes used as a flash memory programming protocol in microcontrollers with built-in USB bootloader functionality.
=== Audio streaming ===
The USB Device Working Group has laid out specifications for audio streaming, and specific standards have been developed and implemented for audio class uses, such as microphones, speakers, headsets, telephones, musical instruments, etc. The working group has published three versions of audio device specifications: USB Audio 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, referred to as &quot;UAC&quot; or &quot;ADC&quot;.

UAC 3.0 primarily introduces improvements for portable devices, such as reduced power usage by bursting the data and staying in low power mode more often, and power domains for different components of the device, allowing them to be shut down when not in use.

UAC 2.0 introduced support for High Speed USB (in addition to Full Speed), allowing greater bandwidth for multi-channel interfaces, higher sample rates, lower inherent latency, and 8× improvement in timing resolution in synchronous and adaptive modes. UAC2 also introduced the concept of clock domains, which provides information to the host about which input and output terminals derive their clocks from the same source, as well as improved support for audio encodings like DSD, audio effects, channel clustering, user controls, and device descriptions.

UAC 1.0 devices are still common, however, due to their cross-platform driverless compatibility, and also partly due to Microsoft&#x27;s failure to implement UAC 2.0 for over a decade after its publication, having finally added support to Windows 10 through the Creators Update on 20 March 2017. UAC 2.0 is also supported by macOS, iOS, and Linux, however Android only implements a subset of the UAC 1.0 specification.

USB provides three isochronous (fixed-bandwidth) synchronization types, all of which are used by audio devices:

* Asynchronous — The ADC or DAC are not synced to the host computer&#x27;s clock at all, operating off a free-running clock local to the device.
* Synchronous — The device&#x27;s clock is synced to the USB start-of-frame (SOF) or Bus Interval signals. For instance, this can require syncing an 11.2896 MHz clock to a 1 kHz SOF signal, a large frequency multiplication.
* Adaptive — The device&#x27;s clock is synced to the amount of data sent per frame by the host

While the USB spec originally described asynchronous mode being used in &quot;low cost speakers&quot; and adaptive mode in &quot;high-end digital speakers&quot;, the opposite perception exists in the hi-fi world, where asynchronous mode is advertised as a feature, and adaptive/synchronous modes have a bad reputation. In reality, all types can be high-quality or low-quality, depending on the quality of their engineering and the application. Asynchronous has the benefit of being untied from the computer&#x27;s clock, but the disadvantage of requiring sample rate conversion when combining multiple sources.

== Connectors ==
The connectors the USB committee specifies support a number of USB&#x27;s underlying goals, and reflect lessons learned from the many connectors the computer industry has used. The female connector mounted on the host or device is called the &quot;receptacle&quot;, and the male connector attached to the cable is called the &quot;plug&quot;. The official USB specification documents also periodically define the term &quot;male&quot; to represent the plug, and &quot;female&quot; to represent the receptacle.

The design is intended to make it difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification requires that the cable plug and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation. The USB-C plug however is reversible. USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle, with no screws, clips, or thumb-turns as some connectors use.

The different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources. However, some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as USB On-The-Go in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables.

USB connector types multiplied as the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles. The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another. The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins, so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection. Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made. Charging docks supply power, and do not include a host device or data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable. Charging cables provide power connections but not data. In a charge-only cable, the data wires are shorted at the device end; otherwise, the device may reject the charger as unsuitable.

== Cabling ==

The USB 1.1 standard specifies that a standard cable can have a maximum length of with devices operating at full speed (12 Mbit/s), and a maximum length of with devices operating at low speed (1.5 Mbit/s).

USB 2.0 provides for a maximum cable length of for devices running at high speed (480 Mbit/s).

The USB 3.0 standard does not directly specify a maximum cable length, requiring only that all cables meet an electrical specification: for copper cabling with AWG 26 wires the maximum practical length is .

=== USB bridge cables ===
USB bridge cables, or data transfer cables can be found within the market, offering direct PC to PC connections. A bridge cable is a special cable with a chip and active electronics in the middle of the cable. The chip in the middle of the cable acts as a peripheral to both computers and allows for peer-to-peer communication between the computers. The USB bridge cables are used to transfer files between two computers via their USB ports.

Popularized by Microsoft as Windows Easy Transfer, the Microsoft utility used a special USB bridge cable to transfer personal files and settings from a computer running an earlier version of Windows to a computer running a newer version. In the context of the use of &quot;Windows Easy Transfer&quot; software, the bridge cable can sometimes be referenced as &quot;Easy Transfer cable&quot;.

Many USB bridge / data transfer cables are still USB 2.0, but there are also a number of USB 3.0 transfer cables. Despite USB 3.0 being 10 times faster than USB 2.0, USB 3.0 transfer cables are only 2 to 3 times faster given their design.

The USB 3.0 specification introduced an A-to-A cross-over cable without power for connecting two PCs. These are not meant for data transfer but are aimed at diagnostic uses.

==== Dual-role USB connections ====
USB bridge cables have become less important with USB dual-role-device capabilities introduced with the USB 3.1 specification. Under the most recent specifications, USB supports most scenarios connecting systems directly with a Type-C cable. For the capability to work, however, connected systems must support role-switching. Dual-role capabilities requires there be &quot;two&quot; controllers within the system, as well as a &quot;role controller&quot;. While this can be expected in a mobile platform such as a tablet or a phone, desktop PCs and laptops often will not support dual roles.

== Power ==
Upstream USB connectors supply power at a nominal 5 V DC via the V_BUS pin to downstream USB devices.

=== Low-power and high-power devices ===

This section describes the power distribution model of USB that existed before Power-Delivery (USB-PD). On devices that do not use PD, USB provides up to 4.5 W through Type-A and Type-B connectors, and up to 15 W through USB-C. All pre-PD USB power is provided at 5 V.

For a host providing power to devices, USB has a concept of the &quot;unit load&quot;. Any device may draw power of one unit, and devices may request more power in these discrete steps. It is not required that the host provide requested power, and a device may not draw more power than negotiated.

Devices that draw no more than one unit are said to be &quot;low-power&quot; devices. All devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured. For USB devices up to USB 2.0 a unit load is 100 mA (or 500 mW), while USB 3.0 defines a unit load as 150 mA (750 mW). Full-featured USB-C can support low-power devices with a unit load of 250 mA (or 1250 mW).

Devices that draw more than one unit are &quot;high-power&quot; devices (such as typical 2.5-inch hard disk drives). USB up to 2.0 allows a host or hub to provide up to 2.5 W to each device, in five discrete steps of 100 mA, and SuperSpeed devices (USB 3.x) allows a host or a hub to provide up to 4.5 W in six steps of 150 mA.
USB-C allows for dual-lane operation of USB 3.x with larger unit load (250 mA; up to 7.5 W). USB-C also allows for Type-C Current as a replacement for USB BC, signaling power availability in a simple way, without needing any data connection.

To recognize Battery Charging mode, a dedicated charging port places a resistance not exceeding 200 Ω across the D+ and D− terminals. Shorted or near-shorted data lanes with less than 200 Ω of resistance across the D+ and D− terminals signify a dedicated charging port (DCP) with indefinite charging rates.

In addition to standard USB, there is a proprietary high-powered system known as PoweredUSB, developed in the 1990s, and mainly used in point-of-sale terminals such as cash registers.

== Signaling ==
USB signals are transmitted using differential signaling on twisted-pair data wires with characteristic impedance. USB 2.0 and earlier specifications define a single pair in half-duplex (HDx). USB 3.0 and later specifications define one dedicated pair for USB 2.0 compatibility and two or four pairs for data transfer: two data wire pairs realising full-duplex (FDx) for single lane (&quot;×1&quot;) variants require at least SuperSpeed (SS) connectors; four pairs realising full-duplex for two lane (&quot;×2&quot;) variants require USB-C connectors. 

USB4 Gen 4 requires the use of all four pairs but allow for asymmetrical pairs configuration. In this case one data wire pair is used for the upstream data and the other three for the downstream data or vice-versa. USB4 Gen 4 use pulse amplitude modulation on 3 levels, providing a trit of information every baud transmitted, the transmission frequency of 12.8 GHz translate to a transmission rate of 25.6 GBd and the 11-bit–to–7-trit translation provides a theoretical maximum transmission speed just over 40.2 Gbit/s.

* Low-speed (LS) and Full-speed (FS) modes use a single data wire pair, labeled D+ and D−, in half-duplex. Transmitted signal levels are for logical low, and for logical high level. The signal lines are not terminated.
* High-speed (HS) uses the same wire pair, but with different electrical conventions. Lower signal voltages of for low and for logical high level, and termination of 45 Ω to ground or 90 Ω differential to match the data cable impedance.
* SuperSpeed (SS) adds two additional pairs of shielded twisted data wires (and new, mostly compatible expanded connectors) besides another grounding wire. These are dedicated to full-duplex SuperSpeed operation. The SuperSpeed link operates independently from the USB 2.0 channel and takes precedence on connection. Link configuration is performed using LFPS (Low Frequency Periodic Signaling, approximately at 20 MHz frequency), and electrical features include voltage de-emphasis at the transmitter side, and adaptive linear equalization on the receiver side to combat electrical losses in transmission lines, and thus the link introduces the concept of &quot;link training&quot;.
* SuperSpeed+ (SS+) uses a new coding scheme with an increased signaling rate (Gen 2×1 mode) and/or the additional lane of USB-C (Gen 1×2 and Gen 2×2 modes).

A USB connection is always between an &quot;A&quot; end, either a &quot;host&quot; or a downstream port of a hub, and a &quot;B&quot; end, either a &quot;peripheral device&quot; or the upstream port of a hub. Historically this was made clear by the fact that hosts had only Type-A and peripheral devices had only Type-B ports, and every compatible cable had one Type-A plug and one Type-B plug. USB-C (Type-C) is a single connector that replaces all legacy Type-A and Type-B connectors, so when both sides are equipment with USB Type-C ports they negotiate which is the &quot;host&quot; and which is the &quot;device&quot;.

== Protocol layer ==

During USB communication, data is transmitted as packets. Initially, all packets are sent from the host via the root hub, and possibly more hubs, to devices. Some of those packets direct a device to send some packets in reply.

== Transactions ==
The basic transactions of USB are:
* OUT transaction
* IN transaction
* SETUP transaction
* Control transfer exchange

== Related standards ==
=== Media Agnostic USB ===
The USB Implementers Forum introduced the Media Agnostic USB (MA-USB) v.1.0 wireless communication standard based on the USB protocol on 29 July 2015. Wireless USB is a cable-replacement technology, and uses ultra-wideband wireless technology for data rates of up to 480 Mbit/s.

The USB-IF used WiGig Serial Extension v1.2 specification as its initial foundation for the MA-USB specification and is compliant with SuperSpeed USB (3.0 and 3.1) and Hi-Speed USB (USB 2.0). Devices that use MA-USB will be branded as &quot;Powered by MA-USB&quot;, provided the product qualifies its certification program.

=== InterChip USB ===

InterChip USB is a chip-to-chip variant that eliminates the conventional transceivers found in normal USB. The HSIC physical layer uses about 50% less power and 75% less board area compared to USB 2.0. It is an alternative standard to SPI and I2C.

=== USB-C ===

USB-C (officially &quot;USB Type-C&quot;) is a standard that defines a new connector, and several new connection features. Among them it supports &quot;Alternate Mode&quot;, which allows transporting other protocols via the USB-C connector and cable. This is commonly used to support the DisplayPort or HDMI protocols, which allows connecting a display, such as a computer monitor or television set, via USB-C.

All other connectors are not capable of two-lane operations (Gen 1×2 and Gen 2×2) in USB 3.2, but can be used for one-lane operations (Gen 1×1 and Gen 2×1).

=== DisplayLink ===

DisplayLink is a technology which allows multiple displays to be connected to a computer via USB. It was introduced around 2006, and before the advent of Alternate Mode over USB-C it was the only way to connect displays via USB. It is a proprietary technology, not standardized by the USB Implementers Forum and typically requires a separate device driver on the computer.

== Comparisons with other connection methods ==
=== FireWire (IEEE 1394) ===
At first, USB was considered a complement to FireWire (IEEE 1394) technology, which was designed as a high-bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.

The most significant technical differences between FireWire and USB include:

* USB networks use a tiered-star topology, while IEEE 1394 networks use a tree topology.
* USB 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a &quot;speak-when-spoken-to&quot; protocol, meaning that each peripheral communicates with the host when the host specifically requests communication. USB 3.0 allows for device-initiated communications towards the host. A FireWire device can communicate with any other node at any time, subject to network conditions.
* A USB network relies on a single host at the top of the tree to control the network. All communications are between the host and one peripheral. In a FireWire network, any capable node can control the network.
* USB runs with a 5 V power line, while FireWire supplies 12 V and theoretically can supply up to 30 V.
* Standard USB hub ports can provide from the typical 500 mA/2.5 W of current, only 100 mA from non-hub ports. USB 3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8 A/9.0 W (for dedicated battery charging, 1.5 A/7.5 W full bandwidth or 900 mA/4.5 W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60 watts of power, although 10 to 20 watts is more typical.

These and other differences reflect the differing design goals of the two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum signaling rate, FireWire 400 is faster than USB 2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire 800 standard is twice as fast as FireWire 400 and faster than USB 2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire&#x27;s speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.

The chipset and drivers used to implement USB and FireWire have a crucial impact on how much of the bandwidth prescribed by the specification is achieved in the real world, along with compatibility with peripherals.

=== Ethernet ===
The &quot;IEEE 802.3af&quot;, &quot;802.3at&quot;, and &quot;802.3bt&quot; Power over Ethernet (PoE) standards specify more elaborate power negotiation schemes than powered USB. They operate at 48 V DC and can supply more power (up to 12.95 W for &quot;802.3af&quot;, 25.5 W for &quot;802.3at&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;PoE+&quot;, 71 W for &quot;802.3bt&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;4PPoE&quot;) over a cable up to 100 meters compared to USB 2.0, which provides 2.5 W with a maximum cable length of 5 meters. This has made PoE popular for Voice over IP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.

Ethernet standards require electrical isolation between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) and the network cable up to 1500 V AC or 2250 V DC for 60 seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.

=== MIDI ===
The &quot;USB Device Class Definition for MIDI Devices&quot; transmits Music Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) music data over USB. The MIDI capability is extended to allow up to sixteen simultaneous &quot;virtual MIDI cables&quot;, each of which can carry the usual MIDI sixteen channels and clocks.

USB is competitive for low-cost and physically adjacent devices. However, Power over Ethernet and the MIDI plug standard have an advantage in high-end devices that may have long cables. USB can cause ground loop problems between equipment, because it connects ground references on both transceivers. By contrast, the MIDI plug standard and Ethernet have built-in isolation to or more.

=== eSATA/eSATAp ===
The eSATA connector is a more robust SATA connector, intended for connection to external hard drives and SSDs. eSATA&#x27;s transfer rate (up to 6 Gbit/s) is similar to that of USB 3.0 (up to 5 Gbit/s) and USB 3.1 (up to 10 Gbit/s). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.

eSATA does not supply power to external devices. This is an increasing disadvantage compared to USB. Even though USB 3.0&#x27;s 4.5 W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives, technology is advancing, and external drives gradually need less power, diminishing the eSATA advantage. eSATAp (power over eSATA, a.k.a. ESATA/USB) is a connector introduced in 2009 that supplies power to attached devices using a new, backward compatible, connector. On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only 5 V to power a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD; on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply 12 V to power larger devices including 3.5-inch HDD/SSD and 5.25-inch optical drives.

eSATAp support can be added to a desktop machine in the form of a bracket connecting the motherboard SATA, power, and USB resources.

eSATA, like USB, supports hot plugging, although this might be limited by OS drivers and device firmware.

=== Thunderbolt ===

Thunderbolt combines PCI Express and DisplayPort into a new serial data interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10 Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20 Gbit/s.

Thunderbolt 2 uses link aggregation to combine the two 10 Gbit/s channels into one bidirectional 20 Gbit/s channel.

Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 use USB-C. Thunderbolt 3 has two physical 20 Gbit/s bi-directional channels, aggregated to appear as a single logical 40 Gbit/s bi-directional channel. Thunderbolt 3 controllers can incorporate a USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller to provide compatibility with USB devices. They are also capable of providing DisplayPort Alternate Mode as well as DisplayPort over USB4 Fabric, making the function of a Thunderbolt 3 port a superset of that of a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port.

DisplayPort Alternate Mode 2.0: USB4 (requiring USB-C) requires that hubs support DisplayPort 2.0 over a USB-C Alternate Mode. DisplayPort 2.0 can support 8K resolution at 60 Hz with HDR10 color. DisplayPort 2.0 can use up to 80 Gbit/s, which is double the amount available to USB data, because it sends all the data in one direction (to the monitor) and can thus use all eight data wires at once.

After the specification was made royalty-free and custodianship of the Thunderbolt protocol was transferred from Intel to the USB Implementers Forum, Thunderbolt 3 has been effectively implemented in the USB4 specification – with compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 optional but encouraged for USB4 products.

== Interoperability ==

Various protocol converters are available that convert USB data signals to and from other communications standards.

== Security threats ==
Due to the prevalency of the USB standard, there are many exploits using the USB standard. One of the biggest instances of this today is known as the USB killer, a device that damages USB devices by sending high voltage pulses across the data lines.

In versions of Microsoft Windows before Windows XP, Windows would automatically run a script (if present) on certain devices via AutoRun, one of which are USB mass storage devices, which may contain malicious software.

<text>Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 5, 1996. Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton and his running mate, incumbent Democratic Vice President Al Gore were re-elected to a second and final term, defeating the Republican ticket of former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp and the Reform ticket of businessman Ross Perot and economist Pat Choate. 

Clinton and Vice President Gore were re-nominated without incident by the Democratic Party. Numerous candidates entered the 1996 Republican primaries, with Dole considered the early frontrunner. Dole clinched the nomination after defeating challenges by publisher Steve Forbes and paleoconservative leader Pat Buchanan. Dole&#x27;s running mate was Jack Kemp, a former congressman and football player who had served as the housing secretary under President George H. W. Bush. Ross Perot, who had won 18.9% of the popular vote as an independent candidate in 1992, ran as the candidate of the Reform Party. Perot received less media attention in 1996 and was excluded from the presidential debates.

Clinton&#x27;s chances of winning were initially considered slim in the middle of his term, as his party had lost both the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1994 for the first time in decades. He was able to regain ground as the economy began to recover from the early 1990s recession with a relatively stable world stage. Clinton tied Dole to Newt Gingrich, the unpopular Republican speaker of the House, and warned that Republicans would increase the deficit and slash spending on popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. Dole promised an across-the-board 15% reduction in federal income taxes and labeled Clinton as a member of the &quot;spoiled&quot; Baby Boomer generation. Dole&#x27;s age was a persistent issue in the election, and gaffes by Dole exacerbated the issue for his campaign.

On election day, Clinton defeated Dole by a wide margin, winning 379 electors to Dole&#x27;s 159 and taking 49.2% of the national popular vote to Dole&#x27;s 40.7%. As in 1992, Perot&#x27;s strong candidacy held both major party candidates below 50% nationwide. This is the most recent election in which a candidate got 70% or more of the electoral vote. Notably, Clinton&#x27;s strength with many southern and rural whites makes him the last Democrat to carry the states of Kentucky, Louisiana, West Virginia, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee in a presidential election. He was also the last Democrat to win Arizona until 2020.

==Background==
In 1995, the Republican Party was riding high on the significant gains made in the 1994 midterm elections. In those races, the Republicans, led by whip Newt Gingrich, captured the majority of seats in the House for the first time in forty years and the majority of seats in the Senate for the first time in eight years. Gingrich became speaker of the House, while Bob Dole was elevated to Senate Majority leader.

The Republicans of the 104th Congress pursued an ambitious agenda, highlighted by their Contract with America, but were often forced to compromise with Clinton, who wielded veto power. A budget impasse between Congress and the Clinton administration eventually resulted in a government shutdown. Clinton, meanwhile, was praised for signing the GOP&#x27;s welfare reform, and other notable bills, but was forced to abandon his own health care plan.

===Candidates gallery===
With the advantage of incumbency, Bill Clinton&#x27;s path to renomination by the Democratic Party was uneventful. At the 1996 Democratic National Convention, Clinton and incumbent Vice President Al Gore were renominated with token opposition. Formerly incarcerated fringe candidate Lyndon LaRouche won a few Arkansas delegates who were barred from the convention. Jimmy Griffin, former Mayor of Buffalo, New York, mounted a brief campaign but withdrew after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. Former Pennsylvania governor Bob Casey contemplated a challenge to Clinton, but health problems forced Casey to abandon a bid.

Clinton easily won primaries nationwide, with margins consistently higher than 80%.

Popular primaries vote:
* Bill Clinton (inc.) – 9,730,184 (88.5%)
* Lyndon LaRouche – 597,081 (5.4%)
* Unpledged – 423,265 (3.8%)

===Candidates gallery===
A number of Republican candidates entered the field to challenge the incumbent Democratic president, Bill Clinton.

The fragmented field of candidates debated issues such as a flat tax and other tax cut proposals, and a return to supply-side economic policies popularized by Ronald Reagan. More attention was drawn to the race by the budget stalemate in 1995 between Congress and the president, which caused temporary shutdowns and slowdowns in many areas of federal government service.

Former Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin of Illinois, who served in the United States House of Representatives from Illinois&#x27;s 16th District and was the 1990 Republican U.S. Senate nominee losing to incumbent Paul Simon conducted a bid for most of 1995, but withdrew before the Iowa caucuses as polls showed her languishing far behind. She participated in a number of primary presidential debates before withdrawing. Martin&#x27;s predecessor in Congress, John Anderson had made first a Republican then independent presidential bid in 1980. Also, Simon who defeated Martin for the U.S. Senate had run for president as a Democrat in 1988.

Former U.S. Army General Colin Powell was widely courted as a potential Republican nominee. However, on November 8, 1995, Powell announced that he would not seek the nomination. Former Secretary of Defense and future Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney was touted by many as a possible candidate for the presidency, but he declared his intentions not to run in early 1995. Former and future Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld formed a presidential campaign exploratory committee, but declined to formally enter the race. Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Secretary of Education William Bennett both flirted with bids, both even set up exploratory committees, for a number of months but both finally declared within days of each other they would not run either.

===Primaries and convention===

Ahead of the 1996 primary contest, Republican Leader of the United States Senate and former vice-presidential candidate Bob Dole was seen as the most likely winner. However, Steve Forbes finished first in Delaware and Arizona while paleoconservative firebrand Pat Buchanan managed early victories in Alaska and Louisiana, in addition to a strong second place in the Iowa caucuses and a surprising victory in the small but key New Hampshire primary. Buchanan&#x27;s New Hampshire win alarmed the Republican &quot;establishment&quot; sufficiently as to provoke prominent Republicans to quickly coalesce around Dole, and Dole won every primary starting with North and South Dakota. Dole resigned his Senate seat on June 11 and the Republican National Convention formally nominated Dole on August 15, 1996, for president.

Popular primaries vote:
* Bob Dole – 8,427,601 (59.2%)
* Pat Buchanan – 3,021,935 (21.2%)

Former Representative and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp was nominated by acclamation for vice president, the following day. This was the only Republican ticket between 1980 and 2004 that did not include a member of the Bush family.

==Reform Party nomination==


===Candidates gallery===
The United States Reform Party had great difficulty in finding a candidate willing to run in the general election. Lowell Weicker, Tim Penny, David Boren and Richard Lamm were among those who toyed with the notion of seeking its presidential nomination, though all but Lamm decided against it; Lamm had himself come close to withdrawing his name from consideration. Lamm designated Ed Zschau as his vice presidential candidate.

Ultimately, the Reform Party nominated its founder Ross Perot from Texas in its first election as an official political party. Although Perot easily won the nomination, his victory at the party&#x27;s national convention led to a schism as supporters of Lamm accused him of rigging the vote to prevent them from casting their ballots. This faction walked out of the national convention and eventually formed their own group, the American Reform Party, and attempted to convince Lamm to run as an Independent in the general election; Lamm declined, pointing out a promise he made before running that he would respect the Party&#x27;s final decision.

Economist Pat Choate was nominated for Vice President.

== Minor parties and independents ==

Parties in this section obtained ballot access in enough states to theoretically obtain the minimum number of electoral votes needed to win the election. Individuals included in this section completed one or more of the following actions: received, or formally announced their candidacy for, the presidential nomination of a third party; formally announced intention to run as an independent candidate and obtained enough ballot access to win the election; filed as a third party or non-affiliated candidate with the FEC (for other than exploratory purposes). Within each party, candidates are listed alphabetically by surname.

===Libertarian Party nomination===
Libertarian candidates
* Harry Browne – writer and investment analyst from Tennessee
* Rick Tompkins – former candidate for Senator from Arizona
* Irwin Schiff – writer and prominent figure in the tax protester movement from Nevada
* Douglas J. Ohmen – political activist from California
* Jeffrey Diket – political activist from Louisiana

The Libertarian Party nominated free-market writer and investment analyst, Harry Browne from Tennessee, and selected Jo Jorgensen from South Carolina as his running-mate. Browne and Jorgensen drew 485,798 votes (0.5% of the popular vote).

===Green Party nomination===
The Green Party of the United States drafted Ralph Nader of Connecticut as a candidate for President of the United States on the Green Party ticket. He was not formally nominated by the Green Party USA, which was, at the time, the largest national Green group; instead, he was nominated independently by various state Green parties (in some areas, he appeared on the ballot as an independent). Nader vowed to spend only $5,000 in his election campaign (to avoid having to file a financial statement with the FEC). Winona LaDuke, a Native American activist and economist from Wisconsin, was named as his running-mate. In Iowa and Vermont, Anne Goeke was listed as Nader&#x27;s running mate; in New Jersey it was Madelyn Hoffman and in New York it was Muriel Tillinghast.

Nader and his running mates drew 685,128 votes (0.71% of the popular vote).

===Natural Law Party nomination===

The Natural Law Party for a second time nominated scientist and researcher John Hagelin for president and Mike Tompkins for vice president. The party platform included preventive health care, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies. During his campaigns, Hagelin favored abortion rights without public financing, campaign finance law reform, improved gun control, a flat tax, the eradication of PACs, a ban on soft money contributions, and school vouchers, and was a believer in &quot;yogic flying.&quot;

Hagelin and Tompkins drew 113,671 votes (0.1% of the popular vote).

===U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party nomination===

The U.S. Taxpayers Party had run its first presidential ticket in 1992, headed by Howard Phillips, who had failed to find any prominent conservative willing to take the mantle. In 1996 the situation ultimately proved the same, though Pat Buchanan for a time was widely speculated to be planning on bolting to the Taxpayers&#x27; Party should the expected Republican nominee, Senator Bob Dole, name a pro-choice running-mate. When Jack Kemp, who opposed abortion, was tapped for the position Buchanan agreed to endorse the Republican ticket. Phillips again led the Taxpayers ticket, with Herbert Titus nominated for the vice presidency.

Phillips and Titus drew 182,820 votes (0.2% of the popular vote).

==General election==

===Campaign===
Without meaningful primary opposition, Clinton was able to focus on the general election early, while Dole was forced to move to the right and spend his campaign reserves fighting off challengers. Political adviser Dick Morris urged Clinton to raise huge sums of campaign funds via soft money for an unprecedented early TV blitz of swing states promoting Clinton&#x27;s agenda and record. As a result, Clinton could run a campaign through the summer defining his opponent as an aged conservative far from the mainstream before Dole was in a position to respond. Compared to the 50-year-old Clinton, then 73-year-old Dole appeared especially old and frail, as illustrated by an embarrassing fall off a stage during a campaign event in Chico, California. Dole further enhanced this contrast on September 18 when he made a reference to a no-hitter thrown the day before by Hideo Nomo of the &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers&quot;, a team that had left Brooklyn for Los Angeles 38 years earlier. A few days later Dole would make a joke about the remark by saying, &quot;And I&#x27;d like to congratulate the St. Louis Cardinals on winning the N.L. Central. Notice I said the St. Louis Cardinals, not the St. Louis Browns.&quot; (The Browns had left St. Louis after the 1954 season to become the Baltimore Orioles.)

Dole chose to focus on Clinton as being &quot;part of the spoiled baby boomer generation&quot; and said, &quot;My generation won [World War II], and we may need to be called to service one last time.&quot; Although his message won appeal with older voters, surveys found that his age was widely held as a liability and his frequent allusions to WWII and the Great Depression in speeches and campaign ads &quot;unappealing&quot; to younger voters. To prove that he was still healthy and active, Dole released all of his medical records to the public and published photographs of himself running on a treadmill. After the falling incident in California, he joked that he &quot;was trying to do that new Democratic dance, the macarena.&quot;

The Clinton campaign avoided mentioning Dole&#x27;s age directly, choosing to confront it in more subtle ways such as the slogan &quot;Building Bridges to the Future&quot; in contrast to the Republican candidate&#x27;s frequent remarks that he was a &quot;bridge to the past&quot;, before the social upheavals of the 1960s. Clinton, without actually calling Dole old, questioned the age of his ideas.

With respect to the issues, Dole promised a 15% across-the-board reduction in income tax rates and made former congressman and supply side advocate Jack Kemp his running mate. Bill Clinton framed the narrative against Dole early, painting him as a mere clone of House speaker Newt Gingrich, warning America that Bob Dole would work in concert with the Republican Congress to slash popular social programs, like Medicare and Social Security, dubbed by Clinton as &quot;Dole-Gingrich&quot;. Bob Dole&#x27;s tax-cut plan found itself under attack from the White House, who said it would &quot;blow a hole in the deficit,&quot; which had been cut nearly in half during his opponent&#x27;s term.

The televised debates featured only Dole and Clinton, locking out Perot and the other minor candidates from the discussion. Perot, who had been allowed to participate in the 1992 debates, would eventually take his case to court, seeking damages from not being in the debate, as well as citing unfair coverage from the major media outlets.

In a first for either major party in a presidential election, both the Clinton and Dole campaigns had official websites. Dole invited viewers to visit his &quot;homepage&quot; at the end of the first debate.

Throughout the campaign, Clinton maintained leads in the polls over Dole and Perot, generally by large margins. In October, Republican National Committee &quot;operatives urg[ed] their party&#x27;s Congressional candidates to cut loose from Bob Dole and press voters to maintain a Republican majority&quot; and spent $4 million on advertising in targeted districts.

=== Presidential debates ===

Three debates, organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, took place—two between the presidential candidates and one between the vice presidential candidates:
=== Campaign donations controversy ===

In late September 1995, questions arose regarding the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s fund-raising practices. In February the following year, China&#x27;s alleged role in the campaign finance controversy first gained public attention after &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a story stating that a U.S. Department of Justice investigation had discovered evidence that agents of China sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the DNC before the 1996 presidential campaign. The paper wrote that intelligence information had showed the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC in violation of U.S. law forbidding non-American citizens from giving monetary donations to U.S. politicians and political parties. Seventeen people were eventually convicted for fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the U.S. elections.

One of the more notable events learned involved Vice President Al Gore and a fund-raising event held at Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. The Temple event was organized by DNC fund-raisers John Huang and Maria Hsia. It is illegal under U.S. law for religious organizations to donate money to politicians or political groups due to their tax-exempt status. The U.S. Justice Department alleged Hsia facilitated $100,000 (~$ in ) in illegal contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign through her efforts at the Temple. Hsia was eventually convicted by a jury in March 2000. The DNC eventually returned the money donated by the Temple&#x27;s monks and nuns. Twelve nuns and employees of the Temple refused to answer questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment when they were subpoenaed to testify before Congress in 1997.

===Results===
On election day, President Clinton won a decisive victory over Dole, becoming the first Democrat to win two consecutive presidential elections since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944. In the popular vote, he out-polled Dole by over 8.2 million votes. The Electoral College map did not change much from the previous election, with the Democratic incumbent winning 379 votes to the Republican ticket&#x27;s 159.

Since Dole was the vice presidential nominee in the 1976 election, Dole&#x27;s 1996 loss made him the only unsuccessful major party nominee for both president and vice president in the history of the United States. Although Clinton&#x27;s margin of victory in the popular vote was slightly greater than that of George H.W. Bush eight years prior, Dole won more states than Bush in part due to Clinton&#x27;s relatively poor performance in areas of low population density, a precursor of the trend where future Democratic contenders for the presidency perform very well in populous metropolitan areas but vastly under-perform in rural counties. In the West, Dole managed to narrowly win Colorado and Montana (both had voted for Clinton four years earlier), while Clinton became the first Democrat to win Arizona since Harry Truman in 1948. In the South, Clinton won Florida, a state he had failed to win in 1992, but lost Georgia, a state that he had carried. The election helped to cement Democratic presidential control in California, Vermont, Maine, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut; all went on to vote Democratic in every subsequent presidential election after having voted Republican in the five prior to 1992. 1996 marked the first time that Vermont voted for a Democrat in two successive elections. Pennsylvania and Michigan both voted Democratic, and would remain in the Democratic presidential fold until 2016.

Reform Party nominee Ross Perot won approximately 8% of the popular vote. His vote total was less than half of his performance in 1992. The 1996 national exit poll showed that just as in 1992, Perot drew supporters from Clinton and Dole equally. In polls directed at Perot voters as to who would be a second choice, Clinton consistently held substantial leads. Perot&#x27;s best showing was in states that tended to strongly favor either Clinton (such as Maine) or Dole (particularly Montana, though the margin of victory there was much closer). Perot once again received his lowest amount of support in the South.

Although Clinton is a native of Arkansas and his running mate hailed from Tennessee, the Democratic ticket carried just four of the eleven states of the former Confederacy (and of those four only Florida and Georgia have voted Democratic in any election since). As such, Clinton&#x27;s 1992 run was tied for the weakest performance in the region by a nationally successful Democratic presidential candidate up until that point. Clinton&#x27;s performance both followed and preceded a substantial decline in support for the Democratic Party in the South; in the 2000 and 2004 elections, the Democrats would fail to carry even one of the former Confederate states, contributing to their defeat both times. This completed the Republican takeover of the American South, a region in which Democrats had held a near monopoly from 1880 to 1948. In 2008, the Democrats were able to win three former Confederate states (Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida), however this was still a worse performance than either of Clinton&#x27;s. Since 1984, no winning presidential candidate has surpassed Bill Clinton&#x27;s 8.5 percent popular vote margin, or his 220 electoral vote margin since 1988. Additionally, since 1964, no other Democratic presidential candidate has surpassed Clinton&#x27;s electoral vote margin and, except Lyndon B. Johnson in that election, no Democratic presidential candidate has surpassed Clinton&#x27;s 8.5 percentage popular vote margin since 1940.

The election also marked the first time in U.S. history that the winner was elected without winning the male vote, the third time in U.S. history that a candidate won two terms as president without winning a majority either time (after Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson, both Democrats). Clinton also remains the last presidential candidate of either party to win at least one county in every state. Clinton maintained a consistent polling edge over Dole, and he won re-election with a substantial margin in the popular vote and the Electoral College. Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win two consecutive presidential elections. Dole won 40.7% of the popular vote and 159 electoral votes, while Perot won 8.4% of the popular vote. Despite Dole&#x27;s defeat, the Republican Party was able to maintain majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Voter turnout was registered at 48.99%, the lowest for a presidential election since 1924.

As of 2024, this remains the last time that the states of Kentucky, Louisiana, West Virginia, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee were carried by a Democratic presidential nominee. It was also the first time most Arizona voters chose a Democratic candidate since 1948, which they would not do again until 2020. Five states switched party predominance in 1996 with their presidential voting: Montana, Colorado, and Georgia were flipped by Senator Dole, while Florida and Arizona were flipped by President Clinton. This is also the most recent time a third-party candidate finished with over 5% of the vote nationwide. This is the last time a Democratic president was re-elected with a higher share of the electoral or popular vote, while also being the last time when an incumbent Democratic candidate would flip any states (Arizona, and Florida in this instance) which they failed to win in their previous election bid. Since Dole was the losing vice presidential candidate in 1976, Dole&#x27;s loss makes him the only person in U.S. history to lose elections for both the vice presidency and the presidency while serving in neither office. This was the first presidential election since 1944 in which an incumbent Democratic president won a second full term in office. It is the most recent election in which the Democratic presidential nominee never served as a senator. This is also the only presidential election between 1980 and 2004 in which a Bush did not appear on the Republican ticket, the last winning Democratic ticket that did not have Joe Biden on it, and the most recent election when the Republican candidate would win fewer than 20 states. It also has the lowest voter turnout since 1980, when the statistic began being measured across the voting-eligible population rather than the voting-age population.

Source: Voter News Service exit poll, reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, November 10, 1996, 28.

==Polling controversy==
The polling in the election was criticized by Everett Carll Ladd, who argued that &quot;polls had overestimated Clinton&#x27;s lead during the campaign and had thereby dampened interest in the election.&quot; Others such as Warren J. Mitofsky rebutted Ladd&#x27;s view; in an analysis in &quot;Public Opinion Quarterly&quot;, Mitofsky wrote that &quot;1996 was not the best but was far from the worst year for the polls&quot;, with accuracy surpassing the polling in 1948 and in 1980. Because Clinton won the election by a comfortable margin, there was no major reaction towards the impreciseness of the polls.

<doc id="32078" wikidata="Q42183" url="?curid=32078" title="Whig Party (United States)">
<text>The Whig Party was a mid-19th century political party in the United States. Alongside the Democratic Party, it was one of two major parties from the late 1830s until the early 1850s and part of the Second Party System. As well as four Whig presidents (William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Millard Fillmore), other prominent members included Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Rufus Choate, William Seward, John J. Crittenden, and John Quincy Adams (whose presidency ended prior to the formation of the Whig Party). The Whig base of support was amongst entrepreneurs, professionals, Protestant Christians (particularly Evangelicals), the urban middle class, and nativists. It had much less backing from poor farmers and unskilled workers.

The party was hostile towards the myth of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;, territorial expansion into Texas and the Southwest, and the Mexican–American War. It disliked presidential power, as exhibited by Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, and preferred congressional dominance in lawmaking. Members advocated modernization, meritocracy, the rule of law, protections against majority rule, and vigilance against executive tyranny. They favored an economic program known as the American System, which called for a protective tariff, federal subsidies for the construction of infrastructure, and support for a national bank. The party was active in both the Northern and Southern United States and did not take a firm stance on slavery, but Northern Whigs tended to be less supportive than their Democratic counterparts.

The Whigs emerged in the 1830s in opposition to U.S. president Andrew Jackson, pulling together former members of the National Republican Party, the Anti-Masonic Party, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs had some weak links to the defunct Federalist Party, but the Whig Party was not a direct successor to that party, and many Whig leaders, including Henry Clay, had aligned with the rival Democratic-Republican Party. In the 1836 presidential election, four different Whig candidates received electoral votes, but the party failed to defeat Jackson&#x27;s chosen successor, Martin Van Buren. Whig nominee William Henry Harrison unseated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election but died one month into his term. Harrison&#x27;s successor, John Tyler, a former Democrat, broke with the Whigs in 1841 after clashing with Clay and other party leaders over economic policies such as the re-establishment of a national bank.

Clay clinched his party&#x27;s nomination in the 1844 presidential election but was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk, who subsequently presided over the Mexican–American War. Whig nominee Zachary Taylor won the 1848 presidential election, but Taylor died in 1850 and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore. Fillmore, Clay, Daniel Webster, and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850, which helped to defuse sectional tensions in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War for a time. Nonetheless, the Whigs suffered a decisive defeat in the 1852 presidential election partly due to sectional divisions within the party. The Whigs collapsed following the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, with most Northern Whigs eventually joining the anti-slavery Republican Party and most Southern Whigs joining the nativist American Party and later the Constitutional Union Party. The last vestiges of the Whig Party faded away after the start of the American Civil War, but Whig ideas remained influential for decades. During the Lincoln Administration, ex-Whigs dominated the Republican Party and enacted much of their American System. Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Rutherford B. Hayes, Chester A. Arthur, and Benjamin Harrison were Whigs before switching to the Republican Party, from which they were elected to office. It is considered the primary predecessor party of the modern-day Republicans.

== Background ==

During the 1790s, the first major U.S. parties arose in the form of the Federalist Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas Jefferson. After 1815, the Democratic-Republicans emerged as the sole major party at the national level but became increasingly polarized. A nationalist wing led by Henry Clay favored policies such as the Second Bank of the United States and the implementation of a protective tariff. A second group, the Old Republicans, opposed these policies, favoring a strict interpretation of the Constitution and a weak federal government.

In the 1824 presidential election, Speaker of the House Henry Clay, Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, and General Andrew Jackson all sought the presidency as members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Crawford favored state sovereignty and a strict constructionist view of the Constitution, while Clay and Adams favored high tariffs and the national bank; regionalism played a central role, with Jackson strongest in the West. Jackson won a plurality of the popular and electoral vote in the 1824 election, but not a majority. The House of Representatives had to decide. Speaker Clay supported Adams, who was elected as president by the House, and Clay was appointed Secretary of State. Jackson called it a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot;.
In the years following the 1824 election, former members of the Democratic-Republican Party split into hostile factions. Supporters of President Adams and Clay joined with many former Federalists such as Daniel Webster to form a group informally known as the &quot;Adams party&quot;. Meanwhile, supporters of Jackson, Crawford, and Vice President John C. Calhoun joined in opposing the Adams administration&#x27;s nationalist agenda, becoming informally known as &quot;Jacksonians&quot;. Due in part to the superior organization (by Martin Van Buren) of the Jacksonians, Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, taking 56 percent of the popular vote. Clay became the leader of the National Republican Party, which opposed President Jackson. By the early 1830s, the Jacksonians organized into the new Democratic Party.

Despite Jackson&#x27;s decisive victory in the 1828 election, National Republicans initially believed that Jackson&#x27;s party would collapse once Jackson took office. Vice President Calhoun split from the administration in 1831. Still, differences over the tariff prevented Calhoun&#x27;s followers from joining the National Republicans. Meanwhile, the Anti-Masonic Party formed following the disappearance and possible murder of William Morgan in 1826. The Anti-Masonic movement, strongest in the Northeast, gave rise to or expanded the use of many innovations which became an accepted practice among other parties, including nominating conventions and party newspapers. Clay rejected overtures from the Anti-Masonic Party, and his attempt to convince Calhoun to serve as his running mate failed, leaving the opposition to Jackson split among different leaders when the National Republicans nominated Clay for president.

Hoping to make the national bank a key issue of the 1832 election, the National Republicans convinced national bank president Nicholas Biddle to request an extension of the national bank&#x27;s charter, but their strategy backfired when Jackson successfully portrayed his veto of the recharter as a victory for the people against an elitist institution. Jackson won another decisive victory in the 1832 presidential election, taking 55 percent of the national popular vote and 88 percent of the popular vote in the slavery states south of Kentucky and Maryland. Clay&#x27;s defeat discredited the National Republican Party, encouraging those opposed to Jackson to seek to create a more effective opposition party. Jackson, by 1832, was determined to destroy the bank (the Second Bank of the United States), which Whigs supported.

== History ==
===Creation, 1833–1836===

Shortly after Jackson&#x27;s re-election, South Carolina passed a measure to &quot;nullify&quot; the Tariff of 1832, beginning the Nullification Crisis. Jackson strongly denied the right of South Carolina to nullify federal law, but the crisis was resolved after Congress passed the Tariff of 1833. The Nullification Crisis briefly scrambled the partisan divisions that had emerged after 1824, as many within the Jacksonian coalition opposed President Jackson&#x27;s threats of force against South Carolina, while some opposition leaders like Daniel Webster supported them. 

The name &quot;Whig&quot; was first suggested for Jackson&#x27;s opponents by James Watson Webb, editor of the &quot;Courier and Enquirer&quot; of New York City. In South Carolina and other states, those opposed to Jackson began to form small &quot;Whig&quot; parties. The Whig label implicitly compared &quot;King Andrew&quot; to King George III, the King of Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution.

Jackson&#x27;s decision to remove government deposits from the national bank ended any possibility of a Webster-Jackson alliance and helped to solidify partisan lines. The removal of the deposits drew opposition from both pro-bank National Republicans and states&#x27; rights Southerners like Willie Person Mangum of North Carolina, the latter of whom accused Jackson of flouting the Constitution. In late 1833, Clay began to hold a series of dinners with opposition leaders to settle on a candidate to oppose Martin Van Buren, the likely Democratic nominee in the 1836 presidential election. While Jackson&#x27;s opponents could not agree on a single presidential candidate, they coordinated in the Senate to oppose Jackson&#x27;s initiatives. Historian Michael Holt writes that the &quot;birth of the Whig Party&quot; can be dated to Clay and his allies taking control of the Senate in December 1833.

The National Republicans, including Clay and Webster, formed the core of the Whig Party, but many Anti-Masons like William H. Seward of New York and Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania also joined. Several prominent Democrats defected to the Whigs, including Mangum, former Attorney General John Berrien, and John Tyler of Virginia. The Whig Party&#x27;s first significant action was to censure Jackson for the removal of the national bank deposits, thereby establishing opposition to Jackson&#x27;s executive power as the organizing principle of the new party.

In doing so, the Whigs were able to shed the elitist image that had persistently hindered the National Republicans. Throughout 1834 and 1835, the Whigs successfully incorporated National Republican and Anti-Masonic state-level organizations and established new state party organizations in Southern states like North Carolina and Georgia. The Anti-Masonic heritage of the Whigs included a distrust of behind-the-scenes political maneuvering by party bosses instead of encouraging direct appeals to the people through gigantic rallies, parades, and rhetorical rabble-rousing.

=== Rise, 1836–1841 ===

Early successes in various states made many Whigs optimistic about victory in 1836, but an improving economy bolstered Van Buren&#x27;s standing ahead of the election. The Whigs also faced the difficulty of uniting former National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and states&#x27; rights Southerners around one candidate, and the party suffered an early blow when Calhoun announced that he would refuse to support any candidate opposed to the doctrine of nullification. Northern Whigs cast aside both Clay and Webster in favor of General William Henry Harrison, a former senator who had led U.S. forces in the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe.

Though he had not previously been affiliated with the National Republicans, Harrison indicated that he shared the party&#x27;s concerns over Jackson&#x27;s executive power and favored federal investments in infrastructure. Southern Whigs coalesced around Senator Hugh Lawson White, a long-time Jackson ally who opposed Van Buren&#x27;s candidacy. Ultimately, Van Buren won a majority of the electoral and popular vote in the 1836 election, though the Whigs improved on Clay&#x27;s 1832 performance in the South and West.

Shortly after Van Buren took office, an economic crisis known as the Panic of 1837 struck the nation. Land prices plummeted, industries laid off employees, and banks failed. According to historian Daniel Walker Howe, the economic crisis of the late 1830s and early 1840s was the most severe recession in U.S. history until the Great Depression. Van Buren&#x27;s economic response centered on establishing the Independent Treasury system, essentially a series of vaults that would hold government deposits. As the debate over the Independent Treasury continued, William Cabell Rives and some other Democrats who favored a more activist government defected to the Whig Party, while Calhoun and his followers joined the Democratic Party. Whig leaders agreed to hold the party&#x27;s first national convention in December 1839 in order to select the Whig presidential nominee.

By early 1838, Clay had emerged as the front-runner due to his southern support and spirited opposition to Van Buren&#x27;s Independent Treasury. A recovering economy convinced other Whigs to support Harrison, who was generally seen as the Whig candidate best able to win over Democrats and new voters. With the crucial support of Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and Thurlow Weed of New York, Harrison won the presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the 1839 Whig National Convention.

For vice president, the Whigs nominated John Tyler, a former states&#x27; rights Democrat selected for the Whig ticket primarily because other Southern supporters of Clay refused to serve as Harrison&#x27;s running mate. Log cabins and hard cider became the dominant symbols of the Whig campaign as the party sought to portray Harrison as a man of the people. The Whigs also assailed Van Buren&#x27;s handling of the economy. They argued that traditional Whig policies, such as the restoration of a national bank and the implementation of protective tariff rates, would help to restore the economy. With the economy still in a downturn, Harrison decisively defeated Van Buren, taking a wide majority of the electoral vote and just under 53 percent of the popular vote.

=== Harrison and Tyler, 1841–1845 ===
With the election of the first Whig presidential administration in the party&#x27;s history, Clay and his allies prepared to pass ambitious domestic policies such as the restoration of the national bank, the distribution of federal land sales revenue to the states, a national bankruptcy law, and increased tariff rates. Harrison died just one month into his term, thereby elevating Vice President Tyler to the presidency. Tyler had never accepted much of the Whig economic program and he soon clashed with Clay and other congressional Whigs. In August 1841, Tyler vetoed Clay&#x27;s national bank bill, holding that the legislation was unconstitutional.

Congress passed a second bill based on an earlier proposal made by Treasury Secretary Ewing that was tailored to address Tyler&#x27;s constitutional concerns, but Tyler vetoed that bill as well. In response, every Cabinet member but Webster resigned, and the Whig congressional caucus expelled Tyler from the party on September 13, 1841. The Whigs later began impeachment proceedings against Tyler, but they ultimately failed to impeach him because they believed his likely acquittal would devastate the party.

Beginning in mid-1842, Tyler increasingly began to court Democrats, appointing them to his Cabinet and other positions. At the same time, many Whig state organizations repudiated the Tyler administration and endorsed Clay as the party&#x27;s candidate in the 1844 presidential election. After Webster resigned from the Cabinet in May 1843 following the conclusion of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, Tyler made the annexation of Texas his key priority. The annexation of Texas was widely viewed as a pro-slavery initiative as it would add another slave state to the union, and most leaders of both parties opposed opening the question of annexation in 1843 due to the fear of stoking the debate over slavery. Tyler was nonetheless determined to pursue annexation because he believed that the British conspired to abolish slavery in Texas and because he saw the issue as a means to reelection, either through the Democratic Party or through a new party. In April 1844, Secretary of State John C. Calhoun reached a treaty with Texas providing for the annexation of that country.

Clay and Van Buren, the two front-runners for major-party presidential nominations in the 1844 election, both announced their opposition to annexation, and the Senate blocked the annexation treaty. To the surprise of Clay and other Whigs, the 1844 Democratic National Convention rejected Van Buren in favor of James K. Polk and established a platform calling for the acquisition of both Texas and Oregon Country. Having won the presidential nomination at the 1844 Whig National Convention unopposed, Clay and other Whigs were initially confident that they would defeat the divided Democrats and their relatively obscure candidate.

However, Southern voters responded to Polk&#x27;s calls for annexation, while in the North, Democrats benefited from the growing animosity towards the Whig Party among Catholic and foreign-born voters. Ultimately, Polk won the election, taking 49.5% of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote; the swing of just over one percent of the vote in New York would have given Clay the victory.

=== Polk and the Mexican–American War, 1845–1849 ===


In the final weeks of Tyler&#x27;s presidency, a small group of Southern Whigs joined with congressional Democrats to pass a joint resolution providing for the annexation of Texas, and Texas subsequently became a state in 1845. Following the annexation of Texas, Polk began preparations for a potential war with Mexico, which still regarded Texas as a part of its republic and contended that Texas&#x27;s true southern border was the Nueces River rather than the Rio Grande. After a skirmish known as the Thornton Affair broke out on the northern side of the Rio Grande, Polk called on Congress to declare war against Mexico, arguing that Mexico had invaded American territory by crossing the Rio Grande.

Many Whigs argued that Polk had provoked war with Mexico by sending a force under General Zachary Taylor to the Rio Grande, but only a minority of Whigs voted against the declaration of war as they feared that opposing the war would be politically unpopular. Polk received the declaration of war against Mexico and also pushed through the restoration of the Independent Treasury System and a bill that reduced tariffs; opposition to the passage of these Democratic policies helped to reunify and reinvigorate the Whigs.

In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million (~$ in ) in hopes of using that money as a down payment for the purchase of California in a treaty with Mexico. Democratic Congressman David Wilmot of Pennsylvania offered an amendment known as the Wilmot Proviso, which would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands. The Wilmot Proviso passed the House with the support of both Northern Whigs and Northern Democrats, breaking the typical pattern of partisan division in congressional votes, but it was defeated in the Senate.

Nonetheless, clear divisions remained between the two parties on territorial acquisitions, as most Democrats joined Polk in seeking to acquire vast tracts of land from Mexico, but most Whigs opposed territorial growth. In February 1848, Mexican and U.S. negotiators reached the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which provided for the cession of Alta California and New Mexico. Despite Whig objections to the acquisition of Mexican territory, the treaty was ratified with the support of a majority of the Democratic and Whig senators; Whigs voted for the treaty largely because ratification brought the war to an immediate end.

During the war, Whig leaders like John J. Crittenden of Kentucky began to look to General Taylor as a presidential candidate, hoping the party could run on Taylor&#x27;s personal popularity rather than economic issues. Taylor&#x27;s candidacy faced significant resistance in the Whig Party due to his lack of public commitment to Whig policies and his association with the Mexican–American War. In late 1847, Clay emerged as Taylor&#x27;s main opponent for the Whig nomination, appealing especially to Northern Whigs with his opposition to the war and the acquisition of new territory.

With strong backing from slavery-state delegates, Taylor won the presidential nomination on the fourth ballot of the 1848 Whig National Convention. The Whigs nominated Millard Fillmore of New York, a pro-Clay Northerner, for vice president. Anti-slavery Northern Whigs disaffected with Taylor joined with Democratic supporters of Martin Van Buren and some members of the Liberty Party to found the new Free Soil Party; the party nominated a ticket of Van Buren and Whig Charles Francis Adams Sr. and campaigned against the spread of slavery into the territories.

The Whig campaign in the North received a boost when Taylor released a public letter in which he stated that he favored Whig principles and would defer to Congress after taking office, thereby reassuring some wavering Whigs. During the campaign, Northern Whig leaders touted traditional Whig policies like support for infrastructure spending and increased tariff rates, but Southern Whigs largely eschewed economic policy, instead emphasizing that Taylor&#x27;s status as an enslaver meant that he could be trusted on the issue of slavery more so than Democratic candidate Lewis Cass of Michigan. Ultimately, Taylor won the election with a majority of the electoral vote and a plurality of the popular vote. Taylor improved on Clay&#x27;s 1844 performance in the South and benefited from the defection of many Democrats to Van Buren in the North.

=== Taylor and Fillmore, 1849–1853 ===

Reflecting the Taylor administration&#x27;s desire to find a middle ground between traditional Whig and Democratic policies, Secretary of the Treasury William M. Meredith issued a report calling for an increase in tariff rates, but not to the levels seen under the Tariff of 1842. Even Meredith&#x27;s moderate policies were not adopted, and, partly due to the strong economic growth of the late 1840s and late 1850s, traditional Whig economic stances would increasingly lose their salience after 1848. When Taylor assumed office, the organization of state and territorial governments and the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained the major issue facing Congress.

To sidestep the issue of the Wilmot Proviso, the Taylor administration proposed that the lands of the Mexican Cession be admitted as states without first organizing territorial governments; thus, slavery in the area would be left to the discretion of state governments rather than the federal government. In January 1850, Senator Clay introduced a separate proposal which included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law.

Taylor died in July 1850 and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore. In contrast to John Tyler, Fillmore&#x27;s legitimacy and authority as president were widely accepted by members of Congress and the public. Fillmore accepted the resignation of Taylor&#x27;s entire Cabinet and appointed Whig leaders like Crittenden, Thomas Corwin of Ohio, and Webster, whose support for the Compromise had outraged his Massachusetts constituents. With the support of Fillmore and an impressive bipartisan and bi-sectional coalition, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas&#x27;s borders won passage shortly after Fillmore took office.

The Senate quickly moved to other significant issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law. Passage of what became known as the Compromise of 1850 soon followed in the House of Representatives. Though the future of slavery in New Mexico, Utah, and other territories remained unclear, Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a &quot;final settlement&quot; of sectional issues.

Following the passage of the Compromise of 1850, Fillmore&#x27;s enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 became the central issue of his administration. The Whig Party became badly split between pro-Compromise Whigs like Fillmore and Webster and anti-Compromise Whigs like William Seward, who demanded the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act.

Though Fillmore&#x27;s enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act made him unpopular among many in the North, he retained considerable support in the South. Meanwhile, Secretary Webster had long coveted the presidency and, though in poor health, planned a final attempt to gain the White House. A third candidate emerged in the form of General Winfield Scott, who won the backing of many Northerners but whose association with Senator William Seward made him unacceptable to Southern Whigs.

On the first presidential ballot of the 1852 Whig National Convention, Fillmore received 133 of the necessary 147 votes, while Scott won 131 and Webster won 29. Fillmore and Webster&#x27;s supporters were unable to broker a deal to unite behind either candidate, and Scott won the nomination on the 53rd ballot. The 1852 Democratic National Convention nominated a dark horse candidate in the form of former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, a Northerner sympathetic to the Southern view on slavery.

As the Whig and Democratic national conventions had approved similar platforms, the 1852 election focused largely on the personalities of Scott and Pierce. The 1852 elections proved to be disastrous for the Whig Party, as Scott was defeated by a wide margin and the Whigs lost several congressional and state elections. Scott amassed more votes than Taylor had in most Northern states, but Democrats benefited from a surge of new voters in the North and the collapse of Whig strength in much of the South.

== Collapse ==

Despite their decisive loss in the 1852 elections, most Whig leaders believed the party could recover during the Pierce presidency in much the same way that it had recovered under President Polk. However, the strong economy still prevented the Whig economic program from regaining salience, and the party failed to develop an effective platform on which to campaign. The debate over the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act, which effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise by allowing slavery in territories north of the 36°30′ parallel, shook up traditional partisan alignments.

Across the Northern states, opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act gave rise to anti-Nebraska coalitions consisting of Democrats focused on this opposition along with Free Soilers and Whigs. In Michigan and Wisconsin, these two coalitions labeled themselves as the Republican Party, but similar groups in other states initially took on different names. Like their Free Soil predecessors, Republican leaders generally did not call for the abolition of slavery but instead sought to prevent the extension of slavery into the territories.

Another political coalition appeared in the form of the nativist and anti-Catholic Know Nothing movement, which eventually organized itself into the American Party. Both the Republican Party and the Know-Nothings portrayed themselves as the natural Whig heirs in the battle against Democratic executive tyranny, but the Republicans focused on the &quot;Slave Power&quot; and the Know-Nothings focused on the supposed danger of mass immigration and a Catholic conspiracy. While the Republican Party almost exclusively appealed to Northerners, the Know-Nothings gathered many adherents in both the North and South; some individuals joined both groups even while they remained part of the Whig Party or the Democratic Party.

Congressional Democrats suffered huge losses in the mid-term elections of 1854, as voters supported a wide array of new parties opposed to the Democratic Party. Though several successful congressional candidates had campaigned only as Whigs, most congressional candidates who were unaffiliated with the Democratic Party had campaigned either independently of the Whig Party or in collusion with another party. As cooperation between Northern and Southern Whigs increasingly appeared impossible, leaders from both sections continued to abandon the party. Though he did not share the nativist views of the Know-Nothings, in 1855, Fillmore became a member of the Know-Nothing movement and encouraged his Whig followers to join as well. In September 1855, Seward led his faction of Whigs into the Republican Party, effectively marking the end of the Whig Party as an independent and significant political force. Thus, the 1856 presidential election became a three-sided contest between Democrats, Know-Nothings, and Republicans.

The Know Nothing National Convention nominated Fillmore for president, but disagreements over the party platform&#x27;s stance on slavery caused many Northern Know-Nothings to abandon the party. Meanwhile, the 1856 Republican National Convention chose John C. Frémont as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. The defection of many Northern Know-Nothings, combined with the caning of Charles Sumner and other events that stoked sectional tensions, bolstered Republicans throughout the North. During his campaign, Fillmore minimized the issue of nativism, instead of attempting to use his campaign as a platform for unionism and a revival of the Whig Party.

Seeking to rally support from Whigs who had yet to join another party, Fillmore and his allies organized the sparsely-attended 1856 Whig National Convention, which nominated Fillmore for president. Ultimately, Democrat James Buchanan won the election with a majority of the electoral vote and 45 percent of the popular vote; Frémont won most of the remaining electoral votes and took 33 percent of the popular vote, while Fillmore won 22 percent of the popular vote and just eight electoral votes. Fillmore largely retained Taylor and Scott voters in the South, but most former Whigs in the North voted for Frémont rather than Fillmore.

Fillmore&#x27;s American Party collapsed after the 1856 election, and many former Whigs who refused to join the Democratic Party or the Republican Party organized themselves into a loose coalition known as the Opposition Party. For the 1860 presidential election, Senator John J. Crittenden and other unionist conservatives formed the Constitutional Union Party. The party nominated a ticket consisting of John Bell, a long-time Whig senator, and Edward Everett, who had succeeded Daniel Webster as Fillmore&#x27;s Secretary of State. With the nomination of two former Whigs, many regarded the Constitutional Union Party as a continuation of the Whig Party; one Southern newspaper called the new party the &quot;ghost of the old Whig Party&quot;.

The party campaigned on preserving the union and took an official non-stance on slavery. The Constitutional Union ticket won a plurality of the vote in three states, but Bell finished in fourth place in the national popular vote behind Republican Abraham Lincoln, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, and pro-Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge. In the North, most former Whigs, including the vast majority of those who had voted for Fillmore in 1856, voted for Lincoln in 1860.

In the secession crisis that followed Lincoln&#x27;s election, Southern Democrats generally led secession efforts, while Southern former Whigs generally opposed immediate secession. During the American Civil War, former Whigs formed the core of a &quot;proto-party&quot; in the Confederacy that was opposed to the Jefferson Davis administration. In the Reconstruction Era, many former Whigs tried to regroup in the South, calling themselves &quot;conservatives&quot; and hoping to reconnect with ex-Whigs in the North. Thus, in Virginia and elsewhere, moderate, nationalist, and economically innovative ex-Whigs used the party name &quot;Conservative&quot; to avoid identifying with the Democratic Party. The Conservative Party ultimately merged into the Democratic Party in the South, but ex-Whigs continued to promote modernization policies such as large-scale railroad construction and the founding of public schools.

The Whig Party vanished after the 1850s, but Whiggism, as a modernizing policy orientation, persisted for decades. It played a major role in shaping the modernizing policies of the state governments during Reconstruction. During the Lincoln Administration, ex-Whigs dominated the Republican Party and enacted much of their American System. Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Rutherford B. Hayes, Chester A. Arthur, and Benjamin Harrison were Whigs before switching to the Republican Party, from which they were elected to office. In the long run, the United States adopted Whiggish economic policies coupled with a Democratic strong presidency.

==Ideology and policies==
===Whig thought===

Historian Frank Towers writes that &quot;Democrats stood for the &#x27;sovereignty of the people&#x27; as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.&quot; Historian Daniel Walker Howe argues the Whigs were modernizers, &quot;who attached a great deal of importance to protecting property, maintaining social order, and preserving a distinct cultural heritage, three characteristic conservative concerns&quot;. The Whigs themselves adopted the word &quot;conservative&quot;, which they associated with &quot;&#x27;law and order&#x27;, social caution, and moral restraint&quot;. Political scientists John H. Aldrich and John D. Griffin note that the labeling of Whig ideology as conservative is &quot;somewhat [counterintuitive] for those who associate a small role for government rather than a pro-business orientation with conservatism&quot;. Others, like historian Joseph W. Pearson, note that the Whigs were &quot;essentially middle class.&quot;

Historian John Ashworth writes that the two parties were polarized on essential questions of economic development, describing their competition as a &quot;clash of democracy with capitalism&quot;. Whigs held that the government had a duty to promote economic prosperity for the people, especially during economic downturns. The Whigs further believed that individual regions of the country lacked the capital necessary for economic growth; thus, the federal government should subsidize large infrastructure projects and promote policies to facilitate the operations of banks and corporations.

Democrats, by contrast, argued that government action would inevitably favor the privileged few; thus, Democrats held that government should intervene in the economy as little as possible, especially at the federal level. Gregory Bowen notes that the two parties were polar opposite and highly ideological: &quot;At the heart of Democratic ideology was a militant egalitarianism [for white men], which contrasted sharply with the Whigs&#x27; support for equality of opportunity to produce a meritocratic society.&quot; Democrats glorified individualism while Whigs said it was a dangerous impulse that must be subordinated to the greater good of an organic society; they called for individuals to restrain themselves and focus on doing their duty.

Howe characterizes the Whigs&#x27; anti-individualism as an &quot;Aristotlean&quot; desire to perfect human nature by subordinating animal impulses to reason and self-control. Historian John Burt expands on Howe&#x27;s argument, noting that Whigs &quot;saw unmediated expressions of popular will in roughly the same way as they saw unmediated compulsions of appetite...[a]s a person driven by appetites is not free but the slave of the body, so a polity driven by popular will is not free but the slave of whatever urgencies drive King Numbers&quot;. The Whigs opposed President Jackson because they saw him as a demagogue recklessly exploiting the will of the majority, and they supported a strong Congress as a means of restraining that will within the bounds of a stable, constitutional framework.

Despite their differences, both parties sought to portray themselves as the true protectors of an American political tradition of equality and self-government. Though their Democratic rivals cast them as a continuation of the Federalists, the Whig Party&#x27;s ideology was rooted in the agenda proposed by Clay and other nationalist Democratic-Republican Party leaders in the aftermath of the War of 1812. Many of these nationalist ideas were influenced by the economic program of Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton, but after the War of 1812, they were also supported by President James Madison, one of the founders of the Democratic-Republican Party.

Unlike their Democratic rivals, many Whigs held an aversion to party organizations that were rooted in the traditional American wariness of political parties. Whig opposition to parties waned after the 1830s, but many leading Whigs, including Webster and John Quincy Adams, never fully gave up their independence in favor of a party label. The Whigs were also deeply committed to preventing executive tyranny, which they saw as an existential threat to republican self-government.

Whig thought was typically rooted in evangelical Christianity, as expressed in the Second Great Awakening. Many Whigs would argue that the Bible was the best of Western civilization. Whigs linked moral progress and material progress—each needed the other. They supported Protestant religiosity and missions while being fearful of Catholics. Whigs believed that a higher stage of morality would be achieved when America brought wealth and opportunity to everyone. Whigs would then promote voluntary associations like churches, temperance societies, and schools. Participating in these kinds of societies made the Whigs think that people would become more virtuous. The Whigs believed the rapid business expansion was good with a focus on voluntary associations, not the moral danger Democrats warned about. This optimism for the future (when compared with the Democrat&#x27;s pessimism, seeing the rising middle class as an affront to the traditional working-class man) is what the historian Joseph W. Pearson notes as the starting difference between both the Whigs and the Democrat&#x27;s economic views.

With this high degree of focus on voluntary associations, the Whigs would place a high degree of emphasis on public schooling. These public schools and Colleges would promote upward social mobility, discouraging immorality and dissipation. One Whig, Horace Mann, played a pivotal role in establishing a public school system in Massachusetts, and most states would emulate that.

===Whig policies===

The Whigs celebrated Clay&#x27;s vision of the American System, which promoted rapid economic and industrial growth in the United States through support for a national bank, high tariffs, a distribution policy, and federal funding for infrastructure projects. After the Second Bank of the United States lost its federal charter in 1836, the Whigs favored the restoration of a national bank that could provide a uniform currency, ensure a consistent supply of credit, and attract private investors. Through high tariffs, Clay and other Whigs hoped to generate revenue and encourage the establishment of domestic manufacturing, thereby freeing the United States from dependence on foreign imports.

High tariffs were also designed to prevent a negative balance of trade and stop the flow of currency and credit from the country. Whigs generally opposed Democratic efforts to reduce federal land prices, implement a &quot;preemption&quot; policy that would allow squatters the right to purchase land before it came to auction, and transfer ownership of western lands to the states. Instead, Whigs favored a &quot;distribution&quot; policy that would distribute revenues from federal land sales to the states; states could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities. The Whigs supported federally-financed internal improvements on the belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.

Aside from the Whig economic program, various other issues confronted the Whig Party. Temperance never became a purely partisan issue between Whigs and Democrats, but Whigs tended to be more favorable to state prohibition laws than were Democrats. Similarly, opinions on immigration did not break down strictly on party lines, but Whigs tended to have less favorable views towards immigration, partly because most recent immigrants aligned with the Democratic Party.

In the mid-1840s, a group of Whigs unsuccessfully pushed a bill that would have implemented new paperwork requirements for naturalization and monitored the movements of immigrants in the United States more closely. The unwillingness of Whig leaders to push for more far-reaching changes, such as an extension of the five-year naturalization period, encouraged some Whigs to join nativist third parties.

Whigs were less in favor of expansionism than their Democratic counterparts, and Whigs tended to oppose the Mexican–American War and the acquisition of new territories like Cuba. John Mack Faragher writes that Democrats sought to balance the rising power of industrialization in the United States by following &quot;Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories&quot;, while Whigs were content to develop the country within its present borders and feared that expansion would cause a divisive debate over slavery in the territories.

== Base of support ==
Political scientist A. James Reichley writes that the Democrats and Whigs were &quot;political institutions of a kind that had never existed before in history&quot; because they commanded mass membership among voters and continued to function between elections. Both parties drew support from voters of various classes, occupations, religions, and ethnicities. Nonetheless, the Whig Party was based among middle-class conservatives. The central fault line between the parties concerned the emerging market economy, as Whigs embraced the economic and social changes caused by the market economy and Democrats rejected them.

Whigs drew strength from the economic elites in both Northern cities and Southern plantation regions, but they also attracted support from other classes in most cities. In many states, local rivalries pushed groups into one party or the other, though areas that favored internal improvements tended to favor Whigs. Catholics overwhelmingly voted Democrat, while Protestants were split between the two parties. Recent Irish and German immigrants generally supported the Democrats, but recent immigrants from England, Scotland, and Wales tended to support the Whigs.

Although the Whigs and the rival Democratic Party established party structures that were unprecedented in terms of mass membership and continued functionality, both parties were still essentially coalitions of state party organizations and lacked strong cohesion at the national level. The Whigs built on the strength of National Republicans and the Anti-Masonic Party to build up party organizations in Delaware, Maryland, and much of New England.

Appealing to voters with a mix of economic and social policies, the Whigs established capable party organizations in Northeastern states like New York and Pennsylvania. Unlike the Federalists and the National Republicans, the Whigs were competitive in the South, building strong state parties in Tennessee and Kentucky, and competitive parties in Louisiana, Georgia, and Virginia. By emphasizing their moral conservatism, the Whigs were also able to expand into the Northwest and win elections in a state like Ohio and Indiana. The Whigs were generally not as competitive in Democratic strongholds like New Hampshire, Maine, Illinois, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, and Texas.

=== Party leaders ===

Henry Clay of Kentucky was the party&#x27;s congressional leader from the time of its formation in 1833 until his resignation from the Senate in 1842, and he remained an important Whig leader until his death in 1852. His frequent rival for leadership of the party was Daniel Webster, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate and served as Secretary of State under three Whig presidents. Clay and Webster each repeatedly sought the Whig presidential nomination, but, excepting Clay&#x27;s nomination in 1844, the Whigs consistently nominated individuals who had served as generals, specifically William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, and Winfield Scott. Harrison, Taylor, John Tyler, and Millard Fillmore all served as president, though Tyler was expelled from the Whig Party shortly after taking office in 1841. Benjamin Robbins Curtis was the lone Whig to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States, though later Supreme Court justices like John Marshall Harlan affiliated with the Whig Party early in their career before joining the Court as members of another party.

During the time of the party&#x27;s existence, numerous other Whig leaders emerged, including Truman Smith of Connecticut, who Holt describes as &quot;the Whigs&#x27; closest equivalent to a modern national party chairman&quot; for his efforts to raise money, deliver the Whig message, and build up the party nationwide. In New York, William Seward and Thurlow Weed established an influential organization and competed with Millard Fillmore&#x27;s faction of the party. John M. Clayton of Delaware and John C. Crittenden of Kentucky were important border state Whigs who were influential in the Taylor administration.

Supreme Court Justice John McLean of Ohio commanded a following in the party and was a perennial aspirant for the Whig presidential nomination, but he maintained his independence from the party and never ran for office as a Whig candidate. Thomas Corwin of Ohio emerged in the 1840s as a leading opponent of the Mexican–American War, and he later served as Fillmore&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury. William Cabell Rives of Virginia joined the Whig Party over dissatisfaction with Van Buren&#x27;s handling of the Independent Treasury, and he became a prominent conservative Whig.

In Georgia, future Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens and Robert Toombs competed for influence with their intra-party rival, John M. Berrien. Future Republican President Abraham Lincoln served a single term as a Whig congressman representing Illinois.

One strength of the Whigs was a superb network of newspapers—their leading editor was Horace Greeley of the powerful &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Boston Atlas&quot;, under the leadership of Richard Haughton and Richard Hildreth, also emerged as an important Whig paper. Influenced by the writings of Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo, Henry Charles Carey became the leading Whig economist in the 1830s. Other prominent Whig-aligned intellectuals and public figures include journalist John G. Palfrey of the &quot;North American Review&quot;, novelist John P. Kennedy, and historian William H. Prescott.

=== Factions ===
The Whigs suffered greatly from factionalism throughout their existence and weak party loyalty, which stood in contrast to the strong party discipline that was the hallmark of a tight Democratic Party organization. Forged out of opposition to Jackson&#x27;s perceived executive tyranny, the early Whig Party was divided between former National Republicans who favored federal measures to promote economic development and Southern states&#x27; rights advocates who wished to keep federal intervention in the economy to a minimum. By the 1840s, Southern Whigs like John M. Berrien of Georgia and John Botts of Virginia endorsed interventionist measures, but other Southern Whigs like William Cabell Rives of Virginia actively sought to shift the party away from economic nationalism.

The Whig Party faced persistent sectional divisions regarding slavery. Northern Whigs tended to be more anti-slavery than Northern Democrats, but during the 1830s, Southern Whigs tended to be more pro-slavery than their Democratic counterparts. By the late 1840s, Southern Democrats had become more insistent regarding the expansion of slavery and more open to the prospect of secession than their Whig counterparts. Northern Whigs divided into two major factions concerning slavery: the anti-slavery Conscience Whigs and the pro-South Cotton Whigs. While the &quot;Consciences&quot; were noted for their moral opposition to slavery–many, like John Quincy Adams, brought over their crusading fervor from their Anti-Masonic days.

The other faction was tied to the cotton-based textile industry, which depended on Southern cotton. They de-emphasized the slavery issue. In Massachusetts, notable Consciences included Charles Sumner, Henry Wilson and Charles Francis Adams while the Cottons were led by such figures as Edward Everett, Robert C. Winthrop and Abbott Lawrence. During the mid-1850s, several Conscience leaders played an important role in the founding of the Republican Party.

===Historical reputation===
Historian Allen C. Guelzo writes that &quot;no major political movement ... has suffered more sheer dismissal, more impatient contempt at the hands of political historians than the American Whigs&quot;. Guelzo traces the start of this &quot;dismissal&quot; to the writings of Henry Adams, who dismissed the Whigs as bereft of ideas, and through to the writings of historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who labeled the period during which the Whigs were active as the &quot;Age of Jackson&quot;. The Whigs&#x27; historical reputation began to recover with the publication of &quot;The Political Culture of the American Whigs&quot; by historian Daniel Walker Howe in 1979. Rather than accepting the traditional understanding of the Whigs as Eastern elitists who sought to exploit the masses, Howe cast the Whigs as &quot;sober, industrious, thrifty people&quot; who sought to promote industrialization and national unity.

In today&#x27;s American political discourse, historians and pundits often cite the Whig Party as an example of a political party that lost its followers and reason for being, as in the expression &quot;going the way of the Whigs&quot;, a term referred to by Donald Critchlow in his book, &quot;The Conservative Ascendancy: How the GOP Right Made Political History&quot;. Critchlow points out that the application of the term by Republicans in the Republican Party of 1974 may have been a misnomer—the old Whig party enjoyed more political support before its demise than the Republican Party in the aftermath of Nixon&#x27;s resignation.

===Namesakes===
After the dissolution of the Whig Party, the term Whig remained part of the name of various newspapers, including the &quot;Quincy Herald-Whig&quot;. Several ephemeral small parties in the United States, including the Florida Whig Party and the &quot;Modern Whig Party&quot;, have adopted the Whig name. In Liberia, the True Whig Party was named in direct emulation of the American Whig Party. The True Whig Party was founded in 1869 and dominated politics in Liberia from 1878 until 1980.

===In popular culture===
Two alternative history works depicting histories where the Confederacy won the American Civil War include a Whig Party having a major role in the postbellum world. In Ward Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;, a revived Whig Party is one of the two main parties of the rump United States, being the right-wing party whose platform reflects an acceptance of the United States&#x27; humbled status following its defeat in the War of Southern Independence. Conversely, in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Southern Victory Series&quot; a Whig Party emerges as the dominant political party of an independent Confederacy, representing the interests of the plantocratic elite and dominating Confederate politics until the rise of the Freedom Party following the First Great War.

<text>The Republican Party, known retrospectively as the Democratic-Republican Party (also referred to by historians as the Jeffersonian Republican Party), was an American political party founded by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in the early 1790s. It championed liberalism, republicanism, individual liberty, equal rights, separation of church and state, freedom of religion, anti-clericalism, emancipation of religious minorities, decentralization, free markets, free trade, and agrarianism. In foreign policy, it was hostile to Great Britain and in sympathy with the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. The party became increasingly dominant after the 1800 elections as the opposing Federalist Party collapsed.

Increasing dominance over American politics led to increasing factional splits within the party. Old Republicans, led by John Taylor of Caroline and John Randolph of Roanoke, believed that the administrations of Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe—and the Congresses led by Henry Clay—had in some ways betrayed the republican &quot;Principles of &#x27;98&quot; by expanding the size and scope of the national government. The Republicans splintered during the 1824 presidential election. Those calling for a return to the older founding principles of the party were often referred to as &quot;Democratic Republicans&quot; (later Democrats) while those embracing the newer nationalist principles of &quot;The American System&quot; were often referred to as National Republicans (later Whigs).

The Republican Party originated in Congress to oppose the nationalist and economically interventionist policies of Alexander Hamilton, who served as Secretary of the Treasury under President George Washington. The Republicans and the opposing Federalist Party each became more cohesive during Washington&#x27;s second term, partly as a result of the debate over the Jay Treaty. Though he was defeated by Federalist John Adams in the 1796 presidential election, Jefferson and his Republican allies came into power following the 1800 elections. As president, Jefferson presided over a reduction in the national debt and government spending, and completed the Louisiana Purchase with France.

Madison succeeded Jefferson as president in 1809 and led the country during the largely inconclusive War of 1812 with Britain. After the war, Madison and his congressional allies established the Second Bank of the United States and implemented protective tariffs, marking a move away from the party&#x27;s earlier emphasis on states&#x27; rights and a strict construction of the United States Constitution. The Federalists collapsed after 1815, beginning a period known as the Era of Good Feelings. Lacking an effective opposition, the Republicans split into rival groups after the 1824 presidential election: one faction supported President John Quincy Adams and became known as the National Republican Party which later merged into the Whig Party, while another faction backed General Andrew Jackson and became the Democratic Party.

Republicans were deeply committed to the principles of republicanism, which they feared were threatened by the aristocratic tendencies of the Federalists. During the 1790s, the party strongly opposed Federalist programs, including the national bank. After the War of 1812, Madison and many other party leaders came to accept the need for a national bank and federally funded infrastructure projects. In foreign affairs, the party advocated western expansion and tended to favor France over Britain, though the party&#x27;s pro-French stance faded after Napoleon took power. The Democratic-Republicans were strongest in the South and the western frontier, and weakest in New England.

== History ==

===Founding, 1789–1796===
In the 1788–89 presidential election, the first such election following the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788, George Washington won the votes of every member of the Electoral College. His unanimous victory in part reflected the fact that no formal political parties had formed at the national level in the United States prior to 1789, though the country had been broadly polarized between the Federalists, who supported ratification of the Constitution, and the Anti-Federalists, who opposed ratification. Washington selected Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State and Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury, and he relied on James Madison as a key adviser and ally in Congress.

Hamilton implemented an expansive economic program, establishing the First Bank of the United States, and convincing Congress to assume the debts of state governments. Hamilton pursued his programs in the belief that they would foster a prosperous and stable country. His policies engendered an opposition, chiefly concentrated in the Southern United States, that objected to Hamilton&#x27;s Anglophilia and accused him of unduly favoring well-connected wealthy Northern merchants and speculators. Madison emerged as the leader of the congressional opposition while Jefferson, who declined to publicly criticize Hamilton while both served in Washington&#x27;s Cabinet, worked behind the scenes to stymie Hamilton&#x27;s programs. Jefferson and Madison established the &quot;National Gazette&quot;, a newspaper which recast national politics not as a battle between Federalists and Anti-Federalists, but as a debate between aristocrats and republicans. In the 1792 election, Washington effectively ran unopposed for president, but Jefferson and Madison backed New York Governor George Clinton&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to unseat Vice President John Adams.

Political leaders on both sides were reluctant to label their respective faction as a political party, but distinct and consistent voting blocs emerged in Congress by the end of 1793. Jefferson&#x27;s followers became known as the Republicans (or sometimes as the Democratic-Republicans) and Hamilton&#x27;s followers became the Federalists. While economic policies were the original motivating factor in the growing partisan split, foreign policy became even more important as war broke out between Great Britain (favored by Federalists) and France, which Republicans favored until 1799. Partisan tensions escalated as a result of the Whiskey Rebellion and Washington&#x27;s subsequent denunciation of the Democratic-Republican Societies, a type of new local political societies that favored democracy and generally supported the Jeffersonian position. Historians use the term &quot;Democratic-Republican&quot; to describe these new organizations, but that name was rarely used at the time. They usually called themselves &quot;Democratic&quot;, &quot;Republican&quot;, &quot;True Republican&quot;, &quot;Constitutional&quot;, &quot;United Freeman&quot;, &quot;Patriotic&quot;, &quot;Political&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, or &quot;Madisonian&quot;. The ratification of the Jay Treaty with Britain further inflamed partisan warfare, resulting in a hardening of the divisions between the Federalists and the Republicans.

By 1795–96, election campaigns—federal, state and local—were waged primarily along partisan lines between the two national parties, although local issues continued to affect elections, and party affiliations remained in flux. As Washington declined to seek a third term, the 1796 presidential election became the first contested president election. Having retired from Washington&#x27;s Cabinet in 1793, Jefferson had left the leadership of the Democratic-Republicans in Madison&#x27;s hands. Nonetheless, the Democratic-Republican congressional nominating caucus chose Jefferson as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee, in the belief that he would be the party&#x27;s strongest candidate; the caucus chose Senator Aaron Burr of New York as Jefferson&#x27;s running mate. Meanwhile, an informal caucus of Federalist leaders nominated a ticket of John Adams and Thomas Pinckney. Though the candidates themselves largely stayed out of the fray, supporters of the candidates waged an active campaign; Federalists attacked Jefferson as a Francophile and atheist, while the Democratic-Republicans accused Adams of being an anglophile and a monarchist. Ultimately, Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, garnering 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson, who became the vice president.

===Adams and the Revolution of 1800===

Shortly after Adams took office, he dispatched a group of envoys to seek peaceful relations with France, which had begun seizing American merchantmen trading with Britain after the ratification of the Jay Treaty. The failure of talks, and the French demand for bribes in what became known as the XYZ Affair, outraged the American public and led to the Quasi-War, an undeclared naval war between France and the United States. The Federalist-controlled Congress passed measures to expand the American military and also pushed through the Alien and Sedition Acts. These acts restricted speech critical of the government while also implementing stricter naturalization requirements. Numerous journalists and other individuals aligned with the Democratic-Republicans were prosecuted under the Sedition Act, sparking a backlash against the Federalists. Meanwhile, Jefferson and Madison drafted the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which held that state legislatures could determine the constitutionality of federal laws.

In the 1800 presidential election, the Democratic-Republicans once again nominated a ticket of Jefferson and Burr. Shortly after a Federalist caucus re-nominated President Adams on a ticket with Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Adams dismissed two Hamilton allies from his Cabinet, leading to an open break between the two key figures in the Federalist Party. Though the Federalist Party united against Jefferson&#x27;s candidacy and waged an effective campaign in many states, the Democratic-Republicans won the election by winning most Southern electoral votes and carrying the crucial state of New York.

A significant element in the party&#x27;s success in New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore and other east-coast cities were United Irish exiles, and other Irish immigrants, whom the Federalists regarded with distinct suspicion. Among these was William Duane who in his newspaper, the &quot;Philadelphia Aurora&quot;, exposed the details of the Ross Bill, by means of which the Federalist-controlled Congress sought to establish a closed-door Grand Committee with powers to disqualify College electors. Adams was to name Duane one of the three or four men most responsible for his eventual defeat.

Jefferson and Burr both finished with 73 electoral votes, more than Adams or Pinckney, necessitating a contingent election between Jefferson and Burr in the House of Representatives. Burr declined to take his name out of consideration, and the House deadlocked as most Democratic-Republican congressmen voted for Jefferson and most Federalists voted for Burr. Preferring Jefferson to Burr, Hamilton helped engineer Jefferson&#x27;s election on the 36th ballot of the contingent election. Jefferson would later describe the 1800 election, which also saw Democratic-Republicans gain control of Congress, as the &quot;Revolution of 1800&quot;, writing that it was &quot;as real of a revolution in the principles of our government as that of [1776] was in its form.&quot; In the final months of his presidency, Adams reached an agreement with France to end the Quasi-War and appointed several Federalist judges, including Chief Justice John Marshall.

===Jefferson&#x27;s presidency, 1801–1809===
Despite the intensity of the 1800 election, the transition of power from the Federalists to the Democratic-Republicans was peaceful. In his inaugural address, Jefferson indicated that he would seek to reverse many Federalist policies, but he also emphasized reconciliation, noting that &quot;every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle&quot;. He appointed a geographically balanced and ideologically moderate Cabinet that included Madison as Secretary of State and Albert Gallatin as Secretary of the Treasury; Federalists were excluded from the Cabinet, but Jefferson appointed some prominent Federalists and allowed many other Federalists to keep their positions. Gallatin persuaded Jefferson to retain the First Bank of the United States, a major part of the Hamiltonian program, but other Federalist policies were scrapped. Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes, shrank the army and the navy, repealed the Alien and Sedition Acts, and pardoned all ten individuals who had been prosecuted under the acts.

With the repeal of Federalist laws and programs, many Americans had little contact with the federal government in their daily lives, with the exception of the postal service. Partly as a result of these spending cuts, Jefferson lowered the national debt from $83 million to $57 million between 1801 and 1809. Though he was largely able to reverse Federalist policies, Federalists retained a bastion of power on the Supreme Court; Marshall Court rulings continued to reflect Federalist ideals until Chief Justice Marshall&#x27;s death in the 1830s. In the Supreme Court case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, the Marshall Court established the power of judicial review, through which the judicial branch had the final word on the constitutionality of federal laws.

By the time Jefferson took office, Americans had settled as far west as the Mississippi River. Many in the United States, particularly those in the west, favored further territorial expansion, and especially hoped to annex the Spanish province of Louisiana. In early 1803, Jefferson dispatched James Monroe to France to join ambassador Robert Livingston on a diplomatic mission to purchase New Orleans. To the surprise of the American delegation, Napoleon offered to sell the entire territory of Louisiana for $15 million. After Secretary of State James Madison gave his assurances that the purchase was well within even the strictest interpretation of the Constitution, the Senate quickly ratified the treaty, and the House immediately authorized funding. The Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the size of the United States, and Treasury Secretary Gallatin was forced to borrow from foreign banks to finance the payment to France. Though the Louisiana Purchase was widely popular, some Federalists criticized it; Congressman Fisher Ames argued that &quot;We are to spend money of which we have too little for land of which we already have too much.&quot;

By 1804, Vice President Burr had thoroughly alienated Jefferson, and the Democratic-Republican presidential nominating caucus chose George Clinton as Jefferson&#x27;s running mate for the 1804 presidential election. That same year, Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel after taking offense to a comment allegedly made by Hamilton; Hamilton died in the subsequent duel. Bolstered by a superior party organization, Jefferson won the 1804 election in a landslide over Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. In 1807, as the Napoleonic Wars continued, the British government announced the Orders in Council, which called for a blockade on French-controlled ports. In response to subsequent British and French searches of American shipping, the Jefferson administration passed the Embargo Act of 1807, which cut off American trade with Europe. The embargo proved unpopular and difficult to enforce, especially in Federalist-leaning New England, and expired at the end of Jefferson&#x27;s second term. Jefferson declined to seek a third term in the 1808 presidential election, but helped Madison triumph over George Clinton and James Monroe at the party&#x27;s congressional nominating caucus. Madison won the general election in a landslide over Pinckney.

===Madison&#x27;s presidency, 1809–1817===
As attacks on American shipping continued after Madison took office, both Madison and the broader American public moved towards war. Public resentment towards Britain led to the election of a new generation of Democratic-Republican leaders, including Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, who championed high tariffs, federally funded internal improvements and a jingoistic attitude towards Britain. On June 1, 1812, Madison asked Congress for a declaration of war. The declaration was passed largely along sectional and party lines, with intense opposition coming from the Federalists and some other congressmen from the Northeast. For many who favored war, national honor was at stake; John Quincy Adams wrote that the only alternative to war was &quot;the abandonment of our right as an independent nation.&quot; George Clinton&#x27;s nephew, DeWitt Clinton, challenged Madison in the 1812 presidential election. Though Clinton assembled a formidable coalition of Federalists and anti-Madison Democratic-Republicans, Madison won a close election.

Madison initially hoped for a quick end to the War of 1812, but the war got off to a disastrous start as multiple American invasions of Canada were defeated. The United States had more military success in 1813, and American troops under William Henry Harrison defeated Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy in the Battle of the Thames in 1814, crushing Indian resistance to U.S. expansion. Britain shifted troops to North America in 1814 following Napoleon&#x27;s abdication, and British forces captured and burnt Washington in August 1814. In early 1815, Madison learned that his negotiators in Europe had signed the Treaty of Ghent, ending the war without major concessions by either side. Though it had no effect on the treaty, Andrew Jackson&#x27;s victory in the January 1815 Battle of New Orleans ended the war on a triumphant note. Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 brought a final end to the Napoleonic Wars and European interference with American shipping. With Americans celebrating a successful &quot;second war of independence&quot;, the Federalist Party slid towards national irrelevance. The subsequent period of virtually one-party rule by the Democratic-Republican Party is known as the &quot;Era of Good Feelings.&quot;

In his first term, Madison and his allies had largely hewed to Jefferson&#x27;s domestic agenda of low taxes and a reduction of the national debt, and Congress allowed the national bank&#x27;s charter to expire during Madison&#x27;s first term. The challenges of the War of 1812 led many Democratic-Republicans to reconsider the role of the federal government. When the 14th Congress convened in December 1815, Madison proposed the re-establishment of the national bank, increased spending on the army and the navy, and a tariff designed to protect American goods from foreign competition. Madison&#x27;s proposals were strongly criticized by strict constructionists like John Randolph, who argued that Madison&#x27;s program &quot;out-Hamiltons Alexander Hamilton.&quot; Responding to Madison&#x27;s proposals, the 14th Congress compiled one of the most productive legislative records up to that point in history, enacting the Tariff of 1816 and establishing the Second Bank of the United States. At the party&#x27;s 1816 congressional nominating caucus, Secretary of State James Monroe defeated Secretary of War William H. Crawford in a 65-to-54 vote. The Federalists offered little opposition in the 1816 presidential election and Monroe won in a landslide election.

===Monroe and Era of Good Feelings, 1817–1825===

Monroe believed that the existence of political parties was harmful to the United States, and he sought to usher in the end of the Federalist Party by avoiding divisive policies and welcoming ex-Federalists into the fold. Monroe favored infrastructure projects to promote economic development and, despite some constitutional concerns, signed bills providing federal funding for the National Road and other projects. Partly due to the mismanagement of national bank president William Jones, the country experienced a prolonged economic recession known as the Panic of 1819. The panic engendered a widespread resentment of the national bank and a distrust of paper money that would influence national politics long after the recession ended. Despite the ongoing economic troubles, the Federalists failed to field a serious challenger to Monroe in the 1820 presidential election, and Monroe won re-election essentially unopposed.

During the proceedings over the admission of Missouri Territory as a state, Congressman James Tallmadge, Jr. of New York &quot;tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings&quot; by proposing amendments providing for the eventual exclusion of slavery from Missouri. The amendments sparked the first major national slavery debate since the ratification of the Constitution, and instantly exposed the sectional polarization over the issue of slavery. Northern Democratic-Republicans formed a coalition across partisan lines with the remnants of the Federalist Party in support of the amendments, while Southern Democratic-Republicans were almost unanimously against such the restrictions. In February 1820, Congressman Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois proposed a compromise, in which Missouri would be admitted as a slave state, but slavery would be excluded in the remaining territories north of the parallel 36°30′ north. A bill based on Thomas&#x27;s proposal became law in April 1820.

By 1824, the Federalist Party had largely collapsed as a national party, and the 1824 presidential election was waged by competing members of the Democratic-Republican Party. The party&#x27;s congressional nominating caucus was largely ignored, and candidates were instead nominated by state legislatures. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, former Speaker of the House Henry Clay, Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford, and General Andrew Jackson emerged as the major candidates in the election. The regional strength of each candidate played an important role in the election; Adams was popular in New England, Clay and Jackson were strong in the West, and Jackson and Crawford competed for the South.

As no candidate won a majority of the electoral vote in the 1824 election, the House of Representatives held a contingent election to determine the president. Clay personally disliked Adams but nonetheless supported him in the contingent election over Crawford, who opposed Clay&#x27;s nationalist policies, and Jackson, whom Clay viewed as a potential tyrant. With Clay&#x27;s backing, Adams won the contingent election. After Clay accepted appointment as Secretary of State, Jackson&#x27;s supporters claimed that Adams and Clay had reached a &quot;Corrupt Bargain&quot; in which Adams promised Clay the appointment in return for Clay&#x27;s support in the contingent election. Jackson, who was deeply angered by the result of the contingent election, returned to Tennessee, where the state legislature quickly nominated him for president in the 1828 election.

=== Final years, 1825–1829 ===
Adams shared Monroe&#x27;s goal of ending partisan conflict, and his Cabinet included individuals of various ideological and regional backgrounds. In his 1825 annual message to Congress, Adams presented a comprehensive and ambitious agenda, calling for major investments in internal improvements as well as the creation of a national university, a naval academy, and a national astronomical observatory. His requests to Congress galvanized the opposition, spurring the creation of an anti-Adams congressional coalition consisting of supporters of Jackson, Crawford, and Vice President Calhoun. Following the 1826 elections, Calhoun and Martin Van Buren (who brought along many of Crawford&#x27;s supporters) agreed to throw their support behind Jackson in the 1828 election. In the press, the two major political factions were referred to as &quot;Adams Men&quot; and &quot;Jackson Men&quot;.

The Jacksonians formed an effective party apparatus that adopted many modern campaign techniques and emphasized Jackson&#x27;s popularity and the supposed corruption of Adams and the federal government. Though Jackson did not articulate a detailed political platform in the same way that Adams did, his coalition was united in opposition to Adams&#x27;s reliance on government planning and tended to favor the opening of Native American lands to white settlement. Ultimately, Jackson won 178 of the 261 electoral votes and just under 56 percent of the popular vote. Jackson won 50.3 percent of the popular vote in the free states and 72.6 percent of the vote in the slave states. The election marked the permanent end of the Era of Good Feelings and the start of the Second Party System. The dream of non-partisan politics, shared by Monroe, Adams, and many earlier leaders, was shattered, replaced with Van Buren&#x27;s ideal of partisan battles between legitimated political parties.

== Origins of party name ==
In the 1790s, political parties were new in the United States and people were not accustomed to having formal names for them. There was no single official name for the Democratic-Republican Party, but party members generally called themselves Republicans and voted for what they called the &quot;Republican party&quot;, &quot;republican ticket&quot; or &quot;republican interest&quot;. Jefferson and Madison often used the terms &quot;republican&quot; and &quot;Republican party&quot; in their letters. As a general term (not a party name), the word republican had been in widespread usage from the 1770s to describe the type of government the break-away colonies wanted to form: a republic of three separate branches of government derived from some principles and structure from ancient republics; especially the emphasis on civic duty and the opposition to corruption, elitism, aristocracy and monarchy.

The term &quot;Democratic-Republican&quot; was used by contemporaries only occasionally, but is used by modern political scientists. Historians often refer to the &quot;Jeffersonian Republicans&quot;. The term &quot;Democratic Party&quot; was first used pejoratively by Federalist opponents. Historians argue that the party died out before the present-day Democratic Party was formed. However, since the days of Franklin Roosevelt Democratic politicians proudly claim Jefferson as their founder.

== Ideology ==

The Democratic-Republican Party saw itself as a champion of republicanism and denounced the Federalists as supporters of monarchy and aristocracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharp/&quot;&gt;James Roger Sharp, &quot;American Politics in the Early Republic: The New Nation in Crisis&quot; (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Brown writes that the party was marked by a &quot;commitment to broad principles of personal liberty, social mobility, and westward expansion.&quot; Political scientist James A. Reichley writes that &quot;the issue that most sharply divided the Jeffersonians from the Federalists was not states rights, nor the national debt, nor the national Bank... but the question of social equality.&quot; In a world in which few believed in democracy or egalitarianism, Jefferson&#x27;s belief in political equality stood out from many of the other leaders who held that the wealthy should lead society. His opponents, says Susan Dunn, warned that Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Republicans would turn America upside down, permitting the hoi polloi to govern the nation and unseating the wealthy social elite, long accustomed to wielding political power and governing the nation.&quot; Jefferson advocated a philosophy that historians call Jeffersonian democracy, which was marked by his belief in agrarianism and strict limits on the national government. Influenced by the Jeffersonian belief in equality, by 1824 all but three states had removed property-owning requirements for voting.

Though open to some redistributive measures, Jefferson saw a strong centralized government as a threat to freedom. Thus, the Democratic-Republicans opposed Federalist efforts to build a strong, centralized state, and resisted the establishment of a national bank, the build-up of the army and the navy, and passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson was especially averse to a national debt, which he believed to be inherently dangerous and immoral. After the party took power in 1800, Jefferson became increasingly concerned about foreign intervention and more open to programs of economic development conducted by the federal government. In an effort to promote economic growth and the development of a diversified economy, Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republican successors would oversee the construction of numerous federally funded infrastructure projects and implement protective tariffs.

While economic policies were the original catalyst to the partisan split between the Democratic-Republicans and the Federalists, foreign policy was also a major factor that divided the parties. Most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the Execution of Louis XVI in 1793, but Federalists began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent. Jefferson and other Democratic-Republicans defended the French Revolution until Napoleon ascended to power. Democratic-Republican foreign policy was marked by support for expansionism, as Jefferson championed the concept of an &quot;Empire of Liberty&quot; that centered on the acquisition and settlement of western territories. Under Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, the United States completed the Louisiana Purchase, acquired Spanish Florida, and reached a treaty with Britain providing for shared sovereignty over Oregon Country. In 1823, the Monroe administration promulgated the Monroe Doctrine, which reiterated the traditional U.S. policy of neutrality with regard to European wars and conflicts, but declared that the United States would not accept the recolonization of any country by its former European master.

=== Slavery ===
From the foundation of the party, slavery divided the Democratic-Republicans. Many Southern Democratic-Republicans, especially from the Deep South, defended the institution. Jefferson and many other Democratic-Republicans from Virginia held an ambivalent view on slavery; Jefferson believed it was an immoral institution, but he opposed the immediate emancipation of all slaves on social and economic grounds. Instead, he favored gradual phasing out of the institution. Meanwhile, Northern Democratic-Republicans often took stronger anti-slavery positions than their Federalist counterparts, supporting measures like the abolition of slavery in Washington. In 1807, with President Jefferson&#x27;s support, Congress outlawed the international slave trade, doing so at the earliest possible date allowed by the Constitution.

After the War of 1812, Southerners increasingly came to view slavery as a beneficial institution rather than an unfortunate economic necessity, further polarizing the party over the issue. Anti-slavery Northern Democratic-Republicans held that slavery was incompatible with the equality and individual rights promised by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. They further held that slavery had been permitted under the Constitution only as a local and impermanent exception, and thus, slavery should not be allowed to spread outside of the original thirteen states. The anti-slavery positions developed by Northern Democratic-Republicans would influence later anti-slavery parties, including the Free Soil Party and the Republican Party. Some Democratic-Republicans from the border states, including Henry Clay, continued to adhere to the Jeffersonian view of slavery as a necessary evil; many of these leaders joined the American Colonization Society, which proposed the voluntary recolonization of Africa as part of a broader plan for the gradual emancipation of slaves.

== Base of support ==
Madison and Jefferson formed the Democratic-Republican Party from a combination of former Anti-Federalists and supporters of the Constitution who were dissatisfied with the Washington administration&#x27;s policies. Nationwide, Democratic-Republicans were strongest in the South, and many of party&#x27;s leaders were wealthy Southern slaveowners. The Democratic-Republicans also attracted middle class Northerners, such as artisans, farmers, and lower-level merchants, who were eager to challenge the power of the local elite. Every state had a distinct political geography that shaped party membership; in Pennsylvania, the Republicans were weakest around Philadelphia and strongest in Scots-Irish settlements in the west. The Federalists had broad support in New England, but in other places they relied on wealthy merchants and landowners. After 1800, the Federalists collapsed in the South and West, though the party remained competitive in New England and in some Mid-Atlantic states.

== Factions ==

Historian Sean Wilentz writes that, after assuming power in 1801, the Democratic-Republicans began to factionalize into three main groups: moderates, radicals, and Old Republicans. The Old Republicans, led by John Randolph, were a loose group of influential Southern plantation owners who strongly favored states&#x27; rights and denounced any form of compromise with the Federalists. The radicals consisted of a wide array of individuals from different sections of the country who were characterized by their support for far-reaching political and economic reforms; prominent radicals include William Duane and Michael Leib, who jointly led a powerful political machine in Philadelphia. The moderate faction consisted of many former supporters of the ratification of the Constitution, including James Madison, who were more accepting of Federalist economic programs and sought conciliation with moderate Federalists.

After 1810, a younger group of nationalist Democratic-Republicans, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, rose to prominence. These nationalists favored federally funded internal improvements and high tariffs, positions that would form the basis for Clay&#x27;s American System. In addition to its base among the leaders of Clay and Calhoun&#x27;s generation, nationalist policies also proved attractive to many older Democratic-Republicans, including James Monroe. The Panic of 1819 sparked a backlash against nationalist policies, and many of those opposed to the nationalist policies rallied around William H. Crawford until he had a major stroke in 1823. After the 1824 election, most of Crawford&#x27;s followers, including Martin Van Buren, gravitated to Andrew Jackson, forming a major part of the coalition that propelled Jackson to victory in the 1828 election.

== Organizational strategy ==
The Democratic-Republican Party invented campaign and organizational techniques that were later adopted by the Federalists and became standard American practice. It was especially effective in building a network of newspapers in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize its policies. Fisher Ames, a leading Federalist, used the term &quot;Jacobin&quot; to link members of Jefferson&#x27;s party to the radicals of the French Revolution. He blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson and wrote they were &quot;an overmatch for any Government... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition&quot;.

As one historian explained: &quot;It was the good fortune of the Republicans to have within their ranks a number of highly gifted political manipulators and propagandists. Some of them had the ability... to not only see and analyze the problem at hand but to present it in a succinct fashion; in short, to fabricate the apt phrase, to coin the compelling slogan and appeal to the electorate on any given issue in language it could understand&quot;. Outstanding propagandists included editor William Duane (1760–1835) and party leaders Albert Gallatin, Thomas Cooper and Jefferson himself. Just as important was effective party organization of the sort that John J. Beckley pioneered. In 1796, he managed the Jefferson campaign in Pennsylvania, blanketing the state with agents who passed out 30,000 hand-written tickets, naming all 15 electors (printed tickets were not allowed). Beckley told one agent: &quot;In a few days a select republican friend from the City will call upon you with a parcel of tickets to be distributed in your County. Any assistance and advice you can furnish him with, as to suitable districts &amp; characters, will I am sure be rendered&quot;. Beckley was the first American professional campaign manager and his techniques were quickly adopted in other states.

The emergence of the new organizational strategies can be seen in the politics of Connecticut around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had to work harder to win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders &quot;to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty&quot;. Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers. This highly coordinated &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot; drive would be familiar to future political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.

== Legacy==

The Federalists collapsed after 1815, beginning a period known as the Era of Good Feelings. After the 1824 presidential election the Democratic-Republicans split into factions. The coalition of Jacksonians, Calhounites, and Crawfordites built by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren coalesced into the Democratic Party, which dominated presidential politics in the decades prior to the Civil War. Supporters of John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay would form the main opposition to Jackson as the National Republican Party, which in turn eventually formed part of the Whig Party, which was the second major party in the United States between the 1830s and the early 1850s. The diverse and changing nature of the Democratic-Republican Party allowed both major parties to claim that they stood for Jeffersonian principles. Historian Daniel Walker Howe writes that Democrats traced their heritage to the &quot;Old Republicanism of Macon and Crawford&quot;, while the Whigs looked to &quot;the new Republican nationalism of Madison and Gallatin.&quot;

The Whig Party fell apart in the 1850s due to divisions over the expansion of slavery into new territories. The modern Republican Party was formed in 1854 to oppose the expansion of slavery, and many former Whig Party leaders joined the newly formed anti-slavery party. The Republican Party sought to combine Jefferson and Jackson&#x27;s ideals of liberty and equality with Clay&#x27;s program of using an active government to modernize the economy. The Democratic-Republican Party inspired the name and ideology of the Republican Party, but is not directly connected to that party.

Fear of a large debt is a major legacy of the party. Andrew Jackson believed the national debt was a &quot;national curse&quot; and he took special pride in paying off the entire national debt in 1835. Politicians ever since have used the issue of a high national debt to denounce the other party for profligacy and a threat to fiscal soundness and the nation&#x27;s future.

===Presidential elections===

===Congressional representation===

The affiliation of many Congressmen in the earliest years is an assignment by later historians. The parties were slowly coalescing groups; at first there were many independents. Cunningham noted that only about a quarter of the House of Representatives up until 1794 voted with Madison as much as two-thirds of the time and another quarter against him two-thirds of the time, leaving almost half as fairly independent.

<text>The Ulvophyceae or ulvophytes are a class of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology, life cycle and molecular phylogenetic data. The sea lettuce, &quot;Ulva&quot;, belongs here. Other well-known members include &quot;Caulerpa&quot;, &quot;Codium&quot;, &quot;Acetabularia&quot;, &quot;Cladophora&quot;, &quot;Trentepohlia&quot; and &quot;Monostroma&quot;.

The Ulvophytes are diverse in their morphology and their habitat. Most are seaweeds such as those listed above. Others, such as &quot;Rhizoclonium&quot;, &quot;Pithophora&quot; and some species of &quot;Cladophora&quot; live in fresh water and in some areas are considered weeds.

==Evolution==
The origin and early diversification of the Ulvophyceae likely took place in the late Neoproterozoic, though may have taken place earlier, in the Mesoproterozoic. Although most contemporary ulvophytes are marine macroalgae (seaweeds), ancestral ulvophytes may have been freshwater, unicellular green algae. Molecular phylogenetic evidence suggests that macroscopic growth was achieved independently in the various major lineages of Ulvophyceae (Ulvales-Ulotrichales, Trentepohliales, Cladophorales, Bryopsidales and Dasycladales). The earliest known representative is the cladophorales &quot;Proterocladus antiquus&quot; from the Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic boundary in North China.

Current hypothesis on relationships among the main clades of Ulvophyceae are shown below.

<doc id="32086" wikidata="Q42189" url="?curid=32086" title="Federalist Party">
<text>The Federalist Party was a conservative and nationalist American political party and the first political party in the United States. It dominated the national government under Alexander Hamilton from 1789 to 1801. The party was defeated by the Democratic-Republican Party in 1800, and it became a minority party while keeping its stronghold in New England. It made a brief resurgence by opposing the War of 1812, then collapsed with its last presidential candidate in 1816. Remnants lasted for a few years afterwards.

The party appealed to businesses who favored banks, national over state government, and manufacturing an army and navy. In world affairs, the party preferred Great Britain and strongly opposed involvement in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The party favored centralization, federalism, modernization, industrialization, and protectionism.

The Federalists called for a strong national government that promoted economic growth and fostered friendly relationships with Great Britain in opposition to Revolutionary France. The Federalist Party came into being between 1789 and 1790 as a national coalition of bankers and businessmen in support of Hamilton&#x27;s fiscal policies. These supporters worked in every state to build an organized party committed to a fiscally sound and nationalistic government. The only Federalist president was John Adams. George Washington was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program, but he remained officially non-partisan during his entire presidency. The Federalist Party controlled the national government until 1801, when it was overwhelmed by the Democratic-Republican opposition led by President Thomas Jefferson.

Federalist policies called for a national bank, tariffs, and good relations with Great Britain as expressed in the Jay Treaty negotiated in 1794. Hamilton developed the concept of implied powers and successfully argued the adoption of that interpretation of the Constitution. The Democratic-Republicans led by Jefferson denounced most of the Federalist policies, especially the bank and implied powers, and vehemently attacked the Jay Treaty as a sell-out of American interests to Britain. The Jay Treaty passed and the Federalists won most of the major legislative battles in the 1790s. They held a strong base in the nation&#x27;s cities and in New England. They factionalized when President Adams secured peace with France, to the anger of Hamilton&#x27;s larger faction. The Jeffersonians won the presidential election of 1800, and the Federalists never returned to power. They recovered some strength through their intense opposition to the War of 1812, but they practically vanished during the Era of Good Feelings that followed the end of the war in 1815.

The Federalists left a lasting legacy in the form of a strong federal government. After losing executive power, they decisively shaped Supreme Court policy for another three decades through Chief Justice John Marshall.

== Origins ==
The term &quot;Federalist&quot; was previously used to refer to a somewhat different coalition of nationalists led by Washington, which advocated replacing the weaker national government under the Articles of Confederation with a new Constitution in 1789. This early coalition included Hamilton and James Madison.

The Federalists of this time were rivaled by the Anti-Federalists, who opposed the ratification of the Constitution and objected to creating a stronger central government. The critiques of the Constitution raised by the Anti-Federalists influenced the creation of the Bill of Rights. Federalists responded to these objections by promising to add a bill of rights as amendments to the Constitution to satisfy these concerns, which aided in securing acceptance and ratification of the Constitution by the states. The new United States Congress, initially with a Federalist majority, submitted to the states a series of amendments to guarantee specific freedoms and rights; once ratified, these would become the first ten amendments to the Constitution.

== Rise ==
Upon taking office in 1789, President Washington nominated his wartime chief of staff Alexander Hamilton to the new office of Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton wanted a strong national government with financial credibility, and he proposed the ambitious Hamiltonian economic program that involved the assumption of the state debts incurred during the American Revolution. This created a national debt and the means to pay it off, and it set up a national bank along with tariffs, with James Madison playing major roles in the program. Parties were considered to be divisive and harmful to republicanism, and no similar parties existed anywhere in the world.

By 1789, Hamilton started building a nationwide coalition (a &quot;Pro-Administration&quot; faction), realizing the need for vocal political support in the states. He formed connections with like-minded nationalists and used his network of treasury agents to link together friends of the government, especially merchants and bankers, in the new nation&#x27;s dozen major cities. His attempts to manage politics in the national capital to get his plans through Congress brought strong responses across the country. In the process, what began as a capital faction soon assumed status as a national faction and then as the new Federalist Party. The Federalist Party supported Hamilton&#x27;s vision of a strong centralized government and agreed with his proposals for a national bank and heavy government subsidies. In foreign affairs, they supported neutrality in the war between France and Great Britain.

Hamilton proposed to fund the national and state debts, and Madison and John J. Beckley began organizing a party to oppose it. This &quot;Anti-Administration&quot; faction became what is now called the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Madison and Thomas Jefferson. This party attracted many Anti-Federalists who were wary of a centralized government.

By the early 1790s, newspapers started calling Hamilton supporters &quot;Federalists&quot; and their opponents &quot;Republicans&quot;, &quot;Jeffersonians&quot;, or &quot;Democratic-Republicans&quot;. Jefferson&#x27;s supporters usually called themselves &quot;Republicans&quot; and their party the &quot;Republican Party&quot;. The Federalist Party became popular with businessmen and New Englanders, as Republicans were mostly farmers who opposed a strong central government. Cities were usually Federalist strongholds, whereas frontier regions were heavily Republican. The Congregationalists of New England and the Episcopalians in the larger cities supported the Federalists, while other minority denominations tended toward the Republican camp. Catholics in Maryland were generally Federalists.

The state networks of both parties began to operate in 1794 or 1795, and patronage became a factor. The winner-takes-all election system opened a wide gap between winners, who got all the patronage, and losers who got none. Hamilton had many lucrative Treasury jobs to dispense—there were 1,700 of them by 1801. Jefferson had one part-time job in the State Department, which he gave to journalist Philip Freneau to attack the Federalists. In New York, George Clinton won the election for governor and used the vast state patronage fund to help the Republican cause.

Washington tried and failed to moderate the feud between his two top cabinet members. He was re-elected without opposition in 1792. The Democratic-Republicans nominated New York&#x27;s Governor Clinton to replace Federalist John Adams as vice president, but Adams won. The balance of power in Congress was close, with some members still undecided between the parties. In early 1793, Jefferson secretly prepared resolutions introduced by Virginia Congressman William Branch Giles designed to repudiate Hamilton and weaken the Washington Administration. Hamilton defended his administration of the nation&#x27;s complicated financial affairs, which none of his critics could decipher until the arrival in Congress of Republican Albert Gallatin in 1793.

Federalists counterattacked by claiming that the Hamiltonian program had restored national prosperity, as shown in one 1792 anonymous newspaper essay: 
To what physical, moral, or political energy shall this flourishing state of things be ascribed? There is but one answer to these inquiries: Public credit is restored and established. The general government, by uniting and calling into action the pecuniary resources of the states, has created a new capital stock of several millions of dollars, which, with that before existing, is directed into every branch of business, giving life and vigor to industry in its infinitely diversified operation. The enemies of the general government, the funding act and the National Bank may bellow tyranny, aristocracy, and speculators through the Union and repeat the clamorous din as long as they please; but the actual state of agriculture and commerce, the peace, the contentment and satisfaction of the great mass of people, give the lie to their assertions.

Jefferson wrote on 12 February 1798: 
=== Religious dimension ===
In New England, the Federalist Party was closely linked to the Congregational church. When the party collapsed, the church was disestablished. In 1800 and other elections, the Federalists targeted infidelity in any form. They repeatedly charged that Republican candidates were atheistic or anti-religious, especially Jefferson, Paine, and Franklin. Conversely, the Baptists, Methodists, and other dissenters favored the Republican cause. Jefferson told the Baptists of Connecticut that there should be a &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state, alluding to the writings of Rhode Island&#x27;s Roger Williams.

== Effects of foreign affairs ==
International affairs—the French Revolution and the subsequent war between royalist Britain and republican France—decisively shaped American politics in 1793–1800 and threatened to entangle the country in wars that &quot;mortally threatened its very existence&quot;. The French revolutionaries guillotined King Louis XVI in January 1793, and subsequently declared war on Britain. The French king had been decisive in helping the United States achieve independence, but now he was dead and many of the pro-American aristocrats in France were exiled or executed. Federalists warned that American republicans threatened to replicate the horrors of the French Revolution and successfully mobilized most conservatives and many clergymen. The Republicans, some of whom had been strong Francophiles, responded with support even through the Reign of Terror, when thousands were guillotined, though it was at this point that many began backing away from their pro-France leanings. Many of those executed had been friends of the United States, such as the Comte D&#x27;Estaing, whose fleet had fought alongside the Americans in the Revolution (Lafayette had already fled into exile, and Thomas Paine went to prison in France). The republicans denounced Hamilton, Adams and even Washington as friends of Britain, as secret monarchists, aristocrats and as enemies of the republican values. The level of rhetoric reached a fever pitch.

In 1793, Paris sent a new minister, Edmond-Charles Genêt (known as &quot;Citizen Genêt&quot;), who systematically mobilized pro-French sentiment and encouraged Americans to support France&#x27;s war against Britain and Spain. Genêt funded local Democratic-Republican Societies that attacked Federalists. He hoped for a favorable new treaty and for repayment of the debts owed to France. Acting aggressively, Genêt outfitted privateers that sailed with American crews under a French flag and attacked British shipping. He tried to organize expeditions of Americans to invade Spanish Louisiana and Spanish Florida. When Secretary of State Jefferson told Genêt he was pushing American friendship past the limit, Genêt threatened to go over the government&#x27;s head and rouse public opinion on behalf of France. Even Jefferson agreed this was blatant foreign interference in domestic politics. Genêt&#x27;s extremism seriously embarrassed the Jeffersonians and cooled popular support for promoting the French Revolution and getting involved in its wars. Recalled to Paris for execution, Genêt kept his head and instead went to New York, where he became a citizen and married the daughter of Governor Clinton. Jefferson left office, ending the coalition cabinet and allowing the Federalists to dominate.

=== Jay Treaty ===
The Jay Treaty battle in 1794–1795 was the effort by Washington, Hamilton and John Jay to resolve numerous difficulties with Britain. Some of these issues dated to the Revolution, such as boundaries, debts owed in each direction and the continued presence of British forts in the Northwest Territory. In addition, the United States hoped to open markets in the British Caribbean and end disputes stemming from the naval war between Britain and France. Most of all the goal was to avert a war with Britain—a war opposed by the Federalists, that some historians claim the Jeffersonians wanted.

As a neutral party, the United States argued it had the right to carry goods anywhere it wanted. The British nevertheless seized American ships carrying goods from the French West Indies. The Federalists favored Britain in the war and by far most of America&#x27;s foreign trade was with Britain, hence a new treaty was called for. The British agreed to evacuate the western forts, open their West Indies ports to American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. One possible alternative was war with Britain, a war that the United States was ill-prepared to fight.

The Republicans wanted to pressure Britain to the brink of war (and assumed that the United States could defeat a weak Britain). Therefore, they denounced the Jay Treaty as an insult to American prestige, a repudiation of the American-French alliance of 1777 and a severe shock to Southern planters who owed those old debts and who would now be never compensated for their escaped slaves who fled to British lines for their freedom. Republicans protested against the treaty and organized their supporters. The Federalists realized they had to mobilize their popular vote, so they mobilized their newspapers, held rallies, counted votes and especially relied on the prestige of President Washington. The contest over the Jay Treaty marked the first flowering of grassroots political activism in the United States, directed and coordinated by two national parties. Politics was no longer the domain of politicians as every voter was called on to participate. The new strategy of appealing directly to the public worked for the Federalists as public opinion shifted to support the Jay Treaty. The Federalists controlled the Senate and they ratified it by exactly the necessary ⅔ vote (20–10) in 1795. However, the Republicans did not give up and public opinion swung toward the Republicans after the Treaty fight and in the South the Federalists lost most of the support they had among planters.

== Whiskey Rebellion ==

The excise tax of 1791 caused grumbling from the frontier including threats of tax resistance. Corn, the chief crop on the frontier, was too bulky to ship over the mountains to market unless it was first distilled into whiskey. This was profitable as the United States population consumed per capita relatively large quantities of liquor. After the excise tax, the backwoodsmen complained the tax fell on them rather than on the consumers. Cash poor, they were outraged that they had been singled out to pay off the &quot;financiers and speculators&quot; back in the East and to pay the salaries of the federal revenue officers who began to swarm the hills looking for illegal stills.

Insurgents in western Pennsylvania shut the courts and hounded federal officials, but Jeffersonian leader Albert Gallatin mobilized the western moderates and thus forestalled a serious outbreak. Washington, seeing the need to assert federal supremacy, called out 13,000 state militia and marched toward Washington, Pennsylvania to suppress this Whiskey Rebellion. The rebellion evaporated in late 1794 as Washington approached, personally leading the army (only two sitting Presidents have directly led American military forces, Washington during the Whiskey Rebellion and Madison in an attempt to save the White House during the War of 1812). The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting. Federalists were relieved that the new government proved capable of overcoming rebellion while Republicans, with Gallatin their new hero, argued there never was a real rebellion and the whole episode was manipulated in order to accustom Americans to a standing army.

Angry petitions flowed in from three dozen Democratic-Republican Societies created by Citizen Genêt. Washington attacked the societies as illegitimate and many disbanded. Federalists now ridiculed Republicans as &quot;democrats&quot; (meaning in favor of mob rule) or &quot;Jacobins&quot; (a reference to the Reign of Terror in France).

Washington refused to run for a third term, establishing a two-term precedent that was to stand until 1940 and eventually to be enshrined in the Constitution as the 22nd Amendment. He warned in his Farewell Address against involvement in European wars and lamented the rising north–south sectionalism and party spirit in politics that threatened national unity: The party spirits serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.

Washington never considered himself a member of any party, but broadly supported most Federalist policies.

== Newspaper editors at war ==
The spoils system helped finance Federalist printers until 1801 and Republican editors after that. Federalist Postmasters General, Timothy Pickering (1791–94) and Joseph Habersham (1795–1801) appointed and removed local postmasters to maximize party funding. Numerous printers were appointed as postmasters. They did not deliver the mail, but they did collect fees from mail users and obtained free delivery of their own newspapers and business mail.

To strengthen their coalitions and hammer away constantly at the opposition, both parties sponsored newspapers in the capital (Philadelphia) and other major cities. On the Republican side, Philip Freneau and Benjamin Franklin Bache blasted the administration with all the scurrility at their command. Bache in particular targeted Washington himself as the front man for monarchy who must be exposed. To Bache, Washington was a cowardly general and a money-hungry baron who saw the Revolution as a means to advance his fortune and fame; Adams was a failed diplomat who never forgave the French their love of Benjamin Franklin and who craved a crown for himself and his descendants; and Alexander Hamilton was the most inveterate monarchist of them all.

The Federalists, with twice as many newspapers at their command, slashed back with equal vituperation. John Fenno and &quot;Peter Porcupine&quot; (William Cobbett) were their nastiest penmen and Noah Webster their most learned. Hamilton subsidized the Federalist editors, wrote for their papers and in 1801 established his own paper, the &quot;New York Evening Post.&quot; Though his reputation waned considerably following his death, Joseph Dennie ran three of the most popular and influential newspapers of the period, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Weekly Museum&quot;, the &quot;Gazette of the United States&quot; and &quot;The Port Folio&quot;.

=== Ceremonies and civil religion ===

The Federalists were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party. Elections remained of central importance, but the rest of the political calendar was filled with celebrations, parades, festivals, and visual sensationalism. The Federalists employed multiple festivities, exciting parades, and even quasi-religious pilgrimages and &quot;sacred&quot; days that became incorporated into the American civil religion. George Washington was always their hero and after his death he became viewed as a sort of demigod looking down from heaven to bestow his blessings on the party. At first, the Federalists focused on commemorating the ratification of the Constitution and organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation&#x27;s new civil religion.

The Fourth of July became a semi-sacred day—a status it has maintained for much of American history. Its celebration in Boston emphasized national over local patriotism and included orations, dinners, militia musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth of July was closely identified with the Federalist Party. Republicans were annoyed and staged their own celebrations on the same day—with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other, which generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth of July became a nonpartisan holiday.

== Adams administration: 1797–1801 ==
Hamilton distrusted Vice President Adams—who felt the same way about Hamilton—but was unable to block his claims to the succession. The election of 1796 was the first partisan affair in the nation&#x27;s history and one of the more scurrilous in terms of newspaper attacks. Adams swept New England and Jefferson the South, with the middle states leaning to Adams. Adams was the winner by a margin of three electoral votes and Jefferson, as the runner-up, became vice president under the system set out in the Constitution prior to the ratification of the 12th Amendment.

The Federalists were strongest in New England, but also had strengths in the middle states. They elected Adams as president in 1796, when they controlled both houses of Congress, the presidency, eight state legislatures and ten governorships.

Foreign affairs continued to be the central concern of American politics, for the war raging in Europe threatened to drag in the United States. Historian Sarah Kreps in 2018 argues the Federalist faction led by President Adams during the 1798 Quasi-War could correspond to &quot;today&#x27;s right-of-center party.&quot;

The new president was a loner, who made decisions without consulting Hamilton or other &quot;High Federalists&quot;. Benjamin Franklin once quipped that Adams was a man always honest, often brilliant and sometimes mad. Adams was popular among the Federalist rank and file, but had neglected to build state or local political bases of his own and neglected to take control of his own cabinet. As a result, his cabinet answered more to Hamilton than to himself. Hamilton was especially popular because he rebuilt the Army—and had commissions to give out.

=== Alien and Sedition Acts ===
After an American delegation was insulted in Paris in the XYZ affair (1797), public opinion ran strongly against the French. An undeclared &quot;Quasi-War&quot; with France from 1798 to 1800 saw each side attacking and capturing the other&#x27;s shipping. It was called &quot;quasi&quot; because there was no declaration of war, but escalation was a serious threat. At the peak of their popularity, the Federalists took advantage by preparing for an invasion by the French Army. To silence Administration critics, the Federalists passed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798. The Alien Act empowered the President to deport such aliens as he declared to be dangerous. The Sedition Act made it a crime to print false, scandalous and malicious criticisms of the federal government, but it conspicuously failed to criminalize criticism of Vice President Thomas Jefferson.

Several Republican newspaper editors were convicted under the Act and fined or jailed and three Democratic-Republican newspapers were shut down. In response, Jefferson and Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions passed by the two states&#x27; legislatures that declared the Alien and Sedition Acts unconstitutional and insisted the states had the power to nullify federal laws.

Undaunted, the Federalists created a navy, with new frigates; and a large new army, with Washington in nominal command and Hamilton in actual command. To pay for it all, they raised taxes on land, houses and slaves, leading to serious unrest. In one part of Pennsylvania, the Fries&#x27; Rebellion broke out, with people refusing to pay the new taxes. John Fries was sentenced to death for treason, but received a pardon from Adams. In the elections of 1798, the Federalists did very well, but this issue started hurting the Federalists in 1799. Early in 1799, Adams decided to free himself from Hamilton&#x27;s overbearing influence, stunning the country and throwing his party into disarray by announcing a new peace mission to France. The mission eventually succeeded, the &quot;Quasi-War&quot; ended and the new army was largely disbanded. Hamiltonians called Adams a failure while Adams fired Hamilton&#x27;s supporters still in the cabinet.

Hamilton and Adams intensely disliked one another and the Federalists split between supporters of Hamilton (&quot;High Federalists&quot;) and supporters of Adams. Hamilton became embittered over his loss of political influence and wrote a scathing criticism of Adams&#x27; performance as president in an effort to throw Federalist support to Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Inadvertently, this split the Federalists and helped give the victory to Jefferson.

== Election of 1800 ==

Adams&#x27;s peace moves proved popular with the Federalist rank and file and he seemed to stand a good chance of re-election in 1800. If the Three-Fifths Compromise had not been enacted, he most likely would have won reelection since many Federalist legislatures removed the right to select electors from their constituents in fear of a Democratic victory. Jefferson was again the opponent and Federalists pulled out all stops in warning that he was a dangerous revolutionary, hostile to religion, who would weaken the government, damage the economy and get into war with Britain. Many believed that if Jefferson won the election, it would be the end of the newly formed United States. The Republicans crusaded against the Alien and Sedition laws as well as the new taxes and proved highly effective in mobilizing popular discontent.

The election hinged on New York as its electors were selected by the legislature and given the balance of North and South, they would decide the presidential election. Aaron Burr brilliantly organized his forces in New York City in the spring elections for the state legislature. By a few hundred votes, he carried the city—and thus the state legislature—and guaranteed the election of a Republican president. As a reward, he was selected by the Republican caucus in Congress as their vice presidential candidate. Alexander Hamilton, knowing the election was lost anyway, went public with a sharp attack on Adams that further divided and weakened the Federalists.

Members of the Republican Party planned to vote evenly for Jefferson and Burr because they did not want for it to seem as if their party was divided. The party took the meaning literally and Jefferson and Burr tied in the election with 73 electoral votes. This sent the election to the House of Representatives to break the tie. The Federalists had enough weight in the House to swing the election in either direction. Many would rather have seen Burr in the office over Jefferson, but Hamilton, who had a strong dislike of Burr, threw his political weight behind Jefferson. During the election, neither Jefferson nor Burr attempted to swing the election in the House of Representatives. Jefferson remained at Monticello to oversee the laying of bricks to a section of his home. Jefferson allowed for his political beliefs and other ideologies to filter out through letters to his contacts. Thanks to Hamilton&#x27;s support, Jefferson would win the election and Burr would become his vice president.

The 1800 election marked the first time power had been transferred between opposing political parties, an act that occurred remarkably without bloodshed. Though there had been strong words and disagreements, contrary to the Federalists fears, there was no war and no ending of one-government system to let in a new one. His patronage policy was to let the Federalists disappear through attrition. Those Federalists such as John Quincy Adams (John Adams&#x27; own son) and Rufus King willing to work with him were rewarded with senior diplomatic posts, but there was no punishment of the opposition.

== Federalists in opposition ==
Fisher Ames (1758–1808) of Massachusetts ranks as one of the more influential figures of his era. Ames led Federalist ranks in the House of Representatives. His acceptance of the Bill of Rights garnered support in Massachusetts for the new Constitution. His greatest fame came as an orator who defined the principles of the Federalist Party and the follies of the Republicans. Ames offered one of the first great speeches in American Congressional history when he spoke in favor of the Jay Treaty. Ames was part of Hamilton&#x27;s faction and cautioned against the excesses of democracy unfettered by morals and reason: &quot;Popular reason does not always know how to act right, nor does it always act right when it knows&quot;. He warned his countrymen of the dangers of flattering demagogues, who incite dis-union and lead their country into bondage: &quot;Our country is too big for union, too sordid for patriotism, too democratic for liberty. What is to become of it, He who made it best knows. Its vice will govern it, by practising upon its folly. This is ordained for democracies&quot;.

=== Jefferson administration ===
Jefferson had a very successful first term, typified by the Louisiana Purchase, which was supported by Hamilton, but opposed by most Federalists at the time as unconstitutional. Some Federalist leaders (Essex Junto) began courting Jefferson&#x27;s vice president and Hamilton&#x27;s nemesis Aaron Burr in an attempt to swing New York into an independent confederation with the New England states, which along with New York were supposed to secede from the United States after Burr&#x27;s election to Governor. However, Hamilton&#x27;s influence cost Burr the governorship of New York, a key in the Essex Junto&#x27;s plan, just as Hamilton&#x27;s influence had cost Burr the presidency nearly four years before. Hamilton&#x27;s thwarting of Aaron Burr&#x27;s ambitions for the second time was too much for Burr to bear. Hamilton had known of the Essex Junto (whom Hamilton now regarded as apostate Federalists) and Burr&#x27;s plans and opposed them vehemently. This opposition by Hamilton would lead to his fatal duel with Burr in July 1804.

The thoroughly disorganized Federalists hardly offered any opposition to Jefferson&#x27;s reelection in 1804 and Federalists seemed doomed. Jefferson had taken away most of their patronage, including federal judgeships. The party now controlled only five state legislatures and seven governorships. After again losing the presidency in 1804, the party was now down to three legislatures and five governorships (four in New England). Their majorities in Congress were long gone, dropping in the Senate from 23 in 1796, and 21 in 1800 to only six in 1804. In New England and in some districts in the middle states, the Federalists clung to power, but the tendency from 1800 to 1812 was steady slippage almost everywhere as the Republicans perfected their organization and the Federalists tried to play catch-up. Some younger leaders tried to emulate the Democratic-Republican tactics, but their overall disdain of democracy along with the upper class bias of the party leadership eroded public support. In the South, the Federalists steadily lost ground everywhere.

The Federalists continued for several years to be a major political party in New England and the Northeast, but never regained control of the presidency or the Congress. With the death of Washington and Hamilton and the retirement of Adams, the Federalists were left without a strong leader as Chief Justice John Marshall stayed out of politics. However, a few younger leaders did appear, notably Daniel Webster. Federalist policies favored factories, banking and trade over agriculture and therefore became unpopular in the growing Western states. They were increasingly seen as aristocratic and unsympathetic to democracy. In the South, the party had lingering support in Maryland, but elsewhere was crippled by 1800 and faded away by 1808.

Massachusetts and Connecticut remained the party strongholds. Historian Richard J. Purcell explains how well organized the party was in Connecticut:
It was only necessary to perfect the working methods of the organized body of office-holders who made up the nucleus of the party. There were the state officers, the assistants, and a large majority of the Assembly. In every county there was a sheriff with his deputies. All of the state, county, and town judges were potential and generally active workers. Every town had several justices of the peace, school directors and, in Federalist towns, all the town officers who were ready to carry on the party&#x27;s work. Every parish had a &quot;standing agent&quot;, whose anathemas were said to convince at least ten voting deacons. Militia officers, state&#x27;s attorneys, lawyers, professors and schoolteachers were in the van of this &quot;conscript army&quot;. In all, about a thousand or eleven hundred dependent officer-holders were described as the inner ring which could always be depended upon for their own and enough more votes within their control to decide an election. This was the Federalist machine.

After 1800, the major Federalist role came in the judiciary. Although Jefferson managed to repeal the Judiciary Act of 1801 and thus dismissed many lower level Federalist federal judges, the effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 failed. Led by the last great Federalist, John Marshall as Chief Justice from 1801 to 1835, the Supreme Court carved out a unique and powerful role as the protector of the Constitution and promoter of nationalism.

=== Anti-War Party ===
As the wars in Europe intensified, the United States became increasingly involved. The Federalists restored some of their strength by leading the anti-war opposition to Jefferson and Madison between 1807 and 1814. President Jefferson imposed an embargo on Britain in 1807 as the Embargo Act of 1807 prevented all American ships from sailing to a foreign port. The idea was that the British were so dependent on American supplies that they would come to terms. For 15 months, the Embargo wrecked American export businesses, largely based in the Boston-New York region, causing a sharp depression in the Northeast. Evasion was common and Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Gallatin responded with tightened police controls more severe than anything the Federalists had ever proposed. Public opinion was highly negative and a surge of support breathed fresh life into the Federalist Party.

As Jefferson refrained from seeking a third term, the Republicans nominated Madison for the presidency in 1808. Meeting in the first-ever national convention, Federalists considered the option of nominating Jefferson&#x27;s Vice President George Clinton (who represented a different Clintonian party faction from New York, had run for the Republican candidacy in 1804 and had not wanted to become vice president) as their own candidate, but balked at working with him and again chose Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, their 1804 candidate. Madison lost New England excluding Vermont, but swept the rest of the country and carried a Republican Congress. Madison dropped the Embargo, opened up trade again and offered a carrot and stick approach. If either France or Britain agreed to stop their violations of American neutrality, the United States would cut off trade with the other country. Tricked by French Emperor Napoleon into believing France had acceded to his demands, Madison turned his wrath on Britain and the War of 1812 began. Young Daniel Webster, running for Congress from New Hampshire in 1812, first gained overnight fame with his anti-war speeches.

===Slavery===
While some Federalists advocated strategic support for the Haitian Revolution, the Federalist press strongly condemned Gabriel&#x27;s Rebellion during the acrimonious presidential campaign of 1800 and claimed that &quot;Jefferson would liberate all Negroes if elected.&quot; Prominent southern Federalists, including John Marshall, Thomas Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Edward Rutledge, were slaveholders. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney successfully defended slavery at the Constitutional Convention and led the Federalist Party in the elections of 1804 and 1808. New York prior to 1799 and New Jersey prior to 1804 were slave states as well, and several leading northern Federalists from these states owned slaves, including John Jay and Philip Schuyler. Federalists supported the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793&#x27;s nearly unanimous passage through Congress, and the Federalist-aligned administration of George Washington signed the bill into law.

After 1800, as their political base contracted to New England, Federalists were increasingly opposed to slavery, both on principle and because the Three-fifths Compromise gave a political advantage to their opponents, who gained increased representation because of the weight given to disenfranchised enslaved people. Rufus King was a prominent opponent of slavery and became the final Federalist presidential candidate in 1816.

Recent scholarship has laid increasing emphasis on later Federalist opposition to slavery 
Day states

:The Federalist Party is currently undergoing a renaissance among historians of the early Republic. This development is based largely on their occasional criticism of slavery. As the Democratic Republicans&#x27; stock has fallen in response to rising concerns over their leader Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s racial views and deep entanglement with slavery, the Federalists who denounced Jefferson, the Republicans, and democracy itself have begun to look much better in comparison. While it has long been known that certain Federalist leaders—notably Alexander Hamilton and John Jay—opposed slavery and that attacks on slaveholding Virginia nabobs were part of the Federalist rhetorical arsenal after 1800, recent historians have found new significance in these facts.

However, Day argues that concerns about the political weight of the slaveholding states were more significant than moral opposition to slavery.

=== Madison administration ===
The nation was at war during the 1812 presidential election and war was the burning issue. Opposition to the war was strong in traditional Federalist strongholds in New England and New York, where the party made a comeback in the elections of 1812 and 1814. In their second national convention in 1812, the Federalists, now the peace party, nominated DeWitt Clinton, the dissident Republican Mayor of New York City and an articulate opponent of the war, who had followed his uncle George Clinton as the leader of the Clintonian faction after his death. Madison ran for reelection promising a relentless war against Britain and an honorable peace. Clinton, denouncing Madison&#x27;s weak leadership and incompetent preparations for war, could count on New England and New York. To win, he needed the middle states and there the campaign was fought out. Those states were competitive and had the best-developed local parties and most elaborate campaign techniques, including nominating conventions and formal party platforms. The Tammany Society in New York City highly favored Madison and the Federalists finally adopted the club idea in 1808. Their Washington Benevolent Societies were semi-secret membership organizations which played a critical role in every northern state as they held meetings and rallies and mobilized Federalist votes. New Jersey went for Clinton, but Madison carried Pennsylvania and thus was reelected with 59% of the electoral votes. However, the Federalists gained 14 seats in Congress.

== Opposition to the War of 1812 and decline ==
The War of 1812 went poorly for the Americans for two years. Even though Britain was concentrating its military efforts on its war with Napoleon, the United States still failed to make any headway on land and was effectively blockaded at sea by the Royal Navy. The British raided and burned Washington, D.C. in 1814 and sent a force to capture New Orleans.

The war was especially unpopular in New England. The New England economy was highly dependent on trade and the British blockade threatened to destroy it entirely. In 1814, the British Navy finally managed to enforce their blockade on the New England coast, so the Federalists of New England sent delegates to the Hartford Convention in December 1814.

During the proceedings of the Hartford Convention, secession from the Union was discussed, though the resulting report listed a set of grievances against the Democratic-Republican federal government and proposed a set of Constitutional amendments to address these grievances. They demanded financial assistance from Washington to compensate for lost trade and proposed constitutional amendments requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress before an embargo could be imposed, new states admitted, or war declared. It also indicated that if these proposals were ignored, then another convention should be called and given &quot;such powers and instructions as the exigency of a crisis may require&quot;. The Federalist Massachusetts Governor had already secretly sent word to England to broker a separate peace accord. Three Massachusetts &quot;ambassadors&quot; were sent to Washington to negotiate on the basis of this report.

By the time the Federalist &quot;ambassadors&quot; got to Washington, the war was over and news of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s stunning victory in the Battle of New Orleans had raised American morale immensely. The &quot;ambassadors&quot; hastened back to Massachusetts, but not before they had done fatal damage to the Federalist Party. The Federalists were thereafter associated with the disloyalty and parochialism of the Hartford Convention and destroyed as a political force. Across the nation, Republicans used the great victory at New Orleans to ridicule the Federalists as cowards, defeatists and secessionists. Pamphlets, songs, newspaper editorials, speeches and entire plays on the Battle of New Orleans drove home the point.

=== Federalist decline ===

The Federalists fielded their last presidential candidate, Rufus King in 1816. With the party&#x27;s passing, partisan hatreds and newspaper feuds declined and the nation entered the &quot;Era of Good Feelings&quot;. Federalism in states like Massachusetts gradually blended into the conservative wing of the Democratic-Republicans. In the 1824 presidential election, New Englanders from both parties supported Adams, a native of the region. However, a few old Federalist leaders, who never forgave Adams for abandoning them, formed a ticket of unpledged electors with radical Democratic-Republicans. This ticket was overwhelmingly defeated and likely would have voted for Crawford.

Following 1824, no Federalist ran for governor of any state and most left for the National Republicans. After the dissolution of the final Federalist congressional caucus in 1825, the last traces of Federalist activity came in Delaware and Massachusetts local politics in the late 1820s. In other states there still technically existed Federalists (for example James Buchanan) but they were engaged in patronage with either Jackson or Adams. In Massachusetts, the Federalist Party ceased to function as a state organization in 1825, surviving only as a local Boston group for the next three years. In Delaware, the Federalist Party lasted until 1826 and controlled the Delaware House of Representatives. When Daniel Webster, representative of Boston, resigned in 1827 to run for U.S. Senator, a caucus of Federalists met in Boston to nominate his replacement. A young William Lloyd Garrison persuaded the caucus to choose the Federalist Harrison Gray Otis, who ultimately declined. The caucus then nominated the Anti-Jacksonian Benjamin Gorham, their original choice.

In the 1828 presidential election, the Federalists were used as a scapegoat in Boston. The Democratic Boston &quot;Statesman&quot; accused Adams of being a secret Hartford Federalist attempting to revive the &quot;reign of terror&quot; under his father. Adams responded by accusing the old Hartford Federalists of treason and attempting to dissolve the union to form their own confederation. The &quot;Jackson Republican&quot;, an ally of the Statesman and founded by former Federalist Theodore Lyman II, implicated Webster among the old Federalists Adams intended to impugn, leading to a libel suit. As a protest against Adams, several &quot;Federal young men&quot; who had been supporting Adams nominated a Federalist ticket of presidential electors. This ticket, headed by Otis and William Prescott Jr. and including three other members of the Hartford Convention, garnered a pitiful 156 votes in Boston and none elsewhere in the state. As with the previous election, Adams swept the city and state.

That ticket, according to the best of knowledge of Samuel Eliot Morison, was &quot;the last ticket ever voted for that bore the name of the once powerful party of Washington and Hamilton.&quot;

== Interpretations ==
Intellectually, Federalists were profoundly devoted to liberty. As Samuel Eliot Morison explained, they believed that liberty is inseparable from union, that men are essentially unequal, that &quot;vox populi&quot; (&quot;voice of the people&quot;) is seldom if ever &quot;vox Dei&quot; (&quot;the voice of God&quot;) and that sinister outside influences are busy undermining American integrity. British historian Patrick Allitt concludes that Federalists promoted many positions that would form the baseline for later American conservatism, including the rule of law under the Constitution, republican government, peaceful change through elections, stable national finances, credible and active diplomacy and protection of wealth.

In terms of &quot;classical conservatism&quot;, the Federalists European-style aristocracy, monarchy, or established religion. Historian John P. Diggins says: &quot;Thanks to the framers, American conservatism began on a genuinely lofty plane. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, John Jay, James Wilson, and, above all, John Adams aspired to create a republic in which the values so precious to conservatives might flourish: harmony, stability, virtue, reverence, veneration, loyalty, self-discipline, and moderation. This was classical conservatism in its most authentic expression&quot;.

Federalists led the successful battles to abolish the international slave trade in New York City and the battle to abolish slavery in the state of New York. The Federalists&#x27; approach to nationalism was coined &quot;open&quot; nationalism in that it creates space for minority groups to have a voice in government. Many Federalists also created space for women to have a significant political role, which was not evident on the Democratic-Republican side.

The Federalists were dominated by businessmen and merchants in the major cities who supported a strong national government. The party was closely linked to the modernizing, urbanizing, financial policies of Alexander Hamilton. These policies included the funding of the national debt and also assumption of state debts incurred during the Revolutionary War, the incorporation of a national Bank of the United States, the support of manufactures and industrial development, and the use of a tariff to fund the Treasury. While it has long been accepted that commercial groups are in support of the Federalists and agrarian groups are in support of the Democratic-Republicans, recent studies have shown that support for Federalists was also evident in agrarian groups. In foreign affairs, the Federalists opposed the French Revolution, engaged in the &quot;Quasi War&quot; (an undeclared naval war) with France in 1798–99, sought good relations with Britain and sought a strong army and navy. Ideologically, the controversy between Democratic-Republicans and Federalists stemmed from a difference of principle and style. In terms of style, the Federalists feared mob rule, thought an educated elite should represent the general populace in national governance and favored national power over state power. Democratic-Republicans distrusted Britain, bankers, merchants and did not want a powerful national government. The Federalists, notably Hamilton, were distrustful of &quot;the people&quot;, the French and the Republicans. In the end, the nation synthesized the two positions, adopting representative democracy and a strong nation state. Just as importantly, American politics by the 1820s accepted the two-party system whereby rival parties stake their claims before the electorate and the winner takes control of majority in state legislatures and the Congress and gains governorships and the presidency.

As time went on, the Federalists lost appeal with the average voter and were generally not equal to the tasks of party organization; hence they grew steadily weaker as the political triumphs of the Democratic-Republican Party grew. For economic and philosophical reasons, the Federalists tended to be pro-British—the United States engaged in more trade with Great Britain than with any other country—and vociferously opposed Jefferson&#x27;s Embargo Act of 1807 and the seemingly deliberate provocation of war with Britain by the Madison Administration. During &quot;Mr. Madison&#x27;s War&quot;, as they called it, the Federalists made a temporary comeback. However, they lost all their gains and more during the patriotic euphoria that followed the war. The membership was aging rapidly, but a few young men from New England did join the cause, most notably Daniel Webster.

After 1816, the Federalists had no national power base apart from John Marshall&#x27;s Supreme Court. They had some local support in New England, New York, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. After the collapse of the Federalist Party in the course of the 1824 presidential election, most surviving Federalists (including Daniel Webster) joined former Democratic-Republicans like Henry Clay to form the National Republican Party, which was soon combined with other anti-Jackson groups to form the Whig Party in 1833. By then, nearly all remaining Federalists joined the Whigs. However, some former Federalists like James Buchanan, Louis McLane and Roger B. Taney became Jacksonian Democrats.

The &quot;Old Republicans&quot;, led by John Randolph of Roanoke, refused to form a coalition with the Federalists and instead set up a separate opposition since Jefferson, Madison, Gallatin, Monroe, John C. Calhoun and Clay had in effect adopted Federalist principles of implied powers to purchase the Louisiana Territory and after the failures and lessons of the War of 1812 raised tariffs to protect factories, chartered the Second National Bank, promoted a strong army and navy and promoted internal improvements. All these measures were opposed to the strict construction of the Constitution, which was the formal basis of the Democratic-Republicans, but the drift of the party to support them could not be checked. It was aided by the Supreme Court, whose influence under John Marshall as a nationalizing factor now first became apparent. The whole change reconciled the Federalists to their absorption into the Democratic-Republican Party. Indeed, they claimed, with considerable show of justice, that the absorption was in the other direction: that the Democratic-Republicans had recanted and that the &quot;Washington-Monroe policy&quot;, as they termed it after 1820, was all that Federalists had ever desired.

The name &quot;Federalist&quot; came increasingly to be used in political rhetoric as a term of abuse and was denied by the Whigs, who pointed out that their leader Henry Clay was the Democratic-Republican Party leader in Congress during the 1810s.

The Federalists had a weak base in the South, with their main base in the Northeast and especially New England, although there were some prominent southern Federalists like Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who had been supported by Hamilton in the presidential election of 1800.

== Electoral history ==
=== Presidential elections ===

=== Congressional representation ===
The affiliation of many Congressmen in the earliest years is an assignment by later historians. The parties were slowly coalescing groups; at first there were many independents. Cunningham noted that only about a quarter of the House of Representatives up until 1794 voted with Madison as much as two-thirds of the time and another quarter against him two-thirds of the time, leaving almost half as fairly independent.
