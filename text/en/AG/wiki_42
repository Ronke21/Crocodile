<text>The Screwtape Letters is a Christian apologetic novel by C. S. Lewis and dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien. It is written in a satirical, epistolary style and, while it is fictional in format, the plot and characters are used to address Christian theological issues, primarily those to do with temptation and resistance to it.

First published in February 1942, the story takes the form of a series of letters from a senior devil, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, a junior tempter. The uncle&#x27;s mentorship pertains to the nephew&#x27;s responsibility in securing the damnation of a British man known only as &quot;the Patient&quot;.

By 1999, the novel had 26 English and 15 German editions, with around half a million copies sold.

== Summary ==
In &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;, Lewis imagines a series of lessons on the importance of taking a deliberate role in Christian faith by portraying a typical human life, with all its temptations and failings, seen from devils&#x27; viewpoints. Screwtape holds an administrative post in the bureaucracy (&quot;Lowerarchy&quot;) of Hell. Until the book&#x27;s final pages, Screwtape acts as a mentor to his nephew Wormwood, an inexperienced and incompetent tempter.

In the 31 letters which compose the book, Screwtape gives Wormwood detailed advice on various methods of undermining God&#x27;s words and of promoting abandonment of God in &quot;the Patient&quot; (whom Wormwood is tempting), interspersed with observations on human nature and the Bible. In Screwtape&#x27;s advice, selfish gain and power are seen as the only good, and neither devil can comprehend God&#x27;s love for man or acknowledge human virtue.

Versions of the letters were originally published weekly in the Anglican periodical &quot;The Guardian&quot; during wartime, from May to November 1941. The book adds an introduction explaining how the author chose to write his story.

Lewis wrote a sequel, &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot;, in 1959. The satirical essay criticizes trends in British society, education, and public attitudes. The essay was included, with a new preface by Lewis, in editions of &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; published by Bles in 1961 and by Macmillan in 1962.

&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; became one of Lewis&#x27; most popular works, although he said it was &quot;not fun&quot; to write and &quot;resolved never to write another &#x27;Letter&quot;.

Both &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; and &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; were released on audio cassette and CD, with narrations by John Cleese, Joss Ackland, and Ralph Cosham. Cleese&#x27;s recording was a Grammy Awards Finalist for Best Spoken Word.

== Plot overview ==
&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; consists of 31 letters written by a senior devil named Screwtape to his nephew, Wormwood (named after a star in the Book of Revelation), a younger and less experienced devil, charged with guiding a man called &quot;the Patient&quot; toward &quot;Our Father Below&quot; (Satan), and away from &quot;the Enemy&quot; (God).

After the first letter, the Patient converts to Christianity, and Wormwood is chastised for allowing this. A striking contrast is formed between Wormwood and Screwtape during the rest of the book, wherein Wormwood is depicted through Screwtape&#x27;s letters as anxious to tempt his patient into extravagantly wicked and deplorable sins, often recklessly, while Screwtape takes a more subtle stance, as in Letter XII, wherein he remarks: &quot;... the safest road to hell is the gradual one – the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.&quot;

In Letter VIII, Screwtape explains to his protégé the different purposes that God and the devils have for the human race: &quot;We want cattle who can finally become food; He wants servants who can finally become sons.&quot; With this end in mind, Screwtape urges Wormwood in Letter VI to promote passivity and irresponsibility in the Patient: &quot;(God) wants men to be concerned with what they do; our business is to keep them thinking about what will happen to them.&quot;

With his own views on theology, Lewis goes on to describe and discuss sex, love, pride, gluttony, and war in successive letters. Lewis, an Oxford and Cambridge scholar himself, suggests in his work that even intellectuals are not impervious to the influence of such devils, especially during complacent acceptance of the &quot;Historical Point of View&quot; (Letter XXVII).

In Letter XXII, after several attempts to find a licentious woman for the Patient &quot;to promote a useful marriage&quot;, and after Screwtape&#x27;s narrowly avoiding a painful punishment for having divulged to Wormwood God&#x27;s genuine love for humanity (about which Wormwood had promptly informed the Infernal authorities), Screwtape notes that the Patient has fallen in love with a Christian girl, and through her and her family, had adopted a very Christian way of life. Toward the end of this letter, in his anger, Screwtape becomes a large centipede, mimicking a similar transformation in Book X of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, wherein the devils are changed into snakes. Later in the correspondence, it is revealed that the young man may be placed in harm&#x27;s way by his possible civil defence duties (it is stated in an earlier letter that he is eligible for military service, but it is never actually confirmed that he was indeed called). While Wormwood is delighted with this and by the Second World War in general, Screwtape admonishes Wormwood to keep the Patient safe in hopes that they can compromise his faith over a long lifetime.

In the last letter, the Patient has been killed during the Blitz and has gone to Heaven, and for his ultimate failure, Wormwood is doomed to suffer the consumption of his spiritual essence by the other devils, especially by Screwtape himself. He responds to Wormwood&#x27;s final letter by saying that he may expect as little assistance as Screwtape would expect from Wormwood were their situations reversed (&quot;My love for you and your love for me are as alike as two peas ... The difference is that I am the stronger&quot;), mimicking the situation where Wormwood himself reported his uncle to the Infernal Police for Infernal Heresy (making a religiously positive remark that would offend Satan).

Screwtape starts every letter with &quot;My dear Wormwood&quot;, except the last letter, which sarcastically says, &quot;My dear, my very dear Wormwood; my poppet, my .&quot;

== Literary sequels ==
=== &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; ===
The short sequel &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; (1959), first published as an article in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, is an addendum to &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;; the two works are often published together as one book. The sequel takes the form of an after-dinner speech given by Screwtape at the Tempters&#x27; Training College for young devils. In stage adaptations it is sometimes added as a prelude, making the work a prequel. &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; is Lewis&#x27; criticism of leveling and featherbedding trends in public education; more specifically, as he reveals in the foreword to the American edition, public education in America (though in the text, it is English education that is held up as the purportedly awful example).

The Cold War opposition between the West and the Communist World is explicitly discussed as a backdrop to the educational issues. Screwtape and other devils are portrayed as consciously using the subversion of education and intellectual thought in the West to bring about its overthrow by the communist enemy from without and within. In this sense &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; is more strongly political than &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;, wherein no strong stand is made on political issues of the day, such as World War II.

=== Other literary sequels ===
Though C. S. Lewis had resolved not to write another letter, and only revisited the character of Screwtape once, in &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot;, the format, referred to by Lewis himself as a kind of &quot;diabolical ventriloquism&quot;, has inspired other authors to prepare sequels or similar works, such as:

* Breig, Joseph A. (1952). &quot;The Devil You Say&quot;.
* 
* Wormwood, who has somehow survived, now finds himself in a new era writing to his own nephew, Soulsniper.
* Fejfar, Antony J. (2004). &quot;The Screwtape Emails: An Allegory&quot;.
* Another Wormwood series of instructions.
* 
* Longenecker, Dwight (2009). &quot;The Gargoyle Code: Lenten Letters between a Master Tempter and his diabolical Trainee&quot;. . Master Tempter Slubgrip advises Dogwart how to corrupt a young Catholic, while struggling to control his own &#x27;patient.&#x27;
* The Archangel Michael provides advice to Jacob, a guardian angel.
* Andrews, Pat. (2014). &quot;E-mails from Hell: An Homage and Update to C.S. Lewis&quot;.
* Aldridge, R.J. (2019). &quot;The Wormwood Emails: Inside Tips on Avoiding Hell&quot;.
* The tempters are working in a Texas prison to keep The Inmate on the wide and easy road to their home below.

== Adaptations ==
=== Stage adaptations ===
The stage play &quot;Dear Wormwood&quot; (later renamed &quot;Screwtape&quot;), written by James Forsyth, was published in 1961. The setting is changed to wartime London, where we actually see Wormwood going about the business of tempting his &quot;patient&quot; (in the play, given the name &quot;Michael Green&quot;). The ending is changed as well, with Wormwood trying to repent and beg for forgiveness, when it appears that his mission has failed. &quot;Dear Wormwood&quot; premiered in Luther High School North, Chicago in April, 1961.

Philadelphia playwright and actor Anthony Lawton&#x27;s original adaptation of &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; has been staged several times since 2000 by Lantern Theater Company, most recently in May/June 2014. In Lawton&#x27;s adaptation, each of Screwtape&#x27;s letters is punctuated by varied dances including tap, Latin ballroom, jazz, martial arts, and rock – and whips and fire-eating. Screwtape performs these dances with his secretary, Toadpipe.

The Fellowship for the Performing Arts obtained from the Lewis estate the rights to adapt &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; for the stage. The initial production opened off-off-Broadway at Theatre 315 in New York City in January 2006. The initial three-week run was extended to eleven and finally closed because the theater was contractually obligated to another production. It was co-written by Max McLean (who also starred) and Jeffrey Fiske (who also directed). In this production, there are two characters - Screwtape and Toadpipe, the latter who is played by a female. A second, expanded production opened off-Broadway at the Theatre at St. Clements on 18 October 2007, originally scheduled to run through 6 January 2008. The production re-opened at the Mercury Theater in Chicago in September 2008, and continued on a national tour including San Francisco, Phoenix, Louisville, Chattanooga, Fort Lauderdale, Houston and Austin, through January 2010 as well as playing at The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. for ten weeks. &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; played for 309 performances at New York City&#x27;s Westside Theatre in 2010. The 2011 tour visited performing arts venues in cities throughout the United States including Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Boston. The 2012–2013 tour began in Los Angeles in January 2012, with return engagements in San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Chicago and Atlanta as well as stops in several other cities. &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; has been described as &quot;Humorous and lively ... the Devil has rarely been given his due more perceptively!&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;A profound experience&quot; by &quot;Christianity Today&quot; and &quot;Wickedly witty ... One hell of a good show!&quot; by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The production has also toured worldwide.

In some productions, the role of Screwtape has been performed by a woman.

The Barley Sheaf Players of Lionville, Pennsylvania performed James Forsyth&#x27;s play &quot;Screwtape&quot; in September 2010. It was directed by Scott Ryan and the play ran the last three weekends in September. The production was reviewed by Paul Recupero for &quot;Stage Magazine&quot;.

=== Comic book adaptation ===
Marvel Comics and religious book publisher Thomas Nelson produced a comic book adaptation of &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; in 1994.

=== Audio drama ===
Focus on the Family Radio Theatre was granted the rights to dramatize &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; as a feature-length audio drama. Production began in 2008, and the product was released in the fall of 2009. Andy Serkis, known for playing Gollum in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, provided the voice for Screwtape, with Bertie Carvel as Wormwood, Philip Bird as The Patient (identified in this production as &quot;John Hamilton&quot;), Laura Michelle Kelly as The Girl (identified in this production as &quot;Dorothy&quot;), Roger Hammond as Toadpipe, Christina Greatrex as Slumtrimpet, Janet Henfrey as Glubose, Eileen Page as John Hamilton&#x27;s mother, Susie Brann as Viv Brett, Robert Benfield as Noel Brett, and Geoffrey Palmer as C.S. Lewis. There is a 7-and-a-half minute video preview of the Radio Theatre production with interviews and making-of footage. This production was a 2010 Audie Awards finalist.

=== Annotated Screwtape Letters ===
An annotated edition of &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; was released in 2013 by HarperOne. Paul McCusker, who adapted the book for Focus on the Family&#x27;s audio drama, wrote the footnotes. McCusker does not provide any theological commentary or interpretation, but instead clarifies vocabulary, literary passages and customs which might not be immediately clear to the modern reader. He also cross-references passages to Lewis&#x27; other works dealing with particular subjects.

== In popular culture ==
=== Comics ===
In &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, Bill Watterson named Miss Wormwood (Calvin&#x27;s elementary school teacher) after Lewis&#x27; apprentice devil.

=== Documentary ===
&quot;Affectionately Yours, Screwtape: The Devil and C.S. Lewis&quot; (January 1, 2007), directed by Tom Dallis and written by Amy Dallis, aired on the History Channel.

=== Literature ===
In 2010, the &quot;Marine Corps Gazette&quot; began publishing a series of articles entitled &quot;The Attritionist Letters&quot; styled in the manner of &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;. In the letters, General Screwtape chastises Captain Wormwood for his inexperience and naivete while denouncing the concepts of maneuver warfare in favor of attrition warfare.

Writer David Foster Wallace praised the book in interviews and placed it first on his list of top ten favorite books.

=== Music ===
Called to Arms&#x27; concept album &quot;Peril and the Patient&quot; (August 10, 2010) is based entirely on &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;.

In U2&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; (1995), an animated Bono is seen walking down the street holding the book &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;. While on stage during the Zoo TV Tour Bono would dress as Mr. MacPhisto, his alter ego. Bono would wear a gold suit and devil horns and usually make prank calls to politicians.

The lyrics for The Receiving End of Sirens&#x27; song &quot;Oubliette (Disappear)&quot;, from the album &quot;The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi&quot; (2007), were inspired by a passage from &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;.

In the Christian metal band Living Sacrifice&#x27;s album &quot;Ghost Thief&quot;, there is a track titled &quot;Screwtape&quot;. Frontman Bruce Fitzhugh explained that the song is &quot;about temptation and the proverbial &#x27;devil on your shoulder.&#x27; It&#x27;s about the thought process we go through to justify a thought or action that is not good for the soul&quot;. Fitzhugh also explains how he thought it was interesting Lewis wrote from the perspective of Screwtape and that he wrote from the same perspective in the song.

The group The Oh Hellos released the album &quot;Dear Wormwood&quot;, which they have described as a form of speculative fiction from the point of view of &quot;the patient&quot;.

The three-part song &quot;Salt (in the Wounds) of the Earth&quot; on the 2021 album &quot;Laysongs&quot; by mandolinist Chris Thile was inspired by &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;.

David Bazan references the book in the lyrics of the title track of the 2024 Pedro the Lion album &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;.

===Political discourse===
President of the United States Ronald Reagan quoted from &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; in his 1983 speech to the National Association of Evangelicals.

Antonin Scalia, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States appointed by Reagan, had professed his admiration for the book. In a 2013 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Scalia remarked: &quot;&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is a great book. It really is, just as a study of human nature.&quot; The book was mentioned in the highly publicized interview during Scalia&#x27;s discourse regarding the nature of his Catholic faith.

<text>The tree of life is a fundamental archetype in many of the world&#x27;s mythological, religious, and philosophical traditions. It is closely related to the concept of the sacred tree. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life which appear in Genesis&#x27; Garden of Eden as part of the Jewish cosmology of creation, and the tree of knowledge connecting to heaven and the underworld such as Yggdrasil, are forms of the world tree or cosmic tree, and are portrayed in various religions and philosophies as the same tree.
==Religion and mythology==

Various trees of life are recounted in folklore, culture and fiction, often relating to immortality or fertility. They had their origin in religious symbolism. According to professor Elvyra Usačiovaitė, a &quot;typical&quot; imagery preserved in ancient iconography is that of two symmetrical figures facing each other, with a tree standing in the middle. The two characters may variously represent rulers, gods, and even a deity and a human follower.

===Ancient Mesopotamia===

The Assyrian tree of life was represented by a series of nodes and crisscrossing lines. It was apparently an important religious symbol, often attended to in Assyrian palace reliefs by human or eagle-headed winged genies, or the King, and blessed or fertilized with bucket and cone. Assyriologists have not reached consensus as to the meaning of this symbol. The name &quot;Tree of Life&quot; has been attributed to it by modern scholarship; it is not used in the Assyrian sources. In fact, no textual evidence pertaining to the symbol is known to exist.
The &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; is a similar quest for immortality. In Babylonian religion, Etana, the King of Kish, searched for a &#x27;plant of birth&#x27; to provide him with a son. This has a solid provenance of antiquity, being found in cylinder seals from the Akkadian Empire (2390–2249 BCE).

The tree of life appears in Asherah iconography, particularly on the Lachish ewer and Pithos A from Kuntillet Ajrud, where it is flanked by ibexes. The tree’s design, with buds, flowers, and possibly almond drupes, resembles the menorah, which is thought to represent a stylized almond tree in Exodus 25:31-36 This suggests a continuation of Asherah’s cultic representation in the temple. Scholars have explored these connections, noting parallels between sacred trees, Asherah, and the menorah.

====Urartu====
In Urartu in the Armenian highlands, the tree of life was a religious symbol and was drawn on walls of fortresses and carved on the armor of warriors. The branches of the tree were equally divided on the right and left sides of the stem, with each branch having one leaf, and one leaf on the apex of the tree. Servants stood on each side of the tree with one of their hands up as if they are taking care of the tree.

===Ancient Iran===
In the Avestan literature and Iranian mythology, there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, such as Amesha Spenta; Ameretat, the guardian of plants and goddess of trees and immortality; Gaokerena or white haoma, a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in the universe; the bas tokhmak, a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow; Mashya and Mashyana, the parents of the human race; barsom, copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz (&quot;Tamarix gallica&quot;), or haoma that Zoroastrians use in their rituals; and haoma, a plant, unknown today, that was the source of sacred potable.

The Gaokerena is a large, sacred haoma planted by Ahura Mazda. Ahriman created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, Ahura Mazda created two kar-fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Ahriman is responsible for all evil including death; Ahura Mazda is responsible for all good (including life).

Haoma is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds. The tree is considerably diverse.

Haoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit soma. The identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism.

Another related issue in ancient mythology of Iran is the myth of Mashya and Mashyana, two trees that were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the creation myth where living beings are created by Gods.

===Hinduism===
A genre of the sacred books of Hinduism, the Puranas, mention a divine tree called the Kalpavriksha. This divine tree is guarded by gandharvas in the garden of the mythological city of Amaravati under the control of Indra, the king of the devas. In one story, for a very long time, the devas and the asuras decided to churn the milky ocean to obtain amrita, the nectar of immortality, and share it equally. During the churning, along with many other mythical items, emerged the Kalpavriksha. It is described to be gold in colour and bear a mesmerising aura. It is said to be pleased with chanting and offers: when it is pleased, it grants every wish. Hindu tradition holds that there are five separate kalpavrikshas and each of them grant different types of wishes. These trees also appear in the beliefs of Jainism.

===Chinese mythology===
In Chinese mythology, a carving of a tree of life depicts a phoenix and a dragon; the dragon often represents immortality. A Taoist story tells of a tree that produces a peach of immortality every three thousand years, and anyone who eats the fruit receives immortality.

An archaeological discovery in the 1990s was of a sacrificial pit at Sanxingdui in Sichuan, China. Dating from about 1200 BCE, it contained three bronze trees, one of them 4 meters high. At the base was a dragon, and fruit hanging from the lower branches. At the top is a bird-like (Phoenix) creature with claws. Also found in Sichuan, from the late Han dynasty (c. 25–220 CE), is another tree of life. The ceramic base is guarded by a horned beast with wings. The leaves of the tree represent coins and people. At the apex is a bird with coins and the Sun.

===Christianity===
The tree of life first appears in Genesis 2:9 and 3:22–24 as the source of eternal life in the Garden of Eden, from which access is revoked when man is driven from the garden. It then reappears in the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation, and most predominantly in the last chapter of that book (Chapter 22) as a part of the new garden of paradise. Access is then no longer forbidden, for those who &quot;wash their robes&quot; (or as the textual variant in the King James Version has it, &quot;they that do his commandments&quot;) &quot;have right to the tree of life&quot; (v. 14). A similar statement appears in Rev 2:7, where the tree of life is promised as a reward to those who overcome. Revelation 22 begins with a reference to the &quot;pure river of water of life&quot; which proceeds &quot;out of the throne of God&quot;. The river seems to feed two trees of life, one &quot;on either side of the river&quot; which &quot;bear twelve manner of fruits&quot; &quot;and the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations&quot; (v. 1–2). Alternatively, this may indicate that the tree of life is a vine that grows on both sides of the river, as John 15:1 would hint at.

Pope Benedict XVI has said that &quot;the Cross is the true tree of life.&quot; Saint Bonaventure taught that the medicinal fruit of the tree of life is Christ himself. Saint Albert the Great taught that the Eucharist, the Body and Blood of Christ, is the Fruit of the Tree of Life. Augustine of Hippo said that the tree of life is Christ:
In Eastern Christianity the tree of life is the love of God.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

The tree of life vision is described and discussed in the Book of Mormon. According to the Book of Mormon, the vision was received in a dream by the prophet Lehi, and later in a vision by his son Nephi, who wrote about it in the First Book of Nephi. The vision includes a path leading to a tree, the fruit of the tree symbolizing the love of God, with an iron rod, symbolizing the word of God, along the path whereby followers of Jesus may hold to the rod and avoid wandering off the path into pits or waters symbolizing the ways of sin. The vision also includes a large building wherein the wicked look down at the righteous and mock them.

The vision is said to symbolize love of Christ and the way to eternal life and is a well known and cited story with members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A member of the church reflected that the vision is &quot;one of the richest, most flexible, and far-reaching pieces of symbolic prophecy contained in the standard works [scriptures].&quot;

====Nag Hammadi Gnosticism====
Different views on the Tree of life can be found in the Nag Hammadi library codices, writings belonging to Gnosticism. In On the Origin of the World, the Tree of Life is said to be located to the north of paradise, providing life to the innocent saints who will come out of their material bodies during what is called the consummation of the age. The color of the tree is described as resembling the Sun, its branches are beautiful, its leaves are similar to that of cypress, and its fruit is like clusters of white grapes. However, in the Secret Book of John, the Tree of Life is portrayed negatively. Its roots are described as bitter, its branches are death, its shadow is hatred, a trap is found in its leaves, its seed is desire, and it blossoms in the darkness.

===Manichaeism===

In the Gnostic religion Manichaeism, the Tree of Life helped Adam obtain the knowledge (gnosis) necessary for salvation and is identified as an image of Jesus.

===Europe===
In Greek mythology, Hera is gifted a branch growing golden apples by her grandmother Gaia, which are then planted in Hera&#x27;s Garden of the Hesperides. The dragon Ladon guards the tree(s) from all who would take the apples. The three golden apples that Aphrodite gave to Hippomenes to distract Atalanta three times during their footrace allowed him to win Atalanta&#x27;s hand in marriage. Though it is not specified in ancient myth, many assume that Aphrodite gathered those apples from Hera&#x27;s tree(s). Eris stole one of these apples and carved the words ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ, &quot;to the fairest&quot;, upon it to create the Apple of Discord. Heracles retrieved three of the apples as the eleventh of his Twelve Labors. The Garden of the Hesperides is often compared to Eden, the golden apples are compared to the forbidden fruit of the tree in Genesis, and Ladon is often compared to the snake in Eden, all of which is part of why the forbidden fruit of Eden is usually represented as an apple in European art, even though Genesis does not specifically name nor describe &quot;any&quot; characteristics of the fruit.
In &quot;Dictionnaire Mytho-Hermetique&quot; (Paris, 1737), Antoine-Joseph Pernety, a famous alchemist, identified the tree of life with the Elixir of life and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.

In &quot;Eden in the East&quot; (1998), Stephen Oppenheimer suggests that a tree-worshipping culture arose in Indonesia and was diffused by the so-called &quot;Younger Dryas&quot; event of c. 10,900 BCE or 12,900 BP, after which the sea level rose. This culture reached China (Sichuan), then India and the Middle East. Finally the Finno-Ugric strand of this diffusion spread through Russia to Finland where the Norse myth of Yggdrasil took root.

===Georgia===
The Borjgali () is an ancient Georgian tree of life symbol.

===Germanic paganism and Norse mythology===
In Germanic paganism, trees played (and, in the form of reconstructive Heathenry and Germanic Neopaganism, continue to play) a prominent role, appearing in various aspects of surviving texts and possibly in the name of gods.

The tree of life appears in Norse religion as &quot;Yggdrasil&quot;, the world tree, a massive tree (sometimes considered a yew or ash tree) with extensive lore surrounding it. Perhaps related to Yggdrasil, accounts have survived of Germanic Tribes honouring sacred trees within their societies. Examples include Thor&#x27;s Oak, sacred groves, the Sacred tree at Uppsala, and the wooden Irminsul pillar. In Norse Mythology, the apples from Iðunn&#x27;s ash box provide immortality for the gods.

===Islam===

The &quot;Tree of Immortality&quot; () is the tree of life motif as it appears in the Quran. It is also alluded to in hadiths and tafsir. Unlike the biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, also called &quot; the tree of immortality and power that never decays&quot;, which God specifically forbade to Adam and Eve.

The tree in Quran is used as an example of a concept, idea, way of life or code of life. A good concept/idea is represented as a good tree and a bad idea/concept is represented as a bad tree Muslims believe that when God created Adam and Eve, he told them that they could enjoy everything in the Garden except this tree (idea, concept, way of life).Satan appeared to them and told them that the only reason God forbade them to eat from that tree was that they would become angels or they start using the idea/concept of Ownership in conjunction with inheritance generations after generations which Iblis convinced Adam to accept

When Adam and Eve ate from this tree their nakedness appeared to them and they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden.

The hadiths also speak about other trees in heaven. 

The tree of life in Islamic architecture is a type of biomorphic pattern found in many artistic traditions. It is considered to be any vegetal pattern with a clear origin or growth. The pattern in al-Azhar Mosque, Cairo&#x27;s mihrab, a unique Fatimid architectural variation, is a series of two or three leave palmettes with a central palmette of five leaves from which the pattern originates. The growth is upwards and outwards and culminates in a lantern like flower towards the top of the niche above which is a small roundel. The curvature of the niche accentuates the undulating movement which despite its complexity is symmetrical along its vertical axis. The representations of varying palm leaves hints to spiritual growth attained through prayer while the upwards and side wards movement of the leaves speaks to the different motions of the worshiper while in salah.

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Indian Ahmadiyya movement founded in 1889, Quranic reference to the tree is symbolic; eating of the forbidden tree signifies that Adam disobeyed God.

===Jewish sources===
 (), Hebrew for &quot;tree of life,&quot; appears in the Book of Genesis and is part of the story of the creation of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Thus the term is a common term used in Judaism. The expression, found in the Book of Proverbs, is figuratively applied to the Torah itself. is also a common name for yeshivas and synagogues as well as for works of Rabbinic literature. It is also used to describe each of the wooden poles to which the parchment of a Sefer Torah is attached.

The tree of life is mentioned in the Book of Genesis; it is distinct from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. After Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were driven out of the Garden of Eden. Remaining in the garden, however, was the tree of life. To prevent their access to this tree in the future, Cherubim with a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden.

In the Book of Proverbs, the tree of life is associated with wisdom: &quot;[Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy &quot;[is every one]&quot; that retaineth her.&quot; In Proverbs 15:4, the tree of life is associated with calmness: &quot;A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit.&quot;

In the Ashkenazic liturgy, the Eitz Chayim is a piyyut commonly sung as the Sefer Torah is returned to the Torah ark.

The Book of Enoch, generally considered non-canonical, states that in the time of the great judgment, God will give all those whose names are in the Book of Life fruit to eat from the tree of life. 

====Kabbalah====

Jewish mysticism depicts the tree of life in the form of ten interconnected nodes, as the central symbol of the Kabbalah. It comprises the ten powers in the divine realm. The panentheistic and anthropomorphic emphasis of this emanationist theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, and the purpose of Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the , restoring harmony to Creation.

From the Renaissance onwards, Kabbalah became incorporated as tradition in Christian Western esotericism as Hermetic Qabalah.

===Mandaeism===
Mandaean scrolls often include abstract illustrations of trees of life that represent the living, interconnected nature of the cosmos. One of these trees is given the name of Shatrin.

===Mesoamerica===
The concept of world trees is a prevalent motif in the Mesoamerican cosmovision and iconography, appearing in the pre-Columbian era. World trees embody the four cardinal directions, which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic &quot;axis mundi&quot; connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.

Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the Maya, Aztec, Izapan, Mixtec, Olmec, and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of the Mesoamerican chronology. The tomb of Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal of the Maya city-state of Palenque, who became its ajaw or leader when he was twelve years old, has tree of life inscriptions within the walls of his burial place, showing just how important it was. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; and is known variously as a &quot;wacah chan&quot; or &quot;yax imix che&quot; in different Mayan languages.

The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright caiman, whose skin evokes the tree&#x27;s spiny trunk.

Directional world trees are also associated with the four Year Bearers in Mesoamerican calendars and associated with the directional colors and deities. Mesoamerican codices which have this association outlined include the Dresden, Borgia and Fejérváry-Mayer codices. It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.

World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water, sometimes atop a &quot;water-monster,&quot; symbolic of the underworld. The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the Milky Way.

===Northern America===
In a myth passed down among the Iroquois, &quot;The World on the Turtle&#x27;s Back&quot;, explains the origin of the land in which a tree of life is described. According to the myth, it is found in the heavens, where the first humans lived, until a pregnant woman fell and landed in an endless sea. Saved by a giant turtle from drowning, she formed the world on its back by planting bark taken from the tree.

The tree of life motif is present in the traditional Ojibway cosmology and traditions. It is sometimes described as Grandmother Cedar, or in Anishinaabemowin.

In the book Black Elk Speaks, Black Elk, an Oglala Lakota (Sioux) (medicine man and holy man), describes his vision in which after dancing around a dying tree that has never bloomed he is transported to the other world (spirit world) where he meets wise elders, 12 men and 12 women. The elders tell Black Elk that they will bring him to meet &quot;Our Father, the two-legged chief&quot; and bring him to the center of a hoop where he sees the tree in full leaf and bloom and the &quot;chief&quot; standing against the tree. Coming out of his trance he hopes to see that the earthly tree has bloomed, but it is dead.

The Oneidas tell that supernatural beings lived in the Skyworld above the waters which covered the earth. This tree was covered with fruits which gave them their light, and they were instructed that no one should cut into the tree otherwise a great punishment would be given. As the woman had pregnancy cravings, she sent her husband to get bark, but he accidentally dug a hole to the other world. After falling through, she came to rest on the turtle&#x27;s back, and four animals were sent out to find land, which the muskrat finally did.

=== Serer religion ===
In Serer religion, the tree of life as a religious concept forms the basis of Serer cosmogony. Trees were the first things created on Earth by the supreme being Roog (&quot;Koox&quot; among the Cangin). In the competing versions of the Serer creation myth, the &quot;Somb&quot; (&quot;Anonychium africana&quot;) and the &quot;Saas&quot; tree (Faidherbia albida) are both viewed as trees of life. However, the prevailing view is that, the &quot;Somb&quot; was the first tree on Earth and the progenitor of plant life. The &quot;Somb&quot; was also used in the Serer tumuli and burial chambers, many of which have survived for more than a thousand years. Thus, &quot;Somb&quot; is not only the tree of life in Serer society but the symbol of immortality.

===Turkic===
The tree of life connects the upper world, middle world and underworld. It is also imagined as the &quot;white creator lord&quot; (yryn-al-tojon), thus synonymous with the creator deity, giving rise to different worlds.

The world tree or tree of life is an important symbol in Turkic mythology. It is a common motif in carpets. It is used in the logo of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey) and in 2009 it was introduced as the main design of the common Turkish lira sub-unit 5 kuruş.

Tree of life is known as &quot;Ulukayın&quot; or &quot;Baiterek&quot; in Turkic communities. It is a sacred beech tree planted by Kayra Han. Sometimes, it is considered axis mundi.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The concept of the tree of life appears in the writings of the Baháʼí Faith, where it can refer to the Manifestation of God, a great teacher who appears to humanity from age to age. An example of this can be found in the &quot;Hidden Words&quot; of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh:

Also, in the &quot;Tablet of Ahmad&quot; of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh: &quot;Verily He is the Tree of Life, that bringeth forth the fruits of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great&quot;.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh refers to his male descendants as branches ( &quot;ʾaghṣān&quot;) and calls women leaves.

A distinction has been made between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The latter represents the physical world with its opposites, such as good and evil and light and dark. In a different context from the one above, the tree of life represents the spiritual realm, where this duality does not exist.

==In art and film==
Austrian symbolist artist Gustav Klimt portrayed his version of the tree of life in his painting, &quot;The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze&quot;. This iconic painting later inspired the external facade of the &quot;New Residence Hall&quot; (also called the &quot;Tree House&quot;), a colorful 21-story student residence hall at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston, Massachusetts.

Alex Proyas&#x27; 2009 film &quot;Knowing&quot; ends with the two young protagonists directed towards the tree of life.

The 2006 Darren Aronofsky film &quot;The Fountain&quot; features the Judeo-Christian tree of life as a major plot element in its non-linear narrative. In Central America during the Age of Discovery, it is the sought-after object of a Spanish conquistador, who believes its gift of eternal life will free Spain and its queen from the tyranny of a religious inquisition. In the present day, a sample from what is implied to be the same tree of life is used by a medical researcher—who seeks a cure for his ailing wife—to develop a serum that reverses the biological aging process. In the distant future, a space traveler (implied to be the same man from the present) uses the last vestiges of a tree&#x27;s bark (again, implied to be the same tree of life) to keep himself alive as he journeys to Xibalba, a fictional dying star lying inside a nebula in the constellation Orion, which he believes will rejuvenate the tree—thereby granting him eternal life—when it explodes.

There are literal and thematic references to the tree in Terrence Malick&#x27;s free-flowing 2012 film &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, including in the title.

The 2021 adventure film &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot; follows a boat captain (Dwayne Johnson) who takes a scientist (Emily Blunt) on a quest to find the Tree.

==Physical &quot;trees of life&quot;==

* In West Africa, the South Asian &quot;Moringa oleifera&quot; tree is regarded as a &quot;tree of life&quot; or &quot;miracle tree&quot; by some because it is arguably the most nutritious source of plant-derived food discovered on the planet. Modern scientists and some missionary groups have considered the plant as a possible solution for the treatment of severe malnutrition and aid for those with HIV/AIDS.

<doc id="30717" wikidata="Q7679409" url="?curid=30717" title="Tales of the Reaching Moon">
<text>Tales of the Reaching Moon (also known as ToTRM) was a British fanzine dedicated to the fantasy world of Glorantha and producing material for fantasy role-playing games.

==Publication history==
When UK fanzine &quot;Pavic Tales&quot;, the first notable Glorantha fanzine, ended after issue #9 (Spring 1989), &quot;Tales of the Reaching Moon&quot; (20 issues, 1989-2002) from British fan organization Reaching Moon Megacorp was the next major fanzine for Glorantha. Reaching Moon Megacorp closed by publishing &quot;Tales of the Reaching Moon&quot; #20 (2002).

The editor, David Hall, published 20 issues from 1989 to 2002 (2/yr until 1994, then annually). The magazine was originally published with a monochrome cover but had a full colour cover from issue 12 onwards. Most of the later issues had a central theme fleshed out through a variety of related articles by different authors. A list of issues with themes is given below:

* Tales of the Reaching Moon #1 (1989) 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #2 (1989) 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #3 (1990) 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #4 (1990) Australian Special!
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #5 (1991) Humakti Special! 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #6 (1991) 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #7 (1992) Hero Quest Special! 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #8 (1992) The Chaos Feature
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #9 (1993) 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #10 (1993) Sea Special 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #11 (1994) Pamaltela: Great Southern Land 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #12 (1994) Bumper Colour Special!
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #13 (1995) Go West! 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #14 (1996) Praxian Special 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #15 (1996) Prax Part Deux 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #16 (1997) Lunar Special
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #17 (1998) Catch-up Special 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #18 (1999) Sartar Special 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #19 (2000) Upland Marsh Special 
* Tales of the Reaching Moon #20 (2002) Farewell Issue!

The fanzine printed gaming material for a variety of rule-systems, including RuneQuest and King Arthur Pendragon. In addition to this it also had fiction, news and a Rumours section based on the format of the RuneQuest supplements.

==Reception==
Allen Varney reviewed the Winter &#x27;93 issue of &quot;Tales of the Reaching Moon&quot;, and said that &quot;For casual players, &quot;Tales of the Reaching Moon&quot; might as well be printed in Sanskrit, as evidenced by cryptic references [...] But if that&#x27;s music to your ears, consider taking an issue on your next trip to Glorantha.&quot;

<doc id="30718" wikidata="Q23384" url="?curid=30718" title="Tide">
<text>Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon (and to a much lesser extent, the Sun) and are also caused by the Earth and Moon orbiting one another.

Tide tables can be used for any given locale to find the predicted times and amplitude (or &quot;tidal range&quot;). 
The predictions are influenced by many factors including the alignment of the Sun and Moon, the phase and amplitude of the tide (pattern of tides in the deep ocean), the amphidromic systems of the oceans, and the shape of the coastline and near-shore bathymetry (see &quot;Timing&quot;). They are however only predictions, the actual time and height of the tide is affected by wind and atmospheric pressure. Many shorelines experience semi-diurnal tides—two nearly equal high and low tides each day. Other locations have a diurnal tide—one high and low tide each day. A &quot;mixed tide&quot;—two uneven magnitude tides a day—is a third regular category.

Tides vary on timescales ranging from hours to years due to a number of factors, which determine the lunitidal interval. To make accurate records, tide gauges at fixed stations measure water level over time. Gauges ignore variations caused by waves with periods shorter than minutes. These data are compared to the reference (or datum) level usually called mean sea level.

While tides are usually the largest source of short-term sea-level fluctuations, sea levels are also subject to change from thermal expansion, wind, and barometric pressure changes, resulting in storm surges, especially in shallow seas and near coasts.

Tidal phenomena are not limited to the oceans, but can occur in other systems whenever a gravitational field that varies in time and space is present. For example, the shape of the solid part of the Earth is affected slightly by Earth tide, though this is not as easily seen as the water tidal movements.

== Characteristics ==
Four stages in the tidal cycle are named:
* The water stops falling, reaching a local minimum called low tide.
* Sea level rises over several hours, covering the intertidal zone; flood tide.
* The water stops rising, reaching a local maximum called high tide.
* Sea level falls over several hours, revealing the intertidal zone; ebb tide.

Oscillating currents produced by tides are known as tidal streams or tidal currents. The moment that the tidal current ceases is called &quot;slack water&quot; or &quot;slack tide&quot;. The tide then reverses direction and is said to be turning. Slack water usually occurs near high water and low water, but there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those of high and low water.

Tides are commonly &quot;semi-diurnal&quot; (two high waters and two low waters each day), or &quot;diurnal&quot; (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters on a given day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the &quot;higher high water&quot; and the &quot;lower high water&quot; in tide tables. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the &quot;higher low water&quot; and the &quot;lower low water&quot;. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the Equator.

=== Reference levels ===

The following reference tide levels can be defined, from the highest level to the lowest:
* &quot;Highest astronomical tide&quot; (HAT) – The highest tide which can be predicted to occur. Note that meteorological conditions may add extra height to the HAT.
* &quot;Mean high water springs&quot; (MHWS) – The average of the two high tides on the days of spring tides.
* &quot;Mean high water neaps&quot; (MHWN) – The average of the two high tides on the days of neap tides.
* &quot;Mean sea level&quot; (MSL) – This is the average sea level. The MSL is constant for any location over a long period.
* &quot;Mean low water neaps&quot; (MLWN) – The average of the two low tides on the days of neap tides.
* &quot;Mean low water springs&quot; (MLWS) – The average of the two low tides on the days of spring tides.
* &quot;Lowest astronomical tide&quot; (LAT) – The lowest tide which can be predicted to occur.

=== Range variation: springs and neaps ===

The semi-diurnal range (the difference in height between high and low waters over about half a day) varies in a two-week cycle. Approximately twice a month, around new moon and full moon when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a configuration known as a syzygy), the tidal force due to the Sun reinforces that due to the Moon. The tide&#x27;s range is then at its maximum; this is called the spring tide. It is not named after the season, but, like that word, derives from the meaning &quot;jump, burst forth, rise&quot;, as in a natural spring. 
Spring tides are sometimes referred to as &quot;syzygy tides&quot;.

When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth (in quadrature), and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon&#x27;s tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide&#x27;s range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps. &quot;Neap&quot; is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning &quot;without the power&quot;, as in &quot;forðganges nip&quot; (forth-going without-the-power).
Neap tides are sometimes referred to as &quot;quadrature tides&quot;.

Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, &quot;slack water&quot; time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.

== Tidal constituents == 

&quot;Tidal constituents&quot; are the net result of multiple influences impacting tidal changes over certain periods of time. Primary constituents include the Earth&#x27;s rotation, the position of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the Moon&#x27;s altitude (elevation) above the Earth&#x27;s Equator, and bathymetry. Variations with periods of less than half a day are called &quot;harmonic constituents&quot;. Conversely, cycles of days, months, or years are referred to as &quot;long period&quot; constituents.

Tidal forces affect the entire earth, but the movement of solid Earth occurs by mere centimeters. In contrast, the atmosphere is much more fluid and compressible so its surface moves by kilometers, in the sense of the contour level of a particular low pressure in the outer atmosphere.

In most locations, the largest constituent is the &quot;principal lunar semi-diurnal&quot;, also known as the &quot;M2 tidal constituent&quot; or &quot;M2 tidal constituent&quot;. Its period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes, exactly half a &quot;tidal lunar day&quot;, which is the average time separating one lunar zenith from the next, and thus is the time required for the Earth to rotate once relative to the Moon. Simple tide clocks track this constituent. The lunar day is longer than the Earth day because the Moon orbits in the same direction the Earth spins. 

The Moon orbits the Earth in the same direction as the Earth rotates on its axis, so it takes slightly more than a day—about 24 hours and 50 minutes—for the Moon to return to the same location in the sky. During this time, it has passed overhead (culmination) once and underfoot once (at an hour angle of 00:00 and 12:00 respectively), so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above-mentioned, about 12 hours and 25 minutes. The moment of highest tide is not necessarily when the Moon is nearest to zenith or nadir, but the period of the forcing still determines the time between high tides.

Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to &quot;stretch&quot; the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally (see equilibrium tide).

As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth&#x27;s surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to &quot;catch up&quot; to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.

When there are two high tides each day with different heights (and two low tides also of different heights), the pattern is called a &quot;mixed semi-diurnal tide&quot;.

=== Lunar distance ===

The changing distance separating the Moon and Earth also affects tide heights. When the Moon is closest, at perigee, the range increases, and when it is at apogee, the range shrinks. Six or eight times a year perigee coincides with either a new or full moon causing perigean spring tides with the largest &quot;tidal range&quot;. The difference between the height of a tide at perigean spring tide and the spring tide when the moon is at apogee depends on location but can be large as a foot higher.

=== Other constituents ===
These include solar gravitational effects, the obliquity (tilt) of the Earth&#x27;s Equator and rotational axis, the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit and the elliptical shape of the Earth&#x27;s orbit of the Sun.

A compound tide (or overtide) results from the shallow-water interaction of its two parent waves.

=== Phase and amplitude ===

Because the &quot;M&quot;2 tidal constituent dominates in most locations, the stage or &quot;phase&quot; of a tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called &quot;cotidal lines&quot;, which are analogous to contour lines of constant altitude on topographical maps, and when plotted form a &quot;cotidal map&quot; or &quot;cotidal chart&quot;. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum flood tide. This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.

For an ocean in the shape of a circular basin enclosed by a coastline, the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the amphidromic point. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by &quot;zero&quot; tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, Iceland and Madagascar.) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant &quot;amplitude&quot; (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a semi-diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line, which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line. High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation, caused by the Coriolis effect, is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the &quot;epoch&quot;. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent &quot;equilibrium tide&quot; on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.

In the North Atlantic, because the cotidal lines circulate counterclockwise around the amphidromic point, the high tide passes New York Harbor approximately an hour ahead of Norfolk Harbor. South of Cape Hatteras the tidal forces are more complex, and cannot be predicted reliably based on the North Atlantic cotidal lines.

=== History of tidal theory ===
Investigation into tidal physics was important in the early development of celestial mechanics, with the existence of two daily tides being explained by the Moon&#x27;s gravity. Later the daily tides were explained more precisely by the interaction of the Moon&#x27;s and the Sun&#x27;s gravity.

Seleucus of Seleucia theorized around 150 BC that tides were caused by the Moon. The influence of the Moon on bodies of water was also mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot;.

In (&quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;) of 725 Bede linked semidurnal tides and the phenomenon of varying tidal heights to the Moon and its phases. Bede starts by noting that the tides rise and fall 4/5 of an hour later each day, just as the Moon rises and sets 4/5 of an hour later. He goes on to emphasise that in two lunar months (59 days) the Moon circles the Earth 57 times and there are 114 tides. Bede then observes that the height of tides varies over the month. Increasing tides are called &quot;malinae&quot; and decreasing tides &quot;ledones&quot; and that the month is divided into four parts of seven or eight days with alternating &quot;malinae&quot; and &quot;ledones&quot;. In the same passage he also notes the effect of winds to hold back tides. Bede also records that the time of tides varies from place to place. To the north of Bede&#x27;s location (Monkwearmouth) the tides are earlier, to the south later. He explains that the tide &quot;deserts these shores in order to be able all the more to be able to flood other [shores] when it arrives there&quot; noting that &quot;the Moon which signals the rise of tide here, signals its retreat in other regions far from this quarter of the heavens&quot;.

Later medieval understanding of the tides was primarily based on works of Muslim astronomers, which became available through Latin translation starting from the 12th century. Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi (d. circa 886), in his , taught that ebb and flood tides were caused by the Moon. Abu Ma&#x27;shar discussed the effects of wind and Moon&#x27;s phases relative to the Sun on the tides. In the 12th century, al-Bitruji (d. circa 1204) contributed the notion that the tides were caused by the general circulation of the heavens.

Simon Stevin, in his 1608 (&quot;The theory of ebb and flood&quot;), dismissed a large number of misconceptions that still existed about ebb and flood. Stevin pleaded for the idea that the attraction of the Moon was responsible for the tides and spoke in clear terms about ebb, flood, spring tide and neap tide, stressing that further research needed to be made.

In 1609 Johannes Kepler also correctly suggested that the gravitation of the Moon caused the tides, which he based upon ancient observations and correlations.

Galileo Galilei in his 1632 &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;, whose working title was &quot;Dialogue on the Tides&quot;, gave an explanation of the tides. The resulting theory, however, was incorrect as he attributed the tides to the sloshing of water caused by the Earth&#x27;s movement around the Sun. He hoped to provide mechanical proof of the Earth&#x27;s movement. The value of his tidal theory is disputed. Galileo rejected Kepler&#x27;s explanation of the tides.

Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was the first person to explain tides as the product of the gravitational attraction of astronomical masses. His explanation of the tides (and many other phenomena) was published in the &quot;Principia&quot; (1687) and used his theory of universal gravitation to explain the lunar and solar attractions as the origin of the tide-generating forces.
Newton and others before Pierre-Simon Laplace worked the problem from the perspective of a static system (equilibrium theory), that provided an approximation that described the tides that would occur in a non-inertial ocean evenly covering the whole Earth. The tide-generating force (or its corresponding potential) is still relevant to tidal theory, but as an intermediate quantity (forcing function) rather than as a final result; theory must also consider the Earth&#x27;s accumulated dynamic tidal response to the applied forces, which response is influenced by ocean depth, the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and other factors.

In 1740, the Académie Royale des Sciences in Paris offered a prize for the best theoretical essay on tides. Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Colin Maclaurin and Antoine Cavalleri shared the prize.

Maclaurin used Newton&#x27;s theory to show that a smooth sphere covered by a sufficiently deep ocean under the tidal force of a single deforming body is a prolate spheroid (essentially a three-dimensional oval) with major axis directed toward the deforming body. Maclaurin was the first to write about the Earth&#x27;s rotational effects on motion. Euler realized that the tidal force&#x27;s &quot;horizontal&quot; component (more than the vertical) drives the tide. In 1744 Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert studied tidal equations for the atmosphere which did not include rotation.

In 1770 James Cook&#x27;s barque HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. Attempts were made to refloat her on the following tide which failed, but the tide after that lifted her clear with ease. Whilst she was being repaired in the mouth of the Endeavour River Cook observed the tides over a period of seven weeks. At neap tides both tides in a day were similar, but at springs the tides rose in the morning but in the evening.

Pierre-Simon Laplace formulated a system of partial differential equations relating the ocean&#x27;s horizontal flow to its surface height, the first major dynamic theory for water tides. The Laplace tidal equations are still in use today. William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, rewrote Laplace&#x27;s equations in terms of vorticity which allowed for solutions describing tidally driven coastally trapped waves, known as Kelvin waves.

Others including Kelvin and Henri Poincaré further developed Laplace&#x27;s theory. Based on these developments and the lunar theory of E W Brown describing the motions of the Moon, Arthur Thomas Doodson developed and published in 1921 the first modern development of the tide-generating potential in harmonic form: Doodson distinguished 388 tidal frequencies. Some of his methods remain in use.

=== History of tidal observation ===
From ancient times, tidal observation and discussion has increased in sophistication, first marking the daily recurrence, then tides&#x27; relationship to the Sun and moon. Pytheas travelled to the British Isles about 325 BC and seems to be the first to have related spring tides to the phase of the moon.

In the 2nd century BC, the Hellenistic astronomer Seleucus of Seleucia correctly described the phenomenon of tides in order to support his heliocentric theory. He correctly theorized that tides were caused by the moon, although he believed that the interaction was mediated by the pneuma. He noted that tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to link tides to the lunar attraction, and that the height of the tides depends on the moon&#x27;s position relative to the Sun.

The &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; of Pliny the Elder collates many tidal observations, e.g., the spring tides are a few days after (or before) new and full moon and are highest around the equinoxes, though Pliny noted many relationships now regarded as fanciful. In his &quot;Geography&quot;, Strabo described tides in the Persian Gulf having their greatest range when the moon was furthest from the plane of the Equator. All this despite the relatively small amplitude of Mediterranean basin tides. (The strong currents through the Euripus Strait and the Strait of Messina puzzled Aristotle.) Philostratus discussed tides in Book Five of &quot;The Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;. Philostratus mentions the moon, but attributes tides to &quot;spirits&quot;. In Europe around 730 AD, the Venerable Bede described how the rising tide on one coast of the British Isles coincided with the fall on the other and described the time progression of high water along the Northumbrian coast.

The first tide table in China was recorded in 1056 AD primarily for visitors wishing to see the famous tidal bore in the Qiantang River. The first known British tide table is thought to be that of John Wallingford, who died Abbot of St. Albans in 1213, based on high water occurring 48 minutes later each day, and three hours earlier at the Thames mouth than upriver at London.

In 1614 Claude d&#x27;Abbeville published the work &quot;&quot;, where he exposed that the Tupinambá people already had an understanding of the relation between the Moon and the tides before Europe.

William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) led the first systematic harmonic analysis of tidal records starting in 1867. The main result was the building of a tide-predicting machine using a system of pulleys to add together six harmonic time functions. It was &quot;programmed&quot; by resetting gears and chains to adjust phasing and amplitudes. Similar machines were used until the 1960s.

The first known sea-level record of an entire spring–neap cycle was made in 1831 on the Navy Dock in the Thames Estuary. Many large ports had automatic tide gauge stations by 1850.

John Lubbock was one of the first to map co-tidal lines, for Great Britain, Ireland and adjacent coasts, in 1840. William Whewell expanded this work ending with a nearly global chart in 1836. In order to make these maps consistent, he hypothesized the existence of a region with no tidal rise or fall where co-tidal lines meet in the mid-ocean. The existence of such an amphidromic point, as they are now known, was confirmed in 1840 by Captain William Hewett, RN, from careful soundings in the North Sea.

Much later, in the late 20th century, geologists noticed tidal rhythmites, which document the occurrence of ancient tides in the geological record, notably in the Carboniferous.

== Physics ==
=== Forces ===

The tidal force produced by a massive object (Moon, hereafter) on a small particle located on or in an extensive body (Earth, hereafter) is the vector difference between the gravitational force exerted by the Moon on the particle, and the gravitational force that would be exerted on the particle if it were located at the Earth&#x27;s center of mass.

Whereas the gravitational force subjected by a celestial body on Earth varies inversely as the square of its distance to the Earth, the maximal tidal force varies inversely as, approximately, the cube of this distance. If the tidal force caused by each body were instead equal to its full gravitational force (which is not the case due to the free fall of the whole Earth, not only the oceans, towards these bodies) a different pattern of tidal forces would be observed, e.g. with a much stronger influence from the Sun than from the Moon: The solar gravitational force on the Earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar, but because the Sun is on average 389 times farther from the Earth, its field gradient is weaker. The overall proportionality is

: formula_1

where is the mass of the heavenly body, is its distance, is its average density, and is its radius. The ratio is related to the angle subtended by the object in the sky. Since the Sun and the Moon have practically the same diameter in the sky, the tidal force of the Sun is less than that of the Moon because its average density is much less, and it is only 46% as large as the lunar, thus during a spring tide, the Moon contributes 69% while the Sun contributes 31%. More precisely, the lunar tidal acceleration (along the Moon–Earth axis, at the Earth&#x27;s surface) is about 1.1 &quot;g&quot;, while the solar tidal acceleration (along the Sun–Earth axis, at the Earth&#x27;s surface) is about 0.52 &quot;g&quot;, where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration at the Earth&#x27;s surface. The effects of the other planets vary as their distances from Earth vary. When Venus is closest to Earth, its effect is 0.000113 times the solar effect. At other times, Jupiter or Mars may have the most effect.

The ocean&#x27;s surface is approximated by a surface referred to as the geoid, which takes into consideration the gravitational force exerted by the earth as well as centrifugal force due to rotation. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and cause the ocean&#x27;s surface to deviate from the geoid. They establish a new equilibrium ocean surface which bulges toward the moon on one side and away from the moon on the other side. The earth&#x27;s rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle. The ocean surface tends toward this equilibrium shape, which is constantly changing, and never quite attains it. When the ocean surface is not aligned with it, it&#x27;s as though the surface is sloping, and water accelerates in the down-slope direction.

=== Equilibrium ===
The equilibrium tide is the idealized tide assuming a landless Earth.
It would produce a tidal bulge in the ocean, elongated towards the attracting body (Moon or Sun).
It is &quot;not&quot; caused by the vertical pull nearest or farthest from the body, which is very weak; rather, it is caused by the tangential or tractive tidal force, which is strongest at about 45 degrees from the body, resulting in a horizontal tidal current.

=== Laplace&#x27;s tidal equations ===
Ocean depths are much smaller than their horizontal extent. Thus, the response to tidal forcing can be modelled using the Laplace tidal equations which incorporate the following features:

* The vertical (or radial) velocity is negligible, and there is no vertical shear—this is a sheet flow.
* The forcing is only horizontal (tangential).
* The Coriolis effect appears as an inertial force (fictitious) acting laterally to the direction of flow and proportional to velocity.
* The surface height&#x27;s rate of change is proportional to the negative divergence of velocity multiplied by the depth. As the horizontal velocity stretches or compresses the ocean as a sheet, the volume thins or thickens, respectively.

The boundary conditions dictate no flow across the coastline and free slip at the bottom.

The Coriolis effect (inertial force) steers flows moving towards the Equator to the west and flows moving away from the Equator toward the east, allowing coastally trapped waves. Finally, a dissipation term can be added which is an analog to viscosity.

=== Amplitude and cycle time ===
The theoretical amplitude of oceanic tides caused by the Moon is about at the highest point, which corresponds to the amplitude that would be reached if the ocean possessed a uniform depth, there were no landmasses, and the Earth were rotating in step with the Moon&#x27;s orbit. The Sun similarly causes tides, of which the theoretical amplitude is about (46% of that of the Moon) with a cycle time of 12 hours. At spring tide the two effects add to each other to a theoretical level of , while at neap tide the theoretical level is reduced to . Since the orbits of the Earth about the Sun, and the Moon about the Earth, are elliptical, tidal amplitudes change somewhat as a result of the varying Earth–Sun and Earth–Moon distances. This causes a variation in the tidal force and theoretical amplitude of about ±18% for the Moon and ±5% for the Sun. If both the Sun and Moon were at their closest positions and aligned at new moon, the theoretical amplitude would reach .

Real amplitudes differ considerably, not only because of depth variations and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period: if there were no land masses, it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength surface wave to propagate along the Equator halfway around the Earth (by comparison, the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere has a natural period of about 57 minutes). Earth tides, which raise and lower the bottom of the ocean, and the tide&#x27;s own gravitational self attraction are both significant and further complicate the ocean&#x27;s response to tidal forces.

=== Dissipation ===

Earth&#x27;s tidal oscillations introduce dissipation at an average rate of about 3.75 terawatts. About 98% of this dissipation is by marine tidal movement. Dissipation arises as basin-scale tidal flows drive smaller-scale flows which experience turbulent dissipation. This tidal drag creates torque on the moon that gradually transfers angular momentum to its orbit, and a gradual increase in Earth–moon separation. The equal and opposite torque on the Earth correspondingly decreases its rotational velocity. Thus, over geologic time, the moon recedes from the Earth, at about {{convert|3.8|cm|in}}/year, lengthening the terrestrial day.{{efn|The day is currently lengthening at a rate of about 0.002 seconds per century.}}

Day length has increased by about 2 hours in the last 600 million years. Assuming (as a crude approximation) that the deceleration rate has been constant, this would imply that 70 million years ago, day length was on the order of 1% shorter with about 4 more days per year.

=== Bathymetry ===

The shape of the shoreline and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate, so there is no simple, general rule that predicts the time of high water from the Moon&#x27;s position in the sky. Coastal characteristics such as underwater bathymetry and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting; actual high water time and height may differ from model predictions due to the coastal morphology&#x27;s effects on tidal flow. However, for a given location the relationship between lunar altitude and the time of high or low tide (the lunitidal interval) is relatively constant and predictable, as is the time of high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast. For example, the high tide at Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., predictably occurs approximately two and a half hours before the Moon passes directly overhead.

Land masses and ocean basins act as barriers against water moving freely around the globe, and their varied shapes and sizes affect the size of tidal frequencies. As a result, tidal patterns vary. For example, in the U.S., the East coast has predominantly semi-diurnal tides, as do Europe&#x27;s Atlantic coasts, while the West coast predominantly has mixed tides. Human changes to the landscape can also significantly alter local tides.

== Observation and prediction ==

=== Timing ===

The tidal forces due to the Moon and Sun generate very long waves which travel all around the ocean following the paths shown in co-tidal charts. The time when the crest of the wave reaches a port then gives the time of high water at the port. The time taken for the wave to travel around the ocean also means that there is a delay between the phases of the Moon and their effect on the tide. Springs and neaps in the North Sea, for example, are two days behind the new/full moon and first/third quarter moon. This is called the tide&#x27;s &quot;age&quot;.

The ocean bathymetry greatly influences the tide&#x27;s exact time and height at a particular coastal point. There are some extreme cases; the Bay of Fundy, on the east coast of Canada, is often stated to have the world&#x27;s highest tides because of its shape, bathymetry, and its distance from the continental shelf edge. Measurements made in November 1998 at Burntcoat Head in the Bay of Fundy recorded a maximum range of {{convert|16.3|m|ft}} and a highest predicted extreme of {{convert|17|m|ft}}. Similar measurements made in March 2002 at Leaf Basin, Ungava Bay in northern Quebec gave similar values (allowing for measurement errors), a maximum range of {{convert|16.2|m|ft}} and a highest predicted extreme of {{convert|16.8|m|ft}}. Ungava Bay and the Bay of Fundy lie similar distances from the continental shelf edge, but Ungava Bay is only free of pack ice for about four months every year while the Bay of Fundy rarely freezes.

Southampton in the United Kingdom has a double high water caused by the interaction between the &quot;M&quot;2 and &quot;M&quot;4 tidal constituents (Shallow water overtides of principal lunar). Portland has double low waters for the same reason. The &quot;M&quot;4 tide is found all along the south coast of the United Kingdom, but its effect is most noticeable between the Isle of Wight and Portland because the &quot;M&quot;2 tide is lowest in this region.

Because the oscillation modes of the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea do not coincide with any significant astronomical forcing period, the largest tides are close to their narrow connections with the Atlantic Ocean. Extremely small tides also occur for the same reason in the Gulf of Mexico and Sea of Japan. Elsewhere, as along the southern coast of Australia, low tides can be due to the presence of a nearby amphidrome.

=== Analysis ===

Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation first enabled an explanation of why there were generally two tides a day, not one, and offered hope for a detailed understanding of tidal forces and behavior. Although it may seem that tides could be predicted via a sufficiently detailed knowledge of instantaneous astronomical forcings, the actual tide at a given location is determined by astronomical forces accumulated by the body of water over many days. In addition, accurate results would require detailed knowledge of the shape of all the ocean basins—their bathymetry, and coastline shape.

Current procedure for analysing tides follows the method of harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by William Thomson. It is based on the principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of Sun and Moon determine a large number of component frequencies, and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion, but that at each place of interest on the Earth, the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality. At each place of interest, the tide heights are therefore measured for a period of time sufficiently long (usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied) to enable the response at each significant tide-generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis, and to extract the tidal constants for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction. The tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force, with a constant amplitude and phase delay for each component. Because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty, the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical tide-generating forces has been found.

The main patterns in the tides are
* the twice-daily variation
* the difference between the first and second tide of a day
* the spring–neap cycle
* the annual variation
The &quot;Highest Astronomical Tide&quot; is the perigean spring tide when both the Sun and Moon are closest to the Earth.

When confronted by a periodically varying function, the standard approach is to employ Fourier series, a form of analysis that uses sinusoidal functions as a &quot;basis&quot; set, having frequencies that are zero, one, two, three, etc. times the frequency of a particular fundamental cycle. These multiples are called &quot;harmonics&quot; of the fundamental frequency, and the process is termed harmonic analysis. If the basis set of sinusoidal functions suit the behaviour being modelled, relatively few harmonic terms need to be added. Orbital paths are very nearly circular, so sinusoidal variations are suitable for tides.

For the analysis of tide heights, the Fourier series approach has in practice to be made more elaborate than the use of a single frequency and its harmonics. The tidal patterns are decomposed into many sinusoids having many fundamental frequencies, corresponding (as in the lunar theory) to many different combinations of the motions of the Earth, the Moon, and the angles that define the shape and location of their orbits.

For tides, then, &quot;harmonic analysis&quot; is not limited to harmonics of a single frequency.{{efn|To demonstrate this Tides Home Page offers a tidal height pattern converted into an &quot;.mp3&quot; sound file, and the rich sound is quite different from a pure tone.}} In other words, the harmonies are multiples of many fundamental frequencies, not just of the fundamental frequency of the simpler Fourier series approach. Their representation as a Fourier series having only one fundamental frequency and its (integer) multiples would require many terms, and would be severely limited in the time-range for which it would be valid.

The study of tide height by harmonic analysis was begun by Laplace, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and George Darwin. A.T. Doodson extended their work, introducing the &quot;Doodson Number&quot; notation to organise the hundreds of resulting terms. This approach has been the international standard ever since, and the complications arise as follows: the tide-raising force is notionally given by sums of several terms. Each term is of the form
: formula_2
where
: {{math|Ao}} is the amplitude,
: {{math|ω}} is the angular frequency, usually given in degrees per hour, corresponding to {{math|t}} measured in hours,
: {{math|p}} is the phase offset with regard to the astronomical state at time &quot;t&quot; = 0. 

There is one term for the Moon and a second term for the Sun. The phase {{math|p}} of the first harmonic for the Moon term is called the lunitidal interval or high water interval. 

The next refinement is to accommodate the harmonic terms due to the elliptical shape of the orbits. To do so, the value of the amplitude is taken to be not a constant, but varying with time, about the average amplitude {{math|Ao}}. To do so, replace {{math|Ao}} in the above equation with {{math|A(t)}} where {{math|A}} is another sinusoid, similar to the cycles and epicycles of Ptolemaic theory. This gives

: formula_3

which is to say an average value {{math|Ao}} with a sinusoidal variation about it of magnitude {{math|Aa}}, with frequency {{math|ωa}} and phase {{math|pa}}. Substituting this for {{math|Ao}} in the original equation gives a product of two cosine factors:

: formula_4

Given that for any {{math|x}} and {{math|y}}
: formula_5
it is clear that a compound term involving the product of two cosine terms each with their own frequency is the same as &quot;three&quot; simple cosine terms that are to be added at the original frequency and also at frequencies which are the sum and difference of the two frequencies of the product term. (Three, not two terms, since the whole expression is formula_6.) Consider further that the tidal force on a location depends also on whether the Moon (or the Sun) is above or below the plane of the Equator, and that these attributes have their own periods also incommensurable with a day and a month, and it is clear that many combinations result. With a careful choice of the basic astronomical frequencies, the Doodson Number annotates the particular additions and differences to form the frequency of each simple cosine term.

Remember that astronomical tides do &quot;not&quot; include weather effects. Also, changes to local conditions (sandbank movement, dredging harbour mouths, etc.) away from those prevailing at the measurement time affect the tide&#x27;s actual timing and magnitude. Organisations quoting a &quot;highest astronomical tide&quot; for some location may exaggerate the figure as a safety factor against analytical uncertainties, distance from the nearest measurement point, changes since the last observation time, ground subsidence, etc., to avert liability should an engineering work be overtopped. Special care is needed when assessing the size of a &quot;weather surge&quot; by subtracting the astronomical tide from the observed tide.

Careful Fourier data analysis over a nineteen-year period (the &quot;National Tidal Datum Epoch&quot; in the U.S.) uses frequencies called the &quot;tidal harmonic constituents&quot;. Nineteen years is preferred because the Earth, Moon and Sun&#x27;s relative positions repeat almost exactly in the Metonic cycle of 19 years, which is long enough to include the 18.613 year lunar nodal tidal constituent. This analysis can be done using only the knowledge of the forcing &quot;period&quot;, but without detailed understanding of the mathematical derivation, which means that useful tidal tables have been constructed for centuries. The resulting amplitudes and phases can then be used to predict the expected tides. These are usually dominated by the constituents near 12 hours (the &quot;semi-diurnal&quot; constituents), but there are major constituents near 24 hours (&quot;diurnal&quot;) as well. Longer term constituents are 14 day or &quot;fortnightly&quot;, monthly, and semiannual. Semi-diurnal tides dominated coastline, but some areas such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are primarily diurnal. In the semi-diurnal areas, the primary constituents &quot;M&quot;2 (lunar) and &quot;S&quot;2 (solar) periods differ slightly, so that the relative phases, and thus the amplitude of the combined tide, change fortnightly (14 day period).

In the &quot;M&quot;2 plot above, each cotidal line differs by one hour from its neighbors, and the thicker lines show tides in phase with equilibrium at Greenwich. The lines rotate around the amphidromic points counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere so that from Baja California Peninsula to Alaska and from France to Ireland the &quot;M&quot;2 tide propagates northward. In the southern hemisphere this direction is clockwise. On the other hand, &quot;M&quot;2 tide propagates counterclockwise around New Zealand, but this is because the islands act as a dam and permit the tides to have different heights on the islands&#x27; opposite sides. (The tides do propagate northward on the east side and southward on the west coast, as predicted by theory.)

The exception is at Cook Strait where the tidal currents periodically link high to low water. This is because cotidal lines 180° around the amphidromes are in opposite phase, for example high water across from low water at each end of Cook Strait. Each tidal constituent has a different pattern of amplitudes, phases, and amphidromic points, so the &quot;M&quot;2 patterns cannot be used for other tide components.

=== Example calculation ===

Because the Moon is moving in its orbit around the Earth and in the same sense as the Earth&#x27;s rotation, a point on the Earth must rotate slightly further to catch up so that the time between semi-diurnal tides is not twelve but 12.4206 hours—a bit over twenty-five minutes extra. The two peaks are not equal. The two high tides a day alternate in maximum heights: lower high (just under three feet), higher high (just over three feet), and again lower high. Likewise for the low tides.

When the Earth, Moon, and Sun are in line (Sun–Earth–Moon, or Sun–Moon–Earth) the two main influences combine to produce spring tides; when the two forces are opposing each other as when the angle Moon–Earth–Sun is close to ninety degrees, neap tides result. As the Moon moves around its orbit it changes from north of the Equator to south of the Equator. The alternation in high tide heights becomes smaller, until they are the same (at the lunar equinox, the Moon is above the Equator), then redevelop but with the other polarity, waxing to a maximum difference and then waning again.

=== Current ===
The tides&#x27; influence on current or flow is much more difficult to analyze, and data is much more difficult to collect. A tidal height is a scalar quantity and varies smoothly over a wide region. A flow is a vector quantity, with magnitude and direction, both of which can vary substantially with depth and over short distances due to local bathymetry. Also, although a water channel&#x27;s center is the most useful measuring site, mariners object when current-measuring equipment obstructs waterways. A flow proceeding up a curved channel may have similar magnitude, even though its direction varies continuously along the channel. Surprisingly, flood and ebb flows are often not in opposite directions. Flow direction is determined by the upstream channel&#x27;s shape, not the downstream channel&#x27;s shape. Likewise, eddies may form in only one flow direction.

Nevertheless, tidal current analysis is similar to tidal heights analysis: in the simple case, at a given location the flood flow is in mostly one direction, and the ebb flow in another direction. Flood velocities are given positive sign, and ebb velocities negative sign. Analysis proceeds as though these are tide heights.

In more complex situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow direction and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along the ebb and flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.

Tide flow information is most commonly seen on nautical charts, presented as a table of flow speeds and bearings at hourly intervals, with separate tables for spring and neap tides. The timing is relative to high water at some harbour where the tidal behaviour is similar in pattern, though it may be far away.

As with tide height predictions, tide flow predictions based only on astronomical factors do not incorporate weather conditions, which can &quot;completely&quot; change the outcome.

The tidal flow through Cook Strait between the two main islands of New Zealand is particularly interesting, as the tides on each side of the strait are almost exactly out of phase, so that one side&#x27;s high water is simultaneous with the other&#x27;s low water. Strong currents result, with almost zero tidal height change in the strait&#x27;s center. Yet, although the tidal surge normally flows in one direction for six hours and in the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions, the reverse surge might be entirely overcome so that the flow continues in the same direction through three or more surge periods.

A further complication for Cook Strait&#x27;s flow pattern is that the tide at the south side (e.g. at Nelson) follows the common bi-weekly spring–neap tide cycle (as found along the west side of the country), but the north side&#x27;s tidal pattern has only &quot;one&quot; cycle per month, as on the east side: Wellington, and Napier.

The graph of Cook Strait&#x27;s tides shows separately the high water and low water height and time, through November 2007; these are &quot;not&quot; measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years-old measurements. Cook Strait&#x27;s nautical chart offers tidal current information. For instance the January 1979 edition for {{coord|41|13.9|S|174|29.6|E}} (northwest of Cape Terawhiti) refers timings to Westport while the January 2004 issue refers to Wellington. Near Cape Terawhiti in the middle of Cook Strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the tidal current reaches its maximum, especially near the notorious Karori Rip. Aside from weather effects, the actual currents through Cook Strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen, only one of the two spring tides at the north west end of the strait near Nelson has a counterpart spring tide at the south east end (Wellington), so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Power generation ===
{{Main|Tidal power}}
Tidal energy can be extracted by two means: inserting a water turbine into a tidal current, or building ponds that release/admit water through a turbine. In the first case, the energy amount is entirely determined by the timing and tidal current magnitude. However, the best currents may be unavailable because the turbines would obstruct ships. In the second, the impoundment dams are expensive to construct, natural water cycles are completely disrupted, ship navigation is disrupted. However, with multiple ponds, power can be generated at chosen times. So far, there are few installed systems for tidal power generation (most famously, La Rance at Saint Malo, France) which face many difficulties. Aside from environmental issues, simply withstanding corrosion and biological fouling pose engineering challenges.

Tidal power proponents point out that, unlike wind power systems, generation levels can be reliably predicted, save for weather effects. While some generation is possible for most of the tidal cycle, in practice turbines lose efficiency at lower operating rates. Since the power available from a flow is proportional to the cube of the flow speed, the times during which high power generation is possible are brief.

== Navigation ==
Tidal flows are important for navigation, and significant errors in position occur if they are not accommodated. Tidal heights are also important; for example many rivers and harbours have a shallow &quot;bar&quot; at the entrance which prevents boats with significant draft from entering at low tide.

Until the advent of automated navigation, competence in calculating tidal effects was important to naval officers. The certificate of examination for lieutenants in the Royal Navy once declared that the prospective officer was able to &quot;shift his tides&quot;.

Tidal flow timings and velocities appear in &quot;tide charts&quot; or a tidal stream atlas. Tide charts come in sets. Each chart covers a single hour between one high water and another (they ignore the leftover 24 minutes) and show the average tidal flow for that hour. An arrow on the tidal chart indicates the direction and the average flow speed (usually in knots) for spring and neap tides. If a tide chart is not available, most nautical charts have &quot;tidal diamonds&quot; which relate specific points on the chart to a table giving tidal flow direction and speed.

The standard procedure to counteract tidal effects on navigation is to (1) calculate a &quot;dead reckoning&quot; position (or DR) from travel distance and direction, (2) mark the chart (with a vertical cross like a plus sign) and (3) draw a line from the DR in the tide&#x27;s direction. The distance the tide moves the boat along this line is computed by the tidal speed, and this gives an &quot;estimated position&quot; or EP (traditionally marked with a dot in a triangle).

Nautical charts display the water&#x27;s &quot;charted depth&quot; at specific locations with &quot;soundings&quot; and the use of bathymetric contour lines to depict the submerged surface&#x27;s shape. These depths are relative to a &quot;chart datum&quot;, which is typically the water level at the lowest possible astronomical tide (although other datums are commonly used, especially historically, and tides may be lower or higher for meteorological reasons) and are therefore the minimum possible water depth during the tidal cycle. &quot;Drying heights&quot; may also be shown on the chart, which are the heights of the exposed seabed at the lowest astronomical tide.

Tide tables list each day&#x27;s high and low water heights and times. To calculate the actual water depth, add the charted depth to the published tide height. Depth for other times can be derived from tidal curves published for major ports. The rule of twelfths can suffice if an accurate curve is not available. This approximation presumes that the increase in depth in the six hours between low and high water is: first hour — 1/12, second — 2/12, third — 3/12, fourth — 3/12, fifth — 2/12, sixth — 1/12.

== Biological aspects ==

=== Intertidal ecology ===

{{Main|Intertidal ecology}}
{{Further|Intertidal zone}}

Intertidal ecology is the study of ecosystems between the low- and high-water lines along a shore. At low water, the intertidal zone is exposed (or &quot;emersed&quot;), whereas at high water, it is underwater (or &quot;immersed&quot;). Intertidal ecologists therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as among the different species. The most important interactions may vary according to the type of intertidal community. The broadest classifications are based on substrates — rocky shore or soft bottom.

Intertidal organisms experience a highly variable and often hostile environment, and have adapted to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature is vertical zonation, in which the community divides into distinct horizontal bands of specific species at each elevation above low water. A species&#x27; ability to cope with desiccation determines its upper limit, while competition with other species sets its lower limit.

Humans use intertidal regions for food and recreation. Overexploitation can damage intertidals directly. Other anthropogenic actions such as introducing invasive species and climate change have large negative effects. Marine Protected Areas are one option communities can apply to protect these areas and aid scientific research.

=== Biological rhythms ===
The approximately 12-hour and fortnightly tidal cycle has large effects on intertidal and marine organisms. Hence their biological rhythms tend to occur in rough multiples of these periods. Many other animals such as the vertebrates, display similar circatidal rhythms. Examples include gestation and egg hatching. In humans, the menstrual cycle lasts roughly a lunar month, an even multiple of the tidal period. Such parallels at least hint at the common descent of all animals from a marine ancestor.

== Other tides ==
When oscillating tidal currents in the stratified ocean flow over uneven bottom topography, they generate internal waves with tidal frequencies. Such waves are called &quot;internal tides&quot;.

Shallow areas in otherwise open water can experience rotary tidal currents, flowing in directions that continually change and thus the flow direction (not the flow) completes a full rotation in {{frac|12|1|2}} hours (for example, the Nantucket Shoals).

In addition to oceanic tides, large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience &quot;atmospheric tides&quot; and &quot;Earth tides&quot;. These are continuum mechanical phenomena. The first two take place in fluids. The third affects the Earth&#x27;s thin solid crust surrounding its semi-liquid interior (with various modifications).

=== Lake tides ===
Large lakes such as Superior and Erie can experience tides of {{convert|1|to|4|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, but these can be masked by meteorologically induced phenomena such as seiche. The tide in Lake Michigan is described as {{convert|0.5|to|1.5|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} or {{convert|1+3/4|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. This is so small that other larger effects completely mask any tide, and as such these lakes are considered non-tidal.

=== Atmospheric tides ===
{{main|Atmospheric tide}}
Atmospheric tides are negligible at ground level and aviation altitudes, masked by weather&#x27;s much more important effects. Atmospheric tides are both gravitational and thermal in origin and are the dominant dynamics from about {{convert|80| to |120|km|mi}}, above which the molecular density becomes too low to support fluid behavior.

=== Earth tides ===
{{Main|Earth tide}}
Earth tides or terrestrial tides affect the entire Earth&#x27;s mass, which acts similarly to a liquid gyroscope with a very thin crust. The Earth&#x27;s crust shifts (in/out, east/west, north/south) in response to lunar and solar gravitation, ocean tides, and atmospheric loading. While negligible for most human activities, terrestrial tides&#x27; semi-diurnal amplitude can reach about {{convert|55|cm|in}} at the Equator—{{convert|15|cm|in}} due to the Sun—which is important in GPS calibration and VLBI measurements. Precise astronomical angular measurements require knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s rotation rate and polar motion, both of which are influenced by Earth tides. The semi-diurnal &quot;M&quot;2 Earth tides are nearly in phase with the Moon with a lag of about two hours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== Galactic tides ===
&quot;Galactic tides&quot; are the tidal forces exerted by galaxies on stars within them and satellite galaxies orbiting them. The galactic tide&#x27;s effects on the Solar System&#x27;s Oort cloud are believed to cause 90 percent of long-period comets.

== Misnomers ==
Tsunamis, the large waves that occur after earthquakes, are sometimes called &quot;tidal waves&quot;, but this name is given by their &quot;resemblance&quot; to the tide, rather than any causal link to the tide. Other phenomena unrelated to tides but using the word &quot;tide&quot; are rip tide, storm tide, hurricane tide, and black or red tides. Many of these usages are historic and refer to the earlier meaning of tide as &quot;a portion of time, a season&quot; and &quot;a stream, current or flood&quot;.

<doc id="30719" wikidata="Q223325" url="?curid=30719" title="Tidal force">
<text>The tidal force or tide-generating force is the difference in gravitational attraction between different points in a gravitational field, causing bodies to be pulled unevenly and as a result are being stretched towards the attraction. It is the differential force of gravity, the net between gravitational forces, the derivative of gravitational potential, the gradient of gravitational fields. Therefore tidal forces are a residual force, a secondary effect of gravity, highlighting its spatial elements, making the closer near-side more attracted than the more distant far-side.

This produces a range of tidal phenomena, such as ocean tides. Earth&#x27;s tides are mainly produced by the relative close gravitational field of the Moon 
and to a lesser extend by the stronger, but further away gravitational field of the Sun. The ocean on the side of Earth facing the Moon is being pulled by the gravity of the Moon away from Earth&#x27;s crust, while on the other side of Earth there the crust is being pulled away from the ocean, resulting in Earth being stretched, bulging on both sides, and having opposite high-tides. Tidal forces viewed from Earth, that is from a rotating reference frame, appear as centripedal and centrifugal forces, but are not caused by the rotation.

Further tidal phenomena include solid-earth tides, tidal locking, breaking apart of celestial bodies and formation of ring systems within the Roche limit, and in extreme cases, spaghettification of objects. Tidal forces have also been shown to be fundamentally related to gravitational waves.

In celestial mechanics, the expression &quot;tidal force&quot; can refer to a situation in which a body or material (for example, tidal water) is mainly under the gravitational influence of a second body (for example, the Earth), but is also perturbed by the gravitational effects of a third body (for example, the Moon). The perturbing force is sometimes in such cases called a tidal force (for example, the perturbing force on the Moon): it is the difference between the force exerted by the third body on the second and the force exerted by the third body on the first.

== Explanation ==
When a body (body 1) is acted on by the gravity of another body (body 2), the field can vary significantly on body 1 between the side of the body facing body 2 and the side facing away from body 2. Figure 2 shows the differential force of gravity on a spherical body (body 1) exerted by another body (body 2).

These &quot;tidal forces&quot; cause strains on both bodies and may distort them or even, in extreme cases, break one or the other apart. The Roche limit is the distance from a planet at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate because the differential force of gravity from the planet overcomes the attraction of the parts of the object for one another. These strains would not occur if the gravitational field were uniform, because a uniform field only causes the entire body to accelerate together in the same direction and at the same rate.

== Size and distance ==
The relationship of an astronomical body&#x27;s size, to its distance from another body, strongly influences the magnitude of tidal force. The tidal force acting on an astronomical body, such as the Earth, is directly proportional to the diameter of the Earth and inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from another body producing a gravitational attraction, such as the Moon or the Sun. Tidal action on bath tubs, swimming pools, lakes, and other small bodies of water is negligible.
Figure 3 is a graph showing how gravitational force declines with distance. In this graph, the attractive force decreases in proportion to the square of the distance (), while the slope () is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance.

The tidal force corresponds to the difference in Y between two points on the graph, with one point on the near side of the body, and the other point on the far side. The tidal force becomes larger, when the two points are either farther apart, or when they are more to the left on the graph, meaning closer to the attracting body.

For example, even though the Sun has a stronger overall gravitational pull on Earth, the Moon creates a larger tidal bulge because the Moon is closer. This difference is due to the way gravity weakens with distance: the Moon&#x27;s closer proximity creates a steeper decline in its gravitational pull as you move across Earth (compared to the Sun&#x27;s very gradual decline from its vast distance). This steeper gradient in the Moon&#x27;s pull results in a larger difference in force between the near and far sides of Earth, which is what creates the bigger tidal bulge.

Gravitational attraction is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. The attraction will be stronger on the side of a body facing the source, and weaker on the side away from the source. The tidal force is proportional to the difference.

=== Sun, Earth, and Moon ===
The Earth is 81 times more massive than the Moon, the Earth has roughly 4 times the Moon&#x27;s radius. As a result, at the same distance, the tidal force of the Earth at the surface of the Moon is about 20 times stronger than that of the Moon at the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Effects ==
In the case of an infinitesimally small elastic sphere, the effect of a tidal force is to distort the shape of the body without any change in volume. The sphere becomes an ellipsoid with two bulges, pointing towards and away from the other body. Larger objects distort into an ovoid, and are slightly compressed, which is what happens to the Earth&#x27;s oceans under the action of the Moon. All parts of the Earth are subject to the Moon&#x27;s gravitational forces, causing the water in the oceans to redistribute, forming bulges on the sides near the Moon and far from the Moon.

When a body rotates while subject to tidal forces, internal friction results in the gradual dissipation of its rotational kinetic energy as heat. In the case for the Earth, and Earth&#x27;s Moon, the loss of rotational kinetic energy results in a gain of about 2 milliseconds per century. If the body is close enough to its primary, this can result in a rotation which is tidally locked to the orbital motion, as in the case of the Earth&#x27;s moon. Tidal heating produces dramatic volcanic effects on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io. Stresses caused by tidal forces also cause a regular monthly pattern of moonquakes on Earth&#x27;s Moon.

Tidal forces contribute to ocean currents, which moderate global temperatures by transporting heat energy toward the poles. It has been suggested that variations in tidal forces correlate with cool periods in the global temperature record at 6- to 10-year intervals, and that harmonic beat variations in tidal forcing may contribute to millennial climate changes. No strong link to millennial climate changes has been found to date.
Tidal effects become particularly pronounced near small bodies of high mass, such as neutron stars or black holes, where they are responsible for the &quot;spaghettification&quot; of infalling matter. Tidal forces create the oceanic tide of Earth&#x27;s oceans, where the attracting bodies are the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. Tidal forces are also responsible for tidal locking, tidal acceleration, and tidal heating. Tides may also induce seismicity.

By generating conducting fluids within the interior of the Earth, tidal forces also affect the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

== Formulation ==

For a given (externally generated) gravitational field, the tidal acceleration at a point with respect to a body is obtained by vector subtraction of the gravitational acceleration at the center of the body (due to the given externally generated field) from the gravitational acceleration (due to the same field) at the given point. Correspondingly, the term &quot;tidal force&quot; is used to describe the forces due to tidal acceleration. Note that for these purposes the only gravitational field considered is the external one; the gravitational field of the body (as shown in the graphic) is not relevant. (In other words, the comparison is with the conditions at the given point as they would be if there were no externally generated field acting unequally at the given point and at the center of the reference body. The externally generated field is usually that produced by a perturbing third body, often the Sun or the Moon in the frequent example-cases of points on or above the Earth&#x27;s surface in a geocentric reference frame.)

Tidal acceleration does not require rotation or orbiting bodies; for example, the body may be freefalling in a straight line under the influence of a gravitational field while still being influenced by (changing) tidal acceleration.

By Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation and laws of motion, a body of mass &quot;m&quot; at distance &quot;R&quot; from the center of a sphere of mass &quot;M&quot; feels a force formula_1,

formula_2

equivalent to an acceleration formula_3,

formula_4

where formula_5 is a unit vector pointing from the body &quot;M&quot; to the body &quot;m&quot; (here, acceleration from &quot;m&quot; towards &quot;M&quot; has negative sign).

Consider now the acceleration due to the sphere of mass &quot;M&quot; experienced by a particle in the vicinity of the body of mass &quot;m&quot;. With &quot;R&quot; as the distance from the center of &quot;M&quot; to the center of &quot;m&quot;, let ∆&quot;r&quot; be the (relatively small) distance of the particle from the center of the body of mass &quot;m&quot;. For simplicity, distances are first considered only in the direction pointing towards or away from the sphere of mass &quot;M&quot;. If the body of mass &quot;m&quot; is itself a sphere of radius ∆&quot;r&quot;, then the new particle considered may be located on its surface, at a distance (&quot;R&quot; ± &quot;∆r&quot;) from the centre of the sphere of mass &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;∆r&quot; may be taken as positive where the particle&#x27;s distance from &quot;M&quot; is greater than &quot;R&quot;. Leaving aside whatever gravitational acceleration may be experienced by the particle towards &quot;m&quot; on account of &quot;m&quot;″s own mass, we have the acceleration on the particle due to gravitational force towards &quot;M&quot; as:

formula_6

Pulling out the &quot;R&quot;2 term from the denominator gives:

formula_7

The Maclaurin series of formula_8 is formula_9 which gives a series expansion of:

formula_10

The first term is the gravitational acceleration due to &quot;M&quot; at the center of the reference body formula_11, i.e., at the point where formula_12 is zero. This term does not affect the observed acceleration of particles on the surface of &quot;m&quot; because with respect to &quot;M&quot;, &quot;m&quot; (and everything on its surface) is in free fall. When the force on the far particle is subtracted from the force on the near particle, this first term cancels, as do all other even-order terms. The remaining (residual) terms represent the difference mentioned above and are tidal force (acceleration) terms. When ∆&quot;r&quot; is small compared to &quot;R&quot;, the terms after the first residual term are very small and can be neglected, giving the approximate tidal acceleration formula_13 for the distances ∆&quot;r&quot; considered, along the axis joining the centers of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;M&quot;:

formula_14

When calculated in this way for the case where ∆&quot;r&quot; is a distance along the axis joining the centers of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, formula_15 is directed outwards from to the center of &quot;m&quot; (where ∆&quot;r&quot; is zero).

Tidal accelerations can also be calculated away from the axis connecting the bodies &quot;m&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, requiring a vector calculation. In the plane perpendicular to that axis, the tidal acceleration is directed inwards (towards the center where ∆&quot;r&quot; is zero), and its magnitude is formula_16 in linear approximation as in Figure 2.

The tidal accelerations at the surfaces of planets in the Solar System are generally very small. For example, the lunar tidal acceleration at the Earth&#x27;s surface along the Moon–Earth axis is about , while the solar tidal acceleration at the Earth&#x27;s surface along the Sun–Earth axis is about , where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration at the Earth&#x27;s surface. Hence the tide-raising force (acceleration) due to the Sun is about 45% of that due to the Moon. The solar tidal acceleration at the Earth&#x27;s surface was first given by Newton in the &quot;Principia&quot;.

<doc id="30722" wikidata="Q207691" url="?curid=30722" title="Theremin">
<text>The theremin (; originally known as the ætherphone, etherphone, thereminophone or termenvox/thereminvox) is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the performer (who is known as a thereminist). It is named after its inventor, Leon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928.

The instrument&#x27;s controlling section usually consists of two metal antennas which function not as radio antennas but rather as position sensors. Each antenna forms one half of a capacitor with each of the thereminist&#x27;s hands as the other half of the capacitor. These antennas capacitively sense the relative position of the hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, and amplitude (volume) with the other. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.

The sound of the instrument is often associated with situations. The theremin has been used in movie soundtracks such as Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s &quot;Spellbound&quot; and &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, and Justin Hurwitz&#x27;s &quot;First Man&quot;, as well as in theme songs for television shows such as the ITV drama &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot;, the latter composed by Natalie Holt. The theremin is also used in concert music (especially avant-garde and 20th- and 21st-century new music); for example, Mano Divina Giannone is a popular American thereminist who along with his orchestra, The Divine Hand Ensemble, regularly holds said concerts. It is also used in popular music genres, such as rock.

== History ==

The theremin was the product of Soviet government-sponsored research into proximity sensors. The instrument was invented in October 1920 by the Russian physicist Lev Sergeyevich Termen, known in the West as Leon Theremin. After a lengthy tour of Europe, during which time he demonstrated his invention to packed houses, Theremin moved to the United States, where he patented his invention in 1928. Subsequently, Theremin granted commercial production rights to RCA.

Although the RCA Thereminvox (released immediately following the Stock Market Crash of 1929) was not a commercial success, it fascinated audiences in America and abroad. Clara Rockmore, a well-known thereminist, toured to wide acclaim, performing a classical repertoire in concert halls around the United States, often sharing the bill with Paul Robeson. Joseph Whiteley (1894–1984) performed under the stage name Musaire and his 1930 RCA Theremin can be seen, played and heard at the Musical Museum, Brentford, England.

During the 1930s, Lucie Bigelow Rosen was also taken with the theremin and together with her husband Walter Bigelow Rosen provided both financial and artistic support to the development and popularisation of the instrument.

In 1938, Theremin left the United States, though the circumstances related to his departure are in dispute. Many accounts claim he was taken from his New York City apartment by NKVD agents (preceding the KGB), taken back to the Soviet Union and made to work in a &quot;sharashka&quot; laboratory prison camp at Magadan, Siberia. He reappeared 30 years later. In his 2000 biography of the inventor, &quot;Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage&quot;, Albert Glinsky suggested he had fled to escape crushing personal debts, and was then caught up in Stalin&#x27;s political purges. In any case, Theremin did not return to the United States until 1991.
After a flurry of interest in America following the end of the Second World War, the theremin soon fell into disuse with serious musicians, mainly because newer electronic instruments were introduced that were easier to play. However, a niche interest in the theremin persisted, mostly among electronics enthusiasts and kit-building hobbyists. One of these electronics enthusiasts, Robert Moog, began building theremins in the 1950s, while he was a high-school student. Moog subsequently published a number of articles about building theremins, and sold theremin kits that were intended to be assembled by the customer. Moog credited what he learned from the experience as leading directly to his groundbreaking synthesizer, the Moog. (Around 1955, a colleague of Moog&#x27;s, electronic music pioneer Raymond Scott, purchased one of Moog&#x27;s theremin subassemblies to incorporate into a new invention, the Clavivox, which was intended to be an easy-to-use keyboard theremin.)

Since the release of the film &quot;&quot; in 1993, the instrument has enjoyed a resurgence in interest and has become more widely used by contemporary musicians. Even though many theremin sounds can be approximated on many modern synthesizers, some musicians continue to appreciate the expressiveness, novelty, and uniqueness of using an actual theremin. The film itself has received positive reviews.

Both theremin instruments and kits are available. The Open Theremin, an open hardware and open software project, was developed by Swiss microengineer Urz Gaudenz, using the original heterodyne oscillator architecture for a good playing experience, combined with Arduino. Using a few extra components, a MIDI interface can be added to the Open Theremin, enabling a player to use their theremin to control different instrument sounds.

The theremin&#x27;s singular operation method has been praised for providing an accessible route to music-making for people with disabilities.

== Operating principles ==

The theremin is distinguished among musical instruments in that it is played without physical contact. The thereminist stands in front of the instrument and moves their hands in the proximity of two metal antennas. While commonly called antennas, they are not used as radio antennae for receiving or broadcasting radio waves, but rather act as plates of capacitors. The distance from one antenna determines frequency (pitch), and the distance from the other controls amplitude (volume). Higher notes are played by moving the hand closer to the pitch antenna. Louder notes are played by moving the hand away from the volume antenna.

Most frequently, the right hand controls the pitch and the left controls the volume, although some performers reverse this arrangement. Some low-cost theremins use a conventional, knob-operated volume control and have only the pitch antenna.

The theremin uses the heterodyne principle to generate an audio signal. The instrument&#x27;s pitch circuitry includes two radio frequency oscillators set below 500 kHz to minimize radio interference. One oscillator operates at a fixed frequency. The frequency of the other oscillator is almost identical, and is controlled by the performer&#x27;s distance from the pitch control antenna.

The performer&#x27;s hand has significant body capacitance, and thus can be treated as the grounded plate of a variable capacitor in an L-C (inductance-capacitance) circuit, which is part of the oscillator and determines its frequency. In the simplest designs, the antenna is directly coupled to the tuned circuit of the oscillator and the &#x27;pitch field&#x27;, that is the change of note with distance, is highly nonlinear, as the capacitance change with distance is far greater near the antenna. In such systems, when the antenna is removed, the oscillator moves up in frequency.
To partly linearise the pitch field, the antenna may be wired in series with an inductor to form a series tuned circuit, resonating with the parallel combination of the antenna&#x27;s intrinsic capacitance and the capacitance of the player&#x27;s hand in proximity to the antenna. This series tuned circuit is then connected in parallel with the parallel tuned circuit of the variable pitch oscillator. With the antenna circuit disconnected, the oscillator is tuned to a frequency slightly higher than the stand-alone resonant frequency of the antenna circuit. At that frequency, the antenna and its linearisation coil present an inductive impedance; and when connected, behaves as an inductor in parallel with the oscillator. Thus, connecting the antenna and linearising coil raises the oscillation frequency. Close to the resonant frequency of the antenna circuit, the effective inductance is small, and the effect on the oscillator is greatest; farther from it, the effective inductance is larger, and fractional change on the oscillator is reduced.

When the hand is distant from the antenna, the resonant frequency of the antenna series circuit is at its highest; i.e., it is closest to the free running frequency of the oscillator, and small changes in antenna capacitance have greatest effect. Under this condition, the effective inductance in the tank circuit is at its minimum and the oscillation frequency is at its maximum. The steepening rate of change of shunt impedance with hand position compensates for the reduced influence of the hand being further away. With careful tuning, a near linear region of pitch field can be created over the central two or three octaves of operation. Using optimized pitch field linearisation, circuits can be made where a change in capacitance between the performer and the instrument in the order of 0.01 picofarads produces a full octave of frequency shift.

The mixer produces the audio-range difference between the frequencies of the two oscillators at each moment, which is the tone that is then wave shaped and amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.

To control volume, the performer&#x27;s other hand acts as the grounded plate of another variable capacitor. As in the tone circuit, the distance between the performer&#x27;s hand and the volume control antenna determines the capacitance and hence natural resonant frequency of an LC circuit inductively coupled to another fixed LC oscillator circuit operating at a slightly higher resonant frequency. When a hand approaches the antenna, the natural frequency of that circuit is lowered by the extra capacitance, which detunes the oscillator and lowers its resonant plate current.

In the earliest theremins, the radio frequency plate current of the oscillator is picked up by another winding and used to power the filament of another diode-connected triode, which thus acts as a variable conductance element changing the output amplitude. The harmonic timbre of the output, not being a pure tone, was an important feature of the theremin. Theremin&#x27;s original design included audio frequency series/parallel LC formant filters as well as a 3-winding variable-saturation transformer to control or induce harmonics in the audio output.

Modern circuit designs often simplify this circuit and avoid the complexity of two heterodyne oscillators by having a single pitch oscillator, akin to the original theremin&#x27;s volume circuit. This approach is usually less stable and cannot generate the low frequencies that a heterodyne oscillator can. Better designs (e.g., Moog, Theremax) may use two pairs of heterodyne oscillators, for both pitch and volume.

== Performance technique ==

Important in theremin articulation is the use of the volume control antenna. Unlike touched instruments, where simply halting play or damping a resonator in the traditional sense silences the instrument, the thereminist must &quot;play the rests, as well as the notes&quot;, as Clara Rockmore observed.

If the pitch hand is moved between notes, without first lowering the volume hand, the result is a &quot;swooping&quot; sound akin to a swanee whistle or a glissando played on the violin. Small flutters of the pitch hand can be used to produce a vibrato effect. To produce distinct notes requires a pecking action with the volume hand to mute the volume while the pitch hand moves between positions.

Thereminists such as Carolina Eyck use a fixed arm position per octave, and use fixed positions of the fingers to create the notes within the octave, allowing very fast transitions between adjacent notes.

Although volume technique is less developed than pitch technique, some thereminists have worked to extend it, especially Pamelia Kurstin with her &quot;walking bass&quot; technique and Rupert Chappelle.

The critic Harold C. Schonberg described the sound of the theremin as &quot;[a] cello lost in a dense fog, crying because it does not know how to get home.&quot;

== Uses ==
=== Concert music ===
The first orchestral composition written for theremin was Andrei Pashchenko&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Mystery&quot;, which premiered in 1924. However, most of the sheet music was lost after its second performance.

Other concert composers who have written for theremin include Bohuslav Martinů, Percy Grainger, Christian Wolff, Joseph Schillinger, Moritz Eggert, Iraida Yusupova, Jorge Antunes, Vladimir Komarov, Anis Fuleihan, and Fazıl Say. Another large-scale theremin concerto is Kalevi Aho&#x27;s Concerto for Theremin and Chamber Orchestra &quot;Eight Seasons&quot; (2011), written for Carolina Eyck.

Edgard Varèse completed the composition &quot;Equatorial&quot; for two theremin cellos and percussion in 1934. His work was a stated influence throughout the career of Frank Zappa, who also composed for theremin.

Maverick composer Percy Grainger chose to use ensembles of four or six theremins (in preference to a string quartet) for his two earliest experimental &quot;Free Music&quot; compositions (1935–1937) because of the instrument&#x27;s complete &#x27;gliding&#x27; freedom of pitch.

Musician Jean-Michel Jarre used the instrument in his concerts Oxygène in Moscow in 1997 and Space of Freedom in Gdańsk in 2005, providing also a short history of Leon Theremin&#x27;s life.

The five-piece Spaghetti Western Orchestra use a theremin as a replacement for Edda Dell&#x27;Orso&#x27;s vocals in their interpretation of Ennio Morricone&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;.

Other notable contemporary theremin players include Pamelia Kurstin, Peter Theremin, Natasha Theremin, Katica Illényi. and Lydia Kavina, Dutch classical musician Thorwald Jørgensen has been described as &quot;one of the most important exponents of classical music on the theremin&quot;.

In 2019 in Kobe, Japan, the Matryomin ensemble, a group of 289 theremin players that included Natasha Theremin, Masha Theremin and Peter Theremin, the daughter, granddaughter and great-grandson of the inventor, achieved a Guinness world record as the largest ensemble of the instrument. The name &quot;Matryomin&quot; is a portmanteau by its inventor of the words &quot;matryoshka&quot; and &quot;theremin&quot;. The theremin concerto &quot;Dancefloor With Pulsing&quot; by the French composer Regis Campo was written for Carolina Eyck and premiered with the Brussels Philharmonic in 2018.

=== Popular music ===
Theremins and theremin-like sounds started to be incorporated into popular music from the end of the 1940s (with a series of Samuel Hoffman/Harry Revel collaborations) and has continued, with various degrees of popularity, to the present.

Lothar and the Hand People were the first rock band known to perform live with a theremin in November 1965. In fact, Lothar was the name they gave to their Moog theremin.

The Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 single &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;—though it does not technically contain a theremin—is the most frequently cited example of the instrument in pop music. The song actually features a similar-sounding instrument invented by Paul Tanner called an Electro-Theremin. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins and increased the awareness of analog synthesizers. In response to requests by the band, Moog Music began producing its own brand of ribbon-controlled instruments which would mimic the sound of a theremin.

Frank Zappa also included the theremin on the albums &quot;Freak Out!&quot; (1966) and &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; (1967).

Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin used a variation of the theremin (pitch antenna only) during performances of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;No Quarter&quot; throughout the performance history of Led Zeppelin, an extended multi-instrumental solo featuring theremin and bowed guitar in 1977, as well as the soundtrack for &quot;Death Wish II&quot;, released in 1982.

Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also used the instrument on the group&#x27;s 1967 albums &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; and &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;.

Tesla guitarist Frank Hannon used a theremin in the band&#x27;s song &quot;Edison&#x27;s Medicine&quot; from the 1991 album &quot;Psychotic Supper&quot;. Hannon is also seen using the instrument in the song&#x27;s music video at the 2:40 mark.

The Lothars are a Boston-area band formed in early 1997 whose CDs have featured as many as four theremins played at once – a first for pop music.

Although credited with a on the track &quot;Mysterons&quot; from the album &quot;Dummy&quot;, Portishead actually used a monophonic synthesizer to achieve theremin-like effects, as confirmed by Adrian Utley, who is credited as playing the instrument; on the songs &quot;Half Day Closing&quot;, &quot;Humming&quot;, &quot;The Rip&quot;, and &quot;Machine Gun&quot; he has actually used a custom-made theremin.

Page McConnell, keyboardist of the American rock band Phish, plays the theremin on rare occasions. His last notable performance was on 6 August 2017, the final evening of the band&#x27;s 13-night residency at Madison Square Garden.

When Simon and Garfunkel performed their song &quot;The Boxer&quot; during a concert at Madison Square Garden in December 2003, they utilized a theremin. The original recording of the song had featured a steel guitar and a piccolo trumpet in unison in the solo interlude, but for this performance, thereminist Rob Schwimmer played the solo.

=== Film music ===
Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the first to incorporate parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces, including a use in his score for the film (, 1931, Leonid Trauberg and Grigori Kozintsev). While the theremin was not widely used in classical music performances, the instrument found great success in many motion pictures, notably, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;The Red House&quot;, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (all three of which were written by Miklós Rózsa, the composer who pioneered the use of the instrument in Hollywood scores), &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot;, &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot;, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, &quot;Castle in the Air&quot;, and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. The theremin is played and identified as such in the Jerry Lewis movie &quot;The Delicate Delinquent&quot;. The theremin is prominent in the score for the 1956 short film &quot;A Short Vision&quot;, which was aired on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; the same year that it was used by the Hungarian composer Mátyás Seiber. More recent appearances in film scores include &quot;Monster House&quot;, &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, &quot;The Machinist&quot; and &quot;The Electrical Life of Louis Wain&quot; (2021), (last three featuring Lydia Kavina), as well as &quot;First Man&quot; (2018).

A theremin was not used for the soundtrack of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, for which Bebe and Louis Barron built disposable oscillator circuits and a ring modulator to create the electronic tonalities used in the film.

Los Angeles–based thereminist Charles Richard Lester is featured on the soundtrack of &quot;Monster House&quot; and has performed the US premiere of Gavriil Popov&#x27;s 1932 score for &quot;Komsomol – Patron of Electrification&quot; with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Esa-Pekka Salonen in 2007.

In Lenny Abrahamson&#x27;s 2014 film, &quot;Frank&quot;, Clara, the character played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, plays the theremin in a band named Soronprfbs.

=== Theatre and performing arts ===
Charlie Rosen, orchestrator of the Broadway musical &quot;Be More Chill&quot;, credits the show as being the first on Broadway to have a theremin in its band.

=== Television ===

* In May 2007, the White Castle American hamburger restaurant chain introduced a television advertisement centered around a live theremin performance by musician Jon Bernhardt of the band &quot;The Lothars.&quot; It is the only known example of a theremin performance being the focus of an advertisement.
* Celia Sheen plays the theremin in the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; series.
* In October 2008, comedian, musician, and theremin enthusiast Bill Bailey played a theremin during his performance of Bill Bailey&#x27;s Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall, which has subsequently been televised. He had previously also written an article, presented a radio show and incorporated the theremin in some of his televised comedy tours.
* Charlie Draper plays the theremin in the soundtrack (written by Natalie Holt) for TV series &quot;Loki&quot; on Disney+.
=== Video games ===
* A theremin-inspired tune serves as the theme for the Edison family in the NES port of &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;
* Lydia Kavina&#x27;s solo theremin is featured on the soundtrack for the 2006 MMORPG computer game &quot;Soul of the Ultimate Nation&quot;, composed by Howard Shore.

=== &quot;The First Theremin Concert for Extraterrestrials&quot; ===

&quot;The First Theremin Concert for Extraterrestrials&quot; was the world&#x27;s first musical METI broadcast dispatched from the Evpatoria deep-space communications complex in Crimea, and was sent seven years before NASA&#x27;s Across the Universe message. Seven different melodies were transmitted from audio-cassette recordings of the theremin being played by Lydia Kavina, Yana Aksenova, and Anton Kerchenko, all from the Moscow Theremin Center. These seven melodies were:
# &quot;Egress alone I to the Ride&quot; by E. Shashina
# The finale of the &quot;9th Symphony&quot; by Beethoven
# &quot;The Four Seasons: Spring,&quot; &quot;Allegro&quot; by Vivaldi
# &quot;The Swan&quot; by Saint-Saens
# &quot;Vocalise&quot; by Rachmaninoff
# &quot;Summertime&quot; by Gershwin
# Russian folk song &quot;Kalinka-Malinka&quot;
They were played in succession six times over the span of three days from August–September 2001 during the transmission of Teen Age Message, an interstellar radio message.

<text>In computer networking, a thin client, sometimes called slim client or lean client, is a simple (low-performance) computer that has been optimized for establishing a remote connection with a server-based computing environment. They are sometimes known as &quot;network computers&quot;, or in their simplest form as &quot;zero clients&quot;. The server does most of the work, which can include launching software programs, performing calculations, and storing data. This contrasts with a rich client or a conventional personal computer; the former is also intended for working in a client–server model but has significant local processing power, while the latter aims to perform its function mostly locally. 

Thin clients occur as components of a broader computing infrastructure, where many clients share their computations with a server or server farm. The server-side infrastructure uses cloud computing software such as application virtualization, hosted shared desktop (HSD) or desktop virtualization (VDI). This combination forms what is known as a cloud-based system, where desktop resources are centralized at one or more data centers. The benefits of centralization are hardware resource optimization, reduced software maintenance, and improved security.

* Example of hardware resource optimization: Cabling, bussing and I/O can be minimized while idle memory and processing power can be applied to user sessions that most need it.
* Example of reduced software maintenance: Software patching and operating system (OS) migrations can be applied, tested and activated for all users in one instance to accelerate roll-out and improve administrative efficiency.
* Example of improved security: Software assets are centralized and easily fire-walled, monitored and protected. Sensitive data is uncompromised in cases of desktop loss or theft.

Thin client hardware generally supports common peripherals, such as keyboards, mice, monitors, jacks for sound peripherals, and open ports for USB devices (e.g., printer, flash drive, webcam). Some thin clients include (legacy) serial or parallel ports to support older devices, such as receipt printers, scales or time clocks. Thin client software typically consists of a graphical user interface (GUI), cloud access agents (e.g., RDP, ICA, PCoIP), a local web browser, terminal emulators (in some cases), and a basic set of local utilities.

==Characteristics==

===Architecture===
In using cloud-based architecture, the server takes on the processing load of several client sessions, acting as a host for each endpoint device. The client software is narrowly purposed and lightweight; therefore, only the host server or server farm needs to be secured, rather than securing software installed on every endpoint device (although thin clients may still require basic security and strong authentication to prevent unauthorized access). One of the combined benefits of using cloud architecture with thin client desktops is that critical IT assets are centralized for better utilization of resources. Unused memory, bussing lanes, and processor cores within an individual user session, for example, can be leveraged for other active user sessions.

The simplicity of thin client hardware and software results in a very low total cost of ownership, but some of these initial savings can be offset by the need for a more robust cloud infrastructure required on the server side.

An alternative to traditional server deployment which spreads out infrastructure costs over time is a cloud-based subscription model known as desktop as a service, which allows IT organizations to outsource the cloud infrastructure to a third party.

===Simplicity===
Thin client computing is known to simplify the desktop endpoints by reducing the client-side software footprint. With a lightweight, read-only operating system (OS), client-side setup and administration is greatly reduced. Cloud access is the primary role of a thin client which eliminates the need for a large suite of local user applications, data storage, and utilities. This architecture shifts most of the software execution burden from the endpoint to the data center. User assets are centralized for greater visibility. Data recovery and desktop repurposing tasks are also centralized for faster service and greater scalability.

===Hardware===
While the server must be robust enough to handle several client sessions at once, thin client hardware requirements are minimal compared to that of a traditional PC laptop or desktop. Most thin clients have low-energy processors, flash storage, memory, and no moving parts. This reduces the cost, power consumption (heat, noise and vibrations), making them affordable to own and easy to replace or deploy. Numerous thin clients also use Raspberry Pis. Since thin clients consist of fewer hardware components than a traditional desktop PC, they can operate in more hostile environments. And because they typically don&#x27;t store critical data locally, risk of theft is minimized because there is little or no user data to be compromised.

===Graphics===
Modern thin clients have come a long way to meet the demands of today&#x27;s graphical computing needs. New generations of low energy chipset and central processing unit (CPU) combinations improve processing power and graphical capabilities. To minimize latency of high resolution video sent across the network, some host software stacks leverage multimedia redirection (MMR) techniques to offload video rendering to the desktop device. Video codecs are often embedded on the thin client to support these various multimedia formats. Other host software stacks makes use of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in order to accelerate fast changing pixel updates required by modern video content. Thin clients typically support local software agents capable of accepting and decoding UDP.

Some of the more graphically intense use cases remain a challenge for thin clients. These use cases might include applications like photo editors, 3D drawing programs, and animation tools. This can be addressed at the host server using dedicated GPU cards, allocation of vGPUs (virtual GPU), workstation cards, and hardware acceleration cards. These solutions allow IT administrators to provide power-user performance where it is needed to a relatively generic endpoint device such as a thin client.

===Limitations===
To achieve such simplicity, thin clients sometimes lag behind desktop PCs in terms of extensibility. For example, if a local software utility or set of device drivers are needed in order to support a locally attached peripheral device (e.g. printer, scanner, biometric security device), the thin client operating system may lack the resources needed to fully integrate the required dependencies (although dependencies can sometimes be added if they can be identified). Modern thin clients address this limitation via port mapping or USB redirection software. However, these methods cannot address all scenarios. Therefore, it is good practice to perform validation tests of locally attached peripherals in advance to ensure compatibility. Further, in large distributed desktop environments, printers are often networked, negating the need for device drivers on every desktop.

While running local productivity applications goes beyond the normal scope of a thin client, it is sometimes needed in rare use cases. License restrictions that apply to thin clients can sometimes prevent them from supporting these applications. Local storage constraints may also limit the space required to install large applications or application suites.

It is also important to acknowledge that network bandwidth and performance is more critical in any type of cloud-based computing model. IT organizations must ensure that their network can accommodate the number of users that they need to serve. If demand for bandwidth exceeds network limits, it could result in a major loss of end user productivity.

A similar risk exists inside the data center. Servers must be sized correctly in order to deliver adequate performance to end users. In a cloud-based computing model, the servers can also represent a single point of failure risk. If a server fails, end users lose access to all of the resources supported by that server. This risk can be mitigated by building redundancies, fail-over processes, backups, and load balancing utilities into the system. Redundancy provides reliable host availability but it can add cost to smaller user populations that lack scale.

===Providers===
Popular providers of thin clients include Chip PC Technologies, Dell (acquired Wyse Technology in 2012), HP, ClearCube, IGEL Technology, LG, NComputing, Stratodesk, Samsung Electronics, ThinClient Direct, and ZeeTim.

==History==
Thin clients have their roots in multi-user systems, traditionally mainframes accessed by some sort of computer terminal. As computer graphics matured, these terminals transitioned from providing a command-line interface to a full graphical user interface, as is common on modern advanced thin clients. The prototypical multi-user environment along these lines, Unix, began to support fully graphical X terminals, i.e., devices running display server software, from about 1984. X terminals remained relatively popular even after the arrival of other thin clients in the mid-late 1990s. Modern Unix derivatives like BSD and Linux continue the tradition of the multi-user, remote display/input session. Typically, X software is not made available on non-X-based thin clients, although no technical reason for this exclusion would prevent it.

Windows NT became capable of multi-user operations primarily through the efforts of Citrix Systems, which repackaged Windows NT 3.51 as the multi-user operating system WinFrame in 1995, launched in coordination with Wyse Technology&#x27;s Winterm thin client. Microsoft licensed this technology back from Citrix and implemented it into Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, under a project codenamed &quot;Hydra&quot;. Windows NT then became the basis of Windows 2000 and Windows XP. , Microsoft Windows systems support graphical terminals via the Remote Desktop Services component. The Wyse Winterm was the first Windows-display-focused thin client (AKA Windows Terminal) to access this environment.

The term &quot;thin client&quot; was coined in 1993 by Tim Negris, VP of Server Marketing at Oracle Corporation, while working with company founder Larry Ellison on the launch of Oracle 7. At the time, Oracle wished to differentiate their server-oriented software from Microsoft&#x27;s desktop-oriented products. Ellison subsequently popularized Negris&#x27; buzzword with frequent use in his speeches and interviews about Oracle products. Ellison would go on to be a founding board member of thin client maker Network Computer, Inc (NCI), later renamed Liberate.

The term stuck for several reasons. The earlier term &quot;graphical terminal&quot; had been chosen to distinguish such terminals from text-based terminals, and thus put the emphasis heavily on &quot;graphics&quot; – which became obsolete as a distinguishing characteristic in the 1990s as text-only physical terminals themselves became obsolete, and text-only computer systems (a few of which existed in the 1980s) were no longer manufactured. The term &quot;thin client&quot; also conveys better what was then viewed as the fundamental difference: thin clients can be designed with less expensive hardware, because they have reduced computational workloads.

By the 2010s, thin clients were not the only desktop devices for general purpose computing that were &quot;thin&quot; – in the sense of having a small form factor and being relatively inexpensive. The nettop form factor for desktop PCs was introduced, and nettops could run full feature Windows or Linux; tablets, tablet-laptop hybrids had also entered the market. However, while there was now little size difference, thin clients retained some key advantages over these competitors, such as not needing a local drive. However, &quot;thin client&quot; can be a misnomer for slim form-factor computers using flash memory such as compactflash, SD card, or permanent flash memory as a hard disk substitute. In 2013, a Citrix employee experimented with a Raspberry Pi as a thin client. Since then, several manufacturers have introduced their version of Raspberry Pi thin clients.

<doc id="30731" wikidata="Q729193" url="?curid=30731" title="Teleological argument">
<text>The teleological argument (from ) also known as physico-theological argument, argument from design, or intelligent design argument, is a rational argument for the existence of God or, more generally, that complex functionality in the natural world, which looks designed, is evidence of an intelligent creator. 
The earliest recorded versions of this argument are associated with Socrates in ancient Greece, although it has been argued that he was taking up an older argument. Later, Plato and Aristotle developed complex approaches to the proposal that the cosmos has an intelligent cause, but it was the Stoics during the Roman era who, under their influence, &quot;developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label &#x27;The Argument from Design&#x27;&quot;.

Since the Roman era, various versions of the teleological argument have been associated with the Abrahamic religions. In the Middle Ages, Islamic theologians such as Al-Ghazali used the argument, although it was rejected as unnecessary by Quranic literalists, and as unconvincing by many Islamic philosophers. Later, the teleological argument was accepted by Saint Thomas Aquinas, and included as the fifth of his &quot;Five Ways&quot; of proving the existence of God. In early modern England, clergymen such as William Turner and John Ray were well-known proponents. In the early 18th century, William Derham published his &quot;Physico-Theology&quot;, which gave his &quot;demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation&quot;. Later, William Paley, in his 1802 &quot;Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity&quot; published a prominent presentation of the design argument with his version of the watchmaker analogy and the first use of the phrase &quot;argument from design&quot;.

From its beginning, there have been numerous criticisms of the different versions of the teleological argument. Some have been written as responses to criticisms of non-teleological natural science which are associated with it. Especially important were the general logical arguments presented by David Hume in his &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;, published in 1779, and the explanation of biological complexity given in Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;, published in 1859. Since the 1960s, Paley&#x27;s arguments have been influential in the development of a creation science movement which used phrases such as &quot;design by an intelligent designer&quot;, and after 1987 this was rebranded as &quot;intelligent design&quot;, promoted by the intelligent design movement which refers to an intelligent designer. Both movements have used the teleological argument to argue against the modern scientific understanding of evolution, and to claim that supernatural explanations should be given equal validity in the public school science curriculum.

Starting already in classical Greece, two approaches to the teleological argument developed, distinguished by their understanding of whether the natural order was literally created or not. The non-creationist approach starts most clearly with Aristotle, although many thinkers, such as the Neoplatonists, believed it was already intended by Plato. This approach is not creationist in a simple sense, because while it agrees that a cosmic intelligence is responsible for the natural order, it rejects the proposal that this requires a &quot;creator&quot; to physically make and maintain this order. The Neoplatonists did not find the teleological argument convincing, and in this they were followed by medieval philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna. Later, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas considered the argument acceptable, but not necessarily the best argument.

While the concept of an intelligence behind the natural order is ancient, a rational argument that concludes that we can know that the natural world has a designer, or a creating intelligence which has human-like purposes, appears to have begun with classical philosophy. Religious thinkers in Judaism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity also developed versions of the teleological argument. Later, variants on the argument from design were produced in Western philosophy and by Christian fundamentalism.

Contemporary defenders of the teleological argument are mainly Christians, for example Richard Swinburne and John Lennox.

== Classical philosophy ==

===Socrates and the pre-Socratics===
The argument from intelligent design appears to have begun with Socrates, although the concept of a cosmic intelligence is older and David Sedley has argued that Socrates was developing an older idea, citing Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, born about 500 BC, as a possible earlier proponent. The proposal that the order of nature showed evidence of having its own human-like &quot;intelligence&quot; goes back to the origins of Greek natural philosophy and science, and its attention to the orderliness of nature, often with special reference to the revolving of the heavens. Anaxagoras is the first person who is definitely known to have explained such a concept using the word &quot;nous&quot; (which is the original Greek term that leads to modern English &quot;intelligence&quot; via its Latin and French translations). Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher from Clazomenae named Hermotimus who had taken a similar position. Amongst Pre-Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar intelligent ordering principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example Empedocles, like Hesiod much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of love, and Pythagoras and Heraclitus attributed the cosmos with &quot;reason&quot; (&quot;logos&quot;). In his &quot;Philebus&quot; 28c Plato has Socrates speak of this as a tradition, saying that &quot;all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (&quot;nous&quot;) is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right.&quot; and later states that the ensuing discussion &quot;confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (&quot;nous&quot;) always rules the universe&quot;.

Xenophon&#x27;s report in his &quot;Memorabilia&quot; might be the earliest clear account of an argument that there is evidence in nature of intelligent design. The word traditionally translated and discussed as &quot;design&quot; is &quot;&quot; and Socrates is reported by Xenophon to have pressed doubting young men to look at things in the market, and consider whether they could tell which things showed evidence of &quot;gnōmē&quot;, and which seemed more to be by blind chance, and then to compare this to nature and consider whether it could be by blind chance. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;, Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras&#x27; concept of a cosmic &quot;nous&quot; as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras&#x27; understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras&#x27; materialist understanding of causation. Socrates complained that Anaxagoras restricted the work of the cosmic &quot;nous&quot; to the beginning, as if it were uninterested and all events since then just happened because of causes like air and water. Socrates, on the other hand, apparently insisted that the demiurge must be &quot;loving&quot;, particularly concerning humanity. (In this desire to go beyond Anaxagoras and make the cosmic &quot;nous&quot; a more active manager, Socrates was apparently preceded by Diogenes of Apollonia.); ; and

===Plato and Aristotle===
Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; is presented as a description of someone who is explaining a &quot;likely story&quot; in the form of a myth, and so throughout history commentators have disagreed about which elements of the myth can be seen as the position of Plato. Sedley (2007) nevertheless calls it &quot;the creationist manifesto&quot; and points out that although some of Plato&#x27;s followers denied that he intended it, in classical times writers such as Aristotle, Epicurus, the Stoics, and Galen all understood Plato as proposing the world originated in an &quot;intelligent creative act&quot;. Plato has a character explain the concept of a &quot;demiurge&quot; with supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work.

Plato&#x27;s teleological perspective is also built upon the analysis of &quot;a priori&quot; order and structure in the world that he had already presented in &quot;The Republic&quot;. The story does not propose creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;; rather, the demiurge made order from the chaos of the cosmos, imitating the eternal Forms.

Plato&#x27;s student and friend Aristotle (c. 384 – 322 BC), continued the Socratic tradition of criticising natural scientists such as Democritus who sought (as in modern science) to explain everything in terms of matter and chance motion. He was very influential in the future development of classical creationism, but was not a straightforward &quot;creationist&quot; because he required no creation interventions in nature, meaning he &quot;insulated god from any requirement to intervene in nature, either as creator or as administrator&quot;. Instead of direct intervention by a creator it is &quot;scarcely an exaggeration to say that for Aristotle the entire functioning of the natural world, as also the heavens, is ultimately to be understood as a shared striving towards godlike actuality&quot;. And whereas the myth in the &quot;Timaeus&quot; suggests that all living things are based on one single paradigm, not one for each species, and even tells a story of &quot;devolution&quot; whereby other living things devolved from humans, it was Aristotle who presented the influential idea that each type of normal living thing must be based on a fixed paradigm or form for that species.

Aristotle felt that biology was a particularly important example of a field where materialist natural science ignored information which was needed in order to understand living things well. For example birds use wings for the purpose of flight. Therefore the most complete explanation in regard to the natural, as well as the artificial, is for the most part teleological. In fact, proposals that species had changed by chance survival of the fittest, similar to what is now called &quot;natural selection&quot;, were already known to Aristotle, and he rejected these with the same logic. He conceded that monstrosities (new forms of life) could come about by chance, but he disagreed with those who ascribed all nature purely to chance because he believed science can only provide a general account of that which is normal, &quot;always, or for the most part&quot;. The distinction between what is normal, or by nature, and what is &quot;accidental&quot;, or not by nature, is important in Aristotle&#x27;s understanding of nature. As pointed out by Sedley, &quot;Aristotle is happy to say (&quot;Physics&quot; II 8, 199a33-b4) without the slightest fear of blasphemy, crafts make occasional mistakes; therefore, by analogy, so can nature.&quot; According to Aristotle the changes which happen by nature are caused by their &quot;formal causes&quot;, and for example in the case of a bird&#x27;s wings there is also a final cause which is the purpose of flying. He explicitly compared this to human technology:
The question of how to understand Aristotle&#x27;s conception of nature having a purpose and direction something like human activity is controversial in the details. Martha Nussbaum for example has argued that in his biology this approach was practical and meant to show nature only being analogous to human art, explanations of an organ being greatly informed by knowledge of its essential function. Nevertheless, Nussbaum&#x27;s position is not universally accepted. In any case, Aristotle was not understood this way by his followers in the Middle Ages, who saw him as consistent with monotheistic religion and a teleological understanding of all nature. Consistent with the medieval interpretation, in his &quot;Metaphysics&quot; and other works Aristotle clearly argued a case for there being one highest god or &quot;prime mover&quot; which was the ultimate cause, though specifically not the material cause, of the eternal forms or natures which cause the natural order, including all living things. He clearly refers to this entity having an intellect that humans somehow share in, which helps humans see the true natures or forms of things without relying purely on sense perception of physical things, including living species. This understanding of nature, and Aristotle&#x27;s arguments against materialist understandings of nature, were very influential in the Middle Ages in Europe. The idea of fixed species remained dominant in biology until Darwin, and a focus upon biology is still common today in teleological criticisms of modern science.

===Roman era===
It was the Stoics who &quot;developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label &#x27;The Argument from Design&#x27;&quot;. Cicero (c. 106 – c. 43 BC) reported the teleological argument of the Stoics in &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of the Gods&quot;) Book II, which includes an early version of the watchmaker analogy, which was later developed by William Paley. He has one of the characters in the dialogue say:
Another very important classical supporter of the teleological argument was Galen, whose compendious works were one of the major sources of medical knowledge until modern times, both in Europe and the medieval Islamic world. He was not a Stoic, but like them he looked back to the Socratics and was constantly engaged in arguing against atomists such as the Epicureans. Unlike Aristotle (who was however a major influence upon him), and unlike the Neoplatonists, he believed there was really evidence for something literally like the &quot;demiurge&quot; found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, which worked physical upon nature. In works such as his &quot;On the Usefulness of Parts&quot; he explained evidence for it in the complexity of animal construction. His work shows &quot;early signs of contact and contrast between the pagan and the Judaeo-Christian tradition of creation&quot;, criticizing the account found in the Bible. &quot;Moses, he suggests, would have contented himself with saying that God ordered the eyelashes not to grow and that they obeyed. In contrast to this, the Platonic tradition&#x27;s Demiurge is above all else a technician.&quot; Surprisingly, neither Aristotle nor Plato, but Xenophon are considered by Galen, as the best writer on this subject. Galen shared with Xenophon a scepticism of the value of books about most speculative philosophy, except for inquiries such as whether there is &quot;something in the world superior in power and wisdom to man&quot;. This he saw as having an everyday importance, a usefulness for living well. He also asserted that Xenophon was the author who reported the real position of Socrates, including his aloofness from many types of speculative science and philosophy.

Galen&#x27;s connection of the teleological argument to discussions about the complexity of living things, and his insistence that this is possible for a practical scientist, foreshadows some aspects of modern uses of the teleological argument.

==Medieval philosophy and theology==

===Late classical Christian writers===
As an appeal to general revelation, Paul the Apostle (AD 5–67), argues in Romans 1:18–20, that because it has been made plain to all from what has been created in the world, it is obvious that there is a God.

Marcus Minucius Felix (c. late 2nd to 3rd century), an Early Christian writer, argued for the existence of God based on the analogy of an ordered house in his &quot;The Orders of Minucius Felix&quot;: &quot;Supposing you went into a house and found everything neat, orderly and well-kept, surely you would assume it had a master, and one much better than the good things, his belongings; so in this house of the universe, when throughout heaven and earth you see the marks of foresight, order and law, may you not assume that the lord and author of the universe is fairer than the stars themselves or than any portions of the entire world ?&quot;

Augustine of Hippo (AD 354–430) in The City of God mentioned the idea that the world&#x27;s &quot;well-ordered changes and movements&quot;, and &quot;the fair appearance of all visible things&quot; was evidence for the world being created, and &quot;that it could not have been created save by God&quot;.

=== Islamic philosophy ===
Early Islamic philosophy played an important role in developing the philosophical understandings of God among Jewish and Christian thinkers in the Middle Ages, but concerning the teleological argument one of the lasting effects of this tradition came from its discussions of the difficulties which this type of proof has. Various forms of the argument from design have been used by Islamic theologians and philosophers from the time of the early Mutakallimun theologians in the 9th century, although it is rejected by fundamentalist or literalist schools, for whom the mention of God in the Qu&#x27;ran should be sufficient evidence. The argument from design was also seen as an unconvincing sophism by the early Islamic philosopher Al-Farabi, who instead took the &quot;emanationist&quot; approach of the Neoplatonists such as Plotinus, whereby nature is rationally ordered, but God is not like a craftsman who literally manages the world. Later, Avicenna was also convinced of this, and proposed instead a cosmological argument for the existence of God.

The argument was however later accepted by both the Aristotelian philosopher Averroes (Ibn Rushd) and his great anti-philosophy opponent Al-Ghazali. Averroes&#x27; term for the argument was &quot;Dalīl al-ˁināya&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;argument from providence&quot;. Both of them however accepted the argument &quot;because&quot; they believed it is explicitly mentioned in the Quran. Despite this, like Aristotle, the Neoplatonists, and Al-Farabi, Averroes proposed that order and continual motion in the world is caused by God&#x27;s intellect. Whether Averroes was an &quot;emanationist&quot; like his predecessors has been a subject of disagreement and uncertainty. But it is generally agreed that what he adapted from those traditions, agreed with them about the fact that God does not create in the same way as a craftsman.

In fact then, Averroes treated the teleological argument as one of two &quot;religious&quot; arguments for the existence of God. The principal demonstrative proof is, according to Averroes, Aristotle&#x27;s proof from motion in the universe that there must be a first mover which causes everything else to move. Averroes&#x27; position that the most logically valid proof should be physical rather than metaphysical (because then metaphysics would be proving itself) was in conscious opposition to the position of Avicenna. Later Jewish and Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas were aware of this debate, and generally took a position closer to Avicenna.

===Jewish philosophy===
An example of the teleological argument in Jewish philosophy appears when the medieval Aristotelian philosopher Maimonides cites the passage in Isaiah 40:26, where the &quot;Holy One&quot; says: &quot;Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number:&quot; However, Barry Holtz calls this &quot;a crude form of the argument from design&quot;, and that this &quot;is only one possible way of reading the text&quot;. He asserts that &quot;Generally, in the biblical texts the existence of God is taken for granted.&quot;

Maimonides also recalled that Abraham (in the midrash, or explanatory text, of Genesis Rabbah 39:1) recognized the existence of &quot;one transcendent deity from the fact that the world around him exhibits an order and design&quot;. The midrash makes an analogy between the obviousness that a building has an owner, and that the world is looked after by God. Abraham says &quot;Is it conceivable that the world is without a guide?&quot; Because of these examples, the 19th century philosopher Nachman Krochmal called the argument from design &quot;a cardinal principle of the Jewish faith&quot;.

The American orthodox rabbi, Aryeh Kaplan, retells a legend about the 2nd century AD Rabbi Meir. When told by a philosopher that he did not believe that the world was created by God, the rabbi produced a beautiful poem that he claimed had come into being when a cat accidentally knocked over a pot of ink, &quot;spilling ink all over the document. This poem was the result.&quot; The philosopher exclaims that would be impossible: &quot;There must be an author. There must be a scribe.&quot; The rabbi concludes, &quot;How could the universe ... come into being by itself? There must be an Author. There must be a Creator.&quot;

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), whose writings became widely accepted within Catholic western Europe, was heavily influenced by Aristotle, Averroes, and other Islamic and Jewish philosophers. He presented a teleological argument in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;. In the work, Aquinas presented five ways in which he attempted to prove the existence of God: the &quot;quinque viae&quot;. These arguments feature only &quot;a posteriori&quot; arguments, rather than literal reading of holy texts. He sums up his teleological argument as follows:

Aquinas notes that the existence of final causes, by which a cause is directed toward an effect, can only be explained by an appeal to intelligence. However, as natural bodies aside from humans do not possess intelligence, there must, he reasons, exist a being that directs final causes at every moment. That being is what we call God.

==Modernity==

=== Newton and Leibniz ===
Isaac Newton affirmed his belief in the truth of the argument when, in 1713, he wrote these words in an appendix to the second edition of his &quot;Principia&quot;:
This view, that &quot;God is known from his works&quot;, was supported and popularized by Newton&#x27;s friends Richard Bentley, Samuel Clarke and William Whiston in the Boyle lectures, which Newton supervised. Newton wrote to Bentley, just before Bentley delivered the first lecture, that:

The German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz disagreed with Newton&#x27;s view of design in the teleological argument. In the Leibniz–Clarke correspondence, Samuel Clarke argued Newton&#x27;s case that God constantly intervenes in the world to keep His design adjusted, while Leibniz thought that the universe was created in such a way that God would not need to intervene at all. As quoted by Ayval Leshem, Leibniz wrote:

Leibniz considered the argument from design to have &quot;only moral certainty&quot; unless it was supported by his own idea of pre-established harmony expounded in his Monadology. Bertrand Russell wrote that &quot;The proof from the pre-established harmony is a particular form of the so-called physico-theological proof, otherwise known as the argument from design.&quot; According to Leibniz, the universe is completely made from individual substances known as monads, programmed to act in a predetermined way. Russell wrote:
=== British empiricists ===

The 17th-century Dutch writers Lessius and Grotius argued that the intricate structure of the world, like that of a house, was unlikely to have arisen by chance. The empiricist John Locke, writing in the late 17th century, developed the Aristotelian idea that, excluding geometry, all science must attain its knowledge &quot;a posteriori&quot;—through sensual experience. In response to Locke, Anglican Irish Bishop George Berkeley advanced a form of idealism in which things only continue to exist when they are perceived. When humans do not perceive objects, they continue to exist because God is perceiving them. Therefore, in order for objects to remain in existence, God must exist omnipresently.

David Hume, in the mid-18th century, referred to the teleological argument in his &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;. Here, he appears to give his support to the argument from design. John Wright notes that &quot;Indeed, he claims that the whole thrust of his analysis of causality in the Treatise supports the Design argument&quot;, and that, according to Hume, &quot;we are obliged &#x27;to infer an infinitely perfect Architect.

However, later he was more critical of the argument in his &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. This was presented as a dialogue between Hume and &quot;a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes&quot;, where the friend gives a version of the argument by saying of its proponents, they &quot;paint in the most magnificent colours the order, beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could come from a random coming together of atoms, or if chance could produce something that the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire&quot;.

Hume also presented arguments both for and against the teleological argument in his &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;. The character Cleanthes, summarizing the teleological argument, likens the universe to a man-made machine, and concludes by the principle of similar effects and similar causes that it must have a designing intelligence:
On the other hand, Hume&#x27;s sceptic, Philo, is not satisfied with the argument from design. He attempts a number of refutations, including one that arguably foreshadows Darwin&#x27;s theory, and makes the point that if God resembles a human designer, then assuming divine characteristics such as omnipotence and omniscience is not justified. He goes on to joke that far from being the perfect creation of a perfect designer, this universe may be &quot;only the first rude essay of some infant deity... the object of derision to his superiors&quot;.

=== Derham&#x27;s natural theology ===
Starting in 1696 with his &quot;Artificial Clockmaker&quot;, William Derham published a stream of teleological books. The best known of these are &quot;Physico-Theology&quot; (1713); &quot;Astro-Theology&quot; (1714); and &quot;Christo-Theology&quot; (1730). &quot;Physico-Theology&quot;, for example, was explicitly subtitled &quot;A demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation&quot;. A natural theologian, Derham listed scientific observations of the many variations in nature, and proposed that these proved &quot;the unreasonableness of infidelity&quot;. At the end of the section on Gravity for instance, he writes: &quot;What else can be concluded, but that all was made with manifest Design, and that all the whole Structure is the Work of some intelligent Being; some Artist, of Power and Skill equivalent to such a Work?&quot; Also, of the &quot;sense of sound&quot; he writes:
Derham concludes: &quot;For it is a Sign a Man is a wilful, perverse Atheist, that will impute so glorious a Work, as the Creation is, to any Thing, yea, a mere Nothing (as Chance is) rather than to God. Weber (2000) writes that Derham&#x27;s &quot;Physico-Theology&quot; &quot;directly influenced&quot; William Paley&#x27;s later work.

The power, and yet the limitations, of this kind of reasoning is illustrated in microcosm by the history of La Fontaine&#x27;s fable of The Acorn and the Pumpkin, which first appeared in France in 1679. The light-hearted anecdote of how a doubting peasant is finally convinced of the wisdom behind creation arguably undermines this approach. However, beginning with Anne Finch&#x27;s conversion of the story into a polemic against atheism, it has been taken up by a succession of moral writers as presenting a valid argument for the proposition that &quot;The wisdom of God is displayed in creation.&quot;

=== Watchmaker analogy ===

The watchmaker analogy, framing the teleological argument with reference to a timepiece, dates at least back to the Stoics, who were reported by Cicero in his &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot; (II.88), using such an argument against Epicureans, whom, they taunt, would &quot;think more highly of the achievement of Archimedes in making a model of the revolutions of the firmament than of that of nature in creating them, although the perfection of the original shows a craftsmanship many times as great as does the counterfeit&quot;. It was also used by Robert Hooke and Voltaire, the latter of whom remarked:

William Paley presented his version of the watchmaker analogy at the start of his &quot;Natural Theology&quot; (1802).
According to Alister McGrath, Paley argued that &quot;The same complexity and utility evident in the design and functioning of a watch can also be discerned in the natural world. Each feature of a biological organism, like that of a watch, showed evidence of being designed in such a way as to adapt the organism to survival within its environment. Complexity and utility are observed; the conclusion that they were designed and constructed by God, Paley holds, is as natural as it is correct.&quot;

Natural theology strongly influenced British science, with the expectation as expressed by Adam Sedgwick in 1831 that truths revealed by science could not conflict with the moral truths of religion. These natural philosophers saw God as the first cause, and sought secondary causes to explain design in nature: the leading figure Sir John Herschel wrote in 1836 that by analogy with other intermediate causes &quot;the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process&quot;.

As a theology student, Charles Darwin found Paley&#x27;s arguments compelling. However, he later developed his theory of evolution in his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, which offers an alternate explanation of biological order. In his autobiography, Darwin wrote that &quot;The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered&quot;. Darwin struggled with the problem of evil and of suffering in nature, but remained inclined to believe that nature depended upon &quot;designed laws&quot; and commended Asa Gray&#x27;s statement about &quot;Darwin&#x27;s great service to Natural Science in bringing back to it Teleology: so that, instead of Morphology versus Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology.&quot;

Darwin owned he was &quot;bewildered&quot; on the subject, but was &quot;inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance:&quot;
==Recent proponents==

===Probabilistic arguments===
In 1928 and 1930, F. R. Tennant published his &quot;Philosophical Theology&quot;, which was a &quot;bold endeavour to combine scientific and theological thinking&quot;. He proposed a version of the teleological argument based on the accumulation of the probabilities of each individual biological adaptation. &quot;Tennant concedes that naturalistic accounts such as evolutionary theory may explain each of the individual adaptations he cites, but he insists that in this case the whole exceeds the sum of its parts: naturalism can explain each adaptation but not their totality.&quot; The &quot;Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; notes that &quot;Critics have insisted on focusing on the cogency of each piece of theistic evidence – reminding us that, in the end, ten leaky buckets hold no more water than one.&quot; Also, &quot;Some critics, such as John Hick and D.H. Mellor, have objected to Tennant&#x27;s particular use of probability theory and have challenged the relevance of any kind of probabilistic reasoning to theistic belief.&quot;

Richard Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;contributions to philosophical theology have sought to apply more sophisticated versions of probability theory to the question of God&#x27;s existence, a methodological improvement on Tennant&#x27;s work but squarely in the same spirit&quot;. He uses Bayesian probability &quot;taking account not only of the order and functioning of nature but also of the &#x27;fit&#x27; between human intelligence and the universe, whereby one can understand its workings, as well as human aesthetic, moral, and religious experience&quot;. Swinburne writes:
Swinburne acknowledges that his argument by itself may not give a reason to believe in the existence of God, but in combination with other arguments such as cosmological arguments and evidence from mystical experience, he thinks it can.

While discussing Hume&#x27;s arguments, Alvin Plantinga offered a probability version of the teleological argument in his book &quot;God and Other Minds&quot;:

Following Plantinga, Georges Dicker produced a slightly different version in his book about George Berkeley:

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has the following criticism of such arguments:
=== Fine-tuned universe ===
A modern variation of the teleological argument is built upon the concept of the fine-tuned universe: According to the website &quot;Biologos&quot;:
Also, the fine-tuning of the Universe is the apparent delicate balance of conditions necessary for human life. In this view, speculation about a vast range of possible conditions in which life cannot exist is used to explore the probability of conditions in which life can and does exist. For example, it can be argued that if the force of the Big Bang explosion had been different by 1/10 to the sixtieth power or the strong interaction force was only 5% different, life would be impossible. Noted physicist Stephen Hawking estimates that &quot;if the rate of the universe&#x27;s expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, the universe would have re-collapsed into a hot fireball due to gravitational attraction&quot;. In terms of a teleological argument, the intuition in relation to a fine-tuned universe would be that God must have been responsible, if achieving such perfect conditions is so improbable. However, in regard to fine-tuning, Kenneth Einar Himma writes: &quot;The mere fact that it is enormously improbable that an event occurred... by itself, gives us no reason to think that it occurred by design ... As intuitively tempting as it may be...&quot; Himma attributes the &quot;Argument from Suspicious Improbabilities&quot;, a formalization of &quot;the fine-tuning intuition&quot; to George N. Schlesinger:

Himma considers Schlesinger&#x27;s argument to be subject to the same vulnerabilities he noted in other versions of the design argument:
Antony Flew, who spent most of his life as an atheist, converted to deism late in life, and postulated &quot;an intelligent being as involved in some way in the design of conditions that would allow life to arise and evolve&quot;. He concluded that the fine-tuning of the universe was too precise to be the result of chance, so accepted the existence of God. He said that his commitment to &quot;go where the evidence leads&quot; meant that he ended up accepting the existence of God. Flew proposed the view, held earlier by Fred Hoyle, that the universe is too young for life to have developed purely by chance and that, therefore, an intelligent being must exist which was involved in designing the conditions required for life to evolve.
Robin Collins argues that the universe is fine-tuned for scientific discoverability, and that this fine-tuning cannot be explained by the multiverse hypothesis. According to Collins, the universe&#x27;s laws, fundamental parameters, and initial conditions must be just right for the universe to be as discoverable as ours. According to Collins, examples of fine-tuning for discoverability include:
* The fine-structure constant is fine-tuned for energy usage. If it were stronger, there would be no practical way to harness energy. If it were weaker, fire would burn through wood too quickly and energy usage would be impractical.
* The baryon-to-photon ratio allowed for the discovery of the big bang via the cosmic microwave background.
* Many things in particle physics are within a narrow range required for discoverability, such as the mass of the Higgs boson.

=== Creation science and intelligent design ===

A version of the argument from design is central to both creation science and intelligent design, but unlike Paley&#x27;s openness to deistic design through God-given laws, proponents seek scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of life, and argue that their theistic science should be taught in science classrooms.

The teaching of evolution was effectively barred from United States public school curricula by the outcome of the 1925 Scopes Trial, but in the 1960s the National Defense Education Act led to the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study reintroducing the teaching of evolution. In response, there was a resurgence of creationism, now presented as &quot;creation science&quot;, based on biblical literalism but with Bible quotes optional. (&quot;Explicit references to the Bible were optional: Morris&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Scientific Creationism&quot; came in two versions, one with Bible quotes, and one without.&quot;)

A 1989 survey found that virtually all literature promoting creation science presented the design argument, with John D. Morris saying &quot;any living thing gives such strong evidence for design by an intelligent designer that only a willful ignorance of the data (II Peter 3:5) could lead one to assign such intricacy to chance&quot;. Such publications introduced concepts central to intelligent design, including &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; (a variant of the watchmaker analogy) and &quot;specified complexity&quot; (closely resembling a fine-tuning argument). The United States Supreme Court ruling on &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; barred the teaching of &quot;Creation Science&quot; in public schools because it breached the separation of church and state, and a group of creationists rebranded Creation Science as &quot;intelligent design&quot; which was presented as a scientific theory rather than as a religious argument.

Scientists disagreed with the assertion that intelligent design is scientific, and its introduction into the science curriculum of a Pennsylvania school district led to the 2005 &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; trial, which ruled that the &quot;intelligent design&quot; arguments are essentially religious in nature and not science. The court took evidence from theologian John F. Haught, and ruled that &quot;ID is not a new scientific argument, but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God. He traced this argument back to at least Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, who framed the argument as a syllogism: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer.&quot; &quot;This argument for the existence of God was advanced early in the 19th century by Reverend Paley&quot;: &quot;The only apparent difference between the argument made by Paley and the argument for ID, as expressed by defense expert witnesses Behe and Minnich, is that ID&#x27;s &#x27;official position&#x27; does not acknowledge that the designer is God.&quot;

Proponents of the intelligent design movement such as Cornelius G. Hunter, have asserted that the methodological naturalism upon which science is based is religious in nature. They commonly refer to it as &#x27;scientific materialism&#x27; or as &#x27;methodological materialism&#x27; and conflate it with &#x27;metaphysical naturalism&#x27;. They use this assertion to support their claim that modern science is atheistic, and contrast it with their preferred approach of a revived natural philosophy which welcomes supernatural explanations for natural phenomena and supports theistic science. This ignores the distinction between science and religion, established in Ancient Greece, in which science can not use supernatural explanations.

Intelligent design advocate and biochemist Michael Behe proposed a development of Paley&#x27;s watch analogy in which he argued in favour of intelligent design. Unlike Paley, Behe only attempts to prove the existence of an intelligent designer, rather than the God of classical theism. Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to propose irreducible complexity: he argues that if a mousetrap loses just one of its parts, it can no longer function as a mousetrap. He argues that irreducible complexity in an object guarantees the presence of intelligent design. Behe claims that there are instances of irreducible complexity in the natural world and that parts of the world must have been designed. This negative argument against step by step evolution ignores longstanding evidence that evolution proceeds through changes of function from preceding systems. The specific examples Behe proposes have been shown to have simpler homologues which could act as precursors with different functions. His arguments have been rebutted, both in general and in specific cases by numerous scientific papers. In response, Behe and others, &quot;ironically, given the absence of any detail in their own explanation, complain that the proffered explanations lack sufficient detail to be empirically tested&quot;.

===Unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics===
William Lane Craig has proposed a nominalist argument influenced by the philosophy of mathematics. This argument revolves around the fact that, by using mathematical concepts, we can discover much about the natural world. For example, Craig writes, Peter Higgs, and any similar scientist, &quot;can sit down at his desk and, by pouring over mathematical equations, predict the existence of a fundamental particle which, thirty years later, after investing millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours, experimentalists are finally able to detect.&quot; He names mathematics as the &#x27;language of nature&#x27;, and refutes two possible explanations for this. Firstly, he suggests, the idea that they are abstract entities brings about the question of their application. Secondly, he responds to the problem of whether they are merely useful fictions by suggesting that this asks why these fictions are so useful. Citing Eugene Wigner as an influence on his thought, he summarizes his argument as follows:

=== &quot;Third way&quot; proposal ===

University of Chicago geneticist James A. Shapiro, writing in the &quot;Boston Review&quot;, states that advancements in genetics and molecular biology, and &quot;the growing realization that cells have molecular computing networks which process information about internal operations and about the external environment to make decisions controlling growth, movement, and differentiation&quot;, have implications for the teleological argument. Shapiro states that these &quot;natural genetic engineering&quot; systems, can produce radical reorganizations of the &quot;genetic apparatus within a single cell generation&quot;. Shapiro suggests what he calls a &#x27;Third Way&#x27;; a non-creationist, non-Darwinian type of evolution:
In his book, &quot;&quot;, Shapiro refers to this concept of &quot;natural genetic engineering&quot;, which he says, has proved troublesome, because many scientists feel that it supports the intelligent design argument. He suggests that &quot;function-oriented capacities [can] be attributed to cells&quot;, even though this is &quot;the kind of teleological thinking that scientists have been taught to avoid at all costs&quot;.

===Interacting whole===

The metaphysical theologian Norris Clarke shared an argument to his fellow professors at Fordham University that was popularised by Peter Kreeft in his &quot;Twenty Arguments for the Existence of God&quot; (1994). The argument states that as components are ordered universally in relation to one another, and are defined by these connections (for example, every two hydrogen atoms are ordered to form a compound with one oxygen atom.) Therefore, none of the parts are self-sufficient, and cannot be explained individually. However, the whole cannot be explained either because it is composed of separate beings and is not a whole. From here, three conclusions can be found: firstly, as the system cannot in any way explain itself, it requires an efficient cause. Secondly, it must be an intelligent mind because the unity transcends every part, and thus must have been conceived as an idea, because, by definition, only an idea can hold together elements without destroying or fusing their distinctness. An idea cannot exist without a creator, so there must be an intelligent mind. Thirdly, the creative mind must be transcendent, because if it were not, it would rely upon the system of space and time, despite having created it. Such an idea is absurd. As a conclusion, therefore, the universe relies upon a transcendent creative mind.

== Criticism ==

===Classical===
The original development of the argument from design was in reaction to atomistic, explicitly non-teleological understandings of nature. Socrates, as reported by Plato and Xenophon, was reacting to such natural philosophers. While less has survived from the debates of the Hellenistic and Roman eras, it is clear from sources such as Cicero and Lucretius, that debate continued for generations, and several of the striking metaphors used still today, such as the unseen watchmaker, and the infinite monkey theorem, have their roots in this period. While the Stoics became the most well-known proponents of the argument from design, the atomistic counter arguments were refined most famously by the Epicureans. On the one hand, they criticized the supposed evidence for intelligent design, and the logic of the Stoics. On the defensive side, they were faced with the challenge of explaining how un-directed chance can cause something which appears to be a rational order. Much of this defence revolved around arguments such as the infinite monkey metaphor. Democritus had already apparently used such arguments at the time of Socrates, saying that there will be infinite planets, and only some having an order like the planet we know. But the Epicureans refined this argument, by proposing that the actual number of types of atoms in nature is small, not infinite, making it less coincidental that after a long period of time, certain orderly outcomes will result.

These were not the only positions held in classical times. A more complex position also continued to be held by some schools, such as the Neoplatonists, who, like Plato and Aristotle, insisted that Nature did indeed have a rational order, but were concerned about how to describe the way in which this rational order is caused. According to Plotinus for example, Plato&#x27;s metaphor of a craftsman should be seen only as a metaphor, and Plato should be understood as agreeing with Aristotle that the rational order in nature works through a form of causation unlike everyday causation. In fact, according to this proposal each thing already has its own nature, fitting into a rational order, whereby the thing itself is &quot;in need of, and directed towards, what is higher or better&quot;.

===David Hume===
Louis Loeb writes that David Hume, in his &quot;Enquiry&quot;, &quot;insists that inductive inference cannot justify belief in extended objects&quot;. Loeb also quotes Hume as writing:
Loeb notes that &quot;we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes.&quot;
Hume also presented a criticism of the argument in his &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;. The character &quot;Philo&quot;, a religious sceptic, voices Hume&#x27;s criticisms of the argument. He argues that the design argument is built upon a faulty analogy as, unlike with man-made objects, we have not witnessed the design of a universe, so do not know whether the universe was the result of design. Moreover, the size of the universe makes the analogy problematic: although our experience of the universe is of order, there may be chaos in other parts of the universe. Philo argues:
Philo also proposes that the order in nature may be due to nature alone. If nature contains a principle of order within it, the need for a designer is removed. Philo argues that even if the universe is indeed designed, it is unreasonable to justify the conclusion that the designer must be an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent God – the God of classical theism. It is impossible, he argues, to infer the perfect nature of a creator from the nature of its creation. Philo argues that the designer may have been defective or otherwise imperfect, suggesting that the universe may have been a poor first attempt at design. Hume also pointed out that the argument does not necessarily lead to the existence of one God: “why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing the world?” (p. 108).

Wesley C. Salmon developed Hume&#x27;s insights, arguing that all things in the universe which exhibit order are, to our knowledge, created by material, imperfect, finite beings or forces. He also argued that there are no known instances of an immaterial, perfect, infinite being creating anything. Using the probability calculus of Bayes Theorem, Salmon concludes that it is very improbable that the universe was created by the type of intelligent being theists argue for.

Nancy Cartwright accuses Salmon of begging the question. One piece of evidence he uses in his probabilistic argument – that atoms and molecules are not caused by design – is equivalent to the conclusion he draws, that the universe is probably not caused by design. The atoms and molecules are what the universe is made up of and whose origins are at issue. Therefore, they cannot be used as evidence against the theistic conclusion.

===Intelligence may not be God===
Referring to it as the physico-theological proof, Immanuel Kant discussed the teleological argument in his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. Even though he referred to it as &quot;the oldest, clearest and most appropriate to human reason&quot;, he nevertheless rejected it, heading section VI with the words, &quot;On the impossibility of a physico-theological proof.&quot; In accepting some of Hume&#x27;s criticisms, Kant wrote that the argument &quot;proves at most intelligence only in the arrangement of the &#x27;matter&#x27; of the universe, and hence the existence not of a &#x27;Supreme Being&#x27;, but of an &#x27;Architect. Using the argument to try to prove the existence of God required &quot;a concealed appeal to the Ontological argument&quot;.

In his &quot;Traité de métaphysique&quot; Voltaire argued that, even if the argument from design could prove the existence of a powerful intelligent designer, it would not prove that this designer is God.
=== Argument from improbability ===

Richard Dawkins is harshly critical of intelligent design in his book &quot;The God Delusion.&quot; In this book, he contends that an appeal to intelligent design can provide no explanation for biology because it not only begs the question of the designer&#x27;s own origin but raises additional questions: an intelligent designer must itself be far more complex and difficult to explain than anything it is capable of designing. He believes the chances of life arising on a planet like the Earth are many orders of magnitude less probable than most people would think, but the anthropic principle effectively counters skepticism with regard to improbability. For example Astronomer Fred Hoyle suggested that potential for life on Earth was no more probable than a Boeing 747 being assembled by a hurricane from the scrapyard. Dawkins argues that a one-time event is indeed subject to improbability but once under way, natural selection itself is nothing like random chance. Furthermore, he refers to his counter argument to the argument from improbability by that same name:

Dawkins considered the argument from improbability to be &quot;much more powerful&quot; than the teleological argument, or argument from design, although he sometimes implies the terms are used interchangeably. He paraphrases St. Thomas&#x27; teleological argument as follows: &quot;Things in the world, especially living things, look as though they have been designed. Nothing that we know looks designed unless it is designed. Therefore there must have been a designer, and we call him God.&quot;

Philosopher Edward Feser contends that Dawkins fundamentally misunderstands the teleological argument, particularly Aquinas&#x27; version, and refutes a straw man.

=== Perception of purpose in biology ===
The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse has argued that Darwin treated the structure of organisms as if they had a purpose: &quot;the organism-as-if-it-were-designed-by God picture was absolutely central to Darwin&#x27;s thinking in 1862, as it always had been&quot;. He refers to this as &quot;the metaphor of design ... Organisms give the appearance of being designed, and thanks to Charles Darwin&#x27;s discovery of natural selection we know why this is true.&quot; In his review of Ruse&#x27;s book, R.J. Richards writes, &quot;Biologists quite routinely refer to the design of organisms and their traits, but properly speaking it&#x27;s &quot;apparent&quot; design to which they refer – an &#x27;as if&#x27; design.&quot; Robert Foley refers to this as &quot;the illusion of purpose, design, and progress&quot;. He adds, &quot;there is no purpose in a fundamentally causative manner in evolution but that the processes of selection and adaptation give the illusion of purpose through the utter functionality and designed nature of the biological world&quot;.

Richard Dawkins suggests that while biology can at first seem to be purposeful and ordered, upon closer inspection its true function becomes questionable. Dawkins rejects the claim that biology serves any designed function, claiming rather that biology only mimics such purpose. In his book &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, Dawkins states that animals are the most complex things in the known universe: &quot;Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose.&quot; He argues that natural selection should suffice as an explanation of biological complexity without recourse to divine providence.

However, theologian Alister McGrath has pointed out that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature&#x27;s ability to tune itself to any degree.
Proponents of intelligent design creationism, such as William A. Dembski question the philosophical assumptions made by critics with regard to what a designer would or would not do. Dembski claims that such arguments are not merely beyond the purview of science: often they are tacitly or overtly theological while failing to provide a serious analysis of the hypothetical objective&#x27;s relative merit. Some critics, such as Stephen Jay Gould suggest that any purported &#x27;cosmic&#x27; designer would only produce optimal designs, while there are numerous biological criticisms to demonstrate that such an ideal is manifestly untenable. Against these ideas, Dembski characterizes both Dawkins&#x27; and Gould&#x27;s argument as a rhetorical straw man. He suggests a principle of constrained optimization more realistically describes the best any designer could hope to achieve:

=== Fideism and rejection of natural theology ===

Some theologians oppose the usage of human reason and science in attaining knowledge of God altogether, asserting the primacy of faith in this endeavour.

=== Alleged argument from analogy ===
The design claim can be challenged as an argument from analogy. Supporters of design suggest that natural objects and man-made objects have many similar properties, and man-made objects have a designer. Therefore, it is probable that natural objects must be designed as well. However, proponents must demonstrate that all the available evidence has been taken into account. Eric Rust argues that, when speaking of familiar objects such as watches, &quot;we have a basis to make an inference from such an object to its designer&quot;. However, the &quot;universe is a unique and isolated case&quot; and we have nothing to compare it with, so &quot;we have no basis for making an inference such as we can with individual objects. ... We have no basis for applying to the whole universe what may hold of constituent elements in the universe.&quot;

=== Other criticisms ===
George H. Smith, in his book &quot;&quot;, points out what he considers to be a flaw in the argument from design:
The teleological argument assumes that one can infer the existence of intelligent design merely by examination, and because life is reminiscent of something a human might design, it too must have been designed. However, considering &quot;snowflakes and crystals of certain salts&quot;, &quot;[i]n no case do we find intelligence&quot;. &quot;There are other ways that order and design can come about&quot; such as by &quot;purely physical forces.&quot;

Most professional biologists support the modern evolutionary synthesis, not merely as an alternative explanation for the complexity of life but a better explanation with more supporting evidence. Living organisms obey the same physical laws as inanimate objects. Over very long periods of time self-replicating structures arose and later formed DNA.

In response to such objections, Andrew Loke of Hong Kong Baptist University argues that these can be avoided by formulating the argument deductively as an argument by exclusion concerning the possible explanations for the highly ordered laws of nature rather than as an argument based on analogy, and that the objection from evolution is invalid because evolution requires the highly ordered laws of nature to be already in place.

==Similar discussions in other civilizations==

===Hinduism===
Nyaya, the Hindu school of logic, had a version of the argument from design. P.G. Patil writes that, in this view, it is not the complexity of the world from which one can infer the existence of a creator, but the fact that &quot;the world is made up of parts&quot;. In this context, it is the Supreme Soul, Ishvara, who created all the world.

The argument is in five parts:
# The ... world ... has been constructed by an intelligent agent.
# On account of being an effect.
# Each and every effect has been constructed by an intelligent agent, just like a pot.
# And the world is an effect.
# Therefore, it has been constructed by an intelligent agent.

However, other Hindu schools, such as Samkhya, deny that the existence of God can ever be proved, because such a creator can never be perceived. Krishna Mohan Banerjee, in his &quot;Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy&quot;, has the Samkhya speaker saying, &quot;the existence of God cannot be established because there is no proof. ... nor can it be proved by Inference, because you cannot exhibit an analogous instance.&quot;

===Buddhist criticism of Hindu Nyaya logic===
Buddhism denies the existence of a creator god, and rejects the Nyaya syllogism for the teleological argument as being &quot;logically flawed&quot;. Buddhists argue that &quot;the &#x27;creation&#x27; of the world cannot be shown to be analogous to the creation of a human artifact, such as a pot&quot;.

===Confucianism===
The 18th century German philosopher Christian Wolff once thought that Confucius was a godless man, and that &quot;the ancient Chinese had no natural religion, since they did not know the creator of the world&quot;. However, later, Wolff changed his mind to some extent. &quot;On Wolff&#x27;s reading, Confucius&#x27;s religious perspective is thus more or less the weak deistic one of Hume&#x27;s Cleanthes.&quot;

===Taoism===
The Taoist writings of the 6th-century-BC philosopher Laozi (also known as Lao Tzu) have similarities with modern naturalist science. B. Schwartz notes that, in Taoism, &quot;The processes of nature are not guided by a teleological consciousness ... the tao [dao] is not consciously providential.

<text>A tram (also known as a streetcar or trolley in Canada and the United States) is an urban rail transit in which vehicles, whether individual railcars or multiple-unit trains, run on tramway tracks on urban public streets; some include segments on segregated right-of-way. The tramlines or tram networks operated as public transport are called tramways or simply trams/streetcars. Because of their close similarities, trams are commonly included in the wider term &quot;light rail&quot;, which also includes systems separated from other traffic.

Tram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than main line and rapid transit trains. Most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a pantograph sliding on an overhead line; older systems may use a trolley pole or a bow collector. In some cases, a contact shoe on a third rail is used. If necessary, they may have dual power systems—electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also carry freight. Some trams, known as tram-trains, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to interurban systems. The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct, and systems may combine multiple features.

One of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low rolling resistance of metal wheels on steel rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort. Another factor which contributed to the rise of trams was the high total cost of ownership of horses. Electric trams largely replaced animal power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Improvements in other vehicles such as buses led to decline of trams in early to mid 20th century. However, trams have seen resurgence since the 1980s.
==History==
===Creation===
The history of passenger trams, streetcars and trolley systems, began in the early nineteenth century. It can be divided into several distinct periods defined by the principal means of power used. Precursors to the tramway included the wooden or stone wagonways that were used in central Europe to transport mine carts with unflanged wheels since the 1500s, and the paved limestone trackways designed by the Romans for heavy horse and ox-drawn transportation. By the 1700s, paved plateways with cast iron rails were introduced in England for transporting coal, stone or iron ore from the mines to the urban factories and docks.

===Horse-drawn===
The world&#x27;s first passenger train or tram was the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, in Wales, UK. The British Parliament passed the Mumbles Railway Act in 1804, and horse-drawn service started in 1807. The service closed in 1827, but was restarted in 1860, again using horses. It was worked by steam from 1877, and then, from 1929, by very large (106-seat) electric tramcars, until closure in 1960. The Swansea and Mumbles Railway was something of a one-off however, and no street tramway appeared in Britain until 1860 when one was built in Birkenhead by the American George Francis Train.

Street railways developed in America before Europe, due to the poor paving of the streets in American cities which made them unsuitable for horsebuses, which were then common on the well-paved streets of European cities. Running the horsecars on rails allowed for a much smoother ride. There are records of a street railway running in Baltimore as early as 1828, however the first authenticated streetcar in America, was the New York and Harlem Railroad developed by the Irish coach builder John Stephenson, in New York City which began service in the year 1832. The New York and Harlem Railroad&#x27;s Fourth Avenue Line ran along the Bowery and Fourth Avenue in New York City. It was followed in 1835 by the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad in New Orleans, Louisiana, which still operates as the St. Charles Streetcar Line. Other American cities did not follow until the 1850s, after which the &quot;animal railway&quot; became an increasingly common feature in the larger towns.
The first permanent tram line in continental Europe was opened in Paris in 1855 by Alphonse Loubat who had previously worked on American streetcar lines. The tram was developed in numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, Budapest, Birmingham, Saint Petersburg, Lisbon, London, Manchester, Paris, Kyiv).
The first tram in South America opened in 1858 in Santiago, Chile. The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in Sydney. Africa&#x27;s first tram service started in Alexandria on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in Batavia (Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia).

Limitations of horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar. In 1905 the British newspaper &quot;Newcastle Daily Chronicle&quot; reported that, &quot;A large number of London&#x27;s discarded horse tramcars have been sent to Lincolnshire where they are used as sleeping rooms for potato pickers&quot;.

Horses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century, and many large metropolitan lines lasted into the early 20th century. New York City had a regular horsecar service on the Bleecker Street Line until its closure in 1917. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had its Sarah Street line drawn by horses until 1923. The last regular mule-drawn cars in the US ran in Sulphur Rock, Arkansas, until 1926 and were commemorated by a U.S. postage stamp issued in 1983. The last mule tram service in Mexico City ended in 1932, and a mule tram in Celaya, Mexico, survived until 1954. The last horse-drawn tram to be withdrawn from public service in the UK took passengers from Fintona railway station to Fintona Junction one mile away on the main Omagh to Enniskillen railway in Northern Ireland. The tram made its last journey on 30 September 1957 when the Omagh to Enniskillen line closed. The &quot;van&quot; is preserved at the Ulster Transport Museum.

Horse-drawn trams still operate on the 1876-built Douglas Bay Horse Tramway on the Isle of Man, and at the 1894-built horse tram at Victor Harbor in South Australia. New horse-drawn systems have been established at the Hokkaidō Museum in Japan and also in Disneyland. A horse-tram route in Polish gmina Mrozy, first built in 1902, was reopened in 2012.

===Steam===
The first mechanical trams were powered by steam. Generally, there were two types of steam tram. The first and most common had a small steam locomotive (called a tram engine in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train. Systems with such steam trams included Christchurch, New Zealand; Sydney, Australia; other city systems in New South Wales; Munich, Germany (from August 1883 on), British India (from 1885) and the Dublin &amp; Blessington Steam Tramway (from 1888) in Ireland. Steam tramways also were used on the suburban tramway lines around Milan and Padua; the last &quot;Gamba de Legn&quot; (&quot;Peg-Leg&quot;) tramway ran on the Milan-Magenta-Castano Primo route in late 1957.

The other style of steam tram had the steam engine in the body of the tram, referred to as a tram engine (UK) or steam dummy (US). The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in Rockhampton, in the Australian state of Queensland between 1909 and 1939. Stockholm, Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of Södermalm between 1887 and 1901.

Tram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used coke rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; condensers or superheating were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam trams faded out around the 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.

===Cable-hauled===
Another motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a fixed track by a moving steel cable, the cable usually running in a slot below the street level. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a &quot;powerhouse&quot; site a distance away from the actual vehicle. The London and Blackwall Railway, which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.

The first practical cable car line was tested in San Francisco, in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable cable grip mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was Dunedin, from 1881 to 1957.

The most extensive cable system in the US was built in Chicago in stages between 1859 and 1892. New York City developed multiple cable car lines, that operated from 1883 to 1909. Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.

From 1885 to 1940, the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on of track. There were also two isolated cable lines in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900, and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.

In Dresden, Germany, in 1901 an elevated suspended cable car following the &quot;Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system&quot; started operating. Cable cars operated on Highgate Hill in North London and Kennington to Brixton Hill in South London. They also worked around &quot;Upper Douglas&quot; in the Isle of Man from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).

In Italy, in Trieste, the Trieste–Opicina tramway was opened in 1902, with the steepest section of the route being negotiated with the help of a funicular and its cables.

Cable cars suffered from high infrastructure costs, since an expensive system of cables, pulleys, stationary engines and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (&quot;dropped&quot;) at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable then had to be &quot;picked up&quot; to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) had to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.

Cable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels did not lose traction as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable pulled the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and track brakes, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.

The San Francisco cable cars, though significantly reduced in number, continue to provide regular transportation service, in addition to being a well-known tourist attraction. A single cable line also survives in Wellington (rebuilt in 1979 as a funicular but still called the &quot;Wellington Cable Car&quot;). Another system, with two separate cable lines and a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of Llandudno up to the top of the Great Orme hill in North Wales, UK.

===Fossil fuels===

Hastings and some other tramways, for example Stockholms Spårvägar in Sweden and some lines in Karachi, used petrol trams. Galveston Island Trolley in Texas operated diesel trams due to the city&#x27;s hurricane-prone location, which would have resulted in frequent damage to an electrical supply system. Although Portland, Victoria promotes its tourist tram as being a cable car it actually operates using a diesel motor. The tram, which runs on a circular route around the town of Portland, uses dummies and salons formerly used on the Melbourne cable tramway system and since restored.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, naphtha gas or coal gas in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between Alphington and Clifton Hill in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia (1886–1888); in Berlin and Dresden, Germany; in Estonia (1921–1951); between Jelenia Góra, Cieplice, and Sobieszów in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at Lytham St Annes, Trafford Park, Manchester (1897–1908) and Neath, Wales (1896–1920).

Comparatively little has been published about gas trams. However, research on the subject was carried out for an article in the October 2011 edition of &quot;The Times&quot;, the historical journal of the Australian Association of Timetable Collectors, later renamed the Australian Timetable Association.

===Electric===

The world&#x27;s first electric tram line operated in Sestroretsk near Saint Petersburg invented and tested by inventor Fyodor Pirotsky in 1875. Later, using a similar technology, Pirotsky put into service the first public electric tramway in St. Petersburg, which operated only during September 1880.
The second demonstration tramway was presented by Siemens &amp; Halske at the 1879 Berlin Industrial Exposition.
The first public electric tramway used for permanent service was the Gross-Lichterfelde tramway in Lichterfelde near Berlin in Germany, which opened in 1881. It was built by Werner von Siemens who contacted Pirotsky. This was the world&#x27;s first commercially successful electric tram. It drew current from the rails at first, with overhead wire being installed in 1883.
In Britain, Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway was opened in 1883 in Brighton. This two kilometer line along the seafront, re-gauged to in 1884, remains in service as the oldest operating electric tramway in the world. Also in 1883, Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram was opened near Vienna in Austria. It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity served by an overhead line with pantograph current collectors. The Blackpool Tramway was opened in Blackpool, UK on 29 September 1885 using conduit collection along Blackpool Promenade. This system is still in operation in modernised form.

The earliest tram system in Canada was built by John Joseph Wright, brother of the famous mining entrepreneur Whitaker Wright, in Toronto in 1883, introducing electric trams in 1892. In the US, multiple experimental electric trams were exhibited at the 1884 World Cotton Centennial World&#x27;s Fair in New Orleans, Louisiana, but they were not deemed good enough to replace the Lamm fireless engines then propelling the St. Charles Streetcar Line in that city. The first commercial installation of an electric streetcar in the United States was built in 1884 in Cleveland, Ohio, and operated for a period of one year by the East Cleveland Street Railway Company. The first city-wide electric streetcar system was implemented in 1886 in Montgomery, Alabama, by the Capital City Street Railway Company, and ran for 50 years.&lt;
In 1888, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway began to operate trams in Richmond, Virginia, that Frank J. Sprague had built. Sprague later developed multiple unit control, first demonstrated in Chicago in 1897, allowing multiple cars to be coupled together and operated by a single motorman. This gave rise to the modern subway train. Following the improvement of an overhead &quot;trolley&quot; system on streetcars for collecting electricity from overhead wires by Sprague, electric tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world.

Earlier electric trains proved difficult or unreliable and experienced limited success until the second half of the 1880s, when new types of current collectors were developed. Siemens&#x27; line, for example, provided power through a live rail and a return rail, like a model train, limiting the voltage that could be used, and delivering electric shocks to people and animals crossing the tracks. Siemens later designed his own version of overhead current collection, called the bow collector. One of the first systems to use it was in Thorold, Ontario, opened in 1887, and it was considered quite successful. While this line proved quite versatile as one of the earliest fully functional electric streetcar installations, it required horse-drawn support while climbing the Niagara Escarpment and for two months of the winter when hydroelectricity was not available. It continued in service in its original form into the 1950s.

Sidney Howe Short designed and produced the first electric motor that operated a streetcar without gears. The motor had its armature direct-connected to the streetcar&#x27;s axle for the driving force. Short pioneered &quot;use of a conduit system of concealed feed&quot; thereby eliminating the necessity of overhead wire and a trolley pole for street cars and railways. While at the University of Denver he conducted experiments which established that multiple unit powered cars were a better way to operate trains and trolleys.

Electric tramways spread to many European cities in the 1890s, such as:
* Prague, Bohemia (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), in 1891;
*Kyiv, Ukraine, in 1892;
* Dresden, Germany; Lyon, France; and Milan and Genoa, Italy, Douglas, Isle of Man in 1893;
* Rome, Italy: Plauen, Germany; Bucharest, Romania; Lviv, Ukraine; Belgrade, Serbia in 1894;
* Bristol, United Kingdom; and Munich, Germany in 1895;
* Bilbao, Spain, in 1896;
* Copenhagen, Denmark; and Vienna, Austria, in 1897;
* Florence and Turin, Italy, in 1898;
* Helsinki, Finland; and Madrid and Barcelona, Spain, in 1899.

Sarajevo built a citywide system of electric trams in 1895. Budapest established its tramway system in 1887, and its ring line has grown to be the busiest tram line in Europe, with a tram running once per minute at rush hour. Bucharest and Belgrade ran a regular service from 1894. Ljubljana introduced its tram system in 1901 – it closed in 1958. Oslo had the first tramway in Scandinavia, starting operation on 2 March 1894.

The first electric tramway in Australia was a Sprague system demonstrated at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne; afterwards, this was installed as a commercial venture operating between the outer Melbourne suburb of Box Hill and the then tourist-oriented country town Doncaster from 1889 to 1896. Electric systems were also built in Adelaide, Ballarat, Bendigo, Brisbane, Fremantle, Geelong, Hobart, Kalgoorlie, Launceston, Leonora, Newcastle, Perth, and Sydney.
By the 1970s, the only full tramway system remaining in Australia was the Melbourne tram system. However, there were also a few single lines remaining elsewhere: the Glenelg tram line, connecting Adelaide to the beachside suburb of Glenelg, and tourist trams in the Victorian Goldfields cities of Bendigo and Ballarat. In recent years the Melbourne system, generally recognised as the largest urban tram network in the world, has been considerably modernised and expanded. The Adelaide line has been extended to the Entertainment Centre, and work is progressing on further extensions. Sydney re-introduced trams (or light rail) on 31 August 1997. A completely new system, known as , was introduced on the Gold Coast, Queensland, on 20 July 2014. The Newcastle Light Rail opened in February 2019, while the Canberra light rail opened on 20 April 2019. This is the first time that there have been trams in Canberra, even though Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s 1914–1920 plans for the capital then in the planning stage did propose a Canberra tram system.
In Japan, the Kyoto Electric railroad was the first tram system, starting operation in 1895. By 1932, the network had grown to 82 railway companies in 65 cities, with a total network length of . By the 1960s the tram had generally died out in Japan.

Two rare but significant alternatives were conduit current collection, which was widely used in London, Washington, D.C., and New York City, and the surface contact collection method, used in Wolverhampton (the Lorain system), Torquay and Hastings in the UK (the Dolter stud system), and in Bordeaux, France (the ground-level power supply system). 

The convenience and economy of electricity resulted in its rapid adoption once the technical problems of production and transmission of electricity were solved. Electric trams largely replaced animal power and other forms of motive power including cable and steam, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

There was one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley pole off an overhead line on the early electrified systems. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as interior lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts DC. In British terminology, such a tram was said to be &#x27;grounded&#x27;—not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram and completing the earth return circuit with their body could receive a serious electric shock. If &quot;grounded&quot;, the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley pole, before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram, the water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails. With improved technology, this ceased to be a problem.

In the 2000s, several companies introduced catenary-free designs: Alstom&#x27;s Citadis line uses a third rail, Bombardier&#x27;s PRIMOVE LRV is charged by contactless induction plates embedded in the trackway and CAF URBOS tram uses ultracaps technology

===Battery===

As early as 1834, Thomas Davenport, a Vermont blacksmith, had invented a battery-powered electric motor which he later patented. The following year he used it to operate a small model electric car on a short section of track four feet in diameter.

Attempts to use batteries as a source of electricity were made from the 1880s and 1890s, with unsuccessful trials conducted in among other places Bendigo and Adelaide in Australia, and for about 14 years as The Hague &quot;accutram&quot; of HTM in the Netherlands. The first trams in Bendigo, Australia, in 1892, were battery-powered, but within as little as three months they were replaced with horse-drawn trams. In New York City some minor lines also used storage batteries. Then, more recently during the 1950s, a longer battery-operated tramway line ran from Milan to Bergamo. In China there is a Nanjing battery Tram line and has been running since 2014. In 2019, the West Midlands Metro in Birmingham, England adopted battery-powered trams on sections through the city centre close to Grade I listed Birmingham Town Hall.

===Compressed air===
Paris and Berne (Switzerland) operated trams that were powered by compressed air using the Mekarski system.
Trials on street tramways in Britain, including by the North Metropolitan Tramway Company between Kings Cross and Holloway, London (1883), achieved acceptable results but were found not to be economic because of the combined coal consumption of the stationary compressor and the onboard steam boiler.

===Hybrid system===
The Trieste–Opicina tramway in Trieste operates a hybrid funicular tramway system. Conventional electric trams are operated in street running and on reserved track for most of their route. However, on one steep segment of track, they are assisted by cable tractors, which push the trams uphill and act as brakes for the downhill run. For safety, the cable tractors are always deployed on the downhill side of the tram vehicle.

Similar systems were used elsewhere in the past, notably on the Queen Anne Counterbalance in Seattle and the Darling Street wharf line in Sydney.

===Modern development===
In the mid-20th century many tram systems were disbanded, replaced by buses, trolleybuses, automobiles or rapid transit. The General Motors streetcar conspiracy was a case study of the decline of trams in the United States. In the 21st century, trams have been re-introduced in cities where they had been closed down for decades (such as Tramlink in London), or kept in heritage use (such as Spårväg City in Stockholm). Most trams made since the 1990s (such as the Bombardier Flexity series and Alstom Citadis) are articulated low-floor trams with features such as regenerative braking.

In March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world&#x27;s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. The chief engineer of the CSR subsidiary CSR Sifang Co Ltd., Liang Jianying, said that the company is studying how to reduce the running costs of the tram.

==Design==

Trams have been used for two main purposes: for carrying passengers and for carrying cargo. There are several types of passenger tram:

* Articulated
* Cargo trams
* Double-Decker
* Drop-centre (or drop-center)
* Double ended and Single ended 
* Low-floor
* Rubber-tired
* Tram-train
==Operation==
There are two main types of tramways, the classic tramway built in the early 20th century with the tram system operating in mixed traffic, and the later type which is most often associated with the tram system having its own right of way. Tram systems that have their own right of way are often called light rail but this does not always hold true. Though these two systems differ in their operation, their equipment is much the same.

===Controls===
Trams were traditionally operated with separate levers for applying power and brakes. More modern vehicles use a locomotive-style controller which incorporate a dead man&#x27;s switch. The success of the PCC streetcar had also seen trams use automobile-style foot controls allowing hands-free operation, particularly when the driver was responsible for fare collection.

===Power supply===

Electric trams use various devices to collect power from overhead lines. The most common device is the pantograph, while some older systems use trolley poles or bow collectors. Ground-level power supply has become a more recent innovation. Another technology uses supercapacitors; when an insulator at a track switch cuts off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large capacitor to drive the tram past the gap in the power feed.
The old tram systems in London, Manhattan (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a plough. It was called conduit current collection. Washington&#x27;s was the last of these to close, in 1962. No commercial tramway uses this system anymore. More recently, an equivalent to these systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a third rail on city streets, known as surface current collection or ground-level power supply; the main example of this is the new tramway in Bordeaux.

====Ground-level power supply====

A ground-level power supply system, also called surface current collection or (APS), is an updated version of the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three-metre neutral sections between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them.

Older systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should be live. Wireless and solid state switching eliminate mechanical problems.

Alstom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power supply cables in the sensitive area of the old city of old Bordeaux.

===Routes===

Route patterns vary greatly among the world&#x27;s tram systems, leading to different network topologies. 
* Most systems start by building up a strongly nucleated radial pattern of routes linking the city centre with residential suburbs and traffic hubs such as railway stations and hospitals, usually following main roads. Some of these, such as those in Hong Kong, Blackpool and Bergen, still essentially comprise a single route. Some suburbs may be served by loop lines connecting two adjacent radial roads. Some modern systems have started by reusing existing radial railway tracks, as in Nottingham and Birmingham, sometimes joining them together by a section of street track through the city centre, as in Manchester. Later developments often include tangential routes linking adjacent suburbs directly, or multiple routes through the town centre to avoid congestion (as in Manchester&#x27;s Second City Crossing).
* Other new systems, particularly those in large cities which already have well-developed metro and suburban railway systems, such as London and Paris, have started by building isolated suburban lines feeding into railway or metro stations. In Paris these have then been linked by ring lines.
* A third, weakly nucleated, route pattern may grow up where a number of nearby small settlements are linked, such as in the coal-mining areas served by BOGESTRA or the Silesian Interurbans.
* A fourth starting point may be a loop in the city centre, sometimes called a downtown circulator, as in Portland or El Paso.
* Occasionally a modern tramway system may grow from a preserved heritage line, as in Stockholm.

The resulting route patterns are very different. Some have a rational structure, covering their catchment area as efficiently as possible, with new suburbs being planned with tramlines integral to their layout – such is the case in Amsterdam. Bordeaux and Montpellier have built comprehensive networks, based on radial routes with numerous interconnections, within the last two decades. Some systems serve only parts of their cities, with Berlin being the prime example, as trams survived the city&#x27;s political division only in the Eastern part. Other systems have ended up with a rather random route map, for instance when some previous operating companies have ceased operation (as with the &quot;tramways vicinaux/buurtspoorwegen&quot; in Brussels) or where isolated outlying lines have been preserved (as on the eastern fringe of Berlin). In Rome, the remnant of the system comprises three isolated radial routes, not connecting in the ancient city centre, but linked by a ring route. Some apparently anomalous lines continue in operation where a new line would not on rational grounds be built, because it is much more costly to build a new line than to continue operating an existing one.

In some places, the opportunity is taken when roads are being repaved to lay tramlines (though without erecting overhead cables) even though no service is immediately planned: such is the case in Leipzigerstraße in Berlin, the Haarlemmer Houttuinen in Amsterdam, and Botermarkt in Ghent.

====Cross-border routes====
Tram systems operate across national borders in Basel (from Switzerland into France and Germany), Geneva (from Switzerland into France) and Strasbourg (from France into Germany). A planned line linking Hasselt (Belgium) with Maastricht (Netherlands) was cancelled in June 2022.

==Track==

Tramway track can have different rail profiles to accommodate the various operating environments of the vehicle. They may be embedded into concrete for street-running operation, or use standard ballasted track with railroad ties on high-speed sections. A more ecological solution is to embed tracks into grass turf, an approach known as green track.

Tramway tracks use a grooved rail with a groove designed for tramway or railway track in pavement or grassed surfaces, also called grassed track or track in a lawn. The rail has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other. The guard provides accommodation for the flange. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail. Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by Alphonse Loubat, a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris. The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove. The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a &quot;scrubber&quot; tram. Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.

In narrow situations double-track tram lines sometimes reduce to single track, or, to avoid switches, have the tracks interlaced.

===Switches===
On many tram systems where tracks diverge, the driver chooses the route, usually either by flicking a switch on the dashboard or by use of the power pedal – generally if power is applied the tram goes straight on, whereas if no power is applied the tram turns. Some systems use automatic point-setting systems, where the route for each journey is downloaded from a central computer, and an onboard computer actuates each point as it comes to it via an induction loop. Such is the case at Manchester Metrolink. If the powered system breaks down, most points may be operated manually, by inserting a metal lever (&#x27;point iron&#x27;) into the point machine.

===Track gauge===

Historically, the track gauge has had considerable variations, with narrow gauge common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now standard gauge. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives.

Another factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout. Standard gauge also enables – at least in theory – a larger choice of manufacturers and thus lower procurement costs for new vehicles. However, other factors such as electrification or loading gauge for which there is more variation may require costly custom built units regardless.

===Tram stop===

Tram stops may be similar to bus stops in design and use, particularly in street-running sections, where in some cases other vehicles are legally required to stop clear of the tram doors. Some stops may have railway platforms, particularly in private right-of-way sections and where trams are boarded at standard railway platform height, as opposed to using steps at the doorway or low-floor trams.

==Manufacturing==

Many independent companies started making trams in the 19th and early 20th century. In the last several decades most of them have merged with or into larger ones. The biggest changes in the period after 2010 were the mergers of AnsaldoBreda into Hitachi Rail in 2015 and Bombardier into Alstom in 2020.
Approximately 5,000 new trams are manufactured each year.

As of February 2017, 4,478 new trams were on order from their makers, with a further 1,092 options being open:
==Debate==

=== Advantages ===

* Trams (and road public transport in general) can be much more efficient in terms of road usage than cars – one vehicle replaces about 40 cars (which take up a far larger area of road space).
* Vehicles run more efficiently compared to similar vehicles that use rubber tyres, since the rolling resistance of steel on steel is lower than rubber on asphalt.
* Trams and light rail transit use sustainable technologies like electric propulsion and support limiting urban sprawl which in return lowers the carbon footprint.
* There is a well studied effect that the installation of a tram service – even if service frequency, speed and price all remain constant – leads to higher ridership and mode shift away from cars compared to buses. Conversely, the abandonment of tram service leads to measurable declines in ridership.
* Being guided by rails means that even very long tram units can navigate tight, winding city streets that are inaccessible to long buses.
* Tram vehicles are very durable, with some being in continuous revenue service for more than fifty years. This is especially true compared to internal combustion buses, which tend to require high amounts of maintenance and break down after less than 20 years, mostly due to the vibrations of the engine.
* In many cases tram networks have a higher capacity than similar buses. This has been cited as a reason for the replacement of one of Europe&#x27;s busiest bus lines (with three-minute headways in peak times) with a tram by Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe.
* Due to the above-mentioned capacity advantage, labor costs (which form the biggest share of operating costs of many public transit systems) per passenger can be significantly lower compared to buses.
* Trams and light rail systems can be cheaper to install than subways or other forms of heavy rail. In Berlin the commonly cited figure is that one kilometer of subway costs as much as ten kilometers of tramway.
* ULR (Ultra Light Rail) developments with prefabricated track and onboard power (no OHL Over Head Line) in the UK are aiming for £10 m per km as opposed to convention tram rail and OHL at £20–£30 m per km.
* Tramways can take advantage of old heavy rail alignments. Some examples include the Manchester Metrolink of which the Bury Line was part of the East Lancashire Railway, the Altrincham Line was part of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway, and the Oldham and Rochdale Line was the Oldham Loop Line. Other examples can be found in Paris, London, Boston, Melbourne and Sydney. They hence sometimes take advantage of high speed track while on train tracks.
*As tram lines are permanent this allows local authorities to redevelop and revitalise their towns and cities provided suitable planning changes are made. Melbourne will allow higher buildings (5 to 6 story) along tram routes leaving the existing suburbs behind unchanged whilst doubling the cities density.
* Trams produce less air pollution than rubber tyred transport which produce tyre, asphalt and brake based pollutants. The use of regenerative electric motor braking in trams lowers mechanical brake use. Steel wheel and rail particulates are produced but regular wheel alignment and flexible track mounting can reduce emissions.
* Tram networks can link to other operational heavy rail and rapid transit systems, allowing vehicles to move directly from one to the other without passengers needing to alight. Trams that are compatible with heavy rail systems are called tram-trains, while those that can use subway tunnels are called semi-metro, pre-metro or U-Stadtbahn.
* Trams can integrate more effectively with pedestrian heavy environments than other forms of transport due to compactness and predictable movement. Passengers can reach surface stations quicker than underground stations. Subjective safety at surface stations is often seen to be higher.
* Trams can be tourist attractions in ways buses usually are not.
* Many modern tram systems plant low growing vegetation – mostly grasses – between the tracks which has a psychological effect on perceived noise levels and the benefits of greenspace. This is not possible for buses as they deviate too much from an &quot;ideal&quot; track in daily operations.

===Disadvantages===

* Installing rails for tram tracks and overhead lines for power means a higher up-front cost than using buses which require no modifications to streets to begin operations. 
* Tram tracks can be hazardous for cyclists, as bikes, particularly those with narrow tyres, may get their wheels caught in the track grooves. It is possible to close the grooves of the tracks on critical sections by rubber profiles that are pressed down by the wheelflanges of the passing tram but that cannot be lowered by the weight of a cyclist. If not well-maintained, however, these lose their effectiveness over time.
* When wet, tram tracks tend to become slippery and thus dangerous for bicycles and motorcycles, especially in traffic. In some cases, even cars can be affected.
* The opening of new tram and light rail systems has sometimes been accompanied by a marked increase in car accidents, as a result of drivers&#x27; unfamiliarity with the physics and geometry of trams. Though such increases may be temporary, long-term conflicts between motorists and light rail operations can be alleviated by segregating their respective rights-of-way and installing appropriate signage and warning systems.
* Rail transport can expose neighbouring populations to moderate levels of low-frequency noise. However, transportation planners use noise mitigation strategies to minimise these effects. Most of all, the potential for decreased private motor vehicle operations along the tram&#x27;s service line because of the service provision could result in lower ambient noise levels than without.
* The overhead power lines and supporting poles utilized by trams (except for those using a third rail) can be unsightly and contribute to visual pollution.

==By region==

Trams are in a period of growth, with about 400 tram systems operating around the world, several new systems being opened each year, and many being gradually extended. Some of these systems date from the late 19th or early 20th centuries. In the past 20 years their numbers have been augmented by modern tramway or light rail systems in cities that had abandoned this form of transport. There have also been some new tram systems in cities that never previously had them.

&quot;Tramways with trams&quot; (British English) or &quot;street railways with streetcars&quot; (North American English) were common throughout the industrialised world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but they had disappeared from most British, Canadian, French and US cities by the mid-20th century. After World War II most Australian cities also began to replace their trams with buses, but Melbourne defied the trend, opening new tram lines even in the mid-1950s. By the 1970s Melbourne was the only Australian city with a major tram network.

By contrast, trams in parts of continental Europe continued to be used by many cities, although there were declines in some countries, including the Netherlands.

Since 1980 trams have returned to favour in many places, partly because their tendency to dominate the roadway, formerly seen as a disadvantage, is considered to be a merit since it raises the visibility of public transport (encouraging car users to change their mode of travel), and enables streets to be reconfigured to give more space to pedestrians, making cites more pleasant places to live. New systems have been built in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, France, Australia and many other countries.

In Milan, Italy, the old &quot;Ventotto&quot; trams are considered a &quot;symbol&quot; of the city. The same can be said of trams in Melbourne in general, but particularly the iconic W class. The Toronto streetcar system had similarly become an iconic symbol of the city, operating the largest network in the Americas as well as the only large-scale tram system in Canada (not including light rail systems, or heritage lines).

====Historical====
Historically, the Paris Tram System was, at its peak, the world&#x27;s largest system, with of track in 1925 (according to other sources, ca. of route length in 1930). However it was completely closed in 1938. The next largest system appears to have been , in Buenos Aires before 19 February 1963. The third largest was Chicago, with over of track, but it was all converted to trolleybus and bus services by 21 June 1958. Before its decline, the BVG in Berlin operated a very large network with of route. Before its system was converted to trolleybus (and later bus) services in the 1930s (last tramway closed 6 July 1952), the first-generation London network had of route in 1931. In 1958 trams in Rio de Jainero were employed on () of track. The final line, the Santa Teresa route was closed in 1968. During a period in the 1980s, the world&#x27;s largest tram system was in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) with , USSR, and was included as such in the Guinness World Records; however Saint Petersburg&#x27;s tram system has declined in size since the fall of the Soviet Union. Vienna in 1960 had , before the expansion of bus services and the opening of a subway (1976). Substituting subway services for tram routes continues. was in Minneapolis–Saint Paul in 1947: There streetcars ended 31 October 1953 in Minneapolis and 19 June 1954 in St. Paul. The Sydney tram network, before it was closed on 25 February 1961, had of route, and was thus the largest in Australia. Since 1961, the Melbourne system (recognised as the world&#x27;s largest) has assumed Sydney&#x27;s title as the largest network in Australia.

==Tram modelling==
Model trams are popular in HO scale (1:87) and O scale (1:48 in the US and generally 1:43,5 and 1:45 in Europe and Asia). They are typically powered and will accept plastic figures inside. Common manufacturers are Roco and Lima, with many custom models being made as well. The German firm Hödl and the Austrian Halling specialise in 1:87 scale.

In the US, Bachmann Industries is a mass supplier of HO streetcars and kits. Bowser Manufacturing has produced white metal models for over 50 years. There are many boutique vendors offering limited run epoxy and wood models. At the high end are highly detailed brass models which are usually imported from Japan or Korea and can cost in excess of $500. Many of these run on gauge track, which is correct for the representation of (standard gauge) in HO scale as in US and Japan, but incorrect in 4 mm (1:76.2) scale, as it represents . This scale/gauge hybrid is called OO scale.
O scale trams are also very popular among tram modellers because the increased size allows for more detail and easier crafting of overhead wiring. In the US these models are usually purchased in epoxy or wood kits and some as brass models. The Saint Petersburg Tram Company produces highly detailed polyurethane non-powered O Scale models from around the world which can easily be powered by trucks from vendors like Q-Car.

==Etymology and terminology==

The English terms &quot;tram&quot; and &quot;tramway&quot; are derived from the Scots word , referring respectively to a type of truck (goods wagon or freight railroad car) used in coal mines and the tracks on which they ran. The word &quot;tram&quot; probably derived from Middle Flemish (&quot;beam, handle of a barrow, bar, rung&quot;). The identical word with the meaning &quot;crossbeam&quot; is also used in the French language. Etymologists believe that the word &quot;tram&quot; refers to the wooden beams the railway tracks were initially made of before the railroad pioneers switched to the much more wear-resistant tracks made of iron and, later, steel. The word &quot;tram-car&quot; is attested from 1873.

===Alternatives===

Although the terms &quot;tram&quot; and &quot;tramway&quot; have been adopted by many languages, they are not used universally in English; North Americans prefer &quot;streetcar&quot;, &quot;trolley&quot;, or &quot;trolleycar&quot;. The term &quot;streetcar&quot; is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to horsecars.

The terms &quot;streetcar&quot; and &quot;trolley&quot; are often used interchangeably in the United States, with &quot;trolley&quot; being the preferred term in the eastern US and &quot;streetcar&quot; in the western US. &quot;Streetcar&quot; is preferred in English Canada, while &quot;tramway&quot; is preferred in Quebec. In parts of the United States, internally powered buses made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to as &quot;trolleys&quot;. To avoid further confusion with trolley buses, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as &quot;trolley-replica buses&quot;. In the United States, the term &quot;tram&quot; has sometimes been used for rubber-tired trackless trains, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams.

A widely held belief holds the word trolley to derive from the &quot;troller&quot; (said to derive from the words &quot;traveler&quot; and &quot;roller&quot;), a four-wheeled device that was dragged along dual overhead wires by a cable that connected the troller to the top of the car and collected electrical power from the overhead wires; this portmanteau derivation is, however, most likely folk etymology. &quot;Trolley&quot; and variants refer to the verb &quot;troll&quot;, meaning &quot;roll&quot; and probably derived from Old French, and cognate uses of the word were well established for handcarts and horse drayage, as well as for nautical uses.

The alternative North American term &#x27;trolley&#x27; may strictly speaking be considered incorrect, as the term can also be applied to cable cars, or conduit cars that instead draw power from an underground supply. Conventional diesel tourist buses decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called &quot;trolleys&quot; in the US (tourist trolley). Furthering confusion, the term &quot;tram&quot; has instead been applied to open-sided, low-speed segmented vehicles on rubber tires generally used to ferry tourists short distances, for example on the Universal Studios backlot tour and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major destinations. The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g. the Roosevelt Island Tramway.

===Trolleybus===
Although the use of the term &quot;trolley&quot; for tram was not adopted in Europe, the term was later associated with the &quot;trolleybus&quot;, a rubber-tired vehicle running on hard pavement, which draws its power from pairs of overhead wires. These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also called &quot;trackless trolleys&quot; (particularly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply &quot;trolleys&quot; (in the UK, as well as the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, and Vancouver).

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; was written by Tennessee Williams in 1947.
* The Rev W. Awdry wrote about GER Class C53 called &quot;Toby the Tram Engine&quot;, which starred in his &quot;The Railway Series&quot; with his faithful coach, Henrietta.
* &quot;The Trolley Song&quot; in the film &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; received an Academy Award nomination.
* Trams feature in the opening titles of the world&#x27;s longest running TV soap opera Coronation Street, set in a fictional suburb of Greater Manchester, and produced by Granada Television. A Blackpool tram killed one of the main characters in 1989 and the most recent faked accident involved a tram (modelled on the Manchester Metrolink) careering off a viaduct into the set in 2009.
* The 1986 Australian film &quot;Malcolm&quot; is centred on an autistic tram enthusiast who builds his own tram and becomes involved with a pair of bank robbers.
* &quot;Toonerville Folks&quot; comic strip (1908–55) by Fontaine Fox featured the &quot;Toonerville Trolley that met all the trains&quot;.
* The predominance of trams (trolleys) in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City gave rise to the disparaging term trolley dodger for residents of the borough. That term, shortened to &quot;Dodger&quot; became the nickname for the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers).
* The &quot;Red Car Trolley&quot; is a transportation attraction at Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California.

<doc id="30736" wikidata="Q1169632" url="?curid=30736" title="The Book of the Law">
<text>Liber AL vel Legis (), commonly known as The Book of the Law, is the central sacred text of Thelema. The book is often referred to simply as Liber AL, &quot;Liber Legis&quot; or just &quot;AL&quot;, though technically the latter two refer only to the manuscript.

Aleister Crowley said that the book was dictated to him by a beyond-human being, Aiwass, who he later referred to as his own Holy Guardian Angel. Through the reception of the &quot;Book&quot;, Crowley proclaimed the arrival of a new stage in the spiritual evolution of humanity, to be known as the &quot;Æon of Horus&quot;. The primary precept of this new aeon is the charge, &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot;

The book contains three chapters, each of which Crowley said had been dictated and written down in one hour, beginning at noon, on 8 April, 9 April, and 10 April in Cairo, Egypt, in the year 1904. The three chapters of the book are attributed to the deities Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Rose Edith Kelly, Crowley&#x27;s wife, corrected two phrases in the manuscript.

Crowley later wrote that &quot;Certain very serious questions have arisen with regard to the method by which this Book was obtained. I do not refer to those doubts—real or pretended—which hostility engenders, for all such are dispelled by study of the text; no forger could have prepared so complex a set of numerical and literal puzzles[...]&quot; Biographer Lawrence Sutin quotes private diaries that fit this story and writes that &quot;If ever Crowley uttered the truth of his relation to the &quot;Book&quot;,&quot; his public account accurately describes what he remembered on this point.

==Structure and title==
The technical title of the book is &quot;Liber AL vel Legis, sub figura CCXX, as delivered by XCIII=418 to DCLXVI&quot;, although this title never occurs in the Book itself, which refers to itself as &quot;the Book of the Law&quot; and &quot;the threefold Book of Law&quot; (chapters 1:35, 3:75). CCXX is 220 in Roman figures, representing The Tree of Life (10 numbers times 22 paths), and is the number of verses of the Book in typescript. XCIII is 93, the enumeration of both &quot;The word of the law&quot; Thelema and Aiwass. DCLXVI is 666, the number of Crowley as Great Beast both as Adept and Magus. This is a way of saying that the book was delivered by Aiwass (whose number is both 93 and 418) to Crowley, who is The Beast 666.

The facsimile manuscript of the Book is not, however, numbered 220, but XXXI (31) as the first chapter&#x27;s verses are unnumbered in the original manuscript: that is, no verse numbers were dictated to Crowley for chapter one. Both editions were titled by Crowley AL, pronounced &quot;El&quot;, value 31, so therefore Liber 31 is the manuscript of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; called AL (not be confused with Liber 31 by C. S. Jones (Frater Achad), which is an exegesis of some of the qabalistic symbolism of the &quot;Book&quot;), whereas Liber 220 is the edited (strictly according to the editing instructions dictated as part of the text of the Book itself), printed form of the text.

The original title of the book was &quot;Liber L vel Legis&quot;. Crowley retitled it &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot; in 1921, when he also gave the handwritten manuscript its own title.

==Creation==
===Summons===
According to Crowley, the story began on 16 March 1904, when he tried to &quot;shew the Sylphs&quot; by use of the Bornless Ritual to his wife, Rose Edith Kelly, while spending the night in the King&#x27;s Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Although she could see nothing, she did seem to enter into a light trance and repeatedly said, &quot;They&#x27;re waiting for you!&quot; Since Rose had no interest in magic or mysticism, she took little interest. However, on the 18th, after he invoked Thoth (the god of knowledge), she mentioned Horus by name as the one waiting for him. Crowley, still skeptical, asked her numerous questions about Horus, which she answered accurately supposedly without having any prior study of the subject.

Crowley also gives a different chronology, in which an invocation of Horus preceded the questioning. Lawrence Sutin says this ritual described Horus in detail, and could have given Rose the answers to her husband&#x27;s questions.

As part of his &#x27;test&#x27; for Rose, Crowley wrote that they visited the Bulaq Museum where Crowley asked her to point out an image of Horus. Much to Crowley&#x27;s initial amusement, she passed by several common images of the god, and went upstairs. From across the room Rose identified Horus on the stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, then housed under inventory number 666 (since moved to the Egyptian Museum of Cairo, number A 9422). The stela would subsequently be known to Thelemites (adherents of Thelema) as the &quot;Stele of Revealing&quot;.

On 20 March, Crowley invoked Horus, &quot;with great success&quot;. Between 23 March and 8 April, Crowley had the hieroglyphs on the stele translated. Also, Rose revealed that her &quot;informant&quot; was not Horus himself, but his messenger, Aiwass.

Finally, on 7 April, Rose gave Crowley his instructions—for three days he was to enter the &quot;temple&quot; and write down what he heard between noon and 1:00 P.M.

===Speakers===
Although the messenger of &quot;Liber AL&quot; was Aiwass, each chapter is presented as an expression of one of three god-forms: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

The first chapter is spoken by Nuit, the Egyptian goddess of the night sky, called the Queen of Space. Crowley calls her the &quot;Lady of the Starry Heaven, who is also Matter in its deepest metaphysical sense, who is the infinite in whom all we live and move and have our being.&quot;

The second chapter is spoken by Hadit, who refers to himself as the &quot;complement of Nu, my bride.&quot; As such, he is the infinitely condensed point, the center of her infinite circumference. Crowley says of him, &quot;He is eternal energy, the Infinite Motion of Things, the central core of all being. The manifested Universe comes from the marriage of Nuit and Hadit; without this could no thing be. This eternal, this perpetual marriage-feast is then the nature of things themselves; and therefore, everything that exists is a &quot;crystallisation of divine ecstasy&quot;, and &quot;He sees the expansion and the development of the soul through joy.&quot;

The third chapter is spoken by Ra-Hoor-Khuit, &quot;a god of War and of Vengeance&quot;, also identified as Hoor-paar-kraat, the Crowned and Conquering Child.

Crowley sums up the speakers of the three chapters thus, &quot;we have Nuit, Space, Hadit, the point of view; these experience congress, and so produce Heru-Ra-Ha, who combines the ideas of Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-paar-kraat.&quot;

The book also introduces:

* The Beast (The Great Beast 666, TO MEGA THERION, Aleister Crowley)
* The Scarlet Woman, also known as Babalon, the Mother of Abominations
* Ankh-af-na-khonsu (the historical priest associated with the Stele of Revealing)

===Writing===

Crowley said he wrote &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; on 8, 9 and 10 April 1904, between the hours of noon and 1:00 pm, in the flat where he and his new wife were staying for their honeymoon, which he described as being near the Boulak Museum in a fashionable European quarter of Cairo, let by the firm Congdon &amp; Co. The apartment was on the ground floor, and the &quot;temple&quot; was the drawing room.

Crowley described the encounter in detail in &quot;The Equinox of the Gods&quot;, saying that as he sat at his desk in Cairo, the voice of Aiwass came from over his left shoulder in the furthest corner of the room. This voice is described as passionate and hurried, and was &quot;of deep timbre, musical and expressive, its tones solemn, voluptuous, tender, fierce or aught else as suited the moods of the message. Not bass—perhaps a rich tenor or baritone.&quot; Further, the voice was devoid of &quot;native or foreign accent&quot;.

Crowley also got a &quot;strong impression&quot; of the speaker&#x27;s general appearance. Aiwass had a body composed of &quot;fine matter&quot;, which had a gauze-like transparency. Further, he &quot;seemed to be a tall, dark man in his thirties, well-knit, active and strong, with the face of a savage king, and eyes veiled lest their gaze should destroy what they saw. The dress was not Arab; it suggested Assyria or Persia, but very vaguely.

Despite initially writing that it was an &quot;excellent example of automatic writing&quot;, Crowley later insisted that it was not just automatic writing (though the writing included aspects of this, since when Crowley tried to stop writing he was compelled to continue. The writing also recorded Crowley&#x27;s own thoughts). Rather he said that the experience was exactly like an actual voice speaking to him. This resulted in a few transcription errors, about which the scribe had to later inquire.
Note, moreover, with what greedy vanity I claim authorship even of all the other A∴A∴ Books in Class A, though I wrote them inspired beyond all I know to be I. Yet in these Books did Aleister Crowley, the master of English both in prose and in verse, partake insofar as he was That. Compare those Books with The Book of the Law! The style [of the former] is simple and sublime; the imagery is gorgeous and faultless; the rhythm is subtle and intoxicating; the theme is interpreted in faultless symphony. There are no errors of grammar, no infelicities of phrase. Each Book is perfect in its kind.

I, daring to snatch credit for these [...] dared nowise to lay claim to have touched The Book of the Law, not with my littlest finger-tip.

He also admits to the possibility that Aiwass may be identified with his own subconscious, although he thought this was unlikely:

Of course I wrote them, ink on paper, in the material sense; but they are not My words, unless Aiwaz be taken to be no more than my subconscious self, or some part of it: in that case, my conscious self being ignorant of the Truth in the Book and hostile to most of the ethics and philosophy of the Book, Aiwaz is a severely suppressed part of me.

Crowley himself was initially opposed to the book and its message:

The fact of the matter was that I resented &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; with my whole soul. For one thing, it knocked my Buddhism completely on the head. ... I was bitterly opposed to the principles of the Book on almost every point of morality. The third chapter seemed to me gratuitously atrocious.

Shortly after making a few copies for evaluation by close friends, the manuscript was misplaced and forgotten about. It would be several years before it was found, and the first official publication occurred in 1909.

&quot;The Book of the Law&quot; annoyed me; I was still obsessed by the idea that secrecy was necessary to a magical document, that publication would destroy its importance. I determined, in a mood which I can only describe as a fit of ill temper, to publish &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, and then get rid of it for ever.

===Original manuscript===
A facsimile of the original handwritten manuscript was published in &quot;The Equinox&quot;, Volume I, Number VII, in 1912. In 1921, Crowley gave the manuscript its own title, &quot;AL (Liber Legis), The Book of the Law, sub figura XXXI&quot;, to distinguish it from the typeset version. It is now sometimes referred to as simply &quot;Liber XXXI&quot;.

The original manuscript was sent on Crowley&#x27;s death to Karl Germer, the executor of his will and head of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). On Germer&#x27;s death no trace of it could be found in his papers. There matters rested until 1984, when Tom Whitmore, the new owner of a house in Berkeley, California, began searching through the junk left in the basement by the previous owner. Among the used mattresses, lumber, and outdated high school textbooks were two boxes of assorted papers and newspaper clippings dealing with Germer&#x27;s affairs, the charter of the O.T.O. and an envelope containing the manuscript of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Whitmore donated the papers to the O.T.O. 

====Changes to the manuscript====
The final version of &quot;Liber Legis&quot; includes text that did not appear in the original writing, including many small changes to spelling. In several cases, stanzas from the Stele of Revealing were inserted within the text.

===The Comment===
Based on several passages, including: &quot;My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khuit&quot; (AL I:36), Crowley felt compelled to interpret &quot;AL&quot; in writing. He wrote two large sets of commentaries where he attempted to decipher each line.

In 1912, he prepared &quot;AL&quot; and his current comments on it for publication in &quot;The Equinox, I(7)&quot;. However, he was not satisfied with this initial attempt. He recalls in his confessions () that he thought the existing commentary was &quot;shamefully meagre and incomplete.&quot; He later explains, &quot;I had stupidly supposed this Comment to be a scholarly exposition of the Book, an elucidation of its obscurities and a demonstration of its praeterhuman origin. I understand at last that this idea is nonsense. The Comment must be an interpretation of the Book intelligible to the simplest minds, and as practical as the Ten Commandments.&quot; Moreover, this Comment should be arrived at &quot;inspirationally&quot;, as the Book itself had been.

Years later in 1925 while in Tunis, Tunisia, Crowley received his inspiration. He published his second commentary, often called simply &quot;The Comment&quot;, in the Tunis edition of &quot;AL&quot;, of which only 11 copies were printed, and signed it as Ankh-f-n-khonsu (lit. &quot;He Lives in Khonsu&quot;—a historical priest who lived in Thebes in the 26th dynasty, associated with the Stele of Revealing). Crowley later tasked his friend and fellow O.T.O. member Louis Wilkinson with preparing an edited version of Crowley&#x27;s commentaries which was published some time after Crowley&#x27;s death as &quot;The Law is for All&quot;.

==Thelemic interpretations==

Thanks in large part to &quot;The Comment&quot;, the interpretation of the often cryptic text of &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot; is generally considered by Thelemites to be a matter for the individual reader. Crowley devoted much of his life to writing about &quot;Liber AL&quot;, seeking to decipher its mysteries and provide insights into its meanings.

Crowley emphasized that one of the main precepts of the book is the emancipation of mankind from all limitations. He viewed &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; as not just introducing a new religion, but also a new cosmology, philosophy, and ethics. According to Crowley, the word Thelema, as uttered by Aiwass, signified a complete departure from the formula of the Dying God, proposing instead a system that integrates the discoveries of science, from physics to psychology, into a coherent and consistent framework.

===Via Hermetic Qabalah===
Crowley employed Hermetic Qabalah, particularly its numerological method of gematria, to interpret the obscurities of &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot;. He explained that the text contains numerous instances of double entendre, paronomasia in one language or another, numerical-literal puzzles, and even connections of letters across various lines. Crowley detailed these interpretations in the Qabalistic section of his Commentary.

In &quot;Magick Without Tears&quot;, Crowley elaborated on his insights, stating that the &quot;Author of the Book&quot; (Aiwass) demonstrated profound knowledge of Qabalah. Initially, Crowley was assured that Aiwass knew at least as much Qabalah as he did. Over time, further study convinced him that Aiwass possessed a much higher level of Qabalistic knowledge, leading Crowley to regard Aiwass as the supreme Qabalist of all time.

===Via prophecy===
Crowley later considered the events of his life and the apparent fulfillment of certain &#x27;predictions&#x27; in &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot; as further proof of its divine origin. He noted that Aiwass had foreseen and provided solutions to difficulties that Crowley only discovered years later, and sometimes even events that he had no part in bringing about.

One significant event was Charles Stansfeld Jones claiming the grade of Magister Templi, which Crowley interpreted as the birth of his &#x27;Magical Son&#x27;. Crowley believed that Jones&#x27; subsequent discovery of the critical value of 31 was foretold in the book (II:76, III:47) and provided him with further insight into his qabalistic understanding and interpretation of the text. Upon receiving notification of this discovery, Crowley expressed his realization that Jones&#x27; key had unlocked deeper meanings within &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot;, noting that the text had unfolded like a flower and solved various enigmatic passages.

===Via English Qaballa===
English Qaballa (EQ) is an English-based Hermetic Qabalah supported by a system of arithmancy that interprets the letters of the English alphabet via an assigned set of values, discovered by James Lees in 1976. It is the result of an intent to understand, interpret, and elaborate on the mysteries of Aleister Crowley&#x27;s received text, &quot;Liber AL vel Legis, the Book of the Law&quot;. According to Jake Stratton-Kent, &quot;the English Qaballa is a qabalah and not a system of numerology. A qabalah is specifically related to three factors: one, a language; two, a &#x27;holy&#x27; text or texts; three, mathematical laws at work in these two.&quot;

The &quot;order &amp; value&quot; discovered by James Lees lays the letters out on the grid superimposed on the page of manuscript of &quot;Liber AL&quot; on which this verse (III:47) appears (sheet 16 of Chapter III). Also appearing on this page are a diagonal line and a circled cross. &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; states that the book should only be printed with Crowley&#x27;s hand-written version included, suggesting that there are mysteries in the &quot;chance shape of the letters and their position to one another&quot; of Crowley&#x27;s handwriting. Whichever top-left to bottom-right diagonal is read the magickal order of the letters is obtained.

==Scholarly analyses==

Israel Regardie, former secretary to Crowley, offers a psychological interpretation of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; in &quot;The Eye in the Triangle&quot;. Regardie suggests that the book can be understood as an expression of Crowley&#x27;s complex psychological landscape, including his struggles with identity and spirituality. He explores the symbolic and archetypal dimensions of the text, providing insights into its deeper meanings and its significance in Crowley&#x27;s magical philosophy. Regardie suggests that current psychological theory supports the idea that individuals possess various forms of knowledge and power of which they are unaware, aligning with both Freudian and Jungian theories.

Marco Pasi, in &quot;Aleister Crowley and the Temptation of Politics&quot;, delves into the philosophical underpinnings of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Pasi highlights the connections between the text and Nietzschean thought, particularly the concept of the Übermensch. He discusses how Crowley&#x27;s work reflects a radical individualism and a break from traditional religious and moral systems. Pasi places &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; within the broader context of early 20th-century intellectual and cultural movements.

Richard Kaczynski, a biographer and historian of Aleister Crowley, provides an in-depth analysis of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; in his work, &quot;Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley&quot;. Kaczynski explores the historical and psychological contexts in which the book was received, discussing how Crowley&#x27;s environment, personal experiences, and extensive knowledge of esoteric traditions influenced the content and structure of the book. His analysis includes a detailed examination of the book&#x27;s themes, symbols, and its role in Crowley&#x27;s overall magical system.

Lawrence Sutin, in his biography &quot;Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley&quot;, presents a critical perspective on &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Sutin argues that the text reflects Crowley&#x27;s subconscious mind rather than a divine revelation, pointing out the possibility that Crowley&#x27;s extensive knowledge of esoteric traditions and his personal aspirations heavily influenced the content of the book. Sutin provides a balanced view, acknowledging the text&#x27;s impact while questioning its purported supernatural origins.

&quot;The Book of the Law&quot; is considered the cornerstone of Thelemic practice, influencing subsequent Thelemic texts and rituals. Its precepts form the basis for Thelemic ethical and spiritual guidance. Wouter J. Hanegraaff, in &quot;Western Esotericism: A Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, discusses how the book has impacted modern esoteric movements, noting that it has inspired various interpretations and adaptations in occult literature and practices, highlighting its lasting influence on contemporary spirituality.

===Skeptical views===
In &quot;The Eye in the Triangle&quot;, Regardie questions the significance of Rose&#x27;s ability to answer Crowley&#x27;s questions about Horus and the Qabala. Given that Rose had been married to Crowley for eight months at the time, Regardie proposed that Crowley may have used Rose as a &#x27;sounding board&#x27; for many of his ideas, meaning she might not have been as ignorant of magick and mysticism as Crowley made out. In his introduction to his edition of &quot;The Law is for All&quot;, Regardie remarked that it ultimately did not matter whether &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; was dictated by a preterhuman intelligence named Aiwass or emerged from the creative depths of Aleister Crowley. He emphasized that Crowley became a mouthpiece for the Zeitgeist, accurately expressing the intrinsic nature of his time.

Charles R. Cammell, in his book &quot;Aleister Crowley: The Man, the Mage, the Poet&quot;, also believed that &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; was an expression of Crowley&#x27;s personality. Cammell described the book&#x27;s maxims as cold, cruel, and relentless, reflecting Crowley&#x27;s own Daemonic personality. He noted that the manner of the book&#x27;s reception made it a document of curious interest, partially emanating from Crowley&#x27;s unconscious mind.

Scholar Joshua Gunn argued that the stylistic similarities between &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; and Crowley&#x27;s poetic writings were too pronounced for it to be anything other than Crowley&#x27;s work. Gunn pointed out that despite Crowley&#x27;s belief in the superhuman inspiration of the book, its clichéd imagery, overwrought style, and elaborate phonetic displays mirrored Crowley&#x27;s other poetic works, suggesting it was not the product of something supernatural.

==Editions==

<doc id="30740" wikidata="Q607116" url="?curid=30740" title="Classical unities">
<text>The classical unities, Aristotelian unities, or three unities represent a prescriptive theory of dramatic tragedy that was introduced in Italy in the 16th century and was influential for three centuries. The three unities are:

#&quot;unity of action&quot;: a tragedy should have one principal action.
#&quot;unity of time&quot;: the action in a tragedy should occur over a period of no more than 24 hours.
#&quot;unity of place&quot;: a tragedy should exist in a single physical location.

==History==
===Italy===
In 1514, author and critic Gian Giorgio Trissino (1478 – 1550) introduced the concept of the unities in his blank-verse tragedy, &quot;Sofonisba&quot;. Trissino claimed he was following Aristotle. However, Trissino had no access to Aristotle&#x27;s most significant work on the tragic form, &quot;Poetics&quot;. Trissino expanded with his own ideas on what he was able to glean from Aristotle&#x27;s book, &quot;Rhetoric&quot;. In &quot;Rhetoric&quot; Aristotle considers the dramatic elements of action and time, while focusing on audience reception. Poor translations at the time resulted in some misreadings by Trissino.

Trissino&#x27;s play &quot;Sofonisba&quot; followed classical Greek style by adhering to the unities, by omitting the usual act division, and even introducing a chorus. The many Italian playwrights that came after Trissino in the 16th Century, also wrote in accordance to the unities. However, according to &quot;The Cambridge Guide to Theatre&quot;, the imitation of classical forms and modes had a deadening effect on Italian drama, which became &quot;rhetorical and inert&quot;. None of the 16th century tragedies that were influenced by the rediscovery of ancient literature have survived except as historic examples. One of the best is Pietro Aretino&#x27;s &quot;Orazia&quot; (1546), which nevertheless is found to be stiff, distant and lacking in feeling.

In 1570 the unities were codified and given new definition by Lodovico Castelvetro ( – 1571) in his influential translation and interpretation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, &quot;Poetica d&#x27;Aristotele vulgarizzata e sposta&quot; (&quot;The Poetics of Aristotle translated in the Vulgar Language and commented on&quot;). Though Castelvetro&#x27;s translations are considered crude and inaccurate, and though he at times altered Aristotle&#x27;s meanings to make his own points, his translations were influential and inspired the vast number of scholarly debates and discussions that followed all through Europe.

===France===
One hundred and twenty years after &quot;Sofonisba&quot; introduced the theory to Italy, it then introduced the concept once again, this time in France with a translation by Jean Mairet. Voltaire said that the &quot;Sophonisba&quot; of Mairet had &quot;a merit which was then entirely new in France, — that of being in accordance with the rules of the theatre. The three unities of action, time, and place are there strictly observed, and the author was regarded as the father of the French stage.&quot; The new rules caught on very quickly in France. Dramatist Pierre Corneille became an ardent supporter of them, and in his plays from &quot;Le Cid&quot; (1636) to &quot;Suréna&quot; (1674) he attempted to keep within the limits of time and place. In 1655 he published his &quot;Trois Discours&quot;, which includes his arguments for the unities. Corneille&#x27;s principles drew the support of Racine and Voltaire, and for French playwrights they became hard rules, and a heresy to disobey them. Voltaire said:
However, in France opposition soon began to grow in the form of a Romantic movement, that wanted freedom from the strictures of the classical unities. It turned into a fierce literary conflict. The opposition included Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and others. Victor Hugo, in the preface to his play, &quot;Cromwell&quot;, criticizes the unities, saying in part,
Hugo ridicules the unities of place and time, but not the unity of action, which he considers &quot;true and well founded&quot;. The conflict came to a climax with the production of Victor Hugo&#x27;s play &quot;Hernani&quot; at the Theatre Francais, on 21 February 1830. It was reported that the two sides, the &quot;Classicists&quot; and &quot;Romanticists&quot;, both full of passion, met as on a field of battle. There was a lot of clamor in the theatre at each performance, even some fist fights. The newer Romantic movement carried the day, and French playwrights no longer had to confine their plays to one location, and have all of the action packed into one day.

===England===
The Classical Unities seem to have had less impact in England. It had adherents in Ben Jonson and John Dryden. Examples of plays that followed the theory include: Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot; (1682), Joseph Addison&#x27;s &quot;Cato,&quot; and Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Irene&quot; (1749). Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1610) takes place almost entirely on an island, during the course of four hours, and with one major action — that of Prospero reclaiming his role as the Duke of Milan. It is suggested that Prospero&#x27;s way of regularly checking the time of day during the play might be satirizing the concept of the unities. In &quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot; (1595), Philip Sidney advocates for the unities, and complains that English plays are ignoring them. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; the chorus notes that the story makes a jump of 16 years:

John Dryden discusses the unity of time in this passage criticizing Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays:
... they are rather so many Chronicles of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little; to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.
Samuel Johnson in the preface to his edition of Shakespeare in 1773 rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life:

After Johnson&#x27;s critique interest seemed to turn away from the theory.

John Pitcher, in the Arden Shakespeare Third Series edition of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2010), suggests that Shakespeare was familiar with the unities due to an English translation of &quot;Poetics&quot; that became popular around 1608.

==Excerpts of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;==
Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; may not have been available to Trissino when he formulated the unities, and the term &quot;Aristotelian unities&quot; is considered a misnomer, but in spite of this, Aristotle&#x27;s name became attached to the theory from the beginning. As translations became available, theorists have looked to the &quot;Poetics&quot; retrospectively for support of the concept. In these passages from the &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle considers action:

Tragedy, then is a process of imitating an action which has serious implications, is complete, and possesses magnitude. ... A poetic imitation, then, ought to be unified in the same way as a single imitation in any other mimetic field, by having a single object: since the plot is an imitation of an action, the latter ought to be both unified and complete, and the component events ought to be so firmly compacted that if any one of them is shifted to another place, or removed, the whole is loosened up and dislocated; for an element whose addition or subtraction makes no perceptible extra difference is not really a part of the whole.

Aristotle considers length or time in a distinction between the epic and tragedy:

Well then, epic poetry followed in the wake of tragedy up to the point of being a (1) good-sized (2) imitation (3) in verse (4) of people who are to be taken seriously; but in its having its verse unmixed with any other and being narrative in character, there they differ. Further, so far as its length is concerned tragedy tries as hard as it can to exist during a single daylight period, or to vary but little, while the epic is not limited in its time and so differs in that respect.

<text>Tláloc ( ) is the god of rain in Aztec religion. He was also a deity of earthly fertility and water, worshipped as a giver of life and sustenance. This came to be due to many rituals, and sacrifices that were held in his name. He was feared, but not maliciously, for his power over hail, thunder, lightning, and even rain. He is also associated with caves, springs, and mountains, most specifically the sacred mountain where he was believed to reside. Cerro Tláloc is very important in understanding how rituals surrounding this deity played out. His followers were one of the oldest and most universal in ancient Mexico.

There are many different representations of Tláloc, and there are many different offerings given to him. Tláloc is often represented through iconography of butterflies, jaguars, and serpents. The Mexican marigold, &quot;Tagetes lucida&quot;, known to the Nahua as cempohualxochitl, was another important symbol of the god, and was burned as a ritual incense in native religious ceremonies. Representations of Tláloc are distinguished by the presence of fangs, whether that be three or four of the same size, or just two, paired with the traditional bifurcated tongue. Often, but not always, Tláloc will also be carrying some sort of vessel that contains water.

Although the name Tláloc is specifically Nahuatl, worship of a storm god, associated with mountaintop shrines and with life-giving rain, is as at least as old as Teotihuacan. It was likely adopted from the Maya god Chaac, perhaps ultimately derived from an earlier Olmec precursor. Tláloc was mainly worshiped at Teotihuacan, while his big rituals were held on Cerro Tláloc. An underground Tláloc shrine has been found at Teotihuacan which shows many offerings left for this deity.

==Deity iconography==
In Aztec iconography, many different sculptures, and pieces of work have been mislabeled or mistaken as Tláloc. For a while, anything that was abstract and on the scarier side was labelled as Tláloc. However, in reality, Tláloc&#x27;s two main identifiers are fangs, along with ringed eyes. Furthermore, his lips are a very defining feature – they are shaped like a mustache. He is most often coupled with lightning, maize, and water in visual representations and artwork. Other forms of Tláloc include a variety of elements or symbols: jaguar, serpent, owl, water lily, bifurcated tongue, quetzal, butterfly, shell, spider, eye-of-the-reptile symbol, cross Venus / symbol. The number of different symbols associated with Tláloc stem from past, widespread confusion on the deity&#x27;s appearance, along with the old, widespread worship of this deity.

Offerings dedicated to Tláloc in Tenochtitlan were known to include several jaguar skulls and even a complete jaguar skeleton. The Mexica held Jaguars to a very high standard, associated with the underworld, Jaguars were considered the ultimate sacrificial animal due to their value, which the Mexica decided was high.

Tláloc&#x27;s impersonators often wore the distinctive mask and heron-feather headdress, usually carrying a cornstalk or a symbolic lightning bolt wand; another symbol was a ritual water jar. Along with this, Tláloc is manifested in the form of boulders at shrine-sites, and in the Valley of Mexico the primary shrine of this deity was located atop Cerro Tláloc. Cerro Tláloc was where human sacrifice was held, in the name of the water deity.

In Coatlinchan, a colossal statue weighing 168 tons was found that was thought to represent Tláloc. However, one scholar believes that the statue may not have been Tláloc at all but his sister or some other female deity. This is a classic confusion as nobody could seem to figure out what was Tláloc, and what was not. This statue was relocated to the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City in 1964.

While pre-Hispanic cultures are thought to have become extinct once the Spanish had completed the colonization of Mexico, aspects of pre-Hispanic cultures continue to influence Mexican culture. Accordingly, Tláloc has continued to be represented in Mexican culture even after the Spanish were thought to have completed evangelizing in Mexico. In fact, even as the Spanish were beginning to proselytize in Mexico, religious syncretism was occurring. Analyses of evangelization plays put on by the Spanish, in order to convert the indigenous peoples to Christianity, suggests that the Spanish might have unknowingly created connections between Christianity and indigenous religious figures, such as Tláloc. Indigenous Mexicans viewing these plays might have made connections between the sacrifice Abraham was willing to make of Isaac, to the sacrifices that were made to Tláloc and other deities. These connections may have allowed indigenous peoples to retain ideas about sacrifice even as they were being forcibly converted to Christianity. Early syncretism between indigenous religions and Christianity, also included more direct connections to Tláloc. Some churches built during the sixteenth century, such as the Santiago Tlatelolco church had stones depicting Tláloc within the interior of the church. Even as the Roman Catholic Church sought to eradicate indigenous religious traditions, depiction of Tláloc still remained within worship spaces, suggesting that Tláloc would still have been worshipped after Spanish colonization. It is clear that Tláloc would have continued to have played a role in Mexican cultures immediately after colonization.

Despite the fact that it has been half a millennium since the conquest of Mexico, Tláloc still plays a role in shaping Mexican culture. At Coatlinchan, a giant statue of Tláloc continues to play a key role in shaping local culture, even after the statue was relocated to Mexico City. In Coatlinchan, people still celebrate the statue of Tláloc, so much so that some local residents still seek to worship him, while the local municipality has also erected a reproduction of the original statue. This makes sense as Tláloc is one of the most renowned deities, who has to this day many believers and followers. Many residents of Coatlinchan, relate to the statue of Tláloc in the way that they might associate themselves with a patron saint, linking their identity as a resident of the town with the image of Tláloc. While Tláloc plays an especially important role in the lives of the people of Coatlinchan, the god also plays an important role in shaping the Mexican identity. Images of Tláloc are found throughout Mexico from Tijuana to the Yucatán, and images of the statue of Tláloc found at Coatlinchan are deployed as a symbol of the Mexican nation. Tláloc and other pre-Hispanic features are critical to creating a common Mexican identity that unites people throughout Mexico. Due to the fact that many scholars believe that Tláloc also has Mayan roots, this widespread appreciation is common in Mesoamerica. Accordingly, people throughout Mexico, and especially in Coatlinchan, refer to Tláloc in very anthropomorphized ways, referring to Tláloc as a person, as the Mexica did with many deities. Furthermore, people continue to observe superstitions about Tláloc. Despite centuries of colonial erasure, Tláloc continues to be represented in American culture.

==Mesoamerican representations==
Evidence suggests that Tláloc was represented in many other Mesoamerican cultures and religions. Tláloc is thought to be one of the most commonly worshipped deities at Teotihuacan and it is specifically here, in Teotihuacan, that representations of Tláloc often show him having jaguar teeth and features. This differs from the Maya version of Tláloc, as the Maya representation depicts no specific relation to jaguars. The inhabitants of Teotihuacan thought of thunder as the rumblings of the jaguar and associated thunder with Tláloc as well. It is likely that this god was given these associations because he is also known as &quot;the provider&quot; among the Aztecs.

A chacmool excavated from the Maya site of Chichén Itzá in the Yucatán by Augustus Le Plongeon possesses imagery associated with Tláloc. This chacmool is similar to others found at the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlán. The chacmool found at Chichén Itzá appears to have been used for sacrificial purposes, as the chacmool is shaped like a captive who has been bound. Likewise, two of the chacmools that have been found at Templo Mayor make clear reference to Tláloc. The first chacmool portrays Tláloc three times. Once on the vessel for collecting the blood and heart of sacrificed victims, once on the underpart of the chacmool with aquatic motifs related to Tláloc, and the actual figure of the chacmool itself is of Tláloc as the figure portrays the iconic goggle eyes and large fangs. The other chacmool was found at the Tláloc half of the double pyramid-temple complex and clearly represents Tláloc for the same reasons. In addition to the chacmools, human corpses were found in close proximity to the Tlálocan half of Templo Mayor, which were likely war captives.

These archaeological findings could explain why the Maya tended to associate their version of Tláloc, Chaac, with the bloodiness of war and sacrifice, because they adopted it from the Aztecs, who used Maya captives for sacrifice to Tláloc. Furthermore, Tláloc can be seen in many examples of Maya war imagery and war-time decoration, such as appearing on “shields, masks, and headdresses of warriors.” This evidence affirms the Maya triple connection between war-time, sacrifice, and the rain deity as they likely adopted the rain deity from the Aztecs, but blurred the line between sacrifice and captive capture, and religion.

Tláloc was also associated with the earth, and it is believed this is also a reason why sacrifices may have been made to him. Sacrifices to Tláloc were not solely a Maya phenomenon, and it is known that the Aztecs also made sacrifices to Tláloc. Just as the Maya had also worshipped their own version of Tláloc, so did the Mixtec people of Oaxaca, who were known to worship a rain god that is extremely similar to other manifestations of Tláloc.

==Historical cosmology==
In Aztec cosmology, the four corners of the universe are marked by &quot;the four Tlálocs&quot; ( ) which both hold up the sky and function as the frame for the passing of time. Tláloc was the patron of the Calendar day &quot;Mazātl.&quot; In Aztec mythology, Tláloc was the lord of the third sun which was destroyed by fire.

On page 28 of the Codex Borgia, the Five Tlaloque are pictured watering maize fields. Each Tláloc is pictured watering the maize with differing types of rains, of which only one was beneficial. The rain that was beneficial to the land was burnished with jade crystals and likely represented the type of rain that would make a bountiful harvest. The other forms of rain were depicted as destroyers of crops, “fiery rain, fungus rain, wind rain, and flint blade rain”. This depiction shows the power that Tláloc had over the Central American crop supply. Also, the high ratio of damaging rains to beneficial rains likely symbolizes the ratio of the likelihood that crops are destroyed to them being nourished. This would explain why so much effort and resources were put forth by the Central Americans in order to appease the Gods.

Additionally, Tláloc is thought to be one of the patron deities of the trecena of 1 Quiahuitl (along with Chicomecoatl). Trecenas are the thirteen-day periods into which the 260-day calendar is divided. The first day of each trecena dictates the augury, or omen, and the patron deity or deities associated with the trecena.

In Aztec mythic cosmography, Tláloc ruled the fourth layer of the upper world, or heavens, which is called Tlálocan (&quot;place of Tláloc&quot;) in several Aztec codices, such as the Vaticanus A and Florentine codices. Described as a place of unending springtime and a paradise of green plants, Tlálocan was the destination in the afterlife for those who died violently from phenomena associated with water, such as by lightning, drowning, and water-borne diseases. These violent deaths also included leprosy, venereal disease, sores, dropsy, scabies, gout, and child sacrifices.

The Nahua believed that Huitzilopochtli could provide them with fair weather for their crops and they placed an image of Tláloc, who was the rain-god, near him so that if necessary, the war god could compel the rain maker to exert his powers.

==Etymology==
Tláloc was also associated with the world of the dead and with the earth. His name is thought to be derived from the Nahuatl word &quot;tlālli&quot; &quot;earth&quot;, and its meaning has been interpreted as &quot;path beneath the earth,&quot; &quot;long cave,&quot; &quot;he who is made of earth&quot;, as well as &quot;he who is the embodiment of the earth&quot;. J. Richard Andrews interprets it as &quot;one that lies on the land,&quot; identifying Tláloc as a cloud resting on the mountaintops. Other names of Tláloc were Tlamacazqui (&quot;Giver&quot;) and Xoxouhqui (&quot;Green One&quot;); and (among the contemporary Nahua of Veracruz), Chaneco.

==Child sacrifice and rituals==
In the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, one of the two shrines on top of the Great Temple was dedicated to Tláloc. The high priest who was in charge of the Tláloc shrine was called &quot;Quetzalcoatl Tláloc Tlamacazqui.&quot; It was the northernmost side of this temple that was dedicated to Tláloc, the god of rain and agricultural fertility. In this area, a bowl was kept in which sacrificial hearts were placed on certain occasions, as offerings to the rain gods. Although the Great Temple had its northern section dedicated to Tláloc, the most important site of worship of the rain god was on the peak of Cerro Tláloc, a mountain on the eastern rim of the Valley of Mexico. Here the Aztec ruler would come and conduct important ceremonies annually. Additionally, throughout the year, pilgrims came to the mountain and offered precious stones and figures at the shrine. Many of the offerings found here also related to water and the sea.

The Tlálocan-bound dead were not cremated as was customary, but instead they were buried in the earth with seeds planted in their faces and blue paint covering their foreheads. Their bodies were dressed in paper and accompanied by a digging stick for planting put in their hands.
The second shrine on top of the main pyramid at Tenochtitlan was dedicated to Tláloc. Both his shrine, and Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s next to it, faced west. Sacrifices and rites took place in these temples. The Aztecs believed Tláloc resided in mountain caves, thus his shrine in Tenochtitlan&#x27;s pyramid was called &quot;mountain abode.&quot; Many rich offerings were regularly placed before it, especially those linked to water, such as shells, jade, and sand. Cerro Tláloc was situated directly east of the pyramid, which is very in-line with classic Aztec architecture. The Mexica did and designed everything with cosmological direction. It was forty-four miles away, with a long road connecting the two places of worship. On Cerro Tláloc, there was a shrine containing stone images of the mountain itself and other neighboring peaks. The shrine was called Tlálocan, in reference to the paradise. Also, the shrine contained four pitchers containing water. Each pitcher would produce a different fate if used on crops: the first would bring forth a good harvest, the second would cause the harvest to fail and rot, the third would dry the harvest out, and the final one would freeze it. Sacrifices that took place on Cerro Tláloc were thought to favor early rains.

The Atlcahualo festivals was celebrated from 12 February until 3 March. Dedicated to the Tlaloque, this veintena involved the sacrifice of children on sacred mountaintops, like Cerro Tláloc. This form of human sacrifice was not only specific, but necessary in the eyes of the Aztecs. The children were beautifully adorned, dressed in the style of Tláloc and the Tlaloque. The children were &quot;chosen&quot; by the community, and although this selection came with honor, being selected came with great responsibility. Furthermore, these children were not usually of high social class. The children to be sacrificed were carried to Cerro Tláloc on litters strewn with flowers and feathers, while also being surrounded by dancers. Once the children reached the peak, they would have to stay overnight with the priests at the vigil. The priests were not allowed to leave this site, or else they would be considered &quot;mocauhque&quot;, meaning they who are abandoned. Then, at the shrine, the children&#x27;s hearts would be pulled out by Aztec priests. If, on the way to the shrine, these children cried, their tears were viewed as positive signs of imminent and abundant rains. Every Atlcahualo festival, seven children were sacrificed in and around Lake Texcoco in the Aztec capital. The children were either slaves or the second-born children of noblepeople, or pīpiltin. If the children did not cry, it meant a bad year for their whole system of living - agriculture. To signify when the rains were about to end, the Aztecs relied on the call from a bird known as the &quot;cuitlacochin&quot;. This would also signify a switch to soft rain rolling in.

The festival of Tozoztontli (24 March – 12 April) similarly involved child sacrifice. During this festival, the children were sacrificed in caves. The flayed skins of sacrificial victims that had been worn by priests for the last twenty days were taken off and placed in these dark caverns.

The winter veintena of Atemoztli (9 December – 28 December) was also dedicated to the Tlaloque. This period preceded an important rainy season, so statues were made out of amaranth dough. Their teeth were pumpkin seeds and their eyes, beans. Once these statues were offered copal, fine scents, and other food items, while they were also prayed to and adorned with finery. Afterwards, their doughy chests were opened, their &quot;hearts&quot; taken out, before their bodies were cut up and eaten. The ornaments with which they had been adorned were taken and burned in peoples’ patios. On the final day of the &quot;veintena,&quot; people celebrated and held banquets.

Tláloc was also worshipped during the Huey Tozotli festival, which was celebrated annually. Evidence from the Codex Borbonicus suggests that Huey Tozotli was a commemoration of Centeotl, the god of maize. While Tláloc is not normally associated with Huey Tozotli, evidence from the Codex Borbonicus indicates that Tláloc was worshipped during this festival. Additional evidence from the Book of Gods and Rites suggest rulers from the Aztec Empire and other states would make a pilgrimage to Cerro Tláloc during the Huey Tozotli festival in order to present offerings to Tláloc. The Book of Gods and Rites also suggests that a child was sacrificed as a part of this pilgrimage as well, although this could simply be the result of colonial sensationalism on the part of the Spanish authors. It is argued that Tláloc was incorporated into celebrations of Huey Tozotli because of his role as the god of rain. Huey Tozotli was a celebration of the maize harvest, and it would make sense that worshippers might want to celebrate Tláloc during this festival as his powers of the rain would be critical to having a successful harvest of maize.

Tláloc was linked to the regenerative capacity of weather, and, as such, he was worshipped at Cerro Tláloc because much of the rain in Central Mexico is formed over range of which Cerro Tláloc is a part. Tláloc was worshipped on Cerro Tláloc during the Etzalcualiztli festival, in which rulers from across Central Mexico performed rituals to Tláloc in order to ask for rain, and to celebrate fertility and the change of the seasons. An important part of these pilgrimages to Cerro Tláloc during Etzalcualitztli was the sacrifice of both adults and children to Tláloc.

==Related deities==

Archaeological evidence indicates Tláloc was worshipped in Mesoamerica before the Aztecs even settled there in the 13th century AD. He was a prominent god in Teotihuacan at least 800 years before the Aztecs. This has led to Meso-American goggle-eyed rain gods being referred to generically as &quot;Tláloc,&quot; although in some cases it is unknown what they were called in these cultures, and in other cases we know that he was called by a different name, e.g., the Maya version was known as Chaac and the Zapotec deity as Cocijo.

Chalchiuhtlicue, or &quot;she of the jade skirt&quot; in Nahuatl, was the deity connected with the worship of ground water. Therefore, her shrines were by springs, streams, irrigation ditches, or aqueducts, the most important of these shrines being at Pantitlan, in the center of Lake Texcoco. Sometimes described as Tláloc&#x27;s sister, Chalchiuhtlicue was impersonated by ritual performers wearing the green skirt that was associated with Chalchiuhtlicue. Like that of Tláloc, her cult was linked to the earth, fertility and nature&#x27;s regeneration.

Tláloc was first married to the goddess of flowers, Xochiquetzal, which literally translates to &quot;Flower Quetzal.&quot; Xochiquetzal personifies pleasure, flowers, and young female sexuality. In doing so, she is associated with pregnancies and childbirths and was believed to act as a guardian figure for new mothers. Unlike many other female deities, Xochiquetzal maintains her youthful appearance and is often depicted in opulent attire and gold adornments.

Tláloc was the father of Tecciztecatl, possibly with Chalchiuhtlicue. Tláloc had an older sister named Huixtocihuatl.

==Cerro Tláloc==

There is a sanctuary found atop Cerro Tláloc, dedicated to the god, Tláloc; it is thought that the location of this sanctuary in relation to other temples surrounding it may have been a way for the Aztecs to mark the time of year and keep track of important ceremonial dates. Research has shown that different orientations linked to Cerro Tláloc revealed a grouping of dates at the end of April and beginning of May associated with certain astronomical and meteorological events. Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic data indicate that these phenomena coincide with the sowing of maize in dry lands associated with agricultural sites. The precinct on the summit of the mountain contains 5 stones which are thought to represent Tláloc and his four Tlaloque, who are responsible for providing rain for the land. It also features a structure that housed a statue of Tláloc in addition to idols of many different religious regions, such as the other sacred mountains.

===Geographical setting===
Cerro Tláloc is the highest peak of the part of the Sierra Nevada called Sierra del Rio Frio that separates the valleys of Mexico and Puebla. It rises over two different ecological zones: alpine meadows and subalpine forests. The rainy season starts in May and lasts until October. The highest annual temperature occurs in April, the onset of the rainy season, and the lowest in December–January. Some 500 years ago weather conditions were slightly more severe, but the best time to climb the mountain was practically the same as today: October through December, and February until the beginning of May. The date of the feast of Huey Tozotli celebrated atop Cerro Tláloc coincided with a period of the highest annual temperature, shortly before dangerous thunderstorms might block access to the summit.

===Archaeological evidence===
The first detailed account of Cerro Tláloc by Jim Rickards in 1929 was followed by visits or descriptions by other scholars. In 1953 Wicke and Horcasitas carried out preliminary archaeological investigations at the site; their conclusions were repeated by Parsons in 1971. Archaeo-astronomical research began in 1984, some of which remains unpublished. In 1989 excavation was undertaken at the site by Solis and Townsend. The current damage that is present at the top of Cerro Tláloc is thought to be likely of human destruction, rather than natural forces. There also appears to have been a construction of a modern shrine that was built in the 1970s, which suggests that there was a recent/present attempt to conduct rituals on the mountain top.

<text>The Titius–Bode law (sometimes termed simply Bode&#x27;s law) is a formulaic prediction of spacing between planets in any given planetary system. The formula suggests that, extending outward, each planet should be approximately twice as far from the Sun as the one before. The hypothesis correctly anticipated the orbits of Ceres (in the asteroid belt) and Uranus, but failed as a predictor of Neptune&#x27;s orbit. It is named after Johann Daniel Titius and Johann Elert Bode.

Later work by Mary Adela Blagg and D.E. Richardson significantly revised the original formula, and made predictions that were subsequently validated by new discoveries and observations. It is these re-formulations that offer &quot;the best phenomenological representations of distances with which to investigate the theoretical significance of Titius–Bode type Laws&quot;.

==Original formulation==
The law relates the semi-major axis formula_1 of each planet&#x27;s orbit outward from the Sun in units such that the Earth&#x27;s semi-major axis is equal to 10:
:formula_2
where formula_3 such that, with the exception of the first step, each value is twice the previous value.
There is another representation of the formula:
:formula_4
where formula_5
The resulting values can be divided by 10 to convert them into astronomical units (), resulting in the expression:
:formula_6

For the far outer planets, beyond Saturn, each planet is predicted to be roughly twice as far from the Sun as the previous object. Whereas the Titius–Bode law predicts Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto at about 10, 20, 39, and 77 , the actual values are closer to 10, 19, 30, 40 .

==Origin and history==

The first mention of a series approximating Bode&#x27;s law is found in a textbook by D. Gregory (1715):
:&quot;... supposing the distance of the Earth from the Sun to be divided into ten equal Parts, of these the distance of Mercury will be about four, of Venus seven, of Mars fifteen, of Jupiter fifty two, and that of Saturn ninety five.&quot;

A similar sentence, likely paraphrased from Gregory (1715), appears in a work published by C. Wolff in 1724.

In 1764, C. Bonnet wrote:
:&quot;We know seventeen planets [that is, major planets and their satellites] that enter into the composition of our solar system; but we are not sure that there are no more.&quot;

In his 1766 translation of Bonnet&#x27;s work, J.D. Titius added two of his own paragraphs to the statement above. The insertions were placed at the bottom of page 7 and at the top of page 8. The new paragraph is not in Bonnet&#x27;s original French text, nor in translations of the work into Italian and English.

There are two parts to Titius&#x27;s inserted text. The first part explains the succession of planetary distances from the Sun:
:Take notice of the distances of the planets from one another, and recognize that almost all are separated from one another in a proportion which matches their bodily magnitudes. Divide the distance from the Sun to Saturn into 100 parts; then Mercury is separated by four such parts from the Sun, Venus by 4+3=7 such parts, the Earth by 4+6=10, Mars by 4+12=16. But notice that from Mars to Jupiter there comes a deviation from this so exact progression. From Mars there follows a space of 4+24=28 such parts, but so far no planet was sighted there. But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all. Let us therefore assume that this space without doubt belongs to the still undiscovered satellites of Mars, let us also add that perhaps Jupiter still has around itself some smaller ones which have not been sighted yet by any telescope. Next to this for us still unexplored space there rises Jupiter&#x27;s sphere of influence at 4+48=52 parts; and that of Saturn at 4+96=100 parts.

In 1772, J.E. Bode, then aged twenty-five, published an astronomical compendium, in which he included the following footnote, citing Titius (in later editions):
:This latter point seems in particular to follow from the astonishing relation which the known six planets observe in their distances from the Sun. Let the distance from the Sun to Saturn be taken as 100, then Mercury is separated by 4 such parts from the Sun. Venus is 4+3=7. The Earth 4+6=10. Mars 4+12=16. Now comes a gap in this so orderly progression. After Mars there follows a space of 4+24=28 parts, in which no planet has yet been seen. Can one believe that the Founder of the universe had left this space empty? Certainly not. From here we come to the distance of Jupiter by 4+48=52 parts, and finally to that of Saturn by 4+96=100 parts.

These two statements, for all their peculiar expression, and from the radii used for the orbits, seem to stem from an antique algorithm by a &quot;cossist&quot;.

Many precedents were found that predate the seventeenth century. Titius was a disciple of the German philosopher C.F. von Wolf (1679–1754), and the second part of the text that Titius inserted into Bonnet&#x27;s work is in a book by von Wolf (1723), suggesting that Titius learned the relation from him. Twentieth-century literature about Titius–Bode law attributes authorship to von Wolf. A prior version was written by D. Gregory (1702), in which the succession of planetary distances 4, 7, 10, 16, 52, and 100 became a geometric progression with ratio 2. This is the nearest Newtonian formula, which was also cited by Benjamin Martin (1747) and Tomàs Cerdà (c. 1760) years before Titius&#x27;s expanded translation of Bonnet&#x27;s book into German (1766). Over the next two centuries, subsequent authors continued to present their own modified versions, apparently unaware of prior work.

Titius and Bode hoped that the law would lead to the discovery of new planets, and indeed the discovery of Uranus and Ceres – both of whose distances fit well with the law – contributed to the law&#x27;s fame. Neptune&#x27;s distance was very discrepant, however, and indeed Pluto – no longer considered a planet – is at a mean distance that roughly corresponds to that the Titius–Bode law predicted for the next planet out from Uranus.

When originally published, the law was approximately satisfied by all the planets then known – i.e., Mercury through Saturn – with a gap between the fourth and fifth planets. Vikarius (Johann Friedrich) Wurm (1787) proposed a modified version of the Titius–Bode Law that accounted for the then-known satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, and better predicted the distance for Mercury.

The Titius–Bode law was regarded as interesting, but of no great importance until the discovery of Uranus in 1781, which happens to fit into the series nearly exactly. Based on this discovery, Bode urged his contemporaries to search for a fifth planet. , the largest object in the asteroid belt, was found at Bode&#x27;s predicted position in 1801.

Bode&#x27;s law was widely accepted at that point, until in 1846 Neptune was discovered in a location that does not conform to the law. Simultaneously, due to the large number of asteroids discovered in the belt, Ceres was no longer a major planet. In 1898 the astronomer and logician C.S. Peirce used Bode&#x27;s law as an example of fallacious reasoning.

The discovery of Pluto in 1930 confounded the issue still further: Although nowhere near its predicted position according to Bode&#x27;s law, it was very nearly at the position the law had designated for Neptune. The subsequent discovery of the Kuiper belt – and in particular the object , which is more massive than Pluto, yet does not fit Bode&#x27;s law – further discredited the formula.

==Data==
The Titius–Bode law predicts planets will be present at specific distances in astronomical units, which can be compared to the observed data for the planets and two dwarf planets in the Solar System:


==Blagg formulation==
In 1913, M.A. Blagg, an Oxford astronomer, re-visited the law.
She analyzed the orbits of the planetary system and those of the satellite systems of the outer gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. She examined the log of the distances, trying to find the best &#x27;average&#x27; difference.

Her analysis resulted in a different formula:

:formula_7

Note in particular that in Blagg&#x27;s formula, the law for the Solar System was best represented by a progression in , rather than the original value used by Titius, Bode, and others.

Blagg examined the satellite system of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, and discovered the same progression ratio , in each.

However, the final form of the correction function    was not given in Blagg&#x27;s 1913 paper, with Blagg noting that the empirical figures given were only for illustration. The empirical form was provided in the form of a graph (the reason that points on the curve are such a close match for empirical data, for objects discovered prior to 1913, is that they &quot;are&quot; the empirical data).

Finding a formula that closely fit the empircal curve turned out to be difficult. Fourier analysis of the shape resulted in the following seven term approximation:

formula_8

After further analysis, Blagg gave the following simpler formula; however the price for the simpler form is that it produces a less accurate fit to the empirical data. Blagg gave it in an un-normalized form in her paper, which leaves the relative sizes of , , and   ambiguous; it is shown here in normalized form (i.e. this version of    is scaled to produce values ranging from to , inclusive):

formula_9

where formula_10

Neither of these formulas for function    are used in the calculations below: The calculations here are based on a graph of function    which was drawn based on observed data.

Her paper was published in 1913, and was forgotten until 1953, when A.E. Roy came across it while researching another problem.
Roy noted that Blagg herself had suggested that her formula could give approximate mean distances of other bodies still undiscovered in 1913. Since then, six bodies in three systems examined by Blagg had been discovered: Pluto, Sinope (Jupiter IX), Lysithea (J X), Carme (J XI), Ananke (J XII), and Miranda (Uranus V).

Roy found that all six fitted very closely. This might have been an exaggeration: out of these six bodies, four were sharing positions with objects that were already known in 1913; concerning the two others, there was a ~6% overestimate for Pluto; and later, a 6% underestimate for Miranda became apparent.

===Comparison of the Blagg formulation with observation===

Bodies in parentheses were not known in 1913, when Blagg wrote her paper. Some of the calculated distances in the Saturn and Uranus systems are not very accurate. This is because the low values of constant in the table above make them very sensitive to the exact form of the 

==Richardson formulation==
In a 1945 &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot; magazine article,
the science writer D.E. Richardson apparently independently arrived at the same conclusion as Blagg: That the progression ratio is rather than . His spacing law is in the form:

formula_11

where formula_12 is an oscillatory function with period formula_13, representing distances formula_12 from an off-centered origin to points on an ellipse.

==Historical inertia==
Nieto, who conducted the first modern comprehensive review of the Titius–Bode Law, noted that &quot;The psychological hold of the Law on astronomy has been such that people have always tended to regard its original form as the one on which to base theories.&quot; He was emphatic that &quot;future theories must rid themselves of the bias of trying to explain a progression ratio of 2&quot;:

==Theoretical explanations==
No solid theoretical explanation underlies the Titius–Bode law – but it is possible that, given a combination of orbital resonance and shortage of degrees of freedom, any stable planetary system has a high probability of satisfying a Titius–Bode-type relationship. Since it may be a mathematical coincidence rather than a &quot;law of nature&quot;, it is sometimes referred to as a rule instead of &quot;law&quot;. Astrophysicist Alan Boss states that it is just a coincidence, and the planetary science journal &quot;Icarus&quot; no longer accepts papers attempting to provide improved versions of the &quot;law&quot;.

Orbital resonance from major orbiting bodies creates regions around the Sun that are free of long-term stable orbits. Results from simulations of planetary formation support the idea that a randomly chosen, stable planetary system will likely satisfy a Titius–Bode law.

Dubrulle and Graner showed that power-law distance rules can be a consequence of collapsing-cloud models of planetary systems possessing two symmetries: rotational invariance (i.e., the cloud and its contents are axially symmetric) and scale invariance (i.e., the cloud and its contents look the same on all scales). The latter is a feature of many phenomena considered to play a role in planetary formation, such as turbulence.

===Natural satellite systems and exoplanetary systems===
Only a limited number of systems are available upon which Bode&#x27;s law can presently be tested; two solar planets have enough large moons that probably formed in a process similar to that which formed the planets: The four large satellites of Jupiter and the biggest inner satellite (i.e., Amalthea) cling to a regular, but non-Titius-Bode, spacing, with the four innermost satellites locked into orbital periods that are each twice that of the next inner satellite. Similarly, the large moons of Uranus have a regular but non-Titius-Bode spacing.
However, according to Martin Harwit
: &quot;a slight new phrasing of this law permits us to include not only planetary orbits around the Sun, but also the orbits of moons around their parent planets.&quot;
The new phrasing is known as “Dermott&#x27;s law”.

Of the recent discoveries of extrasolar planetary systems, few have enough known planets to test whether similar rules apply. An attempt with 55 Cancri suggested the equation

: formula_15

and controversially
predicts an undiscovered planet or asteroid field for formula_16 at 2 .
Furthermore, the orbital period and semi-major axis of the innermost planet in the 55 Cancri system have been greatly revised (from 2.817 days to 0.737 days and from 0.038  to 0.016 , respectively) since the publication of these studies.

Recent astronomical research suggests that planetary systems around some other stars may follow Titius-Bode-like laws.

applied a generalized Titius-Bode relation to 68 exoplanet systems that contain four or more planets. They showed that 96% of these exoplanet systems adhere to a generalized Titius-Bode relation to a similar or greater extent than the Solar System does. The locations of potentially undetected exoplanets are predicted in each system.

Subsequent research detected 5 candidate planets from the 97 planets predicted for the 68 planetary systems. The study showed that the actual number of planets could be larger. The occurrence rates of Mars- and Mercury-sized planets are unknown, so many planets could be missed due to their small size. Other possible reasons that may account for apparent discrepancies include planets that do not transit the star or circumstances in which the predicted space is occupied by circumstellar disks. Despite these types of allowances, the number of planets found with Titius–Bode law predictions was lower than expected.

In a 2018 paper, the idea of a hypothetical eighth planet around TRAPPIST-1 named &quot;TRAPPIST‑1i&quot;, was proposed by using the Titius–Bode law. TRAPPIST‑1i had a prediction based exclusively on the Titius–Bode law with an orbital period of .

Finally, raw statistics from exoplanetary orbits strongly point to a general fulfillment of Titius-Bode-like laws (with exponential increase of semi-major axes as a function of planetary index) in all the exoplanetary systems; when making a blind histogram of orbital semi-major axes for all the known exoplanets for which this magnitude is known, and comparing it with what should be expected if planets distribute according to Titius-Bode-like laws, a significant degree of agreement (i.e., 78%)
is obtained.

<doc id="30746" wikidata="Q17737" url="?curid=30746" title="Theory">
<text>A theory is a systematic and rational form of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or the conclusions derived from such thinking. It involves contemplative and logical reasoning, often supported by processes such as observation, experimentation, and research. Theories can be scientific, falling within the realm of empirical and testable knowledge, or they may belong to non-scientific disciplines, such as philosophy, art, or sociology. In some cases, theories may exist independently of any formal discipline.

In modern science, the term &quot;theory&quot; refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with the scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, or empirical contradiction (&quot;falsify&quot;) of it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word &quot;theory&quot; that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word &quot;hypothesis&quot;). Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions.

Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values. A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.

The word theory or &quot;in theory&quot; is sometimes used outside of science to refer to something which the speaker did not experience or test before. In science, this same concept is referred to as a hypothesis, and the word &quot;hypothetically&quot; is used both inside and outside of science. In its usage outside of science, the word &quot;theory&quot; is very often contrasted to &quot;practice&quot; (from Greek &quot;&quot;, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for &quot;doing&quot;, which is opposed to theory. A &quot;classical example&quot; of the distinction between &quot;theoretical&quot; and &quot;practical&quot; uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.

== Ancient usage ==
The English word &quot;theory&quot; derives from a technical term in philosophy in Ancient Greek. As an everyday word, &quot;theoria&quot;, , meant &quot;looking at, viewing, beholding&quot;, but in more technical contexts it came to refer to contemplative or speculative understandings of natural things, such as those of natural philosophers, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans. English-speakers have used the word &quot;theory&quot; since at least the late 16th century. Modern uses of the word &quot;theory&quot; derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and rational explanation of the general nature of things.

Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the Greek language. In the book &quot;From Religion to Philosophy&quot;, Francis Cornford suggests that the Orphics used the word &quot;theoria&quot; to mean &quot;passionate sympathetic contemplation&quot;. Pythagoras changed the word to mean &quot;the passionless contemplation of rational, unchanging truth&quot; of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence. Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory. Thus, it was Pythagoras who gave the word &quot;theory&quot; the specific meaning that led to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory (as uninvolved, neutral thinking) and practice.

Aristotle&#x27;s terminology, as already mentioned, contrasts theory with &quot;praxis&quot; or practice, and this contrast exists till today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as nature, so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand, &quot;praxis&quot; involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of &quot;praxis&quot; or doing.

==Formality==

Theories are analytical tools for understanding, explaining, and making predictions about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the arts and sciences. A formal theory is syntactic in nature and is only meaningful when given a semantic component by applying it to some content (e.g., facts and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are often expressed in natural language, but can be constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the formal language of mathematical logic. Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of rational thought or logic.

Theory is constructed of a set of sentences that are thought to be true statements about the subject under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as &quot;He is a terrible person&quot; cannot be judged as true or false without reference to some interpretation of who &quot;He&quot; is and for that matter what a &quot;terrible person&quot; is under the theory.

Sometimes two theories have exactly the same explanatory power because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or observationally equivalent, and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference.

The form of theories is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in model theory. When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are closed under application of certain procedures called rules of inference. A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A theorem is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are abstractions of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include arithmetic (abstracting concepts of number), geometry (concepts of space), and probability (concepts of randomness and likelihood).

Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem shows that no consistent, recursively enumerable theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of natural numbers can be expressed, can include all true statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge.

===Underdetermination===

A theory is &quot;underdetermined&quot; (also called &quot;indeterminacy of data to theory&quot;) if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an epistemological issue about the relation of evidence to conclusions.

A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a hypothesis.

===Intertheoretic reduction and elimination===

If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory (i.e., it has more explanatory power), we are justified in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an &quot;intertheoretic reduction&quot; because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about &quot;sound&quot;, &quot;light&quot; and &quot;heat&quot; have been reduced to &quot;wave compressions and rarefactions&quot;, &quot;electromagnetic waves&quot;, and &quot;molecular kinetic energy&quot;, respectively. These terms, which are identified with each other, are called &quot;intertheoretic identities.&quot; When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely.

When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an &quot;intertheoretic elimination.&quot; For instance, the obsolete scientific theory that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of caloric fluid was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that phlogiston is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen.

===Versus theorems===
Theories are distinct from theorems. A &quot;theorem&quot; is derived deductively from axioms (basic assumptions) according to a formal system of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms. &quot;Theories&quot; are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are &#x27;rigorously tentative&#x27;, meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.

== Theory–practice relationship==

Theory is often distinguished from practice or praxis. The question of whether theoretical models of work are relevant to work itself is of interest to scholars of professions such as medicine, engineering, law, and management.

The gap between theory and practice has been framed as a knowledge transfer where there is a task of translating research knowledge to be application in practice, and ensuring that practitioners are made aware of it. Academics have been criticized for not attempting to transfer the knowledge they produce to practitioners. Another framing supposes that theory and knowledge seek to understand different problems and model the world in different words (using different ontologies and epistemologies). Another framing says that research does not produce theory that is relevant to practice.

In the context of management, Van de Van and Johnson propose a form of engaged scholarship where scholars examine problems that occur in practice, in an interdisciplinary fashion, producing results that create both new practical results as well as new theoretical models, but targeting theoretical results shared in an academic fashion. They use a metaphor of &quot;arbitrage&quot; of ideas between disciplines, distinguishing it from collaboration.

==Scientific==

In science, the term &quot;theory&quot; refers to &quot;a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment.&quot; Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make falsifiable predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources (consilience).

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make falsifiable predictions with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing diseases.

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The United States National Academy of Sciences defines scientific theories as follows:The formal scientific definition of &quot;theory&quot; is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics) ... One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.

From the American Association for the Advancement of Science:
A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not &quot;guesses&quot; but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than &quot;just a theory.&quot; It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.

The term &quot;theory&quot; is not appropriate for describing scientific models or untested, but intricate hypotheses.

=== Philosophical views===
The logical positivists thought of scientific theories as &quot;deductive theories&quot;—that a theory&#x27;s content is based on some formal system of logic and on basic axioms. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a logical consequence of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory. This is called the received view of theories.

In the semantic view of theories, which has largely replaced the received view, theories are viewed as scientific models. A model is an abstract and informative representation of reality (a &quot;model of reality&quot;), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria. (See Theories as models for further discussion.)

===In physics===
In physics the term &quot;theory&quot; is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic postulates (usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is classical electromagnetism, which encompasses results derived from gauge symmetry (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed &quot;laws of electromagnetism&quot;, reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.

=== Regarding the term &quot;theoretical&quot; ===
Certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not been confirmed or proven incorrect. These predictions may be described informally as &quot;theoretical&quot;. They can be tested later, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory.
== Mathematical ==

In mathematics, the term &quot;theory&quot; is used differently than its use in science ─ necessarily so, since mathematics contains no explanations of natural phenomena &quot;per se&quot;, even though it may help provide insight into natural systems or be inspired by them. In the general sense, a &quot;mathematical theory&quot; is a branch of mathematics devoted to some specific topics or methods, such as set theory, number theory, group theory, probability theory, game theory, control theory, perturbation theory, etc., such as might be appropriate for a single textbook.

In mathematical logic, a theory has a related but different sense: it is the collection of the theorems that can be deduced from a given set of axioms, given a given set of inference rules.

== Philosophical==

A theory can be either &quot;descriptive&quot; as in science, or &quot;prescriptive&quot; (normative) as in philosophy. The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of ideas. At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through empirical observation.

A field of study is sometimes named a &quot;theory&quot; because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field&#x27;s approach to the subject. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include set theory and number theory; however literary theory, critical theory, and music theory are also of the same form.

=== Metatheory ===

One form of philosophical theory is a &quot;metatheory&quot; or &quot;meta-theory&quot;. A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories. Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems.

== Political==

A political theory is an ethical theory about the law and government. Often the term &quot;political theory&quot; refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, thought about politics.

== Jurisprudential ==

In social science, jurisprudence is the philosophical theory of law. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution.

<text>The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80, later renamed the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer developed by American company Tandy Corporation and sold through their Radio Shack stores. Launched in 1977, it is one of the earliest mass-produced and mass-marketed retail home computers. The name is an abbreviation of &quot;Tandy Radio Shack, Z80 [microprocessor]&quot;, referring to its Zilog Z80 8-bit microprocessor. 

The TRS-80 has a full-stroke QWERTY keyboard, 4 KB dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) standard memory, small size and desk area, floating-point Level I BASIC language interpreter in read-only memory (ROM), 64-character-per-line video monitor, and had a starting price of US$600 (equivalent to US$ in 2024). A cassette tape drive for program storage was included in the original package. While the software environment was stable, the cassette load/save process combined with keyboard bounce issues and a troublesome Expansion Interface contributed to the Model I&#x27;s reputation as not well-suited for serious use. Initially (until 1981), it lacked support for lowercase characters which may have hampered business adoption. An extensive line of upgrades and add-on hardware peripherals for the TRS-80 was developed and marketed by Tandy/Radio Shack. The basic system can be expanded with up to 48 KB of RAM (in 16 KB increments), and up to four floppy disk drives and/or hard disk drives. Tandy/Radio Shack provided full-service support including upgrade, repair, and training services in their thousands of stores worldwide.

By 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest selection of software in the microcomputer market. Until 1982, the TRS-80 was the bestselling PC line, outselling the Apple II by a factor of five according to one analysis. The broadly compatible TRS-80 Model III was released in the middle of 1980. The Model I was discontinued shortly thereafter, primarily due to stricter Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations on radio-frequency interference to nearby electronic devices. In April 1983, the Model III was succeeded by the compatible TRS-80 Model 4. Following the original Model I and its compatible descendants, the TRS-80 name became a generic brand used on other unrelated computer lines sold by Tandy, including the TRS-80 Model II, TRS-80 Model 2000, TRS-80 Model 100, TRS-80 Color Computer, and TRS-80 Pocket Computer.

== History ==
=== Development ===

In the mid-1970s, Tandy Corporation&#x27;s Radio Shack division was a successful American chain of more than 3,000 electronics stores. Among the Tandy employees who purchased a MITS Altair kit computer was buyer Don French, who began designing his own computer and showed it to the vice president of manufacturing John V. Roach, Tandy&#x27;s former electronic data processing manager. Although the design did not impress Roach, the idea of selling a microcomputer did. When the two men visited National Semiconductor in California in mid-1976, Homebrew Computer Club member Steve Leininger&#x27;s expertise on the SC/MP microprocessor impressed them. National executives refused to provide Leininger&#x27;s contact information when French and Roach wanted to hire him as a consultant, but they found Leininger working part-time at Byte Shop. Leininger was unhappy at National, his wife wanted a better job, and Texas did not have a state income tax. Hired for his technical and retail experience, Leininger began working with French in June 1976. The company envisioned a kit, but Leininger persuaded the others that because &quot;too many people can&#x27;t solder&quot;, a preassembled computer would be better.

Tandy had 11 million customers that might buy a microcomputer, but it would be much more expensive than the median price of a Radio Shack product, and a great risk for the very conservative company. Executives feared losing money as Sears did with Cartrivision, and many opposed the project; one executive told French, &quot;Don&#x27;t waste my time—we can&#x27;t sell computers.&quot; As the popularity of CB radio—at one point comprising more than 20% of Radio Shack&#x27;s sales—declined, however, the company sought new products. In December 1976 French and Leininger received official approval for the project but were told to emphasize cost savings; for example, leaving out lowercase characters saved US$1.50 in components and reduced the retail price by . The original retail price required manufacturing cost of ; the first design had a membrane keyboard and no video monitor. Leininger persuaded Roach and French to include a better keyboard, a monitor, datacassette storage, and other features requiring a higher retail price to provide Tandy&#x27;s typical profit margin. In February 1977 they showed their prototype, running a simple tax-accounting program, to Charles Tandy, head of Tandy Corporation. The program quickly crashed as the computer&#x27;s implementation of Tiny BASIC could not handle the figure that Tandy typed in as his salary, and the two men added support for floating-point math to its Level I BASIC to prevent a recurrence. The project was formally approved on 2 February 1977; Tandy revealed that he had already leaked the computer&#x27;s existence to the press. When first inspecting the prototype, he remarked that even if it did not sell, the project could be worthy if only for the publicity it might generate.

MITS sold 1,000 Altairs in February 1975 and was selling 10,000 a year. When Charles Tandy asked who would buy the computer, company president Lewis Kornfeld admitted that they did not know if anyone would, but suggested that small businesses and schools might. Knowing that demand was very strong for the Altair—which cost more than $1,000 with a monitor—Leininger suggested that Radio Shack could sell 50,000 computers, but no one else believed him; Roach called the figure &quot;horseshit&quot;, as the company had never sold that many of anything at that price. Roach and Kornfeld suggested 1,000 to 3,000 per year; 3,000 was the quantity the company would have to produce to buy the components in bulk. Roach persuaded Tandy to agree to build 3,500—the number of Radio Shack stores—so that each store could use a computer for inventory purposes if they did not sell. RCA agreed to supply the video monitor—a black-and-white television with the tuner and speakers removed—after others refused because of Tandy&#x27;s low initial volume of production. Tandy used the black-and-silver colors of the RCA CRT unit&#x27;s cabinet for the TRS-80 units as well.

=== Announcement ===
Having spent less than on development, Radio Shack announced the TRS-80 (Tandy Radio Shack) at a New York City press conference on August 3, 1977. It cost (), or () with a 12&quot; monitor and a Radio Shack tape recorder; the most expensive product Radio Shack previously sold was a stereo. The company hoped that the new computer would help Radio Shack sell higher-priced products, and improve its &quot;schlocky&quot; image among customers. Small businesses were the primary target market, followed by educators, then consumers and hobbyists; despite its hobbyist customer base, Radio Shack saw them as &quot;not the mainstream of the business&quot; and &quot;never our large market&quot;.

Although the press conference did not receive much media attention because of a terrorist bombing elsewhere in the city, the computer received much more publicity at Boston University&#x27;s Personal Computer Fair two days later. A front-page Associated Press article discussed the novelty of a large consumer-electronics company selling a home computer that could &quot;do a payroll for up to 15 people in a small business, teach children mathematics, store your favorite recipes or keep track of an investment portfolio. It can also play cards.&quot; Six sacks of mail arrived at Tandy headquarters asking about the computer, over 15,000 people called to purchase a TRS-80—paralyzing the company switchboard—and 250,000 joined the waiting list with a $100 deposit.

Despite the internal skepticism, Radio Shack aggressively entered the market. The company advertised &quot;The $599 personal computer&quot; as &quot;the most important, useful, exciting, electronic product of our time&quot;. Kornfeld stated when announcing the TRS-80, &quot;This device is inevitably in the future of everyone in the civilized world—in some way—now and so far as ahead as one can think&quot;, and Tandy&#x27;s 1977 annual report called the computer &quot;probably the most important product we&#x27;ve ever built in a company factory&quot;. Unlike competitor Commodore—which had announced the PET several months earlier but had not yet shipped any—Tandy had its own factories (capable of producing 18,000 computers a month) and distribution network, and even small towns had Radio Shack stores. The company announced plans to be selling by Christmas a range of peripherals and software for the TRS-80, began shipping computers by September, opened its first computer-only store in October, and delivered 5,000 computers to customers by December. Still forecasting 3,000 sales a year, Radio Shack sold over 10,000 TRS-80s in its first one and a half months of sales, 55,000 in its first year, and over 200,000 during the product&#x27;s lifetime; one entered the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History. By mid-1978 the waits of two months or more for delivery were over, and the company could state in advertisements that TRS-80 was &quot;on demonstration and available &quot;from stock now&quot; at every Radio Shack store in this community!&quot;

=== Delivery ===
The first units, ordered unseen, were delivered in November 1977, and rolled out to the stores the third week of December. The line won popularity with hobbyists, home users, and small businesses. Tandy Corporation&#x27;s leading position in what &quot;Byte&quot; magazine called the &quot;1977 Trinity&quot; (Apple Computer, Commodore, and Tandy) had much to do with Tandy&#x27;s retailing the computer through more than 3,000 of its Radio Shack storefronts in the USA. Tandy claimed it had &quot;7000 [Radio Shack] stores in 40 countries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tandy/Radio Shack&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-release price for the basic system (CPU/keyboard and video monitor) was and a deposit was required, with a money-back guarantee at time of delivery.

By 1978, Tandy/Radio Shack promoted itself as &quot;The Biggest Name in Little Computers&quot;. By 1979 1,600 employees built computers in six factories. &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot; estimated in 1980 that Tandy was selling three times as many computers as Apple Computer, with both companies ahead of Commodore. By 1981, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; described Radio Shack as &quot;the dominant supplier of small computers&quot;. Hundreds of small companies produced TRS-80 software and accessories, and Adam Osborne described Tandy as &quot;the number-one microcomputer manufacturer&quot; despite having &quot;so few roots in microcomputing&quot;. That year Leininger left his job as director for advanced research; French had left to found a software company, and the company had rejected his attempt for a Tandy Computer Center to sell non-Tandy computers. while the company&#x27;s computer success helped Roach become Tandy&#x27;s CEO. Selling computers did not change the company&#x27;s &quot;schlocky&quot; image; the Radio Shack name embarrassed business customers, and Tandy executives disliked the &quot;Trash-80&quot; nickname for its products. By 1984, computers accounted for 35% of sales, however, and the company had 500 Tandy Radio Shack Computer Centers.

=== Model II and III ===
By 1979, when Radio Shack launched the business-oriented, and incompatible, TRS-80 Model II, the TRS-80 was officially renamed the TRS-80 Model I to distinguish the two product lines.

After some exhibitors at the 1979 Northeast Computer Show were forced to clarify that their products bearing the TRS-80 name were not affiliated with Radio Shack, publications and advertisers briefly began to use &quot;S-80&quot; generically rather than &quot;TRS-80&quot; under scare of legal action, though this never materialized.

Following the Model III launch in mid-1980, Tandy stated that the Model I was still sold, but it was discontinued by the end of the year. Tandy cited one of the main reasons as being the prohibitive cost of redesigning it to meet stricter FCC regulations covering the significant levels of radio-frequency interference emitted by the original design. The Model I radiated so much interference that, while playing games, an AM radio placed next to the computer can be used to provide sounds. Radio Shack offered upgrades (double-density floppy controller, LDOS, memory, reliable keyboard with numeric keypad, lowercase, Level II, RS-232C) as late as its 1984 catalog.

== Hardware ==

The Model I combines the mainboard and keyboard into one unit, which became a design trend in the 8-bit microcomputer era, although the Model I has a separate power supply unit. It uses a Zilog Z80 processor clocked at 1.78 MHz (later models shipped with a Z80A). The initial Level I machines shipped in late 1977-early 1978 have only 4 KB of RAM. After the Expansion Interface and Level II BASIC were introduced in mid-1978, RAM configurations of 16 KB and up were offered (the first 16 KB was in the Model I itself and the remaining RAM in the Expansion Interface).

The OS ROMs, I/O area, video memory, and OS work space occupy the first 16 KB of memory space on the Model I. The remaining 48 KB of the 64 KB memory map space is available for program use, subject to the amount of physical RAM installed. Although the Z80 CPU can use port-based I/O, the Model I&#x27;s I/O is memory-mapped aside from the cassette tape and RS-232 serial ports.

=== Keyboard ===
The TRS-80 Model I keyboard uses mechanical switches that suffer from &quot;keyboard bounce&quot;, resulting in multiple letters being typed per keystroke. The problem was described in Wayne Green&#x27;s editorial in the first issue of &quot;80 Micro&quot;. Dirt, cigarette smoke, or other contamination enters the unsealed key switches, causing electrical noise that the computer detects as multiple presses. The key switches can be cleaned, but the bounce recurs when the keyboard is reexposed to the contaminating environment.

Keyboard bounce only occurs in Model I computers with Level II BASIC firmware; Level I BASIC has a &quot;debounce&quot; delay to the keyboard driver to avoid the noisy switch contacts. Tandy&#x27;s utility, the Model III, the last Model I firmware, and most third-party operating systems also implement the software fix, and Tandy changed the keyboard during the Model III&#x27;s lifetime to an Alps Electric design with sealed switches. The Alps keyboard was available as an upgrade for the Model I for $79.

The keyboard is memory-mapped so that certain locations in the processor&#x27;s memory space correspond to the status of a group of keys.

=== Video and audio===

The color of the KCS 172 RCA monitor&#x27;s text is faintly blue (the standard P4 phosphor used in black-and-white televisions). Green and amber filters, or replacement tubes to reduce eye fatigue were popular aftermarket items. Later models came with a green-on-black display.

Complaints about the video display quality were common. As Green wrote, &quot;hells bells, [the monitor] &quot;is&quot; a cheap black and white television set with a bit of conversion for computer use&quot;. (The computer could be purchased without the Radio Shack monitor.) CPU access to the screen memory causes visible flicker. The bus arbitration logic blocks video display refresh (video-RAM reads) during CPU writes to the VRAM, causing a short black line. This has little effect on normal BASIC programs, but fast programs made with assembly language can be affected. Software authors worked to minimize the effect, and many arcade-style games are available for the Tandy TRS-80.

Because of bandwidth problems in the interface card that replaced the TV&#x27;s tuner, the display loses horizontal sync if large areas of white are displayed. A simple half-hour hardware fix corrects the problem.

The graphics are displayed at a resolution of 64×16 character positions on a screen measuring wide and tall. Each character is composed of a 2×3 matrix of pixels, and corresponds to one byte of the 1 KB video memory used by the TRS-80. In each of those bytes, the first six bits control which pixel is displayed. The seventh bit is ignored, and the eighth toggles graphics mode. The reason that the seventh bit is ignored is due to the company&#x27;s decision to have only seven 2102 static-RAM chips installed on the computer&#x27;s motherboard instead of eight to keep the manufacturing cost low. Thus, there are no lowercase letters in the TRS-80 character set of an unmodified Model I, and the number of both graphics symbols and alphanumeric symbols is 64. This can be worked around by deleting the unused bit and piggybacking an eighth 2102 chip onto another. The alphanumeric symbols are displayed in 5×7 matrices of pixels. The 1978 manual for the popular word processor Electric Pencil came with instructions for modifying the computer. Although the modification needs to be disabled for Level II BASIC, its design became the industry standard and was widely sold in kit form, along with an eighth 2102 chip. Later models came with the hardware for the lowercase character set to be displayed with descenders.

With higher-density RAM chips and purpose-built monitors, higher-resolution crisp displays are obtainable; 80×24-character displays are available in the Model II, Model 4, and later systems.

The Model I has no built-in speaker. Square-wave tones can be produced by outputting data to the cassette port and plugging an amplifier into the cassette &quot;Mic&quot; line. Most games use this ability for sound effects. An adapter was available to use Atari joysticks.

== Peripherals ==
=== Cassette tape drive ===
User data was originally stored on cassette tape. Radio Shack&#x27;s model CTR-41 cassette recorder was included with the US$599 package. The software-based cassette tape interface is slow and erratic; Green described it as &quot;crummy ... drives users up the wall&quot;, and the first issue of &quot;80 Micro&quot; has three articles on how to improve cassette performance. It is sensitive to audio volume, and the computer gives only a crude indication as to whether the correct volume was set, via a blinking character on screen while data is loaded. To find the correct volume at first use, the load is started and the volume is adjusted until the TRS-80 picked up the data. Then it is halted to rewind the tape and restart the load. Users were instructed to save multiple copies of a software program file, especially if audio tape cassettes instead of certified data tape was used. Automatic gain control or indicator circuits can be constructed to improve the loading process (the owner&#x27;s manual provides complete circuit diagrams for the whole machine, including the peripheral interfaces, with notes on operation).

An alternative to using tape was data transmissions from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Chip Shop&quot; programme in the UK, which broadcast software for several different microcomputers over the radio. A special program was loaded using the conventional tape interface. Then the radio broadcast was connected to the cassette tape interface. Tandy eventually replaced the CTR-41 unit with the CTR-80 which had built-in AGC circuitry (and no volume control). This helped the situation, but tape operation is still unreliable.

TRS-80 Model I computers with Level I BASIC read and write tapes at 250 baud (about 30 bytes per second); Level II BASIC doubles this to 500 baud (about 60 bytes per second). Some programmers wrote machine-language programs that increase the speed to up to 2,000 bits per second without a loss of reliability on their tape recorders. With the Model III and improved electronics in the cassette interface, the standard speed increased to 1,500 baud which works reliably on most tape recorders.

For loading and storing data from tape, the CPU creates the sound by switching the output voltage between three states, creating crude sine wave audio.

The first version of the Model I also has a hardware problem that complicated loading programs from cassette recorders. Tandy offered a small board which was installed at a service center to correct the issue. The ROMs in later models were modified to correct this.

=== Model I Expansion Interface ===
Only the Model I uses an Expansion Interface; all later models have everything integrated in the same housing.

The TRS-80 does not use the S-100 bus like other early 8080 and Z80-based computers. A proprietary Expansion Interface (E/I) box, which fits under the video monitor and serves as its base, was offered instead. Standard features of the E/I are a floppy disk controller, Centronics parallel port for a printer, and an added cassette connector. Optionally, an extra 16 or 32 KB of RAM can be installed and a daughterboard with an RS-232 port. The 40-conductor expansion connector passes through to a card edge connector, which permits the addition of external peripherals such as an outboard hard disk drive, a voice synthesizer, or a VOXBOX voice recognition unit.

Originally, printing with the Model I required the Expansion Interface, but later Tandy made an alternative parallel printer interface available.

The Model I Expansion Interface is the most troublesome part of the TRS-80 Model I system. It went through several revisions. The E/I connects to the CPU/keyboard with a 6-inch ribbon cable which is unshielded against RF interference and its card edge connector tends to oxidize due to its base metal contacts. This demands periodic cleaning with a pencil eraser in order to avoid spontaneous reboots, which contributes to its &quot;Trash-80&quot; sobriquet. Aftermarket connectors plated with gold solved this problem permanently. Software developers also responded by devising a recovery method which became a standard feature of many commercial programs. They accept an &quot;asterisk parameter&quot;, an asterisk (star) character typed following the program name when the program is run from the TRSDOS Ready prompt. When used following a spontaneous reboot (or an accidental reset, program crash, or exit to TRSDOS without saving data to disk), the program loads without initializing its data area(s), preserving any program data still present from the pre-reboot session. Thus, for example, if a VisiCalc user suffers a spontaneous reboot, to recover data the user enters at TRSDOS Ready, and Visicalc restores the previous computing session intact.

The power button on the E/I is difficult to operate as it is recessed so as to guard against the user accidentally hitting it and turning it off while in use. A pencil eraser or similar object is used to depress the power button and the E/I has no power LED, making it difficult to determine if it is running or not.

The expansion unit requires a second power supply, identical to the base unit power supply. An interior recess holds both supplies.

The user is instructed to power on and power off all peripherals in proper order to avoid corrupting data or potentially damaging hardware components. The manuals for the TRS-80 advise turning on the monitor first, then any peripherals attached to the E/I (if multiple disk drives are attached, the last drive on the chain is to be powered on first and work down from there), the E/I, and the computer last. When powering down, the computer is to be turned off first, followed by the monitor, E/I, and peripherals. In addition, users are instructed to remove all disks from the drives during power up or down (or else leave the drive door open to disengage the read/write head from the disk). This is because a transient electrical surge from the drive&#x27;s read/write head would create a magnetic pulse that could corrupt data. This was a common problem on many early floppy drives.

The E/I displays a screen full of garbage characters on power up and unless a bootable system disk is present in Drive 0, it hangs there until the user either presses on the back of the computer, which causes it to attempt to boot the disk again, or was pressed, which drops the computer into BASIC. Due to the above-mentioned problems with potentially corrupting disks, it is recommended to power up to the garbage screen with the disk drives empty, insert a system disk, and then hit .

&quot;InfoWorld&quot; compared the cable spaghetti connecting the TRS-80 Model I&#x27;s various components to the snakes in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Radio Shack offered a &quot;TRS-80 System Desk&quot; that concealed nearly all the cabling. It can accommodate the complete computer system plus up to four floppy drives and the Quick Printer. Since the cable connecting the Expansion Interface carries the system bus, it is short (about 6 inches). The user has no choice but to place the E/I directly behind the computer with the monitor on top. This causes problems for a non-Tandy monitor whose case did not fit the mounting holes. Also, the friction fit of the edge connector on the already short interconnect cable makes it possible to disconnect the system bus from the CPU if either unit is bumped during operation.

=== Floppy disk drives ===
Radio Shack introduced floppy drives in July 1978, about six months after the Model I went on sale. The Model I disk operating system TRSDOS was written by Randy Cook under license from Radio Shack; Randy claimed to have been paid $3000 for it. The first version released to the public was a buggy v2.0. This was quickly replaced by v2.1. Floppy disk operation requires buying the Expansion Interface, which included a single-density floppy disk interface (with a formatted capacity of 85K) based on the Western Digital 1771 single-density floppy disk controller chip. The industry standard Shugart Associates SA-400 minifloppy disk drive was used. Four floppy drives can be daisy-chained to the Model I. The last drive in the chain is supposed to have a termination resistor installed but often it is not needed as it is integrated into later cables.

Demand for Model I drives greatly exceeded supply at first. The drive is unreliable, partly because the interface lacked an external data separator (buffer). The early versions of TRSDOS were also buggy, and not helped by the Western Digital FD1771 chip which cannot reliably report its status for several instruction cycles after it receives a command. A common method of handling the delay was to issue a command to the 1771, perform several &quot;NOP&quot; instructions, then query the 1771 for the result. Early TRSDOS neglects the required yet undocumented wait period, and thus false status often returns to the OS, generating random errors and crashes. Once the 1771 delay was implemented, it was fairly reliable.

In 1981, Steve Ciarcia published in &quot;Byte&quot; the design for a homemade, improved expansion interface with more RAM and a disk controller for the TRS-80.

A data separator and a double-density disk controller (based on the WD 1791 chip) were made by Percom (a Texas peripheral vendor), LNW, Tandy, and others. The Percom Doubler adds the ability to boot and use double density floppies using a Percom-modified TRSDOS called DoubleDOS. The LNDoubler adds the ability to read and write diskette drives with up to 720 KB of storage, and also the older diskettes with up to 1,155 KB. Near the end of the Model I&#x27;s lifespan in 1982, upgrades were offered to replace its original controller with a double-density one.

The first disk drives offered on the Model I were Shugart SA-400s which supported 35 tracks and was the sole -inch drive on the market in 1977–78. By 1979, other manufacturers began offering drives. Models 3/4/4P uses Tandon TM-100 40-track drives. The combination of 40 tracks and double density gives a capacity of 180 kilobytes per single-sided floppy disk. The use of index-sync means that a &quot;flippy disk&quot; requires a second index hole and write-enable notch. One could purchase factory-made &quot;flippies&quot;. Some software publishers formatted one side for Apple systems and the other for the TRS-80.

The usual method of connecting floppy drives involves setting the drive letter via jumper blocks on the drive controller board, but Tandy opted for a slightly more user-friendly technique where all four select pins on the drives are jumpered and the ribbon cable is missing the Drive Select line. Thus, the user does not need to worry about moving jumpers around depending on which position on the chain a drive was in.

A standard flat floppy ribbon cable is usable on the Model I, in which case the drives is jumpered to their number on the chain, or even an IBM PC &quot;twist&quot; cable, which requires setting each drive number to 1, but only permits two drives on the chain.

Although third-party DOSes allow the user to define virtually any floppy format wanted, the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; format for TRS-80s is the baseline single-density, single-sided, 35-40 track format of the Model I.

Third-party vendors like Aerocomp made available double-sided and 80 track -inch and later -inch floppy drives with up to 720 KB of storage each. These new drives are half-height and therefore require different or modified drive housings.

=== Exatron Stringy Floppy ===
An alternative to cassette tape and floppy disk storage from Exatron sold over 4,000 units by 1981. The device is a continuous loop tape drive, dubbed the stringy floppy or ESF. It requires no Expansion Interface, plugging directly into the TRS-80&#x27;s 40-pin expansion bus, is much less expensive than a floppy drive, can read and write random-access data like a floppy drive unlike a cassette tape, and it transfers data at up to 14,400 baud. Exatron tape cartridges store over 64 KB of data. The ESF can coexist with the TRS-80 data cassette drive. Exatron also made a complementary RAM expansion board that installed in the TRS-80 keyboard to increase memory to 48 KB without the EI.

=== Hard drive ===
Radio Shack introduced a 5 MB external hard disk for the TRS-80 Model III/4 in 1983. It is the same hard disk unit offered for the Model II line, but came with OS software for Model III/4. An adapter is required to connect it to the Model I&#x27;s E/I. The unit is about the same size as a modern desktop computer enclosure. Up to four hard disks can be daisy-chained for 20 MB of storage. The LDOS operating system by Logical Systems was bundled, which provides utilities for managing the storage space and flexible backup. The initial retail price for the first (primary) unit (). Later, a 15MB hard disk was offered in a white case, which can be daisy-chained for up to 60 MB. Like most hard disks used on 8-bit machines, there is no provision for subdirectories, but the DiskDISK utility is a useful alternative that creates virtual hard disk &quot;.DSK&quot; files that can be mounted as another disk drive and used like a subdirectory would. To display the directory/contents of an unmounted DiskDISK virtual disk file, a shareware DDIR &quot;Virtual Disk Directory Utility&quot; program was commonly used.

=== Printers ===
The &quot;Quick Printer&quot; is an electrostatic rotary printer that scans the video memory through the bus connector, and prints an image of the screen onto aluminum-coated paper in about one second. However, it is incompatible with both the final, buffered version of the Expansion Interface, and with the &quot;heartbeat&quot; interrupt used for the real-time clock under Disk BASIC. This can be overcome by using special cabling, and by doing a &quot;dummy&quot; write to the cassette port while triggering the printer.

Two third-party printers were for metal-coated paper, selling for approximately DM 600 in Germany, and a dot-matrix printer built by Centronics for normal paper, costing at first DM 3000, later sold at approximately DM 1500 in some stores. It has only 7 pins, so letters with descenders such as lowercase &quot;g&quot; do not reach under the baseline, but are elevated within the normal line.

Radio Shack offered an extensive line of printers for the TRS-80 family, ranging from basic 9-pin dot matrix units to large wide-carriage line printers for professional use, daisy-wheel printers, inkjet, laser, and color plotters. All have a Centronics-standard interface and after the introduction of the Color Computer in 1980, many also had a connector for the CoCo&#x27;s serial interface.

FP-215 is a flatbed plotter.

== Software ==
=== BASIC ===
Three versions of the BASIC programming language were produced for the Model I. &quot;Level I BASIC&quot; fits in 4 KB of ROM, and &quot;Level II BASIC&quot; fits into 12 KB of ROM. Level I is single precision only and had a smaller set of commands. Level II introduced double precision floating point support and has a much wider set of commands. Level II was further enhanced when a disk system was added, allowing for the loading of &quot;Disk BASIC&quot;.

Level I BASIC is based on Li-Chen Wang&#x27;s free Tiny BASIC with more functions added by Radio Shack. The accompanying &quot;User&#x27;s Manual for Level 1&quot; by David A. Lien presents lessons on programming with text and cartoons. Lien wrote that it was &quot;written specifically for people who don&#x27;t know anything about computers ... I want you to have fun with your computer! I don&#x27;t want you to be afraid of it, because there is nothing to fear&quot;. Reviewers praised the manual&#x27;s quality. Level I BASIC has only two string variables (codice_1 and codice_2), 26 numeric variables (codice_3 – codice_4), and one array, codice_5. Code for functions like SIN(), COS() and TAN() is not included in ROM but printed at the end of the book. The only error messages are &quot;codice_6&quot; for syntax errors, &quot;codice_7&quot; for arithmetic errors such as division by zero, and &quot;codice_8&quot; for out of memory errors.

Level I BASIC is not tokenized; reserved words are stored literally. In order to maximize the code that fits into 4 KB of memory, users can enter abbreviations for reserved words. For example, writing &quot;codice_9&quot; instead of &quot;codice_10&quot; saves 3 bytes.

Level II BASIC, introduced in mid-1978, was licensed from Microsoft and is required to use the expansion bus and disk drives. Radio Shack always intended for Level I BASIC to be a stopgap until Level II was ready, and the first brochure for the Model I in January 1978 mentioned that Level II BASIC was &quot;coming soon&quot;. It is an abridged version of the 16K Extended BASIC, since the Model I has 12 KB of ROM space. According to Bill Gates, &quot;It was a sort of intermediate between 8K BASIC and Extended BASIC. Some features from Extended BASIC such as descriptive errors and user-defined functions were not included, but there were double precision variables and the PRINT USING statement that we wanted to get in. The entire development of Level II BASIC took about four weeks from start to finish.&quot; The accompanying manual is more terse and technical than the Level I manual. Original Level I BASIC-equipped machines could be retrofitted to Level II through a ROM replacement performed by Radio Shack for a fee (originally $199). Users with Level I BASIC programs stored on cassette have to convert these to the tokenized Level II BASIC before use. A utility for this was provided with the Level II ROMS.

Disk BASIC allows disk I/O, and in some cases (NewDos/80, MultiDOS, DosPlus, LDOS) adds powerful sorting, searching, full-screen editing, and other features. Level II BASIC reserves some of these keywords and issues a &quot;codice_11&quot;, suggesting a behind-the-scenes change of direction intervened between the creation of the Level II ROMs and the introduction of Disk BASIC.

Microsoft also marketed an enhanced BASIC called Level III BASIC written by Bill Gates, on cassette tape. The cassette contains a &quot;Cassette File&quot; version on one side and a &quot;disk file&quot; version on the second side for disk system users (which was to be saved to disk). Level III BASIC adds most of the functions in the full 16 KB version of BASIC plus many other TRS-80 specific enhancements. Many of Level III BASIC&#x27;s features are included in the TRS-80 Model III&#x27;s Level II BASIC and disk BASIC.

Level I BASIC was still offered on the Model I in either 4K or 16K configurations after the introduction of Level II BASIC.

=== Other programming languages ===
Radio Shack published a combined assembler and program editing package called the Series I Assembler Editor. &quot;80 Micro&quot; magazine printed a modification enabling it to run under the Model 4&#x27;s TRSDOS Version 6. Also from Radio Shack was Tiny Pascal.

Microsoft made its Fortran, COBOL and BASCOM BASIC compiler available through Radio Shack.

In 1982, Scientific Time Sharing Corporation published a version of its APL for the TRS-80 Model III as APL*PLUS/80.

=== Other applications ===
Blackjack and backgammon came with the TRS-80, and at its debut, Radio Shack offered four payroll, personal finance, and educational programs on cassette. Its own products&#x27; quality was often poor. A critical 1980 &quot;80 Micro&quot; review of a text adventure described it as &quot;yet another example of Radio Shack&#x27;s inability to deal with the consumer in a consumer&#x27;s market&quot;. The magazine added, &quot;Sadly, too, as with some other Radio Shack programs, the instructions seem to assume that the reader is either a child or an adult with the mentality of a slightly premature corned beef&quot;.

The more than 2,000 Radio Shack franchise stores sold third-party hardware and software, but the more than 4,300 company-owned stores were at first prohibited from reselling or even mentioning products not sold by Radio Shack itself. Green stated in 1980 that although &quot;there are more programs for the 80 than for all other systems combined&quot; because of the computer&#x27;s large market share, &quot;Radio Shack can&#x27;t advertise this because they are trying as hard as they can to keep this fact a secret from their customers. They don&#x27;t want the TRS-80 buyers to know that there is anything more than their handful of mediocre programs available&quot;, many of which &quot;are disastrous and, I&#x27;m sure, doing tremendous damage to the industry&quot;. Broderbund, founded that year, began by publishing TRS-80 software, but by 1983 cofounder Doug Carlston said that the computer &quot;turned out to be a terrible market because most of the distribution networks were closed, even though there were plenty of machines out there&quot;. Green wrote in 1982 that Apple had surpassed Tandy in sales and sales outlets despite the thousands of Radio Shack dealers because it supported third-party development, while &quot;we find the Shack seeming to begrudge any sale not made by them and them alone&quot;. Dealers not affiliated with Radio Shack preferred to sell software for other computers and not compete with the company; mail-order sales were also difficult, because company-owned stores did not sell third-party publications like &quot;80 Micro&quot;.

Charles Tandy reportedly wanted to encourage outside developers but after his death a committee ran the company, which refused to help outside developers, hoping to monopolize the sale of software and peripherals. Leininger reportedly resigned because he disliked the company&#x27;s bureaucracy after Tandy&#x27;s death. An author wrote in a 1979 article on the computer&#x27;s &quot;mystery of machine language graphics control&quot; that &quot;Radio Shack seems to hide the neat little jewels of information a hobbyist needs to make a treasure of the TRS-80&quot;. He stated that other than the &quot;excellent&quot; Level I BASIC manual &quot;there has been little information until recently ... TRS-80 owners must be resourceful&quot;, reporting that the computer&#x27;s &quot;keyboard, video, and cassette&quot; functionality were also undocumented. The first book authorized by Tandy with technical information on TRSDOS for the Model I did not appear until after the computer&#x27;s discontinuation.

By 1982, the company admitted—after no software appeared for the Model 16 after five months—that it should have, like Apple, encouraged third-party developers of products like the killer app VisiCalc. (A lengthy 1980 article in a Tandy publication introducing the TRS-80 version of VisiCalc did not mention that the spreadsheet had been available for the Apple II for a year.) However, in the early 1980s, it was not uncommon for small companies and municipalities to write custom programs for computers such as the TRS-80 to process a variety of data. In one case a small town&#x27;s vehicle fleet was managed from a single TRS-80.

By 1985, the company&#x27;s Ed Juge stated that other than Scripsit and DeskMate, &quot;we intend to rely mostly on &#x27;big-name&#x27;, market-proven software from leading software firms&quot;. A full suite of office applications became available from the company and others, including the VisiCalc and Multiplan spreadsheets and the Lazy Writer, Electric Pencil, and from Radio Shack itself the Scripsit and SuperScripsit word processors.

Compared to the contemporary Commodore and Apple micros, the TRS-80&#x27;s block graphics and crude sound were widely considered limited. The faster speed available to the game programmer, not having to processor color data in high resolution, went a long way to compensating for this. TRS-80 arcade games tended to be faster with effects that emphasized motion. This perceived disadvantage did not deter independent software companies such as Big Five Software from producing unlicensed versions of arcade games like Namco&#x27;s &quot;Galaxian&quot;, Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot;, Taito&#x27;s &quot;Lunar Rescue&quot;, Williams&#x27;s &quot;Make Trax&quot;, and Exidy&#x27;s &quot;Targ&quot; and &quot;Venture&quot;. Sega&#x27;s &quot;Frogger&quot; and &quot;Zaxxon&quot; were ported to the computer and marketed by Radio Shack. Namco/Midway&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot; was cloned by Philip Oliver and distributed by Cornsoft Group as &quot;Scarfman&quot;. Atari&#x27;s &quot;Battlezone&quot; was cloned for the Models I/III by Wayne Westmoreland and Terry Gilman and published by Adventure International as &quot;Armored Patrol&quot;. They also cloned &quot;Eliminator&quot; (based on &quot;Defender&quot;) and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;; the latter wasn&#x27;t published until after the TRS-80 was discontinued, because Nintendo refused to license the game.

Some games originally written for other computers were ported to the TRS-80. &quot;Microchess&quot; has three levels of play and can run in the 4 KB of memory that is standard with the Model I; the classic &quot;ELIZA&quot; is another TRS-80 port. Both were offered by Radio Shack. &quot;Apple Panic&quot;, itself a clone of Universal&#x27;s &quot;Space Panic&quot;, was written for the TRS-80 by Yves Lempereur and published by Funsoft. Epyx″s &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot; runs slowly on the TRS-80. Infocom ported its series of interactive text-based adventure games to the Models I/III; the first, &quot;Zork I&quot;, was marketed by Radio Shack.

Adventure International&#x27;s text adventures began on the TRS-80, as did &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; by Westmoreland and Gilman, later ported to the other home micros. &quot;Android Nim&quot; by Leo Christopherson was rewritten for the Commodore PET and Apple. Many games are unique to the TRS-80, including &quot;Duel-N-Droids&quot;, also by Christopherson, an early first-person shooter &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; by Software Affair (the Orchestra-80, -85 and -90 people) and shooters like &quot;Cosmic Fighter&quot; and &quot;Defence Command&quot;, and strange experimental programs such as Christopherson&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Demon&quot;, in which the player composes a song for a devil and choreographs his dance steps to the music. Radio Shack offered simple graphics animation programs &quot;Micro Movie&quot; and &quot;Micro Marquee&quot;, and &quot;Micro Music&quot;.

Radio Shack offered a number of programming utilities, including an advanced debugger, a subroutine package, and a cross-reference builder. Probably the most popular utility package was Super Utility written by Kim Watt of Breeze Computing. Other utility software such as Stewart Software&#x27;s Toolkit offered the first sorted directory, decoding or reset of passwords, and the ability to eliminate parts of TRSDOS that were not needed in order to free up floppy disk space. They also produced the On-Line 80 BBS, a TRSDOS-based Bulletin Board System. Misosys Inc. was a prolific producer of sophisticated TRS-80 utility and language software for all models of TRS-80 from the very beginning.

Perhaps because of the lack of information on TRSDOS and its bugs, by 1982 perhaps more operating systems existed for the TRS-80 than for any other computer. TRSDOS is limited in its capabilities, since like Apple DOS 3.3 on the Apple II, it is mainly conceived of as a way of extending BASIC to support disk drives. Numerous alternative DOSes appeared, the most prominent being LDOS because Radio Shack licensed it from Logical Systems and adopted it as its official DOS for its Models I and III hard disk drive products. Other alternative TRS-80 DOSes included NewDOS from Apparat, Inc., and DoubleDOS, DOSPlus, MicroDOS, UltraDOS (later called Multidos). The DOS for the Model 4 line, TRSDOS Version 6, was produced by and licensed from Logical Systems. It is a derivative of LDOS, enhanced to allow for the new Model 4 hardware such as its all-RAM architecture (no ROM), external 32 KB memory banks, bigger screen and keyboard, and featured new utilities such as a ram disk and a printer spooler.

The memory map of the Model I and III render them incompatible with the standard CP/M OS for Z80 business computers, which loads at hexadecimal address $0000 with TPA (Transient Program Area) starting at $0100; the TRS-80 ROM resides in this address space. Omikron Systems&#x27; Mappers board remaps the ROM to run unmodified CP/M programs on the Model I. A customized version of CP/M is available but loses its portability advantage. &quot;80 Micro&quot; magazine published a do-it-yourself CP/M modification for the Model III.

== Reception ==
Dan Fylstra, among the first owners, wrote in &quot;Byte&quot; in April 1978 that as an &quot;&#x27;appliance&#x27; computer ... the TRS-80 brings the personal computer a good deal closer to the average customer&quot;, suitable for home and light business use. He concluded that it &quot;is not the only alternative for the aspiring personal computer user, but it is a strong contender.&quot; Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1980 that &quot;the basic TRS-80 is a lot of computer for the money&quot;. He criticized the quality of Tandy&#x27;s application and system software and the high cost of peripherals, but reported that with the Omikron board a customer paid less than $5000 for a computer compatible with TRS-80 and CP/M software &quot;all without building a single kit&quot;.

Three years later Pournelle was less positive about the computer. He wrote in May 1983, &quot;As to our TRS-80 Model I, we trashed that sucker long ago. It was always unreliable, and repeated trips to the local Radio Shack outlet didn&#x27;t help. The problem was that Tandy cut corners&quot;. Pournelle wrote in July 1983:

== Compatible successors ==

Tandy replaced the Model I with the broadly compatible Model III in 1980. (The TRS-80 Model II is an entirely different and incompatible design).

=== Model III ===

Tandy released the TRS-80 Model III on July 26, 1980. The improvements of the Model III over the Model I include: built-in lowercase, a better keyboard with repeating keys, an enhanced character set, a real-time clock, 1500-baud cassette interface, a faster (2.03 MHz) Z80 processor, and an all-in-one enclosure requiring fewer cables. A Model III with two floppy drives requires the use of only one electrical outlet; a two-drive Model I requires five outlets. The Model III avoids the complicated power on/off sequence of the Model I. Shortly after the Model III&#x27;s introduction, Model I production was discontinued as it did not comply with new FCC regulations as of January 1, 1981, regarding electromagnetic interference.

Tandy distinguished between the high-end Model II and Model III, describing the former as &quot;an administrative system, good for things like word processing, data management and VisiCalc operations&quot; and suitable for small businesses. The lowest-priced version of the Model III was sold with 4 KB of RAM and cassette storage. The computer&#x27;s CPU board has three banks of sockets (8 sockets to a bank) which take type 4116 DRAMs, so memory configurations come in 16 KB, 32 KB, or 48 KB RAM memory sizes. Computers with 32 KB or 48 KB RAM can be upgraded with floppy disk drive storage. There is space inside the computer cabinet for two full-height drives. Those offered by Tandy/Radio Shack are single-sided, 40-track, double-density (MFM encoding) for 180K of storage. Third-party suppliers offered double-sided and 80-track drives, though to control them they had to modify the TRSDOS driver code or else furnish an alternative third-party DOS which could (see below). The installation of floppy disk drives also requires the computer&#x27;s power supply to be upgraded. There is no internal cooling fan in the Model III; it uses passive convection cooling (unless an unusual number of power-hungry expansions were installed internally, such as a hard disk drive, graphics board, speedup kit, RS-232 board, etc.).

Tandy claimed that the Model III was compatible with 80% of Model I software. Many software publishers issued patches to permit their Model I programs to run on the Model III. Marketing director Ed Juge explained that their designers considered changing from the Model I&#x27;s 64-column by 16-row video screen layout, but that they ultimately decided that maintaining compatibility was most important.

The Model III&#x27;s memory map and system architecture are mostly the same as the Model I&#x27;s, but the disk drives and printer port were moved from memory mapped to port I/O, thus Model I software that attempts to manipulate the disk controller directly or output to the printer (in particular Model I DOSes and application packages such as Visicalc and Scripsit) will not work. Under the supplied TRSDOS 1.3 operating system Model I disks can be read in the Model III, but not vice versa. The optional LDOS OS (by Logical Systems Inc.) uses a common disk format for both Model I and Model III versions.

Customers and developers complained of bugs in the Model III&#x27;s Microsoft BASIC interpreter and TRSDOS. Tandy/Radio Shack (and TRS-80 magazines like &quot;80 Micro&quot;) periodically published many software patches to correct these deficiencies and to permit users to customize the software to their preferences.

Differences in the WD1771 and WD1791 floppy controllers created problems reading Model I disks on a Model III (the double-density upgrade in the Model I included both chips while a Model III had only the WD1791). The WD1771 supports four data markers while the WD1791 only supports two, and some versions of TRSDOS for the Model I also use them. In addition, they are used by copy protection schemes. Software was available to allow Model I disks to be read on a Model III. The WD1791 supports the 500-bit/s bitrate needed for high-density floppy drives, but the controller is not capable of using them without extensive modifications.

TRSDOS for the Model III was developed in-house by Radio Shack rather than being contracted out like the Model I&#x27;s DOS. None of the code base from Model I DOS was reused and the Model III DOS was rewritten from scratch; this also created some compatibility issues since the Model III DOS&#x27;s API was not entirely identical to the Model I DOS. This was primarily to avoid legal disputes with Randy Cook over ownership of the code as had occurred with Model I DOS and also because Radio Shack originally planned several features for the Model III such as 80-column text support that were not included. Two early versions, 1.1 and 1.2, were replaced by version 1.3 in 1981 which became the standard Model III OS. TRSDOS 1.3 is not format compatible with 1.1 and 1.2; a utility called XFERSYS is provided which converts older format disks to TRSDOS 1.3 format (this change is permanent and the resultant disks cannot be read with the older DOS versions).

The Model III&#x27;s boot screen was cleaned up from the Model I. Instead of displaying garbage on the screen at power up, it displays a &quot;Diskette?&quot; prompt if a bootable floppy is not detected. The user can insert a disk and press any key to boot. On powerup or reset holding down the key will boot the computer into ROM-based Level II BASIC. This ability is useful if the disk drive is not functioning and cannot boot a TRSDOS disk (or if a boot disk is not available); it permits an operator familiar with the machine hardware to perform diagnostics using BASIC&#x27;s PEEK and POKE commands. This works for the Model 4 as well, but not for the 4P.

While Model I DOS is fairly flexible in its capabilities, Model III DOS is hard-coded to only support 180K single-sided floppies, a problem fixed by the many third-party DOSes. To that end, when Radio Shack introduced hard disks for the TRS-80 line in 1982, the company licensed LDOS rather than attempting to modify Model III DOS for hard disk support.

Level II BASIC on the Model III is 16 KB in size and incorporates a few features from Level I Disk BASIC.

TRSDOS 1.3 was given a few more minor updates, the last being in 1984, although the version number was unchanged. This includes at least one update that writes an Easter Egg message &quot;Joe, you rummy buzzard&quot; on an unused disk sector, which is reputedly a joke message left by a programmer in a beta version, but accidentally included in the production master.

The Model III keyboard lacks . Many application programs use , while others use . Often is used in combination with number and alpha keys. The Model III keyboard also lacks ; to caps-lock the alpha keys the user presses . Under LDOS typeahead is supported.

Because TRSDOS 1.3 was found wanting by many users, Tandy offered (at added cost) Logical System&#x27;s LDOS Version 5 as an alternative. As with the Model I, other third-party sources also offered TRSDOS alternatives for the Model III, including NewDOS, Alphabit&#x27;s MultiDOS, and Micro Systems Software&#x27;s DOSPlus. These are compatible with TRSDOS 1.3 and run the same application programs, but offer improved command structures, more and better system utilities, and enhancements to the Microsoft BASIC interpreter. After writing the original Model I TRSDOS, Randy Cook began work on his own DOS, titled VTOS, which was superseded by LDOS and also created some frustration for users as it is the only TRS-80 DOS to be copy-protected.

Although mostly intended as a disk-based computer, the Model III was available in a base cassette configuration with no disk hardware and only 16 KB of RAM with Level II BASIC. Radio Shack also offered a 4K version with Level I BASIC, identical to Model I Level I BASIC, but with the addition of LPRINT and LLIST commands for printer output. Upgrading to a disk machine necessitates installing at least 32 KB of RAM, the disk controller board, and another power supply for the disk drives. Disk upgrades purchased from Radio Shack included TRSDOS 1.3; users upgrading from third-party vendors had to purchase DOS separately (most opted for LDOS or DOSPlus), though a great many Model III applications programs included a licensed copy of TRSDOS 1.3.

As with the Model I&#x27;s E/I, the RS-232C port on the Model III was an extra cost option and not included in the base price of the computer, though the dual disk Model III for $2495 included the serial port.

Like the Model I, the Model III sold well in the educational market. Many school administrators valued the Model III&#x27;s all-in-one hardware design because it made it more difficult for students to steal components. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; approved of the Model III&#x27;s single-unit design, simplified cable management, and improvements such as lack of keyboard bounce and improved disk reliability. The reviewer, a former Model I owner, stated &quot;I&#x27;m impressed&quot; and that &quot;had the Model III been available, it&#x27;s probable that I wouldn&#x27;t have sold it&quot;. He concluded, &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for a computer that&#x27;s not too expensive but that performs well, you would be wise to test the Model III—you might end up buying it.&quot;

Don French, who had left Radio Shack to found FMG Software after designing the Model I, expressed his disappointment in the new machine while trying to convert CP/M to run on it. &quot;I&#x27;ve encountered numerous problems with the floppy drive and its interface. Radio Shack will sell a Model III to anyone. They&#x27;re trying to market it as a business computer when the existing software is woefully inadequate. 48K just isn&#x27;t enough. You run out of memory before you get going. They&#x27;re selling a medical package that takes up nine disks. I think the Model III is a very poorly conceived machine&quot;.

==== Aftermarket products ====
Aftermarket hardware was offered by Tandy/Radio Shack and many third-party manufacturers. The usual selection of add-ons and peripherals available for the Model I were offered: outboard floppy drives (one or two could be plugged into a card-edge connector on the back panel), an outboard hard disk drive (LDOS was furnished as Tandy&#x27;s hard drive OS vice TRSDOS), an RS-232C serial port on an internal circuit card, and a parallel printer (connected by a card-edge connector). Multiple high-resolution graphics solutions were available. The official Radio Shack Model III high-resolution graphics board had a screen resolution of 640 x 240 pixels. The third-party Micro-Labs &quot;Grafyx Solution&quot; board had a screen resolution of 512 x 192 pixels.
A popular hardware/software add-on was the Orchestra-90 music synthesizer. It can be programmed to play up to five voices with a range of six octaves stereophonically. A great many Orch-90 (as it was often called) music files were available for download from CompuServe. The Orch-90 was licensed from a company called Software Affair, which also produced the Model I-compatible Orchestra-85 from 1981.

At least three vendors produced CP/M modifications for the Model III, Omikron (also a Model I mod), Holmes Engineering, and Memory Merchant. Options were available for upgrading the CRT to the CP/M professional standard of 80 columns and 24 rows, as well as eight-inch floppy drives.

A number of third-party manufacturers specialized in upgrading Model IIIs with high-performance hardware and software, and remarketing them under their own labels. The improvements typically included internal hard disk drives, greater capacity floppy drives, 4 MHz Z80 speedup kits, professional-grade green or amber CRT video displays, better DOS software (typically DOSPlus by Micro Systems Software or LDOS by Logical Systems) including the all-important hard drive backup utilities, and custom menu-driven shell interfaces which insulated non-expert users (business employees) from the DOS command line. These were touted as high productivity turnkey systems for small businesses at less cost than competing business systems from higher-end providers such as IBM and DEC, as well as Radio Shack&#x27;s own TRS-80 Model II.

=== Model 4 ===

The successor to the Model III is the TRS-80 Model 4 released in April 1983. It has a faster Z80A CPU, a larger video display 80 columns x 24 rows with reverse video, bigger keyboard, internal speaker, and its 64 KB of RAM can be upgraded to 128 KB of bank-switched RAM. The display can be upgraded with a high-resolution graphics card yielding 640240 pixels. The Model 4 is fully compatible with Model III and CP/M application software. A diskless Model 4 (with 16 KB RAM and Level II BASIC) cost , with 64 KB RAM and one single-sided 180K disk drive , and two drives with RS-232C ; an upgrade for Model III owners cost and provided a new motherboard and keyboard. Tandy sold 71,000 in 1984.

The Model 4 includes all of the Model III&#x27;s hardware, port assignments, and operating modes, making it 100% compatible. Model III programs running on a Model 4 can access the Model 4&#x27;s added hardware features (like 4 MHz clock rate, bigger video screen and keyboard, banked RAM above 64 KB). There were aftermarket software packages that made this ability available to non-programmer users.

The Model 4P is a transportable version introduced in September 1983 and discontinued in early 1985. It is functionally the same as the dual-drive desktop model but lacks the card edge connector for two outboard diskette drives and for a cassette tape interface. It has a slot for an internal modem card and could emulate a Model III.

The Model 4D with bundled Deskmate productivity suite was introduced in early 1985. It has a revised CPU board using faster gate array logic which includes the floppy controller and RS-232C circuitry, all on a single board. The computer has two internal double-sided diskette drives and is the last model descended from the 1977 Model I. It retailed for at its introduction in 1985. During 1987–1988 the retail stores removed the Model 4Ds from display but they were available by special order through 1991.

=== Model 100 ===

Also in April 1983, Radio Shack released the TRS-80 Model 100, one of the first laptop-portable computers.

Manufactured by Kyocera, the Model 100 features an LCD with 8 lines of 40 characters each, 8 kilobytes of RAM (expandable to 32KB), and is powered by AA cell batteries (or a plug-in adapter). A built-in modem and 25-pin RS-232 serial port provided connectivity.

With the rudementary operating system held in ROM, the Model 100 (and the improved model, named the Tandy 102) was ready to use immediately after sliding the power switch on, and work would be held ready when switched off, making it convenient to use for a few moments at a time. This speed made the Model 100/102 useful well after powerful—and slower-booting—laptop computers became common.

The Model 100-series computers also found popularity as a field-portable communications terminal due to its light weight and simplicity.

<doc id="30755" wikidata="Q3112607" url="?curid=30755" title="The Balloon-Hoax">
<text>&quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot; is the title used in collections and anthologies of a newspaper article by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1844 in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in New York. Originally presented as a true story, it detailed European Monck Mason&#x27;s trip across the Atlantic Ocean in only three days in a gas balloon. It was later revealed as a hoax and the story was retracted two days later.

==Overview==
The story now known as &quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot; was first printed in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in New York. The article provided a detailed and highly plausible account of a lighter-than-air balloon trip by European balloonist Monck Mason across the Atlantic Ocean taking 75 hours, along with a diagram and specifications of the craft.

Poe may have been inspired, at least in part, by a prior journalistic hoax known as the &quot;Great Moon Hoax&quot;, published in the same newspaper in 1835. One of the suspected writers of that hoax, Richard Adams Locke, was Poe&#x27;s editor at the time &quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot; was published. Poe had complained for a decade that the paper&#x27;s Great Moon Hoax had plagiarized (by way of Locke) the basic idea from &quot;The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall&quot;, one of Poe&#x27;s less successful stories which also involved similar inhabitants on the Moon. Poe felt &quot;The Sun&quot; had made tremendous profits from his story without giving him a cent. (Poe&#x27;s anger at &quot;The Sun&quot; is chronicled in the 2008 book &quot;The Sun and the Moon&quot; by Matthew Goodman.)

==Publication history==

The story was first published on April 13, 1844 in the New York &quot;Sun&quot;. It ran with the headline:

:ASTOUNDING NEWS!
:BY EXPRESS VIA NORFOLK:
:THE ATLANTIC CROSSED
:IN THREE DAYS!
:SIGNAL TRIUMPH OF
:MR. MONCK MASON&#x27;S
:FLYING MACHINE!!!
:Arrival at Sullivan&#x27;s Island,
:near Charlestown, S. C., of
:Mr. Mason, Mr. Robert Hol-
:land, Mr. Henson, Mr. Har-
:rison Ainsworth, and four
:others, in the
:STEERING BALLOON
:&quot;VICTORIA,&quot;
:AFTER A PASSAGE OF
:SEVENTY-FIVE HOURS
:FROM LAND TO LAND.
:FULL PARTICULARS
:OF THE
:VOYAGE!!!

A retraction concerning the article was printed in &quot;The Sun&quot; on April 15, 1844:

==Critical reception and significance==
Poe himself describes the enthusiasm his story had aroused: he writes that the &quot;Sun&quot; building was &quot;besieged&quot; by people wanting copies of the newspaper. &quot;I never witnessed more intense excitement to get possession of a newspaper&quot;, he wrote. The story&#x27;s impact reflects on the period&#x27;s infatuation with progress. Poe added realistic elements, discussing at length the balloon&#x27;s design and propulsion system in believable detail. His use of real people, including William Harrison Ainsworth, also lent credence to the story. The character of Monck Mason was not a real person, though he was based heavily on Thomas Monck Mason; the story borrowed heavily from Mason&#x27;s 1836 book &quot;Account of the Late Aeronautical Expedition from London to Weilburg&quot;.

&quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot; is like one of Poe&#x27;s &quot;tales of ratiocination&quot; (such as &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;) in reverse: rather than taking things apart to solve a problem, Poe builds up fiction to make it seem true. The story is also an early form of science fiction, specifically responding to the emerging technology of hot air balloons.

The story may have later been an inspiration for Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. As Verne scholar William Butcher pointed out, Verne was an early admirer of Poe and his novel &quot;Cinq semaines en ballon&quot; (&quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;) was published within a year of his non-fiction book &quot;Edgar Poe et ses œuvres&quot; (&quot;Edgar Allan Poe and his Works&quot;). Verne even has a character mention Poe&#x27;s story in &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. It is not difficult to see Poe&#x27;s works, published in France as &quot;Histoires extraordinaires&quot; (&quot;&quot;Extraordinary Stories&quot;), as one of the influences on Verne&#x27;s &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot; (&quot;Extraordinary Journeys&quot;&quot;).

== Real trans-oceanic lighter-than-air flights ==

The first human-carrying lighter-than-air craft of any type to cross the Atlantic was in 1919. The British dirigible R-34, a direct copy of the German L-33 which crashed in Britain during World War I. The 3559.5 mile flight from Britain to New York City took 108 hours 12 minutes.

The first human-carrying unpowered balloon to actually cross the Atlantic Ocean was &quot;Double Eagle II&quot; from August 11 to 17, 1978. The Pacific was crossed in three days by unmanned Japanese &quot;fire balloons&quot; called Fu-Go in 1944, exactly 100 years after Poe&#x27;s story.

<text>Publius Terentius Afer (; – ), better known in English as Terence (), was a playwright during the Roman Republic. He was the author of six comedies based on Greek originals by Menander or Apollodorus of Carystus. All six of Terence&#x27;s plays survive complete and were originally produced between 166–160 BC.

According to ancient authors, Terence was born in Carthage and was brought to Rome as a slave, where he gained an education and his freedom; around the age of 25, Terence is said to have made a voyage to the east in search of inspiration for his plays, where he died either of disease in Greece, or by shipwreck on the return voyage. However, Terence&#x27;s traditional biography is often thought to consist of speculation by ancient scholars who lived too long after Terence to have access to reliable facts about his life.

Terence&#x27;s plays quickly became standard school texts. He ultimately secured a place as one of the four authors taught to all grammar pupils in the Western Roman Empire, and retained a central place in the European school curriculum until the 19th Century, exercising a formative influence on authors such as William Shakespeare and Molière.

== Life and career ==
The manuscripts of Terence&#x27;s plays contain &quot;didascaliae,&quot; or production notices, recording the dates, occasions, and personnel of early productions of the plays, and identifying the author of the Greek original. Other traditional information about the life of Terence derives from the &quot;Vita Terenti,&quot; a biography preserved in Aelius Donatus&#x27; commentary, and attributed by him to Suetonius. However, it is not likely that Terence&#x27;s contemporaries would have considered a dramatist important enough to write down his biography for posterity, and the narrative given by Suetonius&#x27; sources is often construed as conjecture based on the play texts and &quot;didascaliae.&quot;

===Conditions of performance===

In the 2nd Century BC, plays were regular features of four annual Roman festivals: the Ludi Romani (September), the Ludi Plebeii (November), the Ludi Apollinares (July), and the Ludi Megalenses (April); plays would also be staged at votive games, triumphs, and the more elaborate aristocratic funerals. Because the Roman calendar ran some two and a half months ahead of the Sun in the 160s, Terence&#x27;s plays that premiered at the Megalensia, though officially scheduled in April, would actually have premiered in late January.

There was no permanent theatre in Rome until the construction of the Theatre of Pompey in 55 BC, and Terence&#x27;s plays would have been performed on temporary wooden stages constructed for the occasion. The limited space available would probably have accommodated an audience of less than 2,000 persons at a given performance. Admission was free to the entire population, seemingly on a first-come-first-served basis, except for the reservation of seats for members of the Senate after 194 BC; descriptions of 2nd Century theatre audiences refer to the presence of women, children, slaves, and the urban poor.

In Greek New Comedy, from which the Roman comic tradition derived, actors wore masks which were conventionally associated with stock character types. Ancient authors make conflicting statements on whether Roman actors also wore masks in the time of Terence. For a time, Christian Hoffer&#x27;s 1877 dissertation &quot;On the Use of Masks in Publius Terentius&#x27; Comedies&quot; won universal acceptance for the view that masks were not worn at the original performances of the plays of Terence. However, most more recent authorities consider it highly likely that Roman actors of Terence&#x27;s time did wear masks when performing this kind of play, and &quot;hard to believe&quot; or even &quot;inconceivable&quot; that they did not. Donatus states that the actors wore masks in the original productions of the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; and the &quot;Adelphoe.&quot;

===The &quot;didascaliae&quot;===

According to the &quot;didascaliae,&quot; each of Terence&#x27;s plays was originally produced by the acting company of Lucius Ambivius Turpio, and musical accompaniment for each of the plays was provided by a tibicen named Flaccus, a slave in the service of a certain Claudius. The traditional and generally accepted chronology of the plays established according to the &quot;didascaliae&quot; is as follows:

* 166 BC: &quot;Andria&quot; at the Ludi Megalenses
* 165 BC: abortive production of &quot;Hecyra&quot; at the Ludi Megalenses
* 163 BC: &quot;Heauton timorumenos&quot; at the Ludi Megalenses
* 161 BC: &quot;Eunuchus&quot; at the Ludi Megalenses; &quot;Phormio&quot; at the Ludi Romani
* 160 BC: &quot;Adelphoe,&quot; and second abortive production of &quot;Hecyra,&quot; at the funeral games of Aemilius Paullus; third (and successful) production of &quot;Hecyra&quot; at the Ludi Romani

The &quot;didascalia&quot; for each play also identifies its position in the corpus by chronological order. The &quot;didascaliae&quot; state that &quot;Eunuchus&quot; was the second play (&quot;facta II&quot;), and &quot;Heauton timorumenos&quot; was the third (&quot;facta III&quot;), testimony seemingly contradicted by the dates of production, as well as by Donatus&#x27; statement that the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; was &quot;published third&quot; (&quot;edita tertium&quot;). Some scholars have explained the discrepancy by positing an unsuccessful production of &quot;Eunuchus&quot; in 165 or 164 BC, or by interpreting the numbering in reference to the order of composition rather than the order of production. The didascalic numbering, seemingly discounting the unsuccessful productions of &quot;Hecyra,&quot; reckons it the fifth play.

The &quot;didascaliae&quot; also appear to record some information about revival performances at least as late as the 140s. Patrick Tansey has argued that the &quot;didascalia&quot; to &quot;Phormio&quot; in the codex Bembinus contains garbled names of the consuls in 106 BC, which would be the last attested production of Terence before the Renaissance, though the consuls of 141 BC had similar names.

===The prologues===

The Greek plays which provided the Roman comedians with their material typically had a prologue which either preceded the play, or interrupted the first act after one or two scenes. In the plays of Plautus, the prologue usually, but not invariably, provides exposition of the plot; Terence abandons the traditional expository function of the prologue entirely and uses it to provide a different kind of entertainment centring on replies to criticism of his work.

Terence particularly refers the &quot;slanders&quot; he has suffered to a certain &quot;old&quot; and &quot;spiteful&quot; poet. Because Terence says this man was the translator of Menander&#x27;s &quot;Phasma&quot; and &quot;Thesaurus&quot; (&quot;Eu.&quot; 9–10), Donatus (or an earlier commentator from whom Donatus gleaned this information) was able to identify him as Luscius Lanuvinus, although no names are used in the prologues. Nothing survives of Luscius&#x27; work save two lines of the &quot;Thesaurus&quot; quoted by Donatus, nor is anything known about Luscius independently of Terence&#x27;s prologues except that Volcacius Sedigitus rated Luscius the ninth-best Latin comic poet (and Terence the sixth-best). Terence&#x27;s description of Luscius as &quot;old&quot; may refer to a style of play-writing that Terence considered old-fashioned rather than to advanced age. Terence&#x27;s judgement of Luscius&#x27; work is that &quot;by translating them well and writing them badly, he has made good Greek plays into Latin ones that aren&#x27;t good&quot; (&quot;Eu.&quot; 7–8), and that Luscius&#x27; theatrical successes were due more to the efforts of the actors than of the author. (&quot;Ph.&quot; 9–11)

According to Suetonius, Terence was born in Carthage. He came to Rome as a slave in the household of an otherwise unknown senator named P. Terentius Lucanus, who educated him and freed him because of his talent and good looks. Terence then took the &quot;nomen&quot; &quot;Terentius&quot; from his patron. Possibly winning noblemen&#x27;s favour by his youthful beauty, Terence became a member of the so-called Scipionic Circle.

When Terence offered his first play, &quot;Andria,&quot; to the aediles, they bade him first read it to Caecilius. Terence, shabbily dressed, went to the older poet&#x27;s house when he was dining, and when Caecilius had heard only a few lines, he invited the young man to join him for the meal. The historicity of this meeting has been doubted on the grounds that it is improbable Terence, with his aristocratic patrons, would have been unable to dress himself decently for such an important interview; a suspiciously similar story is told about the tragedians Accius and Pacuvius; and Jerome&#x27;s statement that Caecilius died the year after Ennius implies that Caecilius died two years before &quot;Andria&quot; was produced. However, Thomas Carney argues that Jerome&#x27;s dating of Caecilius&#x27; death is not above suspicion, and besides, a delay of several years between this meeting and production is entirely plausible, as Caecilius may have been impressed by the novice playwright&#x27;s work even while the discussion showed Terence the need for revision. R. C. Flickinger argues that the reported state of Terence&#x27;s clothing shows that he had not yet become acquainted with his rich and influential patrons at the time of this meeting, and it was precisely Caecilius&#x27; death shortly thereafter, and the consequent loss of his support, which caused a two-year delay in production.

All six of Terence&#x27;s plays pleased the people; the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; earned 8,000 &quot;nummi,&quot; the highest price that had ever been paid for a comedy at Rome, and was acted twice in the same day. Donatus, who appears to understand that Terence himself received this entire amount, interprets the price that Suetonius says was paid for the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; as 8,000 sesterces. However, Dwora Gilula argues that the term &quot;nummus,&quot; inscribed on the title page in 161 BC, would refer to a denarius, a coin containing a much larger quantity of silver, so that the price paid for the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; was really 32,000 sesterces.

When he was about the age of 25 (or, according to some manuscripts, 35), Terence travelled to Greece or Asia and never returned. Suetonius&#x27; sources disagree about the motive and destination of Terence&#x27;s voyage, as well as about whether he died of illness in Greece, or died by shipwreck on the return voyage. Suetonius places Terence&#x27;s death &quot;in the consulship of Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior,&quot; i.e., in 159 BC. It is possible that the fateful voyage to Greece was a speculative explanation of why he wrote so few plays inferred from Terence&#x27;s complaint in &quot;Eunuchus&quot; 41–3 about the limited materials at his disposal.

As transmitted in the manuscript tradition, the &quot;Vita&quot; attributes the claim to Q. Cosconius that Terence died by shipwreck while returning from Greece &quot;cum C et VIII fabulis conversis a Menandro,&quot; an expression interpreted by some to refer to 108 new plays that Terence had adapted from Menander, but by Carney as &quot;108 stories dramatised by Menander,&quot; who is credited with having written exactly this number of plays. If this number refers to new Terentian plays, it is improbable that Terence worked at such a rate after having previously finished less than one play a year, and some editors delete the number, supposing that the numeral &quot;CVIII&quot; is simply a double copying of the preposition &quot;CVM,&quot; subsequently rationalised as a number.

Terence was said to have been of &quot;moderate height, slender, and of dark complexion.&quot; Suetonius&#x27; description of Terence&#x27;s complexion is likely an inference from his supposed African origin, and his description of the poet&#x27;s physique may have originated as a metaphor for the &quot;lightness&quot; of his verse style, just as the poet Philitas of Cos was said to have weighted his shoes with lead lest he blow away in the wind. Likenesses of Terence found in medieval manuscripts have no authenticity. Suetonius says that Terence was survived by a daughter who later married a Roman knight, and was said to have left 20 acres of gardens on the Appian Way, a report contradicted by another of Suetonius&#x27; sources who says that Terence died poor.

===Name and ethnicity===
Ancient biographers&#x27; reports that Terence was born in Africa may be an inference from his name and not independent biographical information. His cognomen &quot;Afer&quot; (&quot;the [North] African&quot;) may indicate that Terence hailed from ancient Libya. However, such names did not necessarily denote origin, and there were Romans who had this cognomen who were not Africans, such as Domitius Afer.

It has often been asserted on the basis of the name that Terence was of Berber descent, as the Romans distinguished between Berbers, called &quot;Afri&quot; in Latin, and Carthaginians, called &quot;Poeni.&quot; However, lexicographic evidence does not support the validity of this distinction during Terence&#x27;s lifetime. If Terence was born as a slave in Carthage, it is possible his mother was an ethnic Italian brought there as a war captive by Hannibal. Carney argues that Terence must have been born from the Italiote Greek population enslaved by Hannibal, as this would explain his proficiency in Latin and Greek. F. H. Sandbach notes that in the modern world, it is rare, but not entirely unknown, for an author to achieve literary distinction in a second language.

===Dates===
Terence&#x27;s date of birth is uncertain, though Sesto Prete infers from Terence&#x27;s characterisation of himself as a &quot;new&quot; writer (&quot;Eu.&quot; 43), and of a rival poet as &quot;old&quot; (&quot;Hau.&quot; 23), that Terence was young when he wrote his plays in the 160s. Suetonius&#x27; statement that Terence died at about the age of 25 in 159 BC would imply that he was born in 184 BC, the same year as the death of Plautus, and was only 18 years old when he produced his first play. The variant reading that Terence was in his 30s when he died suggests instead that he was born ten years earlier in 194, which would appear to be supported by the statement attributed to Fenestella that Terence was older than Scipio and Laelius. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; places Terence&#x27;s death in 158 BC.

== Plays ==

Like Plautus, Terence adapted Greek plays from the late phases of Attic comedy. Unlike Plautus though, Terence&#x27;s way of writing his comedies was more in a simple conversational Latin, pleasant and direct, while less visually humorous to watch.

Five of Terence&#x27;s plays are about a pair of young men in love (in the &quot;Hecyra&quot; there is only one young man, who is already married, but who suspects his wife of infidelity). In all the plays there are two girls involved, one a citizen woman, the other a prostitute. In four of the plays a recognition (&quot;anagnorisis&quot; or &quot;anagnorismos&quot;) occurs which proves that one of the girls is the long-lost daughter of a respectable citizen, thus making the way free for her marriage.

Terence&#x27;s six plays are:
* &quot;Andria&quot; (&quot;The Girl from Andros&quot;) (166 BC)
::A young Athenian, Pamphilus, is desperately in love with Glycerium, a foreign girl of low class, and has made her pregnant. But his father Simo wants him to marry the daughter of his friend Chremes. Meanwhile his friend Charinus is in love with the daughter that Pamphilus rejects. The wily slave Davus advises Pamphilus to agree to the marriage, believing that Chremes will object to it because of his affair with Glycerium, but the plan goes wrong when Chremes agrees to the marriage after all. Pamphilus is furious with Davus. Simo is also furious since he believes that birth of Glycerium&#x27;s baby is just one of Davus&#x27;s tricks. The situation is saved when, thanks to the arrival of a stranger from Andros, Chremes realises that Glycerium is his own long-lost daughter. The two young men get to marry the girls of their choice and Davus is rescued from punishment.

* &quot;Heauton Timorumenos&quot; (&quot;The Self-Tormentor&quot;) (163 BC)
::An Athenian farmer, Chremes, asks his neighbour Menedemus why he works all day on his farm. Menedemus says he is punishing himself for allowing his anger over his son Clinia&#x27;s love affair with a poor girl to push the boy into going abroad on military service; he misses him terribly. On returning home Chremes finds that Clinia has returned and is visiting Chremes&#x27; son Clitipho. Chremes&#x27; wily slave Syrus brings Clinia&#x27;s girlfriend Antiphila to Chremes&#x27; house; but he also brings Clitipho&#x27;s girlfriend, the expensive courtesan Bacchis. To conceal Clitipho&#x27;s affair, he says they will pretend to Chremes that Bacchis is Clinia&#x27;s girlfriend, and that Antiphila is one of Bacchis&#x27;s servants. In another ruse he suggests to Chremes that Chremes should persuade Menedemus to buy Antiphila so that Clinia can stay with Bacchis. However, when Clitipho&#x27;s mother discovers from a ring that Antiphila is her own daughter, whom Chremes had ordered to be exposed as a baby, this plan falls through. Undeterred, Syrus tricks Chremes into paying money to Bacchis for Antiphila&#x27;s release. But when Chremes learns that it is Clitipho who is in love with Bacchis, he is furious, especially at the thought of how much Bacchis will cost. At first he threatens to disinherit Clitipho, but eventually he forgives him on condition that he agrees to marry a suitable girl at once. Clinia, meanwhile, is allowed to marry Antiphila. Syrus is also forgiven.

* &quot;Eunuchus&quot; (&quot;The Eunuch&quot;) (161 BC)
::A young man, Phaedria, is in love with a courtesan, Thais. He reluctantly agrees to leave town for a couple of days so that Thais can spend time with a rival lover, Thraso, who has promised to give her a certain slave girl who had previously been in her family. Before leaving town, Phaedria gives Thais an African maid and a eunuch. But while he is absent his 16-year-old brother Chaerea, at the suggestion of the slave Parmeno, disguises himself as the eunuch, gains access to Thais&#x27;s house, and rapes the young girl, who is actually an Athenian citizen kidnapped in childhood. Thais&#x27;s plans to restore the girl to her family are ruined. The situation is resolved when Chaerea begs Thais for forgiveness and offers to marry the girl himself. Phaedria gets to continue his affair with Thais, but is persuaded to share her with Thraso, who is richer than he is and can defray the expense of her upkeep. Parmeno, despite the gleeful predictions of Thais&#x27;s maid Pythias, in the end escapes punishment.

* &quot;Phormio&quot; (161 BC)
::While their fathers are away Antipho has fallen in love with a poor orphaned citizen, and his cousin Phaedria has fallen for a slave girl. Phormio, a parasite, has helped Antipho to marry the poor girl by making a false claim in court. When Antipho&#x27;s father Demipho returns he is furious because he had wanted Antipho to marry his brother Chremes&#x27;s daughter. Chremes agrees to pay Phormio 30 minae on condition that he removes the girl and marries her himself. Too late Chremes realises that the poor girl is his own daughter. He tries to undo the arrangement with Phormio, but Phormio has already paid the money to Phaedria to buy his slave girl. Phormio escapes punishment since Chremes&#x27; wealthy wife Nausistrata is furious not only about Chremes&#x27; secret second marriage but that he had been embezzling her money to pay for it. Antipho is allowed to keep his wife, Phaedria to keep his girlfriend, and Phormio is invited to dinner.

* &quot;Hecyra&quot; (&quot;The Mother-in-Law&quot;) (165 BC, but eventually performed in 160 BC)
::Laches&#x27; son, Pamphilus, has been made to marry Philumena, daughter of their neighbour Phidippus. At first he refused to sleep with her, because of his love for a courtesan, Bacchis, but gradually he grows to love his wife. But while he is away Philumena leaves their home and moves back to her father&#x27;s house. Everyone blames the mother-in-law, Sostrata, or else his continuing love for Bacchis. But when Pamphilus returns he discovers that the real reason for her departure is that she is about to give birth to a child, which he believes is not his. He therefore decides to divorce Philumena even though he still loves her. The situation is resolved when Philumena&#x27;s mother Myrrina discovers Philumena&#x27;s ring which Pamphilus had given to Bacchis. It is revealed that Pamphilus had drunkenly raped a young unknown woman some ten months ago and taken her ring, making Pamphilus the father of Philumena&#x27;s child. The couple reconcile, and the gossipy slave Parmeno and the two fathers are kept in the dark about the rape.

* &quot;Adelphoe&quot; (&quot;The Brothers&quot;) (160 BC)
::Micio, a wealthy Athenian bachelor, has brought up Aeschinus, the adopted elder son of his brother Demea, in town in an indulgent way. Meanwhile Demea has brought up his younger son Ctesipho in the village in a strict fashion. When Ctesipho falls in love with a slave-girl, Aeschinus on his behalf abducts the girl from the slave-dealer, Sannio, who owns her. Meanwhile, however, the widowed neighbour, Sostrata, alarmed that Aeschinus seems to have abandoned her daughter whom Aeschinus had made pregnant, sends her relative Hegio to complain to Micio, to Aeschinus&#x27;s embarrassment. A rascally slave, Syrus, plays his part by negotiating with the slave-dealer, and by keeping Demea out of the way of Ctesipho by various ruses. When Demea at last finds Ctesipho and his girlfriend in Micio&#x27;s house, he is furious and reproaches Micio for interfering in Ctesipho&#x27;s upbringing. The situation is resolved when Demea takes control. Changing from strictness to indulgence, he suggests that they should forego Aeschinus&#x27;s wedding procession and simply knock down the dividing wall between the two houses; in addition he insists that Micio must marry Sostrata, give Syrus his freedom and some business capital, and grant Hegio an income from part of his land. Ctesipho is allowed to keep his music-girl.

==Ancient commentary==

Saint Jerome mentions in &quot;Contra Rufinum&quot; I.16 that &quot;my teacher Donatus&quot; had written a commentary on the comedies of Terence. Donatus&#x27; commentary does not survive in the form in which he originally wrote it. It is commonly believed that an unknown medieval scribe, using two or more manuscripts of Terence containing marginal notes excerpted from Donatus, copied the notes in order to reconstitute the commentary as a separate book, incorporating extraneous material in the process, assigning notes to verses where they did not originally belong, or including material that had been otherwise changed in the course of transmission. Citations from Donatus&#x27; commentary which are not found in the extant redaction occur in Priscian and in scholia to the Codex Bembinus and Codex Victorianus. Another ancient commentary is attributed to one Eugraphius, of whom nothing is known but his authorship of this commentary. Donatus&#x27; commentary on the &quot;Heauton timorumenos&quot; is lacking, but his references to this play in his commentary on other parts of the corpus and Eugraphius&#x27; commentary help to make up the gap.

In its extant form, Donatus&#x27; commentary is prefaced by Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Vita Terenti,&quot; a short essay on the genre of comedy and its differences from tragedy now commonly called &quot;De fabula,&quot; and a separate, shorter work on the same subject which in some manuscripts begins with the heading &quot;De comoedia.&quot; was able to identify the &quot;De fabula&quot; as the work of an earlier commentator on Terence named Evanthius (probably identical with the grammarian Evanthius said in Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; to have died at Constantinople in AD 358) because the grammarian Rufinus of Antioch (5th cent. AD), in a work &quot;On the Metres of Terence,&quot; quotes the &quot;De fabula&quot; and ascribes it to Evanthius. Evanthius&#x27; work is otherwise lost. The &quot;De comoedia&quot; has continued to be considered the work of Donatus.

==Manuscripts of Terence==
The manuscripts of Terence can be divided into two main groups. One group has just one representative, the Codex Bembinus (known as A), dating to the 4th or early 5th century AD, and kept in the Vatican library. This book, written in rustic capitals, is one of the earliest surviving manuscripts of any Latin writer. It has the plays in the order &quot;An., Eu., Hau., Ph., Hec., Ad.&quot; Three small fragments of similar antiquity survive as well.

Approximately 650 manuscripts exist of later date. These are often known as the &quot;Calliopian&quot; manuscripts, based on subscriptions to the plays found in several of the earlier manuscripts indicating the text had been corrected by someone named Calliopius; nothing further is known of this individual. They date from the 9th century onwards and are written in minuscule letters. This group can be subdivided into three classes. The first class, known as γ (&quot;gamma&quot;), dates to the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries and includes manuscripts P (Parisinus), C (Vaticanus), and possibly F (Ambrosianus), and E (Riccardianus) among others. They have the plays in the order &quot;An., Eu., Hau., Ad., Hec., Ph.&quot;. Manuscript C is the famous Codex Vaticanus Latinus 3868, which has illustrations which seem to be copied from originals dating in style to the mid-third century.

Another group, known as δ (&quot;delta&quot;), has the plays in alphabetical order: &quot;An., Ad., Eu., Ph.&quot;(=F), &quot;Hau., Hec.&quot; This consists of 3 or 4 10th-century manuscripts: D (Victorianus), G (Decurtatus), p (Parisinus), and perhaps also L (Lipsiensis).

All the remaining manuscripts belong to the &quot;mixed&quot; group and contain readings copied from both γ and δ, and so are of little value in establishing the text.

It is thought that the γ group and the δ group go back to two archetypes, both now lost, called Γ (&quot;Gamma&quot;) and Δ (&quot;Delta&quot;), and that both of these were copied from a single archetype, also now lost, known as Σ (&quot;sigma&quot;). According to A. J. Brothers, manuscript A, although it contains some errors, generally has a better text than Σ, which has a number of changes designed perhaps to make Terence easier to read in schools. Both A and the now lost Σ are believed to be derived from an even earlier archetype known as Φ (&quot;phi&quot;), the date of which is unknown.

In addition to these manuscripts there are also certain commentaries, glossaries, and quotations in ancient writers and grammarians which sometimes assist editors in establishing the original reading. The best known of these is the , a commentary by the 4th-century grammarian Aelius Donatus, which is often helpful, although the part dealing with the &quot;Heauton Timorumenos&quot; is missing.

==Cultural legacy==
At a relatively early date, Terence&#x27;s play texts began to circulate as literary works for a reading public, as opposed to scripts for the use of actors. By the end of the 2nd Century BC, Terence had been established as a literary &quot;classic&quot; and a standard school text. Cicero (born 106 BC) recalls that when he was a boy, his education in rhetoric included an assignment to recount Simo&#x27;s narrative from the first scene of the &quot;Andria&quot; in his own words. Throughout the imperial period, Terence was second only to Vergil as the most widely known and read of Latin poets, and he remained a core school author while other Republican authors were displaced from the curriculum by Vergil and other Augustan poets. By the late 4th Century AD, Terence had become one of the four main canonical school authors (the others being Cicero, Sallust, and Vergil), canonised in a celebrated work by Arusianus Messius, and later referred to by Cassiodorus as &quot;Messius&#x27; quadriga.&quot; St Jerome, St Augustine of Hippo, and the pupils of a &quot;grammarian&quot; friend of St Sidonius Apollinaris were all set to read the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; in school, and in another of his letters, Sidonius describes reading the &quot;Hecyra&quot; together with his son at home.

Terence was one of the few canonical classical authors to maintain a continuous presence in medieval literacy, and the large number of surviving manuscripts bears witness to his great popularity. Adolphus Ward said that Terence led &quot;a charmed life in the darkest ages of learning,&quot; a remark approved by E. K. Chambers, but Paul Theiner takes issue with this, suggesting that it is more appropriate to attribute &quot;a charmed life&quot; to authors who survived the Middle Ages by chance in a few manuscripts found in isolated libraries, whereas the broad and constant popularity of Terence &quot;rendered elfin administrations quite unnecessary.&quot;

Roman students learning to write would regularly be assigned to copy edifying &quot;sententiae,&quot; or &quot;maxims,&quot; a practice adopted from Greek paedagogy, and Terence was a rich source of such &quot;sententiae.&quot; Scores of Terentian maxims enjoyed such currency in late antiquity that they often lost nominal association with their author, with those who quoted Terence qualifying his words as a common proverb. Through the Middle Ages, Terence was frequently quoted as an authority on human nature and the mores of men, without regard for which character spoke the line or the original dramatic context, as long as the quotation was sententious in itself when separated from the rest of the play.

Augustine was a lifelong admirer of Terence&#x27;s observations on the human condition, and 38 quotations from 28 distinct passages of Terence have been identified in Augustine&#x27;s works. Notwithstanding his respect for Terence&#x27;s moralising, when Augustine writes in the &quot;Confessions&quot; about his school days, he quotes the scene from the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; where Chaerea recounts how he and Pamphila looked together at a painting of Zeus intruding in the home of Danaë, after which Chaerea, emboldened by the example of the pagan god, took the opportunity to rape Pamphila. Augustine argues that it is not necessary for students to be exposed to such &quot;vileness&quot; (&quot;turpitudo&quot;) merely to learn vocabulary and eloquence.

In the 10th Century, Hrotsvit of Gandersheim wrote six plays based on the lives of Christian saints, on the model of the six comedies of Terence. In a preface explaining her purpose in writing, Hrotsvit takes up Augustine&#x27;s critique of the moral influence of the comedies, saying that many Christians attracted by Terence&#x27;s style find themselves corrupted by his subject matter, and she has undertaken to write works in the same genre so that the literary form once used &quot;to describe the shameless acts of licentious women&quot; might be repurposed to glorify the chastity of holy virgins. As Terence&#x27;s subject matter is trivial while Hrotsvit&#x27;s is important, his plays are in verse while hers are in prose, her plays are written in the same style as other medieval literature and lack verbal reminiscences of Terence apart from some oaths and interjections, and she does not respect the unity of time or other ancient dramatic conventions, it has been argued that Terence&#x27;s influence on Hrotsvit is superficial, and the only similarity between them is that they each wrote six plays.

Hrotsvit&#x27;s indebtedness to Terence lies rather in situations and subject matter, transposed to invert the Terentian plot and its values; the place of the Terentian hero who successfully pursues a woman is taken by the girl who triumphs by resisting all advances (or a prostitute who abandons her former life), and a happy ending lies not in the consummation of the young couple&#x27;s marriage, but in a figurative marriage to Christ. Whereas in the &quot;Eunuchus,&quot; Chaerea entered a courtesan&#x27;s home disguised as a eunuch to gain access to his beloved, two of Hrotsvit&#x27;s plays (&quot;Abraham&quot; and &quot;Paphnutius&quot;) feature a man entering a brothel disguised as a lover in order to win a woman to repentance and a life of continence. Robert Talbot reads Hrotsvit&#x27;s plays as a Christian allegorisation of Terence designed to rehabilitate the comedies themselves, as Hrotsvit&#x27;s reconfiguration of the genre to demonstrate the superiority of heavenly love to earthly love will enable readers to read Terence in a new way, with their minds directed from the sinful content to a higher Christian meaning. Hrotsvit did not exercise a significant influence on European literature before her works were rediscovered and printed in 1501.

In the &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; Dante&#x27;s guide Vergil tells him that Terence is in Limbo among the virtuous pagans (&quot;Purg.&quot; XXII, 94–105), and shows him Thais, the character from the &quot;Eunuchus,&quot; in the eighth circle of hell where flatterers are punished. (&quot;Inf.&quot; XVIII, 133–5) It has been claimed that Dante did not know Terence directly, and his references to Terence are derived from citations in Cicero or medieval florilegia. However, Terence was one of the most commonly read authors in the 14th Century, and Joseph Russo argues that considering the access Dante would have had to manuscripts of Terence and the desire he would have had to read Terence, the logical conclusion is that &quot;Dante must have known Terence.&quot;

Renaissance humanists delighted in Terence. Giovanni Boccaccio copied out in his own hand all of Terence&#x27;s comedies in a manuscript that is now in the Laurentian Library.

The first printed edition of Terence appeared in Strasbourg in 1470, while the first certain post-antique performance of one of Terence&#x27;s plays, &quot;Andria&quot;, took place in Florence in 1476. There is evidence, however, that Terence was performed much earlier. The short dialogue &quot;Terentius et delusor&quot; was probably written to be performed as an introduction to a Terentian performance in the 9th century (possibly earlier).

Beatus Rhenanus writes that Erasmus, gifted in his youth with a tenacious memory, held Terence&#x27;s comedies as closely as his fingers and toes. In the &quot;De ratione studii&quot; (1511), a central text for European curricula, Erasmus wrote, &quot;among Latin authors, who is more useful for learning to speak than Terence? He is pure, concise, and near to everyday conversation, and pleasant to youth as well for his genre of plot.&quot; Martin Luther wrote that &quot;I love Terence&quot; and considered his comedies useful not only to help schoolboys improve their language skills, but also to teach them about society, because Terence &quot;saw how it goes with people&quot;; even if there were some &quot;obscene&quot; passages in the comedies, Luther insisted that they were no less appropriate for young people to read without censorship than the Bible, which &quot;contains amatory things everywhere.&quot; The indexes of the Weimar edition of Martin Luther&#x27;s works note nearly 200 references to Terence and his plays.

The preservation of Terence through the church enabled his work to influence much of later Western drama. Two of the earliest English comedies, the 16th-century &quot;Ralph Roister Doister&quot; and &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Needle&quot;, are thought to parody Terence&#x27;s plays. Montaigne and Molière cite and imitate him.

Based on what is known about a typical curriculum at a grammar school such as William Shakespeare went to, it may be considered certain that Shakespeare must have studied Terence as a boy. In Shakespeare&#x27;s day, a typical schoolboy at the age of 9 would begin to memorise a great part, if not all, of Terence. A quote from the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; is not taken direct from the play, but quoted in a form in which it is found in William Lily&#x27;s Latin Grammar and Nicholas Udall&#x27;s &quot;Floures for Latine spekynge,&quot; with the syntax adapted to form an independent sentence. However, the indebtedness of the character of Armado in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; to Thraso in the &quot;Eunuchus&quot; points to Shakespeare&#x27;s familiarity with the play as a whole. Chaerea&#x27;s exultation upon coming out of Thais&#x27; house after the rape, declaring himself content to die in that blissful moment, also seems to be echoed in &quot;Othello&quot; II.1 and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; III.3. Shakespeare&#x27;s encounter with Terence in grammar school introduced him to comedy and scenic structure, laying the foundations for his art.

Terence&#x27;s plays were a standard part of the Latin curriculum of the neoclassical period. In a letter prescribing a course of education for his nephew Peter Carr, Thomas Jefferson listed Terence among classical poets Carr already had read or would read at school. Jefferson copied four extracts from the &quot;Andria&quot; into his literary commonplace book, seemingly in the late 1760s and 1770s, and the presence of three different editions of Terence in the carefully selected second Monticello library is a clear indication that Terence formed a part of Jefferson&#x27;s retirement reading.

In 1781, John Adams offered his son John Quincy Adams a copy of Anne Dacier&#x27;s edition of Terence with a parallel French translation, writing, &quot;Terence is remarkable, for good Morals, good Taste and good Latin—his Language has a Simplicity and an elegance, that makes him proper to be accurately studied, as A Model.&quot; This was declined, as John Quincy believed his teacher would not like him to have a translation &quot;because when I shall translate him he would desire that I might do it without help.&quot; John Quincy eventually read the &quot;Andria&quot; over three evenings in February 1786, and was not impressed with the pace of his Harvard class, which finished the play three months later. He recorded in his diary that &quot;The Play is interesting, and many of the Sentiments are fine&quot;, and though he found the plot highly improbable, &quot;the Critic can never find Perfection, and the person that is willing to be pleased with what he reads, is happier than he who is always looking for faults.&quot;

In 1816, John Quincy&#x27;s son George Washington Adams performed in a school production of &quot;Andria&quot; in the role of the old man Crito, to the relief of the family, who had worried he might be given a less &quot;respectable&quot; part. George&#x27;s grandmother Abigail Adams, having read the play, took exception to &quot;the manners and morals&quot;. Grandfather John, after rereading all six of Terence&#x27;s comedies, also expressed apprehension about whether they were fit to be taught or exhibited to impressionable youths, who lacked sufficient life experience to recognise certain characters and their deeds as morally repugnant and react appropriately. Accordingly, Adams undertook a month-long project to go through the plays excerpting approximately 140 passages that he considered illustrative of human nature as it is the same in all ages and countries, adding translations and comments explaining the moral lessons his grandsons should draw from the texts. John Quincy believed the manners and plots of Terence&#x27;s plays were too remote from modern life for there to be a danger of a detrimental influence on students&#x27; morals, but praised his father&#x27;s project, writing, &quot;You have indeed skimmed the cream of Terence and sent it to my boys—I trust they will preserve it and that it will aid them in drawing all the solid benefit from the amanuensis of Laelius and Scipio, which he can afford to their future lives.&quot; When Adams sent his grandson Charles Francis Adams his excerpts from the &quot;Phormio,&quot; he remarked, &quot;in these Plays of Terence ... Are not the Slaves Superior Beings to the Citizens? Every Smart Expression; every brilliant Image, every Moral Sentiment is in the Mouth of a Slave.&quot; In 1834, when Charles read the works of Terence, copying in his grandfather&#x27;s comments and making other notes, he responded, &quot;In returning to answer these questions, I must disagree with the sentiment. I cannot overlook the characters of Menedemus and Chremes, of Micio and Demea which contain more moral sentiment than all the Slaves in the six Plays.&quot;

American playwright Thornton Wilder based his novel &quot;The Woman of Andros&quot; on Terence&#x27;s &quot;Andria&quot;.

Due to his cognomen Afer, Terence has long been identified with Africa and heralded as the first poet of the African diaspora by generations of writers, including Juan Latino, Alexandre Dumas, Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou. Phyllis Wheatley, the first published African-American poet, asked why the Muses had inspired &quot;one alone of Afric&#x27;s sable race.&quot; Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, in an attempt to prove that African-Americans were naturally incapable of poetry, claimed that Terence had been &quot;of the race of whites.&quot; Two of his plays were produced in Denver with black actors.

Questions as to whether Terence received assistance in writing or was not the actual author have been debated over the ages, as described in the 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica:&quot;
[In a prologue to one of his plays, Terence] meets the charge of receiving assistance in the composition of his plays by claiming as a great honour the favour which he enjoyed with those who were the favorites of the Roman people. But the gossip, not discouraged by Terence, lived and throve; it crops up in Cicero and Quintilian, and the ascription of the plays to Scipio had the honour to be accepted by Montaigne and rejected by Diderot.

<text>&quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe and first published in 1842 in the literary annual &quot;The Gift: A Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Present for 1843&quot;. The story is about the torments endured by a prisoner of the Spanish Inquisition, though Poe skews historical facts. The narrator of the story describes his experience of being tortured. The story is especially effective at inspiring fear in the reader because of its heavy focus on the senses, such as sound, emphasizing its reality, unlike many of Poe&#x27;s stories which are aided by the supernatural. The traditional elements established in popular horror tales at the time are followed, but critical reception has been mixed. The tale has been adapted to film several times.

==Plot summary==
The unnamed narrator is brought to trial before sinister judges of the Spanish Inquisition, charged with offenses that are never stated. As seven tall white candles on a table slowly burn down, the narrator feels his hopes of survival diminishing as well. He is condemned to death, whereupon he faints and later awakens to find himself in a totally dark room. At first the prisoner thinks that he is locked in a tomb, but then he discovers that he is in a cell. He decides to explore the cell by placing a scrap of his robe against the wall so that he can count the paces around the room, but he faints before he can measure the whole perimeter.

When he reawakens, he discovers food and water nearby. He tries to measure the cell again, and finds that the perimeter measures one hundred steps. While crossing the room, he trips on the hem of his robe and falls, his chin landing at the edge of a deep pit. He realizes that had he not tripped, he would have fallen into this pit.

After losing consciousness again, the narrator discovers that the prison is slightly illuminated and that he is strapped to a wooden frame on his back, facing the ceiling. Above him is a picture of Father Time, holding a razor-edged pendulum measuring &quot;a foot in length from horn to horn.&quot; The pendulum is swinging back and forth and slowly descending, designed to kill the narrator eventually. However, he is able to attract rats to him by smearing his bonds with the meat left for him to eat. The rats chew through the straps, and he slips free just before the pendulum can begin to slice into his chest.

The pendulum is withdrawn into the ceiling, and the walls become red-hot and start to move inwards, forcing him slowly toward the center of the room and into the pit. As he loses his last foothold and begins to topple in, he hears a roar of voices and trumpets, the walls retract, and an arm pulls him to safety. The French Army has captured the city of Toledo and the Inquisition has fallen into its enemies&#x27; hands.

==Publication and response==
&quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; was included in &quot;The Gift: A Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Present&quot; for 1843, edited by Eliza Leslie and published by Carey &amp; Hart. It was slightly revised for a republication in the May 17, 1845 issue of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;.

William Butler Yeats was generally critical of Poe, calling him &quot;vulgar.&quot; Of &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; in particular he said it does &quot;not seem to me to have permanent literary value of any kind... Analyse the Pit and the Pendulum and you find an appeal to the nerves by tawdry physical affrightments.&quot;

==Analysis==
&quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; is a study of the effect terror has on the narrator, starting with the opening line, which suggests that he is already suffering from death anxiety (&quot;I was sick — sick unto death with that long agony&quot;). However, there is an implicit irony in the reference to the black-robed judges having lips &quot;whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words&quot;, which shows that he has survived and is writing the story after the events. Unlike much of Poe&#x27;s work, the story has no supernatural elements. The &quot;realism&quot; of the story is enhanced through Poe&#x27;s focus on reporting : the dungeon is airless and unlit, the narrator is subject to thirst and starvation, he is swarmed by rats, the razor-sharp pendulum threatens to slice into him and the closing walls are red-hot. The narrator experiences the blade mostly through sound as it &quot;hissed&quot; while swinging. Poe emphasizes this element of sound with such words as &quot;surcingle,&quot; &quot;cessation,&quot; &quot;crescent,&quot; and &quot;scimitar&quot;, and various forms of literary consonance.

Poe was following an established model of terror writing of his day, often seen in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (a formula he mocks in &quot;A Predicament&quot;). Those stories, however, often focused on chance occurrences or personal vengeance as a source of terror. Poe may have been inspired to focus on the purposeful impersonal torture in part by Juan Antonio Llorente&#x27;s &quot;History of the Spanish Inquisition&quot;, first published in 1817. It has also been suggested that Poe&#x27;s &quot;pit&quot; was inspired by a translation of the Qur&#x27;an (Poe had referenced the Qur&#x27;an also in &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; and &quot;Israfel&quot;) by George Sale. Poe was familiar with Sale, and even mentioned him by name in a note in his story &quot;The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade&quot;. Sale&#x27;s translation was a part of commentary and, in one of those notes, refers to an allegedly common form of torture and execution by &quot;throwing [people] into a glowing pit of fire, whence he had the opprobrious appellation of the Lord of the Pit.&quot; In the Koran itself, in Sura (Chapter) 85, &quot;The Celestial Signs&quot;, a passage reads: &quot;...cursed were the contrivers of the pit, of fire supplied with the fuel... and they afflicted them for no other reason, but because they believed in the mighty, the glorious God.&quot; Poe is also considered to have been influenced by William Mudford&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Shroud&quot;, a short story about an iron torture chamber which shrinks through mechanical action and eventually crushes the victim inside. Poe apparently got the idea for the shrinking chamber in the &quot;Pit and the Pendulum&quot; after Mudford&#x27;s story was published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s magazine&quot; in 1830.

==Historical authenticity==
Poe makes no attempt to describe accurately the operations of the Spanish Inquisition, and takes considerable dramatic license with the broader history premised in this story. The rescuers are led by Napoleon&#x27;s General Lasalle (who was not, however, in command of the French occupation of Toledo) and this places the action during the Peninsular War (1808–14), centuries after the height of the Spanish Inquisition. The elaborate tortures of this story have no historic parallels in the activity of the Spanish Inquisition in any century, let alone the nineteenth when under Charles III and Charles IV only four persons were condemned. The Inquisition was, however, abolished during the period of French intervention (1808–13).

The original source of the pendulum torture method is one paragraph in the preface of the 1826 book &quot;The history of the Inquisition of Spain&quot; by the Spanish priest, historian and activist Juan Antonio Llorente, relating a second-hand account by a single prisoner released from the Inquisition&#x27;s Madrid dungeon in 1820, who purportedly described the pendulum torture method. Most modern sources dismiss this as fantasy. One theory is that Llorente misunderstood the account he heard; the prisoner was actually referring to another common Inquisition torture, the &quot;strappado&quot; (garrucha), in which the prisoner has his hands tied behind his back and is hoisted off the floor by a rope tied to his hands. This method was also known as the &quot;pendulum&quot;. 

Poe places a Latin epigraph before the story, describing it as &quot;a quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris&quot;. The epigraph was not Poe&#x27;s invention; such an inscription had been reported, no later than 1803, as having been composed with the intention (possibly facetious) of having it placed on the site, and it had appeared, without attribution, as an item of trivia in the 1836 &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, a periodical to which Poe contributed. It does not appear, however, that the market was ever built as intended. Charles Baudelaire, a French poet who translated Poe&#x27;s works into French and who viewed Poe as an inspiration, said that the building on the site of the Old Jacobin Club had no gates and, therefore, no inscription.

==Adaptations==
* Several film adaptations of the story have been produced, including the early French-language film &quot;Le Puits et le pendule&quot; in 1909 by Henri Desfontaines. The first English-language adaptation was in 1913, directed by Alice Guy-Blaché.
* The 1935 film &quot;The Raven&quot;, starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, features a pendulum torture device in the dungeon underneath the house of the Poe-obsessed Dr. Vollin, played by Lugosi.
* The 1943 episode of the radio drama &quot;Suspense&quot;, starring Henry Hull
* The 1961 film &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, directed by Roger Corman and starring Vincent Price and Barbara Steele, like the other installments in the Corman/Price &quot;Poe Cycle&quot;, bears minimal resemblance to the Poe story. The torture apparatus of the title makes its appearance only in the final ten minutes of the film. The reason for this is that the story is too short to be made into a feature-length film. The plan was to have a third act, which would be faithful to Poe, while the other two would be written in a manner that the cast and crew hoped would be similar to a Poe plot. A novelization of the film was written by Lee Sheridan, adapted from Richard Matheson&#x27;s screenplay in 1961, and published by Lancer Books in paperback.
* The 1964 French film &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; was directed by Alexandre Astruc and stars Maurice Ronet.
* In &quot;The Flintstones&quot; season 5, episode 8, &quot;Dr. Sinister&quot;, aired in 1964, Fred and Barney are menaced by a pendulum torture device until Barney discovers that he can use the blade to cut the bindings on his wrists. Later, Fred and Barney narrowly escape being thrown into a pit, which Dr. Sinister says is bottomless, hence anyone thrown in for crossing him would just keep falling for all eternity.
* A 1967 West German film adaptation of Poe&#x27;s story called &quot;The Blood Demon&quot; was directed by Harald Reinl and stars Christopher Lee.
* In 1970, Vincent Price included a solo recitation of the story in the anthology film &quot;An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;.
* In a 1970 episode from the animated cartoon series &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;, titled &quot;London Town Treachery&quot;, the Hooded Claw has captured Penelope and attempts to kill her using a pendulum that swings lower and lower, as in Poe&#x27;s story.
* In 1983, Czech Surrealist Jan Švankmajer directed a 15-minute live-action short film called &quot;The Pendulum, the Pit and Hope&quot;, based on this story and the short story &quot;A Torture by Hope&quot; by Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam. It is a fairly faithful adaptation of both stories, featuring a unique first-person camera perspective and segments produced in Švankmajer&#x27;s trademark stop-motion and cut-out animation. Most of the art design was done by his wife, Eva Švankmajerová.
* In 1989, the opening episode of the fifth season of the U.S. TV series &quot;MacGyver&quot; shows the protagonist strapped down as the intended victim of a Poe-like pendulum.
* In 1991, a film version of the story directed by Stuart Gordon and starring Lance Henriksen was released. The plot was altered to a love story set in Spain in 1492.
* The operatic metal band Nightwish released the 5-part epic song &quot;The Poet and the Pendulum&quot; on their 2007 album &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; that draws much inspiration from Poe&#x27;s work.
* The 2009 horror film directed by David DeCoteau bears little resemblance to the original story but, like the 1961 version, utilizes the large swinging pendulum in the penultimate scene. The film follows a group of university students who visit a hypnotherapy institute lorded over by a sinister hypnotist who wants to use the students to experiment with the possibility of breaking the pain threshold.
* The 2012 horror/mystery film &quot;The Raven&quot;, starring John Cusack in the role of Edgar Allan Poe, contains multiple reenactments of Poe&#x27;s horror stories. Included is a scene where the &quot;Pit and the Pendulum&quot; scenario is re-created and successfully kills its victim.
* In 2013, the guitarist Buckethead produced an ekphrastic representation of &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; on an album called &quot;The Pit.&quot;
* The 2013 animated anthology &quot;Extraordinary Tales&quot; includes &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, narrated by Guillermo del Toro.
* The seventh episode of the Mike Flanagan directed Netflix miniseries &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; is titled &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; and features plot points loosely based on the short story.

<doc id="30758" wikidata="Q12539" url="?curid=30758" title="Age of Enlightenment">
<text>The Age of Enlightenment (also the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment) was an intellectual and philosophical movement taking place in Europe from the late 17th century to the early 19th century. The Enlightenment, which valued knowledge gained through rationalism and empiricism, was concerned with a range of social ideas and political ideals such as natural law, liberty, and progress, toleration and fraternity, constitutional government, and the formal separation of church and state.

The Enlightenment was preceded by and overlapped the Scientific Revolution, which included the work of Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton, among others, as well as the rationalist philosophy of Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and John Locke. Some date the beginning of the Enlightenment to the publication of René Descartes&#x27; &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; in 1637, with his method of systematically disbelieving everything unless there was a well-founded reason for accepting it, and featuring his famous dictum, &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;). Others cite the publication of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687) as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. European historians traditionally dated its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 and its end with the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Many historians now date the end of the Enlightenment as the start of the 19th century, with the latest proposed year being the death of Immanuel Kant in 1804.

Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and religious officials and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism, socialism, and neoclassicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment. Scientific racism also has a background in this period.

The Enlightenment was marked by an increasing awareness of the relationship between the mind and the everyday media of the world, and by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious dogma — an attitude captured by Kant&#x27;s essay &quot;Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?,&quot; where the phrase (&#x27;dare to know&#x27;) can be found.

The central doctrines of the Enlightenment were individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law, and religious freedom, in contrast to an absolute monarchy or single party state and the religious persecution of faiths other than those formally established and often controlled outright by the State. By contrast, other intellectual currents included arguments in favour of anti-Christianity, Deism, and even Atheism, accompanied by demands for secular states, bans on religious education, suppression of Monasteries, the suppression of the Jesuits, and the expulsion of religious orders. Contemporary criticism, particularly of these anti-religious concepts, has since been dubbed the Counter-Enlightenment by Sir Isaiah Berlin.

==Influential intellectuals==
The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the Scientific Revolution. Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Pierre Bayle, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Some of figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria, George Berkeley, Denis Diderot, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Lord Monboddo, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Hugo Grotius, and Voltaire.

One of the most influential Enlightenment publications was the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Encyclopedia&quot;). Published between 1751 and 1772 in 35 volumes, it was compiled by Diderot, Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and a team of 150 others. The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; helped spread the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond. Other publications of the Enlightenment included Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge&quot; (1710), Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Letters on the English&quot; (1733) and &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; (1764); Hume&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1740); Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; (1748); Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot; (1754) and &quot;The Social Contract&quot; (1762); Cesare Beccaria&#x27;s &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot; (1764); Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; (1759) and &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776); and Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781).

==Topics==
===Philosophy===

Bacon&#x27;s empiricism and Descartes&#x27; rationalist philosophy laid the foundation for enlightenment thinking. Descartes&#x27; attempt to construct the sciences on a secure metaphysical foundation was not as successful as his method of doubt applied to philosophy, which led to a dualistic doctrine of mind and matter. His skepticism was refined by Locke&#x27;s &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1690) and Hume&#x27;s writings in the 1740s. Descartes&#x27; dualism was challenged by Spinoza&#x27;s uncompromising assertion of the unity of matter in his &quot;Tractatus&quot; (1670) and &quot;Ethics&quot; (1677).

According to Jonathan Israel, these laid down two distinct lines of Enlightenment thought: first, the moderate variety, following Descartes, Locke, and Christian Wolff, which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith, and, second, the Radical Enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza, advocating democracy, individual liberty, freedom of expression, and eradication of religious authority. The moderate variety tended to be deistic whereas the radical tendency separated the basis of morality entirely from theology. Both lines of thought were eventually opposed by a conservative Counter-Enlightenment which sought a return to faith.

In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of philosophic and scientific activity challenging traditional doctrines and dogmas. After the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, the relationship between church and the absolutist government was very strong. The early enlightenment emerged in protest to these circumstances, gaining ground under the support of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV. Called the &quot;Siècle des Lumières,&quot; the philosophical movement of the Enlightenment had already started by the early 18th century, when Pierre Bayle launched the popular and scholarly Enlightenment critique of religion. As a skeptic Bayle only partially accepted the philosophy and principles of rationality. He did draw a strict boundary between morality and religion. The rigor of his &quot;Dictionnaire Historique et Critique&quot; influenced many of the Enlightenment &quot;Encyclopédistes.&quot; By the mid-18th century the French Enlightenment had found a focus in the project of the &quot;Encyclopédie.&quot; The philosophical movement was led by Voltaire and Rousseau, who argued for a society based upon reason rather than faith and Catholic doctrine, for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher Montesquieu introduced the idea of a separation of powers in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution. While the &quot;philosophes&quot; of the French Enlightenment were not revolutionaries and many were members of the nobility, their ideas played an important part in undermining the legitimacy of the Old Regime and shaping the French Revolution.

Francis Hutcheson, a moral philosopher and founding figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, described the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, &quot;the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers.&quot; Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by Hutcheson&#x27;s protégés in Edinburgh: David Hume and Adam Smith. Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy.
Kant tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority, as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason. Kant&#x27;s work continued to shape German thought and indeed all of European philosophy, well into the 20th century.

Mary Wollstonecraft was one of England&#x27;s earliest feminist philosophers. She argued for a society based on reason and that women as well as men should be treated as rational beings. She is best known for her work &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792).

===Science===

Science played an important role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. There were immediate practical results. The experiments of Antoine Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris, and the experiments of the Montgolfier brothers enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot air balloon in 1783.

Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued empiricism and rational thought and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. The study of science, under the heading of natural philosophy, was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and natural history, which included anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and zoology. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally: Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.

Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge, in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. Some societies created or retained links to universities, but contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university&#x27;s utility was in the transmission of knowledge while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state to provide technical expertise.

Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members and the administration of the society. In the 18th century, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over 70 official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term &quot;the Age of Academies&quot; to describe the 18th century.

Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. &quot;Philosophes&quot; introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science. The century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

The influence of science began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature. Some poetry became infused with scientific metaphor and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. Richard Blackmore committed the Newtonian system to verse in &quot;Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books&quot; (1712). After Newton&#x27;s death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades. James Thomson penned his &quot;Poem to the Memory of Newton,&quot; which mourned the loss of Newton and praised his science and legacy.

===Sociology, economics, and law===
Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a &quot;science of man,&quot; which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement, and Hume&#x27;s philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution), and as popularised by Dugald Stewart was the basis of classical liberalism.

In 1776, Adam Smith published &quot;The Wealth of Nations,&quot; often considered the first work on modern economics as it had an immediate impact on British economic policy that continues into the 21st century. It was immediately preceded and influenced by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot&#x27;s drafts of &quot;Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth&quot; (1766). Smith acknowledged indebtedness and possibly was the original English translator.

Beccaria, a jurist, criminologist, philosopher, and politician and one of the great Enlightenment writers, became famous for his masterpiece &quot;Dei delitti e delle pene&quot; (Of Crimes and Punishments, 1764). His treatise, translated into 22 languages, condemned torture and the death penalty and was a founding work in the field of penology and the classical school of criminology by promoting criminal justice. Francesco Mario Pagano wrote important studies such as &quot;Saggi politici&quot; (Political Essays, 1783); and &quot;Considerazioni sul processo criminale&quot; (Considerations on the Criminal Trial, 1787), which established him as an international authority on criminal law.

===Politics===
The Enlightenment has long been seen as the foundation of modern Western political and intellectual culture. The Enlightenment brought political modernization to the West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. This thesis has been widely accepted by scholars and has been reinforced by the large-scale studies by Robert Darnton, Roy Porter, and, most recently, by Jonathan Israel. Enlightenment thought was deeply influential in the political realm. European rulers such as Catherine II of Russia, Joseph II of Austria, and Frederick II of Prussia tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance, which became known as enlightened absolutism. Many of the major political and intellectual figures behind the American Revolution associated themselves closely with the Enlightenment: Benjamin Franklin visited Europe repeatedly and contributed actively to the scientific and political debates there and brought the newest ideas back to Philadelphia; Thomas Jefferson closely followed European ideas and later incorporated some of the ideals of the Enlightenment into the Declaration of Independence; and Madison incorporated these ideals into the U.S. Constitution during its framing in 1787.

====Theories of government====

Locke, one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers, based his governance philosophy in social contract theory, a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought. English philosopher Thomas Hobbes ushered in this new debate with his work &quot;Leviathan&quot; in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual, the natural equality of all men, the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state), the view that all legitimate political power must be &quot;representative&quot; and based on the consent of the people, and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.

Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; and &quot;Discourse on Inequality,&quot; respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, in which the government&#x27;s authority lies in the consent of the governed, is necessary for man to live in civil society. Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law, in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty, and property. However, when one citizen breaks the law of nature both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an &quot;unbiased judge&quot; or common authority, such as courts. In contrast, Rousseau&#x27;s conception relies on the supposition that &quot;civil man&quot; is corrupted, while &quot;natural man&quot; has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established. Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom. This is embodied in the sovereignty of the general will, the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens.

Locke is known for his statement that individuals have a right to &quot;Life, Liberty, and Property,&quot; and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, wrote in 1706: &quot;There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn.&quot; Locke&#x27;s theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the French National Constituent Assembly&#x27;s Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

Some &quot;philosophes&quot; argued that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and capitalism, the scientific method, religious tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the &quot;philosophes&quot; in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered the essential change.

Although much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists, Hume and Ferguson criticized this camp. Hume&#x27;s essay &quot;Of the Original Contract&quot; argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen and civil government is grounded in a ruler&#x27;s habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler&#x27;s authority over-and-against the subject that the subject tacitly consents, and Hume says that the subjects would &quot;never imagine that their consent made him sovereign,&quot; rather the authority did so. Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 &quot;An Essay on the History of Civil Society,&quot; Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without agreeing to a social contract.

Both Rousseau&#x27;s and Locke&#x27;s social contract theories rest on the presupposition of natural rights, which are not a result of law or custom but are things that all men have in pre-political societies and are therefore universal and inalienable. The most famous natural right formulation comes from Locke&#x27;s &quot;Second Treatise,&quot; when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke, the law of nature is grounded on mutual security or the idea that one cannot infringe on another&#x27;s natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, as well as the right to preserve life and property.

Locke argues against indentured servitude on the basis that enslaving oneself goes against the law of nature because a person cannot surrender their own rights: freedom is absolute, and no one can take it away. Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one&#x27;s natural rights.

====Enlightened absolutism====

The leaders of the Enlightenment were not especially democratic, as they more often look to absolute monarchs as the key to imposing reforms designed by the intellectuals. Voltaire despised democracy and said the absolute monarch must be enlightened and must act as dictated by reason and justice—in other words, be a &quot;philosopher-king.&quot;

In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger states. These rulers are called &quot;enlightened despots&quot; by historians. They included Frederick the Great of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, Leopold II of Tuscany and Joseph II of Austria. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing many reforms that had little support so that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors, and nearly all his programs were reversed. Senior ministers Pombal in Portugal and Johann Friedrich Struensee in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals. In Poland, the model constitution of 1791 expressed Enlightenment ideals, but was in effect for only one year before the nation was partitioned among its neighbors. More enduring were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland.
Frederick the Great, the king of Prussia from 1740 to 1786, saw himself as a leader of the Enlightenment and patronized philosophers and scientists at his court in Berlin. Voltaire, who had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept Frederick&#x27;s invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained: &quot;My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit.&quot;

====American Revolution and French Revolution====
The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789—both had some intellectual influence from Thomas Jefferson. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the &quot;consent of the governed&quot; philosophy as delineated by Locke in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the &quot;divine right of kings.&quot; In this view, the revolutions were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully and therefore violent revolution was the result. A governance philosophy where the king was never wrong would be in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government.

Alexis de Tocqueville proposed the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of &quot;substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power.&quot; This illusory power came from the rise of &quot;public opinion,&quot; born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The &quot;literary politics&quot; that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville &quot;clearly designates... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power.&quot;

===Religion===

Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in God. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an &quot;unprejudiced examination&quot; of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of Christianity to be a belief in Christ the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate. Anthony Collins, one of the English freethinkers, published his &quot;Essay concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions the Evidence whereof depends on Human Testimony&quot; (1707), in which he rejects the distinction between &quot;above reason&quot; and &quot;contrary to reason,&quot; and demands that revelation should conform to man&#x27;s natural ideas of God. In the &quot;Jefferson Bible,&quot; Thomas Jefferson went further and dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels, and the resurrection of Jesus after his death, as he tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the New Testament.

Enlightenment scholars sought to curtail the political power of organized religion and thereby prevent another age of intolerant religious war. Spinoza determined to remove politics from contemporary and historical theology (e.g., disregarding Judaic law). Moses Mendelssohn advised affording no political weight to any organized religion but instead recommended that each person follow what they found most convincing. They believed a good religion based in instinctive morals and a belief in God should not theoretically need force to maintain order in its believers, and both Mendelssohn and Spinoza judged religion on its moral fruits, not the logic of its theology.

Several novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including deism and talk of atheism. According to Thomas Paine, deism is the simple belief in God the Creator with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note: &quot;In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.&quot; Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined; that is, since atheists gave themselves to no supreme authority and no law and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle observed that, in his day, &quot;prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion],&quot; and he believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual &quot;could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions.&quot;

====Separation of church and state====

The &quot;Radical Enlightenment&quot; promoted the concept of separating church and state, an idea that is often credited to Locke. According to his principle of the social contract, Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority.

These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with the social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution. In a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut, Thomas Jefferson calls for a &quot;wall of separation between church and state&quot; at the federal level. He previously had supported successful efforts to disestablish the Church of England in Virginia and authored the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Jefferson&#x27;s political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of Locke, Bacon, and Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived.

==National variations==
The Enlightenment took hold in most European countries and influenced nations globally, often with a specific local emphasis. For example, in France it became associated with anti-government and anti-Church radicalism, while in Germany it reached deep into the middle classes, where it expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments or established churches. Government responses varied widely. In France, the government was hostile, and the &quot;philosophes&quot; fought against its censorship, sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile. The British government, for the most part, ignored the Enlightenment&#x27;s leaders in England and Scotland, although it did give Newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office.

A common theme among most countries which derived Enlightenment ideas from Europe was the intentional non-inclusion of Enlightenment philosophies pertaining to slavery. Originally during the French Revolution, a revolution deeply inspired by Enlightenment philosophy, &quot;France&#x27;s revolutionary government had denounced slavery, but the property-holding &#x27;revolutionaries&#x27; then remembered their bank accounts.&quot; Slavery frequently showed the limitations of the Enlightenment ideology as it pertained to European colonialism, since many colonies of Europe operated on a plantation economy fueled by slave labor. In 1791, the Haitian Revolution, a slave rebellion by emancipated slaves against French colonial rule in the colony of Saint-Domingue, broke out. European nations and the United States, despite the strong support for Enlightenment ideals, refused to &quot;[give support] to Saint-Domingue&#x27;s anti-colonial struggle.&quot;

===Great Britain===
====England====
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars. The majority of textbooks on British history make little or no mention of an English Enlightenment. Some surveys of the entire Enlightenment include England and others ignore it, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift. Freethinking, a term describing those who stood in opposition to the institution of the Church, and the literal belief in the Bible, can be said to have begun in England no later than 1713, when Anthony Collins wrote his &quot;Discourse of Free-thinking,&quot; which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacked the clergy of all churches and was a plea for deism.

Roy Porter argues that the reasons for this neglect were the assumptions that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and that it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order. Porter admits that after the 1720s England could claim thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire, or Rousseau. However, its leading intellectuals such as Gibbon, Edmund Burke and Samuel Johnson were all quite conservative and supportive of the standing order. Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England and had succeeded such that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration, positions which intellectuals on the continent had to fight against powerful odds. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment.

According to Derek Hirst, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterised by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialisation of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.

====Scotland====
In the Scottish Enlightenment, the principles of sociability, equality, and utility were disseminated in schools and universities, many of which used sophisticated teaching methods which blended philosophy with daily life. Scotland&#x27;s major cities created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions such as schools, universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums, and masonic lodges. The Scottish network was &quot;predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and &#x27;design&#x27; oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment.&quot; In France, Voltaire said &quot;we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization.&quot; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of William Cullen, physician and chemist; James Anderson, agronomist; Joseph Black, physicist and chemist; and James Hutton, the first modern geologist.

====Anglo-American colonies====


Several Americans, especially Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers. Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics. The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic. Thinkers such as Paine, Locke, and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom. The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas, as well as some French thinkers such as Montesquieu. As deists, they were influenced by ideas of John Toland and Matthew Tindal. There was a great emphasis upon liberty, republicanism, and religious tolerance. There was no respect for monarchy or inherited political power. Deists reconciled science and religion by rejecting prophecies, miracles, and biblical theology. Leading deists included Thomas Paine in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; and Thomas Jefferson in his short &quot;Jefferson Bible,&quot; from which he removed all supernatural aspects.

===German states===
Prussia took the lead among the German states in sponsoring the political reforms that Enlightenment thinkers urged absolute rulers to adopt. There were important movements as well in the smaller states of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, and the Palatinate. In each case, Enlightenment values became accepted and led to significant political and administrative reforms that laid the groundwork for the creation of modern states. The princes of Saxony, for example, carried out an impressive series of fundamental fiscal, administrative, judicial, educational, cultural, and general economic reforms. The reforms were aided by the country&#x27;s strong urban structure and influential commercial groups and modernized pre-1789 Saxony along the lines of classic Enlightenment principles.

Before 1750, the German upper classes looked to France for intellectual, cultural, and architectural leadership, as French was the language of high society. By the mid-18th century, the &quot;Aufklärung&quot; (The Enlightenment) had transformed German high culture in music, philosophy, science, and literature. Christian Wolff was the pioneer as a writer who expounded the Enlightenment to German readers and legitimized German as a philosophic language.

Johann Gottfried von Herder broke new ground in philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the Sturm und Drang movement of proto-Romanticism. Weimar Classicism (&quot;Weimarer Klassik&quot;) was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical, and Enlightenment ideas. The movement (from 1772 until 1805) involved Herder as well as polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, a poet and historian. The theatre principal Abel Seyler greatly influenced the development of German theatre and promoted serious German opera, new works and experimental productions, and the concept of a national theatre. Herder argued that every group of people had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schiller&#x27;s plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero&#x27;s struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.

German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers Johann Sebastian Bach, Joseph Haydn, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

In remote Königsberg, Kant tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom, and political authority. Kant&#x27;s work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape German thought—and indeed all of European philosophy—well into the 20th century. German Enlightenment won the support of princes, aristocrats, and the middle classes, and it permanently reshaped the culture. However, there was a conservatism among the elites that warned against going too far.

In 1788, Prussia issued an &quot;Edict on Religion&quot; that forbade preaching any sermon that undermined popular belief in the Holy Trinity or the Bible. The goal was to avoid theological disputes that might impinge on domestic tranquility. Men who doubted the value of Enlightenment favoured the measure, but so too did many supporters. German universities had created a closed elite that could debate controversial issues among themselves, but spreading them to the public was seen as too risky. This intellectual elite was favoured by the state, but that might be reversed if the process of the Enlightenment proved politically or socially destabilizing.

===Habsburg monarchy===
The reign of Maria Theresa, the first Habsburg monarch to be considered influenced by the Enlightenment in some areas, was marked by a mix of enlightenment and conservatism. Her son Joseph II&#x27;s brief reign was marked by this conflict, with his ideology of Josephinism facing opposition. Joseph II carried out numerous reforms in the spirit of the Enlightenment, which affected, for example, the school system, monasteries and the legal system. Emperor Leopold II, who was an early opponent of capital punishment, had a brief and contentious rule that was mostly marked by relations with France. Similarly, Emperor Francis II&#x27;s rule was primarily marked by relations with France.

The ideas of the Enlightenment also appeared in literature and theater works. Joseph von Sonnenfels was an important representative. In music, Austrian musicians such as Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were associated with the Enlightenment.

===Italy===
In Italy the main centers of diffusion of the Enlightenment were Naples and Milan: in both cities the intellectuals took public office and collaborated with the Bourbon and Habsburg administrations. In Naples, Antonio Genovesi, Ferdinando Galiani, and Gaetano Filangieri were active under the tolerant King Charles of Bourbon. However, the Neapolitan Enlightenment, like Vico&#x27;s philosophy, remained almost always in the theoretical field. Only later, many Enlighteners animated the unfortunate experience of the Parthenopean Republic. In Milan, however, the movement strove to find concrete solutions to problems. The center of discussions was the magazine &quot;Il Caffè&quot; (1762–1766), founded by brothers Pietro and Alessandro Verri (famous philosophers and writers, as well as their brother Giovanni), who also gave life to the Accademia dei Pugni, founded in 1761. Minor centers were Tuscany, Veneto, and Piedmont, where among others, Pompeo Neri worked.

From Naples, Genovesi influenced a generation of southern Italian intellectuals and university students. His textbook &quot;Della diceosina, o sia della Filosofia del Giusto e dell&#x27;Onesto&quot; (1766) was a controversial attempt to mediate between the history of moral philosophy on the one hand and the specific problems encountered by 18th-century commercial society on the other. It contained the greater part of Genovesi&#x27;s political, philosophical, and economic thought, which became a guidebook for Neapolitan economic and social development.

Science flourished as Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani made break-through discoveries in electricity. Pietro Verri was a leading economist in Lombardy. Historian Joseph Schumpeter states he was &quot;the most important pre-Smithian authority on Cheapness-and-Plenty.&quot; The most influential scholar on the Italian Enlightenment has been Franco Venturi. Italy also produced some of the Enlightenment&#x27;s greatest legal theorists, including Beccaria, Giambattista Vico, and Francesco Mario Pagano.

===Bourbon Spain and Spanish America===
When Charles II, the last Spanish Habsburg monarch, died his successor was from the French House of Bourbon, initiating a period of French Enlightenment influence in Spain and the Spanish Empire.

In the 18th Century, the Spanish continued to expand their empire in the Americas with the Spanish missions in California and established missions deeper inland in South America. Under Charles III, the crown began to implement serious structural changes. The monarchy curtailed the power of the Catholic Church, and established a standing military in Spanish America. Freer trade was promoted under &quot;comercio libre&quot; in which regions could trade with companies sailing from any other Spanish port, rather than the restrictive mercantile system. The crown sent out scientific expeditions to assert Spanish sovereignty over territories it claimed but did not control, but also importantly to discover the economic potential of its far-flung empire. Botanical expeditions sought plants that could be of use to the empire. Charles IV gave Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt free rein to travel in Spanish America, usually closed to foreigners, and more importantly, access to crown officials to aid the success of his scientific expedition.

When Napoleon invaded Spain in 1808, Ferdinand VII abdicated and Napoleon placed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the throne. To add legitimacy to this move, the Bayonne Constitution was promulgated, which included representation from Spain&#x27;s overseas components, but most Spaniards rejected the whole Napoleonic project. A war of national resistance erupted. The Cortes de Cádiz (parliament) was convened to rule Spain in the absence of the legitimate monarch, Ferdinand. It created a new governing document, the Constitution of 1812, which laid out three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial; put limits on the king by creating a constitutional monarchy; defined citizens as those in the Spanish Empire without African ancestry; established universal manhood suffrage; and established public education starting with primary school through university as well as freedom of expression. The constitution was in effect from 1812 until 1814, when Napoleon was defeated and Ferdinand was restored to the throne of Spain. Upon his return, Ferdinand repudiated the constitution and reestablished absolutist rule.

===Haiti===
The Haitian Revolution began in 1791 and ended in 1804 and shows how Enlightenment ideas &quot;were part of complex transcultural flows.&quot; Radical ideas in Paris during and after the French Revolution were mobilized in Haiti, such as by Toussaint Louverture. Toussaint had read the critique of European colonialism in Guillaume Thomas François Raynal&#x27;s book &quot;Histoire des deux Indes&quot; and &quot;was particularly impressed by Raynal&#x27;s prediction of the coming of a &#x27;Black Spartacus.

The revolution combined Enlightenment ideas with the experiences of the slaves in Haiti, two-thirds of whom had been born in Africa and could &quot;draw on specific notions of kingdom and just government from West and Central Africa, and to employ religious practices such as voodoo for the formation of revolutionary communities.&quot; The revolution also affected France and &quot;forced the French National Convention to abolish slavery in 1794.&quot;

===Portugal and Brazil===

The Enlightenment in Portugal (&quot;Iluminismo&quot;) was heavily marked by the rule of Prime Minister Marquis of Pombal under King Joseph I from 1756 to 1777. Following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake which destroyed a large part of Lisbon, the Marquis of Pombal implemented important economic policies to regulate commercial activity (in particular with Brazil and England), and to standardise quality throughout the country (for example by introducing the first integrated industries in Portugal). His reconstruction of Lisbon&#x27;s riverside district in straight and perpendicular streets (the Lisbon Baixa), methodically organized to facilitate commerce and exchange (for example by assigning to each street a different product or service), can be seen as a direct application of the Enlightenment ideas to governance and urbanism. His urbanistic ideas, also being the first large-scale example of earthquake engineering, became collectively known as Pombaline style, and were implemented throughout the kingdom during his stay in office. His governance was as enlightened as ruthless, see for example the Távora affair.

In literature, the first Enlightenment ideas in Portugal can be traced back to the diplomat, philosopher, and writer António Vieira who spent a considerable amount of his life in colonial Brazil denouncing discriminations against New Christians and the indigenous peoples in Brazil. During the 18th century, enlightened literary movements such as the Arcádia Lusitana (lasting from 1756 until 1776, then replaced by the Nova Arcádia in 1790 until 1794) surfaced in the academic medium, in particular involving former students of the University of Coimbra. A distinct member of this group was the poet Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage. The physician António Nunes Ribeiro Sanches was also an important Enlightenment figure, contributing to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; and being part of the Russian court. The ideas of the Enlightenment influenced various economists and anti-colonial intellectuals throughout the Portuguese Empire, such as José de Azeredo Coutinho, José da Silva Lisboa, Cláudio Manoel da Costa, and Tomás Antônio Gonzaga.

The Napoleonic invasion of Portugal had consequences for the Portuguese monarchy. With the aid of the British navy, the Portuguese royal family was evacuated to Brazil, its most important colony. Even though Napoleon had been defeated, the royal court remained in Brazil. The Liberal Revolution of 1820 forced the return of the royal family to Portugal. The terms by which the restored king was to rule was a constitutional monarchy under the Constitution of Portugal. Brazil declared its independence of Portugal in 1822 and became a monarchy.

===Russia===

In Russia, the government began to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences in the mid-18th century. This era produced the first Russian university, library, theatre, public museum, and independent press. Like other enlightened despots, Catherine the Great played a key role in fostering the arts, sciences and education. She used her own interpretation of Enlightenment ideals, assisted by notable international experts such as Voltaire (by correspondence) and in residence world class scientists such as Leonhard Euler and Peter Simon Pallas. The national Enlightenment differed from its Western European counterpart in that it promoted further modernization of all aspects of Russian life and was concerned with attacking the institution of serfdom in Russia. The Russian Enlightenment centered on the individual instead of societal enlightenment and encouraged the living of an enlightened life. A powerful element was &quot;prosveshchenie&quot; which combined religious piety, erudition, and commitment to the spread of learning. However, it lacked the skeptical and critical spirit of the Western European Enlightenment.

===Poland and Lithuania===
Enlightenment ideas (&quot;oświecenie&quot;) emerged late in Poland, as the Polish middle class was weaker and szlachta (nobility) culture (Sarmatism) together with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth political system (Golden Liberty) were in deep crisis. The political system was built on aristocratic republicanism, but was unable to defend itself against powerful neighbors Russia, Prussia, and Austria as they repeatedly sliced off regions until nothing was left of independent Poland. The Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and especially in theatre and the arts peaked in the reign of King Stanisław August Poniatowski (second half of the 18th century).

Warsaw was a main centre after 1750, with an expansion of schools and educational institutions and the arts patronage held at the Royal Castle. Leaders promoted tolerance and more education. They included King Stanislaw II August and reformers Piotr Switkowski, Antoni Poplawski, Josef Niemcewicz, and Jósef Pawlinkowski, as well as Baudouin de Cortenay, a Polonized dramatist. Opponents included Florian Jaroszewicz, Gracjan Piotrowski, Karol Wyrwicz, and Wojciech Skarszewski. The movement went into decline with the Third Partition of Poland (1795) – a national tragedy inspiring a short period of sentimental writing – and ended in 1822, replaced by Romanticism.

===China===

Eighteenth-century China experienced &quot;a trend towards seeing fewer dragons and miracles, not unlike the disenchantment that began to spread across the Europe of the Enlightenment.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;some of the developments that we associate with Europe&#x27;s Enlightenment resemble events in China remarkably.&quot; During this time, ideals of Chinese society were reflected in &quot;the reign of the Qing emperors Kangxi and Qianlong; China was posited as the incarnation of an enlightened and meritocratic society—and instrumentalized for criticisms of absolutist rule in Europe.&quot;

===Japan===
From 1641 to 1853, the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan enforced a policy called &quot;kaikin.&quot; The policy prohibited foreign contact with most outside countries. Robert Bellah found &quot;origins of modern Japan in certain strands of Confucian thinking, a &#x27;functional analogue to the Protestant Ethic&#x27; that Max Weber singled out as the driving force behind Western capitalism.&quot; Japanese Confucian and Enlightenment ideas were brought together, for example, in the work of the Japanese reformer Tsuda Mamichi in the 1870s, who said, &quot;Whenever we open our mouths...it is to speak of &#x27;enlightenment.

In Japan and much of East Asia, Confucian ideas were not replaced but &quot;ideas associated with the Enlightenment were instead fused with the existing cosmology—which in turn was refashioned under conditions of global interaction.&quot; In Japan in particular, the term &quot;ri,&quot; which is the Confucian idea of &quot;order and harmony on human society&quot; also came to represent &quot;the idea of laissez-faire and the rationality of market exchange.&quot; By the 1880s, the slogan &quot;Civilization and Enlightenment&quot; became potent throughout Japan, China, and Korea and was employed to address challenges of globalization.

===Korea===
During this time, Korea &quot;aimed at isolation&quot; and was known as the &quot;hermit kingdom&quot; but became awakened to Enlightenment ideas by the 1890s such as with the activities of the Independence Club. Korea was influenced by China and Japan but also found its own Enlightenment path with the Korean intellectual Yu Kilchun who popularized the term Enlightenment throughout Korea. The use of Enlightenment ideas was a &quot;response to a specific situation in Korea in the 1890s, and not a belated answer to Voltaire.&quot;

===India===
In 18th-century India, Tipu Sultan was an enlightened monarch, who &quot;was one of the founding members of the (French) Jacobin Club in Seringapatam, had planted a liberty tree, and asked to be addressed as &#x27;Tipu Citoyen, which means Citizen Tipu. In parts of India, an important movement called the &quot;Bengal Renaissance&quot; led to Enlightenment reforms beginning in the 1820s. Ram Mohan Roy was a reformer who &quot;fused different traditions in his project of social reform that made him a proponent of a &#x27;religion of reason.

===Egypt===

Eighteenth-century Egypt had &quot;a form of &#x27;cultural revival&#x27; in the making—specifically Islamic origins of modernization long before Napoleon&#x27;s Egyptian campaign.&quot; Napoleon&#x27;s expedition into Egypt further encouraged &quot;social transformations that harkened back to debates about inner-Islamic reform, but now were also legitimized by referring to the authority of the Enlightenment.&quot; A major intellectual influence on Islamic modernism and expanding the Enlightenment in Egypt, Rifa al-Tahtawi &quot;oversaw the publication of hundreds of European works in the Arabic language.&quot;

===Ottoman Empire===
The Enlightenment began to influence the Ottoman Empire in the 1830s and continued into the late 19th century.
The Tanzimat was a period of reform in the Ottoman Empire that began with the Gülhane Hatt-ı Şerif in 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876.

Namik Kemal, a political activist and member of the Young Ottomans, drew on major Enlightenment thinkers and &quot;a variety of intellectual resources in his quest for social and political reform.&quot; In 1893, Kemal responded to Ernest Renan, who had indicted the Islamic religion, with his own version of the Enlightenment, which &quot;was not a poor copy of French debates in the eighteenth century, but an original position responding to the exigencies of Ottoman society in the late nineteenth century.&quot;

==Historiography==
The idea of the Enlightenment has always been contested territory. According to Keith Thomas, its supporters &quot;hail it as the source of everything that is progressive about the modern world. For them, it stands for freedom of thought, rational inquiry, critical thinking, religious tolerance, political liberty, scientific achievement, the pursuit of happiness, and hope for the future.&quot; Thomas adds that its detractors accuse it of shallow rationalism, naïve optimism, unrealistic universalism, and moral darkness. From the start, conservative and clerical defenders of traditional religion attacked materialism and skepticism as evil forces that encouraged immorality. By 1794, they pointed to the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution as confirmation of their predictions.

Romantic philosophers argued that the Enlightenment&#x27;s excessive dependence on reason was a mistake that it perpetuated, disregarding the bonds of history, myth, faith, and tradition that were necessary to hold society together. Ritchie Robertson portrays it as a grand intellectual and political program, offering a &quot;science&quot; of society modeled on the powerful physical laws of Newton. &quot;Social science&quot; was seen as the instrument of human improvement. It would expose truth and expand human happiness.

===Definition===
The term &quot;Enlightenment&quot; emerged in English in the latter part of the 19th century, with particular reference to French philosophy, as the equivalent of the French term &quot;Lumières&quot; (used first by Jean-Baptiste Dubos in 1733 and already well established by 1751). From Kant&#x27;s 1784 essay &quot;Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?&quot; (&quot;Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?&quot;), the German term became &quot;Aufklärun&quot;g (&quot;aufklären&quot;=to illuminate; &quot;sich aufklären&quot;=to clear up). However, scholars have never agreed on a definition of the Enlightenment or on its chronological or geographical extent. Terms like &quot;les Lumières&quot; (French), &quot;illuminism&quot;o (Italian), &quot;ilustración&quot; (Spanish) and &quot;Aufklärung&quot; (German) referred to partly overlapping movements. Not until the late 19th century did English scholars agree they were talking about &quot;the Enlightenment.&quot;

Enlightenment historiography began in the period itself, from what Enlightenment figures said about their work. A dominant element was the intellectual angle they took. Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Preliminary Discourse&quot; of &quot;l&#x27;Encyclopédie&quot; provides a history of the Enlightenment which comprises a chronological list of developments in the realm of knowledge—of which the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; forms the pinnacle. In 1783, Mendelssohn referred to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use of reason. Kant called Enlightenment &quot;man&#x27;s release from his self-incurred tutelage,&quot; tutelage being &quot;man&#x27;s inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another.&quot; &quot;For Kant, Enlightenment was mankind&#x27;s final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance.&quot; The German scholar Ernst Cassirer called the Enlightenment &quot;a part and a special phase of that whole intellectual development through which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic self-confidence and self-consciousness.&quot; According to historian Roy Porter, the liberation of the human mind from a dogmatic state of ignorance, is the epitome of what the Age of Enlightenment was trying to capture.

Bertrand Russell saw the Enlightenment as a phase in a progressive development which began in antiquity and that reason and challenges to the established order were constant ideals throughout that time. Russell said that the Enlightenment was ultimately born out of the Protestant reaction against the Catholic Counter-Reformation and that philosophical views such as affinity for democracy against monarchy originated among 16th-century Protestants to justify their desire to break away from the Catholic Church. Although many of these philosophical ideals were picked up by Catholics, Russell argues that by the 18th century the Enlightenment was the principal manifestation of the schism that began with Martin Luther.

Jonathan Israel rejects the attempts of postmodern and Marxian historians to understand the revolutionary ideas of the period purely as by-products of social and economic transformations. He instead focuses on the history of ideas in the period from 1650 to the end of the 18th century and claims that it was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually led to the revolutions of the latter half of the 18th century and the early 19th century. Israel argues that until the 1650s Western civilization &quot;was based on a largely shared core of faith, tradition, and authority.&quot;

===Time span===
There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment, though several historians and philosophers argue that it was marked by Descartes&#x27; 1637 philosophy of &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;), which shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty. In France, many cited the publication of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687), which built upon the work of earlier scientists and formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation. French historians usually place the &quot;Siècle des Lumières&quot; (&quot;Century of Enlightenments&quot;) between 1715 and 1789: from the beginning of the reign of Louis XV until the French Revolution. Most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the French Revolution or the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars (1804) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment.

In recent years, scholars have expanded the time span and global perspective of the Enlightenment by examining: (1) how European intellectuals did not work alone and other people helped spread and adapt Enlightenment ideas, (2) how Enlightenment ideas were &quot;a response to cross-border interaction and global integration,&quot; and (3) how the Enlightenment &quot;continued throughout the nineteenth century and beyond.&quot; The Enlightenment &quot;was not merely a history of diffusion&quot; and &quot;was the work of historical actors around the world... who invoked the term... for their own specific purposes.&quot;

===Modern study===
In the 1947 book &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment,&quot; Frankfurt School philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno argue: 

Extending Horkheimer and Adorno&#x27;s argument, intellectual historian Jason Josephson Storm argues that any idea of the Age of Enlightenment as a clearly defined period that is separate from the earlier Renaissance and later Romanticism or Counter-Enlightenment constitutes a myth. Storm points out that there are vastly different and mutually contradictory periodizations of the Enlightenment depending on nation, field of study, and school of thought; that the term and category of &quot;Enlightenment&quot; referring to the Scientific Revolution was actually applied after the fact; that the Enlightenment did not see an increase in disenchantment or the dominance of the mechanistic worldview; and that a blur in the early modern ideas of the humanities and natural sciences makes it hard to circumscribe a Scientific Revolution. Storm defends his categorization of the Enlightenment as &quot;myth&quot; by noting the regulative role ideas of a period of Enlightenment and disenchantment play in modern Western culture, such that belief in magic, spiritualism, and even religion appears somewhat taboo in intellectual strata.

In the 1970s, study of the Enlightenment expanded to include the ways Enlightenment ideas spread to European colonies and how they interacted with indigenous cultures and how the Enlightenment took place in formerly unstudied areas such as Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Poland, Hungary, and Russia. Intellectuals such as Robert Darnton and Jürgen Habermas have focused on the social conditions of the Enlightenment. Habermas described the creation of the &quot;bourgeois public sphere&quot; in 18th-century Europe, containing the new venues and modes of communication allowing for rational exchange. Habermas said that the public sphere was bourgeois, egalitarian, rational, and independent from the state, making it the ideal venue for intellectuals to critically examine contemporary politics and society, away from the interference of established authority. While the public sphere is generally an integral component of the social study of the Enlightenment, other historians have questioned whether the public sphere had these characteristics.

==Society and culture==
In contrast to the intellectual historiographical approach of the Enlightenment, which examines the various currents or discourses of intellectual thought within the European context during the 17th and 18th centuries, the cultural (or social) approach examines the changes that occurred in European society and culture. This approach studies the process of changing sociabilities and cultural practices during the Enlightenment.

One of the primary elements of the culture of the Enlightenment was the rise of the public sphere, a &quot;realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate, more open and accessible forms of urban public space and sociability, and an explosion of print culture,&quot; in the late 17th century and 18th century. Elements of the public sphere included that it was egalitarian, that it discussed the domain of &quot;common concern,&quot; and that argument was founded on reason. Habermas uses the term &quot;common concern&quot; to describe those areas of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive territory of the state and religious authorities, now open to critical examination by the public sphere. The values of this bourgeois public sphere included holding reason to be supreme, considering everything to be open to criticism (the public sphere is critical), and the opposition of secrecy of all sorts.
The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of capitalism. The modern nation state in its consolidation of public power created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the public sphere. Capitalism also increased society&#x27;s autonomy and self-awareness, as well as an increasing need for the exchange of information. As the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of institutions, and the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters. In France, the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy&#x27;s move from the king&#x27;s palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720, since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations, especially fine paintings.

The context for the rise of the public sphere was the economic and social change commonly associated with the Industrial Revolution: &quot;Economic expansion, increasing urbanization, rising population and improving communications in comparison to the stagnation of the previous century.&quot; Rising efficiency in production techniques and communication lowered the prices of consumer goods and increased the amount and variety of goods available to consumers (including the literature essential to the public sphere). Meanwhile, the colonial experience (most European states had colonial empires in the 18th century) began to expose European society to extremely heterogeneous cultures, leading to the breaking down of &quot;barriers between cultural systems, religious divides, gender differences and geographical areas.&quot;

The word &quot;public&quot; implies the highest level of inclusivity—the public sphere by definition should be open to all. However, this sphere was only public to relative degrees. Enlightenment thinkers frequently contrasted their conception of the &quot;public&quot; with that of the people: Condorcet contrasted &quot;opinion&quot; with populace, Marmontel &quot;the opinion of men of letters&quot; with &quot;the opinion of the multitude&quot; and d&#x27;Alembert the &quot;truly enlightened public&quot; with &quot;the blind and noisy multitude.&quot; Additionally, most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes. Cross-class influences occurred through noble and lower class participation in areas such as the coffeehouses and the Masonic lodges.

===Implications in the arts===
Because of the focus on reason over superstition, the Enlightenment cultivated the arts. Emphasis on learning, art, and music became more widespread, especially with the growing middle class. Areas of study such as literature, philosophy, science, and the fine arts increasingly explored subject matter to which the general public, in addition to the previously more segregated professionals and patrons, could relate.
As musicians depended more on public support, public concerts became increasingly popular and helped supplement performers&#x27; and composers&#x27; incomes. The concerts also helped them to reach a wider audience. Handel, for example, epitomized this with his highly public musical activities in London. He gained considerable fame there with performances of his operas and oratorios. The music of Haydn and Mozart, with their Viennese Classical styles, are usually regarded as being the most in line with the Enlightenment ideals.

The desire to explore, record, and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact on music publications. Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire de musique&quot; (published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 18th century. This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was Charles Burney&#x27;s &quot;A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period&quot; (1776), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time. Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, Rose Rosengard Subotnik&#x27;s &quot;Deconstructive Variations&quot; (subtitled &quot;Music and Reason in Western Society&quot;) compares Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (1791) using the Enlightenment and Romantic perspectives and concludes that the work is &quot;an ideal musical representation of the Enlightenment.&quot;

As the economy and the middle class expanded, there was an increasing number of amateur musicians. One manifestation of this involved women, who became more involved with music on a social level. Women were already engaged in professional roles as singers and increased their presence in the amateur performers&#x27; scene, especially with keyboard music. Music publishers began to print music that amateurs could understand and play. The majority of the works that were published were for keyboard, voice and keyboard, and chamber ensemble. After these initial genres were popularized, from the mid-century on, amateur groups sang choral music, which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize on. The increasing study of the fine arts, as well as access to amateur-friendly published works, led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing music. Music magazines, reviews, and critical works which suited amateurs as well as connoisseurs began to surface.

==Dissemination of ideas==
The &quot;philosophes&quot; spent a great deal of energy disseminating their ideas among educated men and women in cosmopolitan cities. They used many venues, some of them quite new.

===Republic of Letters===
The term &quot;Republic of Letters&quot; was coined in 1664 by Pierre Bayle in his journal &quot;Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres.&quot; Towards the end of the 18th century, the editor of &quot;Histoire de la République des Lettres en France,&quot; a literary survey, described the Republic of Letters as being: 

The Republic of Letters was the sum of a number of Enlightenment ideals: an egalitarian realm governed by knowledge that could act across political boundaries and rival state power. It was a forum that supported &quot;free public examination of questions regarding religion or legislation.&quot; Kant considered written communication essential to his conception of the public sphere; once everyone was a part of the &quot;reading public,&quot; then society could be said to be enlightened. The people who participated in the Republic of Letters, such as Diderot and Voltaire, are frequently known today as important Enlightenment figures. Indeed, the men who wrote Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; arguably formed a microcosm of the larger &quot;republic.&quot;
Many women played an essential part in the French Enlightenment because of the role they played as &quot;salonnières&quot; in Parisian salons, as the contrast to the male &quot;philosophes.&quot; The salon was the principal social institution of the republic and &quot;became the civil working spaces of the project of Enlightenment.&quot; Women, as salonnières, were &quot;the legitimate governors of [the] potentially unruly discourse&quot; that took place within. While women were marginalized in the public culture of the Old Regime, the French Revolution destroyed the old cultural and economic restraints of patronage and corporatism (guilds), opening French society to female participation, particularly in the literary sphere.

In France, the established men of letters (&quot;gens de lettres&quot;) had fused with the elites (&quot;les grands&quot;) of French society by the mid-18th century. This led to the creation of an oppositional literary sphere, Grub Street, the domain of a &quot;multitude of versifiers and would-be authors.&quot; These men came to London to become authors only to discover that the literary market could not support large numbers of writers, who in any case were very poorly remunerated by the publishing-bookselling guilds.

The writers of Grub Street, the Grub Street Hacks, were left feeling bitter about the relative success of the men of letters and found an outlet for their literature which was typified by the &quot;libelle.&quot; Written mostly in the form of pamphlets, the &quot;libelles&quot; &quot;slandered the court, the Church, the aristocracy, the academies, the salons, everything elevated and respectable, including the monarchy itself.&quot; &quot;Le Gazetier cuirassé&quot; by Charles Théveneau de Morande was a prototype of the genre. It was Grub Street literature that was most read by the public during the Enlightenment. According to Darnton, more importantly the Grub Street hacks inherited the &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; once displayed by the &quot;philosophes&quot; and paved the way for the French Revolution by desacralizing figures of political, moral, and religious authority in France.

===Book industry===
The increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the &quot;social&quot; Enlightenment. Developments in the Industrial Revolution allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities at lower prices, encouraging the spread of books, pamphlets, newspapers, and journals – &quot;media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes.&quot; Commercial development likewise increased the demand for information, along with rising populations and increased urbanisation. However, demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes, as evidenced by the bibliothèque bleue. Literacy rates are difficult to gauge, but in France the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century. Reflecting the decreasing influence of religion, the number of books about science and art published in Paris doubled from 1720 to 1780, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total.

Reading underwent serious changes in the 18th century. In particular, Rolf Engelsing has argued for the existence of a &quot;reading revolution.&quot; Until 1750, reading was done intensively: people tended to own a small number of books and read them repeatedly, often to small audience. After 1750, people began to read &quot;extensively,&quot; finding as many books as they could, increasingly reading them alone. This is supported by increasing literacy rates, particularly among women.

The vast majority of the reading public could not afford to own a private library, and while most of the state-run &quot;universal libraries&quot; set up in the 17th and 18th centuries were open to the public, they were not the only sources of reading material. On one end of the spectrum was the &quot;bibliothèque bleue,&quot; a collection of cheaply produced books published in Troyes, France. Intended for a largely rural and semi-literate audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While some historians have argued against the Enlightenment&#x27;s penetration into the lower classes, the &quot;bibliothèque bleue&quot; represents at least a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability. Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material for a small price started to appear, and occasionally bookstores would offer a small lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, journals, and sometimes even popular novels to their customers. &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Spectator,&quot; two influential periodicals sold from 1709 to 1714, were closely associated with coffee house culture in London, being both read and produced in various establishments in the city. This is an example of the triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: reading material was often obtained, read, discussed, and even produced on the premises.
It is difficult to determine what people actually read during the Enlightenment. For example, examining the catalogs of private libraries gives an image skewed in favor of the classes wealthy enough to afford libraries and also ignores censored works unlikely to be publicly acknowledged. For this reason, a study of publishing would be much more fruitful for discerning reading habits. Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. For example, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes, the man in charge of the French censor. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, &quot;general works&quot; (those books &quot;that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority&quot;), demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature. However, these works never became part of literary canon and are largely forgotten today as a result.

A healthy, legal publishing industry existed throughout Europe, although established publishers and book sellers occasionally ran afoul of the law. For example, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, condemned by both the King and Clement XII, nevertheless found its way into print with the help of the aforementioned Malesherbes and creative use of French censorship law. However, many works were sold without running into any legal trouble at all. Borrowing records from libraries in England, Germany, and North America indicate that more than 70% of books borrowed were novels. Less than 1% of the books were of a religious nature, indicating the general trend of declining religiosity.

===Natural history===

A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur&#x27;s &quot;Histoire naturelle des insectes&quot; and Jacques Gautier d&#x27;Agoty&#x27;s &quot;La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain&quot; (1746). Outside Ancien Régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology, and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by Matthew Daniel Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.

The target audience of natural history was French upper class, evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works. Naturalists catered to upper class desire for erudition: many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. However, natural history was often a political affair. As Emma Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists &quot;slipped between the natural world and the social ... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural, but also the dominance of the natural over the social.&quot; The idea of taste (&quot;le goût&quot;) was a social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members of the upper class. In this way, natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class. From this basis, naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.

===Scientific and literary journals===

The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment. The first journal, the Parisian , appeared in 1665. However, it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication, but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally low demand for English publications on the continent, which was echoed by England&#x27;s similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market—such as Danish, Spanish, and Portuguese—found journal success more difficult, and a more international language was used instead. French slowly took over Latin&#x27;s status as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of learned circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland, where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced.

Jonathan Israel called the journals the most influential cultural innovation of European intellectual culture. They shifted the attention of the &quot;cultivated public&quot; away from established authorities to novelty and innovation, and instead promoted the Enlightened ideals of toleration and intellectual objectivity. Being a source of knowledge derived from science and reason, they were an implicit critique of existing notions of universal truth monopolized by monarchies, parliaments, and religious authorities. They also advanced Christian Enlightenment that upheld &quot;the legitimacy of God-ordained authority&quot;—the Bible—in which there had to be agreement between the biblical and natural theories.

===Encyclopedias and dictionaries===

Although the existence of dictionaries and encyclopedias spanned into ancient times, the texts changed from defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century encyclopedic dictionaries. The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers&#x27; tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on secular affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of theology.

Along with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines. Commenting on alphabetization, the historian Charles Porset has said that &quot;as the zero degree of taxonomy, alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the Enlightenment.&quot; For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and hierarchical systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of egalitarianism. Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Enlightenment as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply. In the latter half of the 18th century, the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the French Revolution. Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions.

The first technical dictionary was drafted by John Harris and entitled &quot;Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences.&quot; Harris&#x27; book avoids theological and biographical entries and instead concentrates on science and technology. Published in 1704, the &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris&#x27; model, including Ephraim Chambers&#x27; &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; (1728), which included five editions and is a substantially larger work than Harris&#x27;. The folio edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; emphasized Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as engraving, brewing, and dyeing.

 In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The &quot;Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerk- und Handlungs-Lexicon&quot; (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. &quot;Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon&quot; (1721) was better known than the &quot;Handlungs-Lexicon&quot; and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine while geometry and logic were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1771) was modelled along the same lines as the German lexicons.

However, the prime example of reference works that systematized scientific knowledge in the Age of Enlightenment were universal encyclopedias rather than technical dictionaries. It was the goal of universal encyclopedias to record all human knowledge in a comprehensive reference work. The most well-known of these works is Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers.&quot; The work, which began publication in 1751, was composed of 35 volumes and over 71,000 separate entries. A great number of the entries were dedicated to describing the sciences and crafts in detail and provided intellectuals across Europe with a high-quality survey of human knowledge. In d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot,&quot; the work&#x27;s goal to record the extent of human knowledge in the arts and sciences is outlined:

The massive work was arranged according to a &quot;tree of knowledge.&quot; The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism. Both areas of knowledge were united by philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment&#x27;s desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree&#x27;s design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour. As the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; gained popularity, it was published in quarto and octavo editions after 1777. The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately 25,000 copies of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution. The extensive yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience.

===Popularization of science===
One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was precipitated by a high rise in the availability of food; this enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education. Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured &quot;to make information available to the greatest number of people.&quot; As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. Newton&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.
The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle&#x27;s &quot;Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds&quot; (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter&#x27;s &quot;Astronomy&quot; (1727) was advertised as &quot;a Work entirely New&quot; that would include &quot;short and easie Rules and Astronomical Tables.&quot;

The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the &quot;Principia&quot; was &quot;Eléments de la philosophie de Newton,&quot; published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Principia,&quot; published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton&#x27;s theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Writing for a growing female audience, Francesco Algarotti published &quot;Il Newtonianism per le dame,&quot; which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by Elizabeth Carter. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by Henry Pemberton. His &quot;A View of Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Philosophy&quot; was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class. During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works. Sarah Trimmer wrote a successful natural history textbook for children titled &quot;The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature&quot; (1782), which was published for many years in eleven editions.

===Schools and universities===

Most work on the Enlightenment emphasizes the ideals discussed by intellectuals, rather than the actual state of education at the time. Leading educational theorists like England&#x27;s John Locke and Switzerland&#x27;s Jean Jacques Rousseau both emphasized the importance of shaping young minds early. By the late Enlightenment, there was a rising demand for a more universal approach to education, particularly after the American Revolution and the French Revolution.

The predominant educational psychology from the 1750s onward, especially in northern European countries, was associationism: the notion that the mind associates or dissociates ideas through repeated routines. In addition to being conducive to Enlightenment ideologies of liberty, self-determination, and personal responsibility, it offered a practical theory of the mind that allowed teachers to transform longstanding forms of print and manuscript culture into effective graphic tools of learning for the lower and middle orders of society. Children were taught to memorize facts through oral and graphic methods that originated during the Renaissance.

Many of the leading universities associated with Enlightenment progressive principles were located in northern Europe, with the most renowned being the universities of Leiden, Göttingen, Halle, Montpellier, Uppsala, and Edinburgh. These universities, especially Edinburgh, produced professors whose ideas had a significant impact on Britain&#x27;s North American colonies and later the American Republic. Within the natural sciences, Edinburgh&#x27;s medical school also led the way in chemistry, anatomy, and pharmacology. In other parts of Europe, the universities and schools of France and most of Europe were bastions of traditionalism and were not hospitable to the Enlightenment. In France, the major exception was the medical university at Montpellier.

===Learned academies===
The history of Academies in France during the Enlightenment begins with the Academy of Science, founded in 1666 in Paris. It was closely tied to the French state, acting as an extension of a government seriously lacking in scientists. It helped promote and organize new disciplines and it trained new scientists. It also contributed to the enhancement of scientists&#x27; social status, considering them to be the &quot;most useful of all citizens.&quot; Academies demonstrate the rising interest in science along with its increasing secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members (13%). The presence of the French academies in the public sphere cannot be attributed to their membership, as although the majority of their members were bourgeois, the exclusive institution was only open to elite Parisian scholars. They perceived themselves as &quot;interpreters of the sciences for the people.&quot; For example, it was with this in mind that academicians took it upon themselves to disprove the popular pseudo-science of mesmerism.

The strongest contribution of the French Academies to the public sphere comes from the &quot;concours académiques&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;academic contests&quot;) they sponsored throughout France. These academic contests were perhaps the most public of any institution during the Enlightenment. The practice of contests dated back to the Middle Ages and was revived in the mid-17th century. The subject matter had previously been generally religious and/or monarchical, featuring essays, poetry, and painting. However, by roughly 1725 this subject matter had radically expanded and diversified, including &quot;royal propaganda, philosophical battles, and critical ruminations on the social and political institutions of the Old Regime.&quot; Topics of public controversy were also discussed such as the theories of Newton and Descartes, the slave trade, women&#x27;s education, and justice in France. More importantly, the contests were open to all, and the enforced anonymity of each submission guaranteed that neither gender nor social rank would determine the judging. Indeed, although the &quot;vast majority&quot; of participants belonged to the wealthier strata of society (&quot;the liberal arts, the clergy, the judiciary and the medical profession&quot;), there were some cases of the popular classes submitting essays and even winning. Similarly, a significant number of women participated—and won—the competitions. Of a total of 2,300 prize competitions offered in France, women won 49—perhaps a small number by modern standards but very significant in an age in which most women did not have any academic training. Indeed, the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in women&#x27;s education.

In England, the Royal Society of London played a significant role in the public sphere and the spread of Enlightenment ideas. It was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in 1662. The society played a large role in spreading Robert Boyle&#x27;s experimental philosophy around Europe and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence and exchange. Boyle was &quot;a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate&quot; and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy. This is where the Royal Society came into play: witnessing had to be a &quot;collective act&quot; and the Royal Society&#x27;s assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations. However, not just any witness was considered to be credible: &quot;Oxford professors were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants.&quot; Two factors were taken into account: a witness&#x27;s knowledge in the area and a witness&#x27;s &quot;moral constitution.&quot; In other words, only civil society were considered for Boyle&#x27;s public.

===Salons===

Salons were places where &quot;philosophes&quot; were reunited and discussed old, actual, or new ideas. This led to salons being the birthplace of intellectual and enlightened ideas.

===Coffeehouses===
Coffeehouses were especially important to the spread of knowledge during the Enlightenment because they created a unique environment in which people from many different walks of life gathered and shared ideas. They were frequently criticized by nobles who feared the possibility of an environment in which class and its accompanying titles and privileges were disregarded. Such an environment was especially intimidating to monarchs who derived much of their power from the disparity between classes of people. If the different classes joined together under the influence of Enlightenment thinking, they might recognize the all-encompassing oppression and abuses of their monarchs and because of the numbers of their members might be able to successfully revolt. Monarchs also resented the idea of their subjects convening as one to discuss political matters, especially matters of foreign affairs. Rulers thought political affairs were their business only, a result of their divine right to rule.

Coffeeshops became homes away from home for many who sought to engage in discourse with their neighbors and discuss intriguing and thought-provoking matters, from philosophy to politics. Coffeehouses were essential to the Enlightenment, for they were centers of free-thinking and self-discovery. Although many coffeehouse patrons were scholars, many were not. Coffeehouses attracted a diverse set of people, including the educated wealthy and bourgeois as well as the lower classes. Patrons, being doctors, lawyers, merchants, represented almost all classes, so the coffeeshop environment sparked fear in those who wanted to preserve class distinction. One of the most popular critiques of the coffeehouse said that it &quot;allowed promiscuous association among people from different rungs of the social ladder, from the artisan to the aristocrat&quot; and was therefore compared to Noah&#x27;s Ark, receiving all types of animals, clean and unclean. This unique culture served as a catalyst for journalism, when Joseph Addison and Richard Steele recognized its potential as an audience. Together, Steele and Addison published &quot;The Spectator (1711),&quot; a daily publication which aimed, through fictional narrator Mr. Spectator, to both entertain and provoke discussion on serious philosophical matters.

The first English coffeehouse opened in Oxford in 1650. Brian Cowan said that Oxford coffeehouses developed into &quot;penny universities,&quot; offering a locus of learning that was less formal than at structured institutions. These penny universities occupied a significant position in Oxford academic life, as they were frequented by those consequently referred to as the &quot;virtuosi,&quot; who conducted their research on some of the premises. According to Cowan, &quot;the coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to congregate, to read, as well as learn from and to debate with each other, but was emphatically not a university institution, and the discourse there was of a far different order than any university tutorial.&quot;

The Café Procope was established in Paris in 1686, and by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city. The Café Procope in particular became a center of Enlightenment, welcoming such celebrities as Voltaire and Rousseau. The Café Procope was where Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert decided to create the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. The cafés were one of the various &quot;nerve centers&quot; for &quot;bruits publics,&quot; public noise or rumour. These &quot;bruits&quot; were allegedly a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available at the time.

===Debating societies===

The debating societies are an example of the public sphere during the Enlightenment. Their origins include:
* Clubs of fifty or more men who, at the beginning of the 18th century, met in pubs to discuss religious issues and affairs of state.
* Mooting clubs, set up by law students to practice rhetoric.
* Spouting clubs, established to help actors train for theatrical roles.
* John Henley&#x27;s Oratory, which mixed outrageous sermons with even more absurd questions, like &quot;Whether Scotland be anywhere in the world?&quot;

In the late 1770s, popular debating societies began to move into more &quot;genteel&quot; rooms, a change which helped establish a new standard of sociability. The backdrop to these developments was &quot;an explosion of interest in the theory and practice of public elocution.&quot; The debating societies were commercial enterprises that responded to this demand, sometimes very successfully. Some societies welcomed from 800 to 1,200 spectators per night.

The debating societies discussed an extremely wide range of topics. Before the Enlightenment, most intellectual debates revolved around &quot;confessional&quot;—that is, Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist) or Anglican issues, debated primarily to establish which bloc of faith ought to have the &quot;monopoly of truth and a God-given title to authority.&quot; After Enlightenment, everything that previously had been rooted in tradition was questioned, and often replaced by new concepts. After the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century, a &quot;general process of rationalization and secularization set in&quot; and confessional disputes were reduced to a secondary status in favor of the &quot;escalating contest between faith and incredulity.&quot;

In addition to debates on religion, societies discussed issues such as politics and the role of women. However, the critical subject matter of these debates did not necessarily translate into opposition to the government; the results of the debate quite frequently upheld the &quot;status quo&quot;. From a historical standpoint, one of the most important features of the debating society was their openness to the public, as women attended and even participated in almost every debating society, which were likewise open to all classes providing they could pay the entrance fee. Once inside, spectators were able to participate in a largely egalitarian form of sociability that helped spread Enlightenment ideas.

===Masonic lodges===
Historians have debated the extent to which the secret network of Freemasonry was a main factor in the Enlightenment. Leaders of the Enlightenment included Freemasons such as Diderot, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Lessing, Pope, Horace Walpole, Sir Robert Walpole, Mozart, Goethe, Frederick the Great, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. Norman Davies said Freemasonry was a powerful force on behalf of liberalism in Europe from about 1700 to the twentieth century. It expanded during the Enlightenment, reaching practically every country in Europe. It was especially attractive to powerful aristocrats and politicians as well as intellectuals, artists, and political activists.

During the Enlightenment, Freemasons comprised an international network of like-minded men, often meeting in secret in ritualistic programs at their lodges. They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain, France, and other places. Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values, and rituals originated in Scotland and spread to England and then across the Continent in the 18th century. They fostered new codes of conduct—including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability—&quot;liberty, fraternity, and equality.&quot; Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity, which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs, but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism. Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France—by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations. The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden, and Russia. One example was the Illuminati, founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons, but was never part of the movement. The name itself translates to &quot;,&quot; chosen to reflect their original intent to promote the values of the movement. The Illuminati was an overtly political group, which most Masonic lodges decidedly were not.

Masonic lodges created a private model for public affairs. They &quot;reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections, and representatives.&quot; In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. For example, in French lodges the line &quot;As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened&quot; was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to &quot;initiate the unenlightened.&quot; This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.

German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed: &quot;On the Continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges.&quot; Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that &quot;although the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right.&quot; Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Freemason ideals and the enlightenment in D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s Dream, exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs. Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought. On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism and he argues the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds. The presence of noble women in the French &quot;lodges of adoption&quot; that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.

The major opponent of Freemasonry was the Catholic Church so in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Spain, and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between what Davies calls the reactionary Church and enlightened Freemasonry. Even in France, Masons did not act as a group. American historians, while noting that Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were indeed active Masons, have downplayed the importance of Freemasonry in causing the American Revolution because the Masonic order was non-political and included both Patriots and their enemy the Loyalists.

===Art===
The art produced during the Enlightenment focused on a search for morality that was absent from the art in previous eras. At the same time, the Classical art of Greece and Rome became interesting to people again, since archaeological teams discovered Pompeii and Herculaneum. People took inspiration from it and revived classical art into neo-classical art. This can especially be seen in early American art and architecture, which featured arches, goddesses, and other classical architectural designs.

<text>The Hunt for Red October is the debut novel by American author Tom Clancy, first published on October 1, 1984, by the Naval Institute Press. It depicts Soviet submarine captain Marko Ramius as he seemingly goes rogue with his country&#x27;s cutting-edge ballistic missile submarine &quot;Red October&quot;, and marks the first appearance of Clancy&#x27;s most popular fictional character, Jack Ryan, an analyst working for the Central Intelligence Agency, as he must prove his theory that Ramius is intending to defect to the United States.

&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; launched Clancy&#x27;s career as a novelist, especially after then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan remarked that he had enjoyed reading the book. A film adaptation was released on March 2, 1990, and several computer and video games based on the book have been developed. The book was instrumental in bringing the book genre of techno-thriller into the mainstream.

==Plot==
During the Cold War, Soviet Navy submarine commander Marko Ramius plans to defect to the United States with the ballistic missile submarine &quot;Red October&quot;. It is equipped with a &quot;caterpillar drive&quot;, a cutting-edge silent propulsion system that makes audio detection by passive sonar difficult and enables the submarine to sneak its way into American territorial waters and launch nuclear missiles with little to no warning. As the sub leaves the shipyard at Polyarny, Ramius kills his political officer to ensure that he will not interfere. Ramius was ordered to conduct military exercises with Soviet attack submarine &quot;V. K. Konovalov&quot;, commanded by his former student Viktor Tupolev, to test the effectiveness of the caterpillar drive. Instead, he plots a course for the North American coast, falsely informing the crew that they will be proceeding undetected all the way to Cuba. Before sailing, Ramius sends a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin stating his intention to defect; the Soviet Northern Fleet then sails out to sink &quot;Red October&quot; under the pretext of a search and rescue mission.

&quot;Red October&quot; passes near , a under the command of Bart Mancuso, which is patrolling the entrance of a route used by Soviet submarines in the Reykjanes Ridge off Iceland. &quot;Dallas&quot;″s sonar operator hears the sound of the stealth drive but does not identify it as a submarine. As tensions rise between the US and Soviet fleets due to the unannounced incursion of the Soviet Northern Fleet into Atlantic waters, the crew of &quot;Dallas&quot; analyzes tapes of &quot;Red October&quot;″s acoustic signature and realizes that it is the sound of a new propulsion system. Meanwhile, CIA analyst Jack Ryan determines that the submarine&#x27;s new construction variations house a stealth drive.

Putting information about the letter together with the subsequent launch of the entire Northern Fleet, Ryan deduces Ramius&#x27;s plans to defect. The US military reluctantly agrees to assist; while planning for contingencies in case the Soviet fleet has intentions other than those inferred. Ryan becomes responsible for shepherding Ramius and his submarine away from the pursuing Soviet fleet and meets with Royal Navy acquaintance Admiral John White, commanding a task force from the aircraft carrier .

After Ramius fakes a reactor accident, the US Navy evacuates &quot;Red October&quot;″ crew using a DSRV rescue submarine. Ramius and his officers stay behind, claiming that they plan to scuttle the submarine to prevent it getting into the hands of the Americans. To convince the Soviets that &quot;Red October&quot; has in fact been destroyed, a decommissioned US ballistic missile submarine, , is blown up underwater as a deception. A depth gauge taken from &quot;Red October&quot;&#x27;s main instrument panel is made to appear as if it had been salvaged from &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;″s wreckage. Meanwhile, Ryan, Mancuso, some of the &quot;Dallas&quot; crew, and Owen Williams board &quot;Red October&quot; and meet Ramius face-to-face.

The deception succeeds in convincing Soviet observers that &quot;Red October&quot; has been lost and the Soviet forces withdraw, but Tupolev stays behind. Unbeknownst to anyone, Igor Loginov, a cook on &quot;Red October&quot; who is actually an undercover GRU officer, has remained aboard after the other crewmen evacuated. He attempts to destroy &quot;Red October&quot; by exploding one of the submarine&#x27;s missiles in its silo. Loginov is discovered and fatally shoots Captain Lieutenant Kamarov and seriously wounds Ramius and Williams. Ryan tries to reason with Loginov, who refuses to listen and is eventually killed in a firefight in the submarine&#x27;s missile compartment.

Later, the &quot;V.K. Konovalov&quot; happens upon what is initially believed to be an submarine being escorted by two other submarines. Based on its acoustical signature, Tupolev realizes that it is in fact &quot;Red October,&quot; and proceeds to engage it. The two US submarines escorting &quot;Red October&quot; are prohibited from firing on &quot;Konovalov&quot; by rules of engagement, and &quot;Red October&quot; has no torpedomen on board. After a battle, Ramius sinks &quot;Konovalov&quot; by ramming it, killing Tupolev and his crew.

The Americans escort &quot;Red October&quot; safely into dry dock in Norfolk, Virginia, where it is analyzed by US military intelligence. Ramius and his crew are taken to a CIA safehouse and are given new identities, beginning their settlement into American life. Ryan is commended and debriefed by his superiors and returns to his posting in London.

==Characters==
===The Soviets===
* Captain First Rank Marko Aleksandrovich Ramius: Soviet submarine captain who commands the &quot;Red October&quot;, the Soviet Navy&#x27;s newest ballistic missile submarine. His decision to defect was spurred by personal factors. His wife, Natalia, had died at the hands of an intoxicated and incompetent doctor; however, the doctor escaped punishment because he was the son of a Politburo member. Natalia&#x27;s untimely death, combined with Ramius&#x27;s long-standing disillusionment with the callousness of Soviet rule and his fear of &quot;Red October&quot;″s destabilizing effect on world affairs, exhausts his tolerance for the failings of the Soviet system.
* Captain Second Rank Viktor Aleksievich Tupolev: Commanding officer of the attack submarine &quot;V. K. Konovalov&quot; and Ramius&#x27;s former student.
* Captain Second Rank Vasily Borodin: Executive officer of &quot;Red October&quot;

==Themes==
&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; introduced Tom Clancy&#x27;s writing style, which included technical details about weaponry, submarines, espionage, and the military. The accurate nature of Clancy&#x27;s writing was well known among the American military such that Clancy remarked in a 1986 interview: &quot;When I met Navy Secretary John Lehman last year, the first thing he asked me about the book was, &#x27;Who the hell cleared it?

The novel shares elements with James Clavell&#x27;s works, particularly &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1975) and &quot;Noble House&quot; (1981), where political power is used instead of physical confrontation with an enemy. Clancy portrays the Soviets, especially Captain Ramius, sympathetically, and most characters are understandable in their actions and fears, while at the same time comparing and contrasting their philosophies and values against their American counterparts, who in turn are shown as more competent in their profession, this being explained by the US Navy being better equipped and trained than the Soviet sailors who are mostly conscripts.

In the novel, the US and its service personnel are unmistakably the &quot;good guys&quot;. The central theme of the US being flawed, but ultimately a force for good and hope in the world is something the author would explore more in his later novels. However, unlike &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;, these later novels often include negative American characters, motivated by power or greed.

In addition, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; is considered a coming-of-age story regarding the main character Jack Ryan. However, instead of running away from responsibilities, a theme common in contemporary American literature, Clancy subverts the convention by having Ryan rushing toward the burdens of the adult world. Moreover, the book introduced Jack Ryan as a new archetype of the American hero – an everyman who uses his prior knowledge instead of physical power in solving a particular crisis.

==Development==
From a young age, Clancy was an avid reader of naval history and sea exploration. However, he was later rejected from serving in the military because of his poor eyesight. Since graduating from high school and eventually earning an English major, he had always wanted to write a novel. He eventually worked as an insurance agent for a small business owned by his then-wife&#x27;s family.

In his spare time, Clancy started working on &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; on November 11, 1982, and finished it four months later on February 23, 1983. Contrary to popular belief that Clancy had access to top-secret intelligence in researching for the novel, he consulted technical manuals, discussions with former submariners and books like Norman Polmar&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the Soviet Navy&quot; and &quot;Combat Fleets of the World&quot; in order to maintain accuracy in describing Soviet submarines.

He then submitted the first draft of the novel to the Naval Institute Press, where he previously wrote an article on the MX missile for their magazine &quot;Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute&quot;. Three weeks later, the publication company returned his manuscript, along with a request to cut about a hundred pages&#x27; worth of numerous technical details. After fixing his work, Clancy then sold &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; to the Naval Institute Press for a modest sum of $5,000.

Having recently decided to publish fiction, the publication company made Clancy&#x27;s work their first published novel. Editor Deborah Grosvenor later recalled convincing the publishers: &quot;I think we have a potential best-seller here, and if we don&#x27;t grab this thing, somebody else would.&quot; She believed Clancy had an &quot;innate storytelling ability, and his characters had this very witty dialogue&quot;.

== Theories about source of the story ==
* The 2005 book &quot;The Last Sentry: Valery Sablin and the True Hunt for Red October&quot; by Gregory D Young and Nate Braden suggests that the novel was based on the Soviet frigate Storozhevoy mutiny in 1975. While Clancy was researching the mutiny, he read Young&#x27;s master thesis about the incident. Clancy wrote to Young asking for a reference copy and permission to quote the thesis in the novel he was drafting. Clancy outlines &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; in considerable detail and concludes by asking Young for other reliable naval reference books.
* The 2020 Muse Entertainment documentary &quot;The Real Hunt for Red October&quot; claims that the story of Red October is based on the loss of Soviet submarine K-129, which was lost in 1968, and recovered by 1974&#x27;s Project Azorian.
* The 1976 defection of Viktor Belenko flying his MiG-25P &quot;Foxbat&quot; aircraft from the Soviet Union to Japan.

==Reception==
===Critical===
The book received critical acclaim, especially from the American government. U.S. President Ronald Reagan had pronounced the book, which was given to him as a Christmas gift, as &quot;the perfect yarn&quot; and &quot;unputdownable&quot;; his endorsement eventually boosted the novel&#x27;s sales and solidified Clancy&#x27;s reputation as a bestselling author. Regarding the reception, Clancy remarked: &quot;I was thunderstruck, dumbfounded, bowled over, amazed. But I wasn&#x27;t surprised.&quot; Many members of the White House were fans of the book.

&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; was also popular among the military. On a 1985 visit to , Clancy discovered 26 copies of the novel among the crew. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in its original review, praised the novel as &quot;the most satisfactory novel of a sea chase since C.S. Forester perfected the form.&quot;

===Commercial===
Due to an extensive marketing campaign by the Naval Institute Press for their first published work of fiction, which was initially aimed at the military, the book sold 45,000 copies by March 1985. Clancy said in a 1991 interview: &quot;I thought we&#x27;d sell maybe five thousand or ten thousand hardcovers and that would be the end of it. I never really thought about making money.&quot;

After Reagan&#x27;s endorsement, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; topped the national bestseller lists, particularly &quot;The New York Times&quot;. It eventually sold more than 365,000 copies in hardcover. After securing the paperback rights to Berkley Books for $49,500, the novel sold another 4.3 million copies.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

The novel was adapted as a feature film, which was released in the United States on March 2, 1990. Captain Marko Ramius was played by Sean Connery, while Alec Baldwin played Jack Ryan. It serves as the first entry in the Jack Ryan film series, which would later follow a chronological order differing from the novels. The movie is a nearly faithful depiction of the novel even though there are many deviations, including &quot;Red October&quot; traveling up the Penobscot River in Maine to dry dock, the omission of the Royal Navy task force including Ryan&#x27;s time aboard , and the &quot;caterpillar drive&quot; being described as a magnetohydrodynamic drive system, essentially, &quot;a jet engine for the water&quot;, rather than a drive powered by a series of mechanical impellers inside flow tunnels. Although in both the novel and movie, the caterpillar drive was supposed to be undetectably silent.

The film received mainly positive reviews from critics, holding an 88% rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 74 reviews. It was the sixth top-grossing film of the year, generating $122 million in North America and more than $200 million worldwide in box office. In a 1991 interview, Clancy remarked of the film&#x27;s success: &quot;It was reasonably true to the spirit of the book, although the movie had a lot of technical errors in it and some changes in the story which I do not think is necessary. But you have to remember that the printed word and visual representation on the screen are two different art forms and they have very different roles.&quot;

===Games===

The novel also became the basis for three computer, video, and console games. One version, a combination of a submarine simulator and strategy game, was released in 1987 and received positive reviews. Another game based on the movie was released in 1990. The console game was released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and later for the Game Boy and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In addition, a board game &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, published in 1988 by TSR, Inc. became one of the all time bestselling wargames.

In late 2015, River Horse announced it had acquired the rights and intended to crowdfund another game based on the intellectual property.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; popularized the book genre of techno-thriller into the mainstream. &quot;Tom Clancy defined an era, not just of thrillers but of pop culture in general,&quot; said Jon Land, an author and marketing chair for the International Thriller Writers. &quot;No one encapsulated the mindset and mentality of the Reagan era more, as the Cold War was heating up for the last time and we were entering a new age of modern warfare. Clancy&#x27;s books tapped into our fears and helped define our psyches, even as he reinvigorated the thriller genre by bringing millions of new readers into the fold.&quot;

On April 20, 2018, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; was included in the list of 100 most-loved books in the U.S., compiled by PBS as part of their new series and multi-platform initiative &quot;The Great American Read&quot;.

The book appeared in a fake commercial ad serving as a teaser trailer for the third season of the Netflix web television series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, which was released on July 16, 2018.
