<text>Lord of the Flies is the 1954 debut novel of British author William Golding. The plot concerns a group of British boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves. The novel&#x27;s themes include morality, leadership, and the tension between civility and chaos.

&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was generally well received, and is a popularly assigned book in schools.

== Background ==

Published in 1954, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was Golding&#x27;s first novel. Golding got the idea for the plot from &quot;The Coral Island&quot;, a children&#x27;s adventure novel with a focus on Christianity and the supposed civilising influence of British colonialism. Golding thought that the book was unrealistic, and asked his wife if it would be a good idea if he &quot;wrote a book about children on an island, children who behave in the way children really would behave?&quot;

The novel&#x27;s title is a literal translation of Beelzebub, a biblical demon considered the god of pride and warfare. Golding, who was a philosophy teacher before becoming a Royal Navy lieutenant, experienced war firsthand, and commanded a landing craft in the Normandy landings during D-Day in 1944. After the war ended and Golding returned to England, the world was dominated by Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation, which led Golding to examine the nature of humanity and went on to inspire &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.

&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was rejected by many publishers before being accepted by Faber &amp; Faber. An initial rejection labelled the book as &quot;absurd ... Rubbish &amp; dull&quot;. The book was originally titled &quot;Strangers from Within&quot;, which was considered &quot;too abstract and too explicit&quot; and was eventually changed to &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. 

Editor Charles Monteith worked with Golding on several major edits, including removing the entire first section which described an evacuation from nuclear war. The character of Simon was also heavily edited to remove an interaction with a mysterious figure who is implied to be God. Ultimately, Golding accepted the edits, and wrote that &quot;I&#x27;ve lost any kind of objectivity I ever had over this novel and can hardly bear to look at it.&quot; The edited manuscripts are available to view at the University of Exeter library.

== Plot ==

In the midst of a wartime evacuation, a British aeroplane crashes on an isolated island. The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood or preadolescence. A fair-haired boy named Ralph and a fat boy nicknamed Piggy find a conch shell, which Ralph uses as a horn to gather the survivors. Ralph immediately commands authority over the other boys using the conch, and is elected their &quot;chief&quot;. He establishes three goals for the boys: to have fun, to survive, and to constantly maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships. Ralph, a red-haired boy named Jack, and a quiet boy named Simon use Piggy&#x27;s glasses to create a signal fire.

The semblance of order deteriorates as the boys grow lazy and ignore Ralph&#x27;s efforts to improve life on the island. They become paranoid about an imaginary monster called &quot;the beast&quot;. Ralph fails to convince the boys that no beast exists, while Jack gains popularity by declaring that he will personally hunt and kill the monster. At one point, Jack takes the boys to hunt a wild pig, including the boys who were meant to watch the signal fire. The smoke signal goes out, failing to attract a ship that was passing by the island. Ralph angrily confronts Jack and considers relinquishing his role as leader, but is persuaded not to do so by Piggy. 

One night, an air battle occurs near the island and the body of a fighter pilot drifts down in a parachute. Twin boys Sam and Eric mistake the corpse for the beast. When Ralph and Jack investigate with another boy, Roger, they flee in terror, believing the beast is real. Jack tries to turn the others against Ralph, and goes off alone to form his own tribe, with most of the other boys gradually joining him. Jack and his followers set up an offering to the beast in the forest: a pig&#x27;s head, mounted on a sharpened stick and swarming with flies. Simon, who often ventures into the forest alone, has an imaginary dialogue with the head, which he dubs the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. The head tells Simon that there is no beast on the island, and predicts that the other boys will turn on Simon. That night, Ralph and Piggy visit Jack&#x27;s tribe, who have begun painting their faces and engaging in primitive ritual dances. When Simon realises that the beast is only a dead pilot, he rushes to tell Jack&#x27;s tribe, but the frenzied boys (including Ralph and Piggy) mistake Simon for the beast and beat him to death.

Jack and his tribe steal Piggy&#x27;s glasses, the only means of starting a fire. Ralph goes to Jack&#x27;s camp with Piggy, Sam, and Eric to confront him and retrieve the glasses. Roger drops a boulder that kills Piggy and shatters the conch. Ralph manages to escape, but Sam and Eric are forced to join Jack&#x27;s tribe. That night, Ralph secretly confronts Sam and Eric, who warn him that Jack plans to hunt him. The following morning, Jack&#x27;s tribe sets fire to the forest. Ralph narrowly escapes the boys and the fire, and finally falls in front of a uniformed adult – a British naval officer who has landed on the island to investigate the fire. Ralph, Jack, and the other boys erupt into sobs over the &quot;end of innocence&quot;. The officer expresses his disappointment at seeing the boys exhibiting such feral, warlike behavior, then turns, &quot;moved and a little embarrassed,&quot; to stare at his cruiser waiting offshore.

== Characters ==
=== Primary ===
*Ralph: The athletic and charismatic protagonist who is the boys&#x27; elected leader. He is often representative of order, civilisation, and productive leadership. At the beginning of the novel, Ralph sets out to build huts and thinks of ways to improve their chances of being rescued. Ralph&#x27;s influence over the boys is at first secure, but it declines as the boys defect to Jack and turn to savagery.
*Jack Merridew: The strong-willed antagonist who represents savagery, violence, and power. At the beginning of the novel, he is infuriated at losing the leadership election to Ralph. He then leads his tribe, consisting of a group of ex-choir boys, into the deep forest where they hunt pigs and turn into barbarians with painted faces. By the end of the novel, he uses the boys&#x27; fear of the beast to assert control over them.
*Simon: An innately spiritual boy who is often the voice of reason in the rivalry between Ralph and Jack.
*Piggy: Ralph&#x27;s intellectual and talkative friend who helps Ralph to become leader and is the source of many innovative ideas. He represents the rational side of humanity. Piggy&#x27;s asthma, weight and poor eyesight make him a target of scorn and violence. His real name is not given.
*Roger: An initially quiet boy who eventually becomes violent when Jack rises to power.

=== Secondary ===

* Sam and Eric: Twins, who are among Ralph&#x27;s few supporters at the end of the novel. Roger forces them to join Jack&#x27;s tribe.
* The Officer: A naval officer who rescues the surviving boys at the end of the novel. He does not understand the boys&#x27; warlike behaviour, despite commanding a warship himself.

== Themes ==
The novel&#x27;s major themes of morality, civility, leadership, and society all explore the duality of human nature. 

&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; portrays a scenario in which upper-class British children quickly descend into chaos and violence without adult authority, despite the boys&#x27; attempts to establish order and co-ordination. This subverts the colonial narration found in many British books of this period; for example, &quot;The Coral Island&quot;. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; contains various references to &quot;The Coral Island&quot;; for example, the rescuing naval officer describing the boys&#x27; misadventures as a &quot;jolly good show. Like the Coral Island.&quot; Golding&#x27;s three central characters, Ralph, Piggy, and Jack, can also be interpreted as caricatures of the protagonists in &quot;The Coral Island.&quot;

At an allegorical level, a central theme is how the desire for civilisation conflicts with the desire for power. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; also portrays the tension between groupthink and individuality, rational and emotional reactions, and morality and immorality. These themes have been explored in an essay by American literary critic Harold Bloom.

Some examples of symbolism in &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; are the signal fire, Piggy&#x27;s glasses, and the conch shell, which can be read as representing hope, reason, democracy and unity, among other interpretations.

The novel also examines aspects of war, as the story is set during a war that has begun before the boys arrive on the island. Although the location of the island is never stated, it is sometimes thought to be somewhere in the Pacific, but John Sutherland argues that a coral island in the Indian Ocean is intended, based on remarks by Jack that the plane had stopped off in &quot;Gib&quot; (Gibraltar) and &quot;Addis&quot; (Addis Ababa), presumably en route to a refuge in Western Australia. An early manuscript, entitled &quot;Strangers From Within&quot;, explicitly placed the island near New Guinea and Borneo.

=== Genre and style ===
As a tale of adventure and survival, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; fits the genre of romanticism. It also questions human morality, making it a work of philosophical fiction. The novel is styled as allegorical fiction, embodying the concepts of inherent human savagery, mob mentality, and totalitarian leadership. However, Golding deviates from typical allegory in that both the protagonists and the antagonists are fully developed, realistic characters.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===

Its first print run of 3,000 copies was slow to sell, but &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; went on to become very popular, with more than ten million copies sold as of 2015. E. M. Forster chose &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as his &quot;outstanding novel of the year&quot;, and it was described in one review as &quot;not only a first-rate adventure but a parable of our times&quot;. In February 1960, Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; rated &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; five stars out of five, stating, &quot;Golding paints a truly terrifying picture of the decay of a minuscule society ... Well on its way to becoming a modern classic&quot;. Marc D. Hauser called &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; &quot;riveting&quot; and said that it &quot;should be standard reading in biology, economics, psychology, and philosophy&quot;.

&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was included on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990–1999, for its controversial stance on human nature and individual welfare versus the common good. The book has been criticised as cynical for portraying humanity as inherently selfish and violent. It has been linked with the essay &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; by Garrett Hardin and with books by Ayn Rand and countered by &quot;Management of the Commons&quot; by Elinor Ostrom. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; has been contrasted with the Tongan castaways incident from 1965, when a group of schoolboys on a fishing boat from Tonga were marooned on an uninhabited island and considered dead by their relatives. The group not only managed to survive for over 15 months but &quot;had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination&quot;. When ship captain Peter Warner found them, they were in good health and spirits. The Dutch historian, Rutger Bregman, writing about the Tonga event, called Golding&#x27;s portrayal unrealistic.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 41 on the editor&#x27;s list and 25 on the reader&#x27;s list. In 2003, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was listed at number 70 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read, and in 2005 it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels since 1923. &quot;Time&quot; also included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.

Popular in schools, especially in the English-speaking world, a 2016 UK poll saw &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; ranked third in the nation&#x27;s favourite books from school, behind George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

In 2019, BBC News included &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

== In other media ==
=== Film ===
Three film adaptations were based on the book:
* &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (1963), directed by Peter Brook
* &quot;Alkitrang Dugo&quot; (1975), a Filipino film, directed by Lupita A. Concio
* &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (1990), directed by Harry Hook

A fourth adaptation, to feature an all-female cast, was announced by Warner Bros. in August 2017. Subsequently abandoned, it inspired the 2021 television series &quot;Yellowjackets&quot;. &quot;Ladyworld&quot;, an all-female adaptation, was released in 2018.

=== Television ===
In April 2023, the BBC announced that the British production company Eleven Film would produce the first ever television adaptation of the novel, written by screenwriter Jack Thorne.

=== Stage ===
The book was first adapted for the stage and performed in 1984 at Clifton College Preparatory School. It was adapted by Elliot Watkins, a teacher at the school, with the consent of Golding, who attended the opening night.

Nigel Williams wrote his own adaptation of the text for the stage some ten years later. It was debuted by the Royal Shakespeare Company in July 1995. The Pilot Theatre Company toured it extensively in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

In October 2014 it was announced that the 2011 production of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; would return to conclude the 2015 season at the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre ahead of a major UK tour. The production was to be directed by Timothy Sheader.

Kansas-based Orange Mouse Theatricals and Mathew Klickstein produced a topical, gender-bending adaptation called &quot;Ladies of the Fly&quot; that was co-written by a group of girls aged 8 to 16 based on the original text and their own lives. The production was performed by the girls as an immersive live-action show in August 2018.

=== Radio ===
In June 2013, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast a dramatisation by Judith Adams in four 30-minute episodes directed by Sasha Yevtushenko. The cast included Ruth Wilson as narrator, Finn Bennett as Ralph, Richard Linnel as Jack, Caspar Hilton-Hilley as Piggy, and Jack Caine as Simon.

=== Graphic novel ===
A graphic novel based of the book, adapted and illustrated by Aimée de Jongh, was published on 12 September 2024 in 35 countries. The Dutch version of the book was sold out in a day.

== Influence ==
===Literature===
Author Stephen King named his fictional town of Castle Rock after Jack&#x27;s mountain camp in &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. The book itself appears prominently in King&#x27;s novels &quot;Cujo&quot; (1981), &quot;Misery&quot; (1987) and &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; (1999). His novel &quot;It&quot; was influenced by Golding&#x27;s novel: &quot;I thought to myself I&#x27;d really like to write a story about what&#x27;s gained and what&#x27;s lost when you go from childhood to adulthood, and also, the things we experience in childhood that are like seeds that blossom later on.&quot; In 2011, King wrote an introduction for a new edition of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; to mark the centenary of Golding&#x27;s birth. King&#x27;s town of Castle Rock inspired the name of Rob Reiner&#x27;s production company, Castle Rock Entertainment.

Alan Garner credits the book with making him want to become a writer.

===Music===
Iron Maiden wrote a song inspired by the book, included in their 1995 album &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

The Camerawalls include a song titled &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;Pocket Guide to the Otherworld&quot;.

<doc id="31586" wikidata="Q552828" url="?curid=31586" title="Ty Cobb">
<text>Tyrus Raymond Cobb (December 18, 1886 – July 17, 1961), nicknamed &quot;the Georgia Peach&quot;, was an American professional baseball center fielder. A native of rural Narrows, Georgia, Cobb played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He spent 22 years with the Detroit Tigers and served as the team&#x27;s player-manager for the last six, and he finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1936, Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes (98.2%); no other player received a higher percentage of votes until Tom Seaver in 1992. In 1999, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; ranked Cobb third on its list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players.&quot;

Cobb is credited with setting 90 MLB records throughout his career. Cobb has won more batting titles than any other player, with 11 (or 12, depending on source). During his entire 24-year career, he hit .300 in a record 23 consecutive seasons, with the exception being his rookie season. He also hit .400 in three different seasons, a record he shares with three other players. Cobb has more five-hit games (14) than any other player in major league history. He also holds the career record for stealing home (54 times) and for stealing second base, third base, and home in succession (4 times), and as the youngest player ever to compile 4,000 hits and score 2,000 runs. His combined total of 4,065 runs scored and runs batted in (after adjusting for home runs) is still the highest ever produced by any major league player. Cobb also ranks first in games played by an outfielder in major league history (2,934). He retained many other records for almost a half century or more, including most career games played (3,035) and at bats (11,429 or 11,434 depending on source) until 1974 as well as the modern record for most career stolen bases (892) until 1977. He also had the most career hits until 1985 (4,189 or 4,191, depending on source) and most career runs until 2001. His .366 career batting average was officially listed as the highest-ever until 2024, when MLB decided to include Negro Leagues players in official statistics.

Cobb&#x27;s reputation, which includes a large college scholarship fund for Georgia residents financed by his early investments in Coca-Cola and General Motors, has been somewhat tarnished by allegations of racism and violence. These primarily stem from a couple of mostly discredited biographies that were released following his death. Cobb&#x27;s reputation as a violent man was exaggerated by his first biographer, sportswriter Al Stump, whose stories about Cobb have been proven as sensationalized and largely fictional. While he was known for often violent conflicts, he spoke favorably about black players joining the Major Leagues and was a well-known philanthropist.

==Early life==
Cobb was born in 1886 in Narrows, Georgia, a small, unincorporated rural community of farmers. He was the first of three children born to William Herschel Cobb (1863–1905) and Amanda Chitwood Cobb (1871–1936). Cobb&#x27;s father was a state senator.
When he was still an infant, his parents moved to the nearby town of Royston, where he grew up. By most accounts, he became fascinated with baseball as a child, and decided that he wanted to go professional one day; his father was vehemently opposed to this idea, but by his teenage years, he was trying out for area teams. He played his first years in organized baseball for the Royston Rompers, the semi-pro Royston Reds, and the Augusta Tourists of the South Atlantic League, who released him after only two days. He then tried out for the Anniston, Alabama-based Anniston Steelers of the semipro Tennessee–Alabama League, with his father&#x27;s stern admonition ringing in his ears: &quot;Don&#x27;t come home a failure!&quot; After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $50, Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written about his talents under different aliases to Grantland Rice, the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; sports editor. Eventually, Rice wrote a small note in the &quot;Journal&quot; that a &quot;young fellow named Cobb seems to be showing an unusual lot of talent.&quot; After about three months, Cobb returned to the Tourists and finished the season hitting .237 in 35 games. While with the Tourists he was mentored and coached by George Leidy, who emphasized pinpoint bunting and aggression on the basepaths. In August 1905, the management of the Tourists sold Cobb to the American League&#x27;s Detroit Tigers for $750 ().

On August 8, 1905, Cobb&#x27;s mother, Amanda, fatally shot his father, William, with a pistol that William had purchased for her. Court records indicate that William Cobb had suspected Amanda of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Amanda Cobb was charged with murder and released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Ty Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, &quot;I did it for my father. He never got to see me play ... but I knew he was watching me, and I never let him down.&quot;

Cobb was initiated into Freemasonry in 1907, earning the 32nd degree in 1912.

In 1911, Cobb moved to Detroit&#x27;s architecturally significant and now historically protected Woodbridge neighborhood, from which he would walk with his dogs to the ballpark prior to games. The Victorian duplex in which Cobb lived still stands.

==Professional career==

===Early years===
Three weeks after his mother killed his father, Cobb debuted in center field for the Detroit Tigers. On August 30, 1905, in his first major league at bat, he doubled off Jack Chesbro of the New York Highlanders. Chesbro had won 41 games the previous season. Cobb was 18 years old at the time, the youngest player in the league by almost a year. Although he hit only .240 in 41 games, he signed a $1,500 contract to play for the Tigers in 1905.

As a rookie, Cobb was subject to severe hazing by his veteran teammates, who were jealous of the young prospect. The players smashed his homemade bats, nailed his cleats in the clubhouse, doused his clothes before tying knots in them, and verbally abused him. Cobb later attributed his hostile temperament to this experience: &quot;These old-timers turned me into a snarling wildcat.&quot; Tigers manager Hughie Jennings later acknowledged that Cobb was targeted for abuse by veteran players, some of whom sought to force him off the team. &quot;I let this go for a while because I wanted to satisfy myself that Cobb has as much guts as I thought in the very beginning,&quot; Jennings recalled. &quot;Well, he proved it to me, and I told the other players to let him alone. He is going to be a great baseball player and I won&#x27;t allow him to be driven off this club.&quot;
The following year, 1906, Cobb became the Tigers&#x27; full-time center fielder and hit .316 in 98 games, setting a record for the highest batting average (minimum 310 plate appearances) for a 19-year-old (later bested by Mel Ott&#x27;s .322 average in 124 games for the 1928 New York Giants). He never hit below that mark again. After being moved to right field, he led the Tigers to three consecutive American League pennants in 1907, 1908 and 1909. Detroit would lose each World Series (to the Cubs twice and then the Pirates); however, Cobb&#x27;s postseason numbers were far below his career standard. Cobb did not get another opportunity to play on a pennant-winning team.

In 1907, Cobb reached first and then stole second, third and home. He accomplished the feat four times during his career, still an MLB record as of 2022. He finished the 1907 season with a league-leading .350 batting average, 212 hits, 49 steals and 119 runs batted in (RBI). At age 20, he was the youngest player to win a batting championship and held this record until 1955, when fellow Detroit Tiger Al Kaline won the batting title while twelve days younger than Cobb had been. Reflecting on his career in 1930, two years after retiring, he told Grantland Rice, &quot;The biggest thrill I ever got came in a game against the Athletics in 1907 [on September 30]... The Athletics had us beaten, with Rube Waddell pitching. They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning, when I happened to hit a home run that tied the score. This game went 17 innings to a tie, and a few days later, we clinched our first pennant. You can understand what it meant for a 20-year-old country boy to hit a home run off the great Rube, in a pennant-winning game with two outs in the ninth.&quot;

Despite great success on the field, Cobb was no stranger to controversy off it. As described in &quot;Smithsonian&quot;, &quot;In 1907 during spring training in Augusta, Georgia, a black groundskeeper named Bungy Cummings, whom Cobb had known for years, attempted to shake Cobb&#x27;s hand or pat him on the shoulder.&quot; The &quot;overly familiar greeting infuriated&quot; Cobb, who attacked Cummings. When Cummings&#x27; wife tried to defend him, Cobb allegedly choked her. The assault was only stopped when catcher Charles &quot;Boss&quot; Schmidt knocked Cobb out. However, aside from Schmidt&#x27;s statement to the press, no other corroborating witnesses to the assault on Cummings ever came forward and Cummings himself never made a public comment about it. Author Charles Leerhsen speculates that the assault on Cummings and his wife never occurred and that it was a total fabrication by Schmidt. Cobb had spent the previous year defending himself on several occasions from assaults by Schmidt, with Schmidt often coming out of nowhere to blindside Cobb. On that day, several reporters did see Cummings, who appeared to be &quot;partially under the influence of liquor,&quot; approach Cobb and shout &quot;Hello, Carrie!&quot; (the meaning of which is unknown) and go in for a hug. Cobb then pushed him away, which was the last interaction that anyone saw between Cobb and Cummings. Shortly thereafter, hearing a fight, several reporters came running and found Cobb and Schmidt wrestling on the ground. When the fight was broken up and Cobb had walked away, Schmidt remained behind and told the reporters that he saw Cobb assaulting Cummings and his wife and had intervened. Leerhsen speculates that this was just another one of Schmidt&#x27;s assaults on Cobb and that once discovered, Schmidt made up a story that made him sound like he had assaulted Cobb for a noble purpose. In 1908, Cobb attacked a black laborer in Detroit who complained when Cobb stepped into freshly poured asphalt; Cobb was found guilty of battery, but the sentence was suspended.

In September 1907, Cobb began a relationship with The Coca-Cola Company that lasted the remainder of his life. By the time he died, he held over 20,000 shares of stock and owned bottling plants in Santa Maria, California, Twin Falls, Idaho, and Bend, Oregon. He was also a celebrity spokesman for the product. In the offseason between 1907 and 1908, Cobb negotiated with Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina, offering to coach baseball there &quot;for $250 a month, provided that he did not sign with Detroit that season.&quot; This did not come to pass, however.

The following season, the Tigers finished ahead of the Chicago White Sox for the pennant. Cobb again won the batting title with a .324 average, but Detroit suffered another loss in the World Series. In August 1908, Cobb married Charlotte (&quot;Charlie&quot;) Marion Lombard, the daughter of prominent Augustan Roswell Lombard. In the offseason, the couple lived on her father&#x27;s Augusta estate, &quot;The Oaks&quot;, until they moved into their own house on Williams Street in November 1913.
The Tigers won the AL pennant again in 1909. During that World Series, Cobb&#x27;s last, he stole home in the second game, igniting a three-run rally, but that was the high point for him, finishing with a lowly .231, as the Tigers lost to Honus Wagner and the powerful Pirates in seven games. Although he performed poorly in the postseason, he won the Triple Crown by hitting .377 with 107 RBI and nine home runs, all inside the park, thus becoming the only player of the modern era to lead his league in home runs in a season without hitting a ball over the fence.

In the same season, Charles M. Conlon snapped the famous photograph of a grimacing Cobb sliding into third base amid a cloud of dirt, which visually captured the grit and ferocity of his playing style.

===1910: Chalmers Award controversy===

Going into the final days of the 1910 season, Cobb had a .004 lead on Nap Lajoie for the American League batting title. The prize for the winner of the title was a Chalmers automobile. Cobb sat out the final two games to preserve his average. Lajoie hit safely eight times in a doubleheader but six of those hits were bunt singles. Later it was rumored that the opposing manager had instructed his third baseman to play extra deep to allow Lajoie to win the batting race over the generally disliked Cobb. Although Cobb was credited with a higher batting average, it was later discovered in the 1970s that one game had been counted twice so that Cobb actually lost to Lajoie. As a result of the incident, AL president Ban Johnson was forced to arbitrate the situation. He declared Cobb the rightful owner of the title, but car company president Hugh Chalmers chose to award one to both Cobb and Lajoie.

===1911–1914===
Cobb regarded baseball as &quot;something like a war,&quot; future Tiger second baseman Charlie Gehringer said. &quot;Every time at bat for him was a crusade.&quot; Baseball historian John Thorn said in the book &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;, &quot;He is testament to how far you can get simply through will. ... Cobb was pursued by demons.&quot;

Cobb was having a tremendous year in 1911, which included a 40-game hitting streak. Still, &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson led him by .009 points in the batting race late in the season. Near the end of the season, Cobb&#x27;s Tigers had a long series against Jackson&#x27;s Cleveland Naps. Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly both on and off the field. Cobb used that friendship to his advantage. Cobb ignored Jackson when Jackson tried to say anything to him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily back at him, making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to &quot;fall off&quot; to a final average of .408, twelve points lower than Cobb&#x27;s .420, a 20th-century record which stood until George Sisler tied it and Rogers Hornsby surpassed it with .424, the record since then (until 2024) except for Hugh Duffy&#x27;s .438 in the 19th century.

Cobb led the AL that year in numerous other categories, including 248 hits, 147 runs scored, 127 RBI, 83 stolen bases, 47 doubles, 24 triples and a .621 slugging percentage. Cobb hit eight home runs but finished second in that category to Frank Baker, who hit eleven. He was awarded another Chalmers car, this time for being voted the AL MVP by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.
On May 12, 1911, playing against the New York Highlanders, he scored from first base on a single to right field, then scored another run from second base on a wild pitch. In the seventh inning, he tied the game with a two-run double. The Highlanders catcher vehemently argued the safe call at second base with the umpire in question, going on at such length that the other Highlanders infielders gathered nearby to watch. Realizing that no one on the Highlanders had called time, Cobb strolled unobserved to third base and then casually walked towards home plate as if to get a better view of the argument. He then suddenly broke into a run and slid into home plate for the eventual winning run. It was performances like this that led Branch Rickey to say later that Cobb &quot;had brains in his feet.&quot;

Describing his gameplay strategy in 1930, he said, &quot;My system was all offense. I believed in putting up a mental hazard for the other fellow. If we were five or six runs ahead, I&#x27;d try some wild play, such as going from first to home on a single. This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on. I worked out all the angles I could think of, to keep them guessing and hurrying.&quot; In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies, he was able to surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.

On May 15, 1912, Cobb assaulted a heckler, Claude Lucker (often misspelled as Lueker), in the stands in New York&#x27;s Hilltop Park where the Tigers were playing the Highlanders. Lucker, described by baseball historian Frank Russo as &quot;a Tammany Hall lackey and two-bit punk,&quot; often berated Cobb when Detroit visited New York. In this game, the two traded insults through the first couple of innings. Cobb at one point went to the Highlander dugout to look for the Highlanders&#x27; owner to try to have Lucker ejected from the game, but his search was in vain. He also asked for the police to intervene, but they refused. The situation climaxed when Lucker allegedly called Cobb a &quot;half-nigger.&quot; Cobb, in his discussion of the incident in the Holmes biography, avoided such explicit words but alluded to Lucker&#x27;s epithet by saying he was &quot;reflecting on my mother&#x27;s color and morals.&quot; He went on to state that he warned Highlander manager Harry Wolverton that if something was not done about that man, there would be trouble. No action was taken. At the end of the sixth inning, after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lucker, who it turned out was handicapped (he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand in an industrial accident). Some onlookers shouted at him to stop because the man had no hands, to which Cobb reportedly retorted, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if he got no feet!&quot; According to Russo, the crowd cheered Cobb on in the fight. Though extremely rare in the 21st century, attacking fans was not so unusual an activity in the early years of baseball. Other notable baseball stars who assaulted heckling fans include Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Rube Waddell, Kid Gleason, Sherry Magee, and Fred Clarke.
The league suspended him. His teammates, though not fond of Cobb, went on strike to protest the suspension, and the lack of protection of players from abusive fans, before the May 18 game in Philadelphia. For that one game, Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of hastily recruited college and sandlot players plus two Tiger coaches and lost 24–2, thereby setting some of Major League Baseball&#x27;s modern-era (post-1900) negative records, notably the 26 hits in a nine-inning game allowed by Allan Travers, who pitched one of the sport&#x27;s most unlikely complete games. The pre-1901 record for the most hits and runs given up in a game is held by the Cleveland Blues&#x27; Dave Rowe. Primarily an outfielder, Rowe pitched a complete game on July 24, 1882, giving up 35 runs on 29 hits. The current post-1900 record for most hits in a nine-inning game is 31, set in 1992 by the Milwaukee Brewers against Toronto; however, the Blue Jays used six pitchers.

The strike ended when Cobb urged his teammates to return to the field. According to him, this incident led to the formation of a players&#x27; union, the &quot;Ballplayers&#x27; Fraternity&quot; (formally, the Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America), an early version of what is now called the Major League Baseball Players Association, which garnered some concessions from the owners.

During his career, Cobb was involved in numerous other fights, both on and off the field, and several profanity-laced shouting matches. For example, Cobb and umpire Billy Evans arranged to settle their in-game differences through fisticuffs under the grandstand after the game. Members of both teams were spectators, and broke up the scuffle after Cobb had knocked Evans down, pinned him and began choking him. In 1909, Cobb was arrested for assault for an incident that occurred in a Cleveland hotel. Cobb got into an argument with the elevator operator around 2:15 a.m. when the man refused to take him to the floor where some of his teammates were having a card game. The elevator operator stated that he could only take Cobb to the floor where his room was. As the argument escalated, a night watchman approached and he and Cobb eventually got into a physical confrontation. During the fight, Cobb produced a penknife and slashed the watchman across the hand. Cobb later claimed that the watchman, who had the upper hand in the fight, had his finger in Cobb&#x27;s left eye and that Cobb was worried he was going to have his sight ruined. The fight finally ended when the watchman produced a gun and struck Cobb several times in the head, knocking him out. Cobb would later plead guilty to simple assault and pay a $100 fine. This incident has often been retold with the elevator operator and the watchman both being black. However, recent scholarship has shown that all parties involved were white.

On August 13, 1912, the same day the Tigers were to play the New York Highlanders at Hilltop Park, Cobb and his wife were driving to a train station in Syracuse that was to transport him to the game when three intoxicated men had stopped him on the way. When Cobb had gotten out of the car to confront the men, they had asked for money and instigated a physical fight, with Cobb defending himself from one of the men by punching him in the chin as another had fled the scene. After being grabbed by the neck by another man, the man had pulled a knife and stabbed him in the back before he forced him away and returned to his car to continue driving to the station for the game. Cobb refused to speak any further of the issue. He would go on to hit 2–3 with two singles and a run scored, as well as batting .418. The Tigers lost 2–3.

In 1913, Cobb signed a contract worth $12,000 for the six-month season (), making him likely the first baseball player in history to be paid a five-figure salary. This occurred in the same year where Cobb had allegedly grown pessimistic and was quoted as saying: &quot;It seems I am a burden to the Detroit club, as a trespasser of its rules. If that be the case, let Mr. Navin put a price on me and I&#x27;ll take a chance on being able to negotiate my own release. I don&#x27;t think I shall ever play ball again. This is positively my last statement in this matter.&quot; This attributed statement was first published on an April 19, 1913, edition of the Los Angeles Herald. Cobb did not play that day as the Tigers won 4–0 against the St. Louis Browns.

In June 1914, Cobb pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace after pulling a revolver during an argument at a Detroit butcher shop. He was fined $50 ().

===1915–1921===
In 1915, Cobb set the single-season record for stolen bases with 96, which stood until Dodger Maury Wills broke it in 1962. That year, he also won his ninth consecutive batting title, hitting .369.

During 1917 spring training, Cobb showed up late for a Dallas spring training doubleheader against the New York Giants because of a golf outing. Several of the Giants, including Buck Herzog, called him names from the bench. Cobb retaliated by spiking Herzog during the second game, prompting a bench-clearing brawl in which Cobb ground Herzog&#x27;s face in the dirt. The Dallas Police Department had to help stop the brawl, and Cobb was thrown out of the game. Both teams were staying at the Oriental Hotel, and at dinner that evening, Herzog walked up to Cobb and challenged him to a fight. The two met an hour later in Cobb&#x27;s room, where the Tiger outfielder had prepared for the fight by moving furniture out of the way and pouring water on the floor. Cobb&#x27;s leather-soled shoes enabled him to get better footing than Herzog, who wore tennis shoes. The fight lasted for thirty minutes, over the course of which Cobb knocked down Herzog about six times while Herzog only knocked Cobb down once. The scuffle left Herzog&#x27;s face bloodied and his eyes nearly shut. With Herzog vowing revenge, Cobb skipped the rest of the exhibition series against the Giants, heading to Cincinnati to train with the Reds, who were managed by Cobb&#x27;s friend Christy Mathewson. However, Cobb later expressed the deepest respect for Herzog because of the way the infielder had conducted himself in the fight.

In 1917, Cobb hit in 35 consecutive games, still the only player with two 35-game hitting streaks (including his 40-game streak in 1911). He had six hitting streaks of at least 20 games in his career, second only to Pete Rose&#x27;s eight.

Also in 1917, Cobb starred in the motion picture &quot;Somewhere in Georgia&quot; for a sum of $25,000 plus expenses (equivalent to approximately $ today). Based on a story by sports columnist Grantland Rice, the film casts Cobb as &quot;himself,&quot; a small-town Georgia bank clerk with a talent for baseball. Broadway critic Ward Morehouse called the movie &quot;absolutely the worst flicker I ever saw, pure hokum.&quot;

In October 1918, Cobb enlisted in the Chemical Corps branch of the United States Army and was sent to the Allied Expeditionary Forces headquarters in Chaumont, France. He served approximately 67 days overseas before being honorably discharged and returning to the United States. He was given the rank of captain underneath the command of Major Branch Rickey, the president of the St. Louis Cardinals. Other baseball players serving in this unit included Captain Christy Mathewson and Lieutenant George Sisler. All of these men were assigned to the Gas and Flame Division, where they trained soldiers in preparation for chemical attacks by exposing them to gas chambers in a controlled environment, which eventually caused Mathewson to contract the tuberculosis that killed him on the eve of the 1925 World Series.

On August 19, 1921, in the second game of a doubleheader against Elmer Myers of the Boston Red Sox, Cobb collected his 3,000th hit. Aged 34 at the time, he is still the youngest ballplayer to reach that milestone, and in the fewest at-bats (8,093).

By 1920, Babe Ruth, sold to the renamed New York Yankees from the Boston Red Sox, had established himself as a power hitter, something Cobb was not considered to be. When his Tigers showed up in New York to play the Yankees for the first time that season, writers billed it as a showdown between two stars of competing styles of play. Ruth hit two homers, a triple, and two singles during the series, compared to Cobb&#x27;s two hits of a double and a single.

As Ruth&#x27;s popularity grew, Cobb became increasingly hostile toward him. He saw the Babe not only as a threat to his style of play, but also to his style of life. Perhaps what angered him the most about Ruth was that despite Babe&#x27;s total disregard for his physical condition and traditional baseball, he was still an overwhelming success and brought fans to the ballparks in record numbers to see him challenge his own slugging records.

On May 5, 1925, Cobb told a reporter that, for the first time in his career, he was going to try to hit home runs, saying he wanted to show that he could hit home runs but simply chose not to. That day, he went 6 for 6, with two singles, a double and three homers. The 16 total bases set a new AL record, which stood until May 8, 2012, when Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers hit four home runs and a double for a total of 18 bases. The next day Cobb had three more hits, two of which were home runs. The single his first time up gave him nine consecutive hits over three games, while his five homers in two games tied the record set by Cap Anson of the old Chicago NL team in 1884. By the end of the series Cobb had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases, and afterwards reverted to his old playing style. Even so, when asked in 1930 by Grantland Rice to name the best hitter he&#x27;d ever seen, Cobb answered, &quot;You can&#x27;t beat the Babe. Ruth is one of the few who can take a terrific swing and still meet the ball solidly. His timing is perfect. [No one has] the combined power and eye of Ruth.&quot;

===Cobb as player/manager===

Tigers owner Frank Navin tapped Cobb to take over for Hughie Jennings as manager for the 1921 season, a deal he signed on his 34th birthday for $32,500 (equivalent to approximately $ in today&#x27;s terms). The signing surprised the baseball world. Although Cobb was a legendary player, he was disliked throughout the baseball community, even by his own teammates.

The closest Cobb came to winning another pennant was in 1924, when the Tigers finished in third place, six games behind the pennant-winning Washington Senators. The Tigers had also finished third in 1922, but 16 games behind the Yankees. Cobb blamed his lackluster managerial record (479 wins against 444 losses) on Navin, who was arguably even more frugal than he was, passing up several quality players Cobb wanted to add to the team. In fact, he had saved money by hiring Cobb to both play and manage.

In 1922, Cobb tied a batting record set by Wee Willie Keeler, with four five-hit games in a season. This has since been matched by Stan Musial, Tony Gwynn and Ichiro Suzuki. On May 10, 1924, Cobb was honored at ceremonies before a game in Washington, D.C., by more than 100 dignitaries and legislators. He received 21 books, one for each year in professional baseball.

At the end of 1925, Cobb was again embroiled in a batting title race, this time with one of his teammates and players, Harry Heilmann. In a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns on October 4, 1925, Heilmann got six hits to lead the Tigers to a sweep of the doubleheader and beat Cobb for the batting crown, .393 to .389. Cobb and Browns player-manager George Sisler each pitched in the final game, Cobb pitching a perfect inning.
====Managerial record====
===Move to Philadelphia===
Cobb announced his retirement after a 22-year career as a Tiger in November 1926, and headed home to Augusta, Georgia. Shortly thereafter, Tris Speaker also retired as player-manager of the Cleveland Indians. The retirement of two great players at the same time sparked some interest, and it turned out that the two were coerced into retirement because of allegations of game-fixing brought about by Dutch Leonard, a former pitcher managed by Cobb.
Leonard accused former pitcher and outfielder Smoky Joe Wood and Cobb of betting on a Tigers–Indians game played in Detroit on September 25, 1919, in which they allegedly orchestrated a Tigers victory to win the bet. Leonard claimed proof existed in letters written to him by Cobb and Wood. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis held a secret hearing with Cobb, Speaker and Wood. A second secret meeting among the AL directors led to the unpublicized resignations of Cobb and Speaker; however, rumors of the scandal led Judge Landis to hold additional hearings in which Leonard refused to participate. Cobb and Wood admitted to writing the letters, but claimed that a horse-racing bet was involved and that Leonard&#x27;s accusations were in retaliation for Cobb&#x27;s having released him from the Tigers, thereby demoting him to the minor leagues. Speaker denied any wrongdoing.

On January 27, 1927, Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any wrongdoing because of Leonard&#x27;s refusal to appear at the hearings. Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker to return to their original teams, but each team let them know that they were free agents and could sign with any club they wanted. Speaker signed with the Washington Senators for 1927, and Cobb with the Philadelphia Athletics. Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season. Cobb said he had come back only to seek vindication and say he left baseball on his own terms.

Cobb played regularly in 1927 for a young and talented team that finished second to one of the greatest teams of all time, the 110–44 1927 Yankees, returning to Detroit to a tumultuous welcome on May 10 and doubling his first time up to the cheers of Tigers fans. On July 18, Cobb became the first member of the 4,000 hit club when he doubled off former teammate Sam Gibson, still pitching for the Tigers, at Navin Field.

Cobb returned for the 1928 season but played less frequently due to his age and the blossoming abilities of the young A&#x27;s, who were again in a pennant race with the Yankees. On September 3, Ty Cobb pinch-hit in the ninth inning of the first game of a doubleheader against the Senators and doubled off Bump Hadley for his last career hit, although his final at-bats were not until September 11 against the Yankees, when he popped out off Hank Johnson and grounded out to shortstop Mark Koenig. He then announced his retirement, effective the end of the season, after batting .300 or higher in 23 consecutive seasons (the only season under .300 being his rookie season), a major league record that is unlikely to be broken. Despite not being known as a slugger, he led the AL in slugging percentage eight times in his 11 seasons from 1907 to 1917.

He also ended his career with a rather dubious record. When Cobb retired, he led AL outfielders for most errors all-time with 271, which still stands today. Nineteenth-century player Tom Brown holds the major league record with 490 errors committed as an outfielder, while the National League record is held by 19th-century player George Gore with 346 errors. Cobb ranks 14th on the all-time list for errors committed by an outfielder.

==Post-playing career==
Cobb retired a wealthy and successful man. He toured Europe with his family, went to Scotland for some time and then returned to his farm in Georgia. He spent his retirement pursuing his off-season avocations of hunting, golfing, polo, and fishing. His other pastime was trading stocks and bonds, increasing his immense personal wealth. He was a major stockholder in the Coca-Cola Corporation, which by itself would have made him wealthy.

In the winter of 1930, Cobb moved into a Spanish ranch estate on Spencer Lane in the affluent town of Atherton located south of San Francisco, California, on the San Francisco Peninsula. At the same time, his wife Charlie filed the first of several divorce suits but withdrew the suit shortly thereafter. The couple eventually divorced in 1947 after 39 years of marriage, the last few years of which Cobb&#x27;s wife lived in nearby Menlo Park. The couple had three sons and two daughters: Tyrus Raymond Jr, Shirley Marion, Herschel Roswell, James Howell, and Beverly.

Cobb&#x27;s children found him to be demanding, yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth. He expected his sons to be exceptional athletes in general and baseball players in particular. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. flunked out of Princeton (where he had played on the varsity tennis team), much to his father&#x27;s dismay. The elder Cobb traveled to the Princeton campus and beat his son with a whip to ensure against future academic failure. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. then entered Yale University and became captain of the tennis team while improving his academics, but was then arrested twice in 1930 for drunkenness and left Yale without graduating. Cobb helped his son deal with his pending legal problems, but then permanently broke off with him. Even though Tyrus Raymond, Jr. finally reformed and eventually earned an M.D. from the Medical College of South Carolina and practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Dublin, Georgia, until his death at 42 on September 9, 1952, from a brain tumor, his father remained distant.

In February 1936, when the first Baseball Hall of Fame election results were announced, Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson, the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected that first year. His 98.2% stood as the record until Tom Seaver received 98.8% of the vote in 1992. Those results show that although many people disliked him personally, they respected the way he had played and what he had accomplished. In 1998, &quot;Sporting News&quot; ranked him as third on the list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

Of major league stars of the 1940s and 1950s, Cobb had positive things to say about Stan Musial, Phil Rizzuto, and Jackie Robinson, but few others. Even so, he was known to help out young players. He was instrumental in helping Joe DiMaggio negotiate his rookie contract with the New York Yankees.

According to sportswriter Grantland Rice, he and Cobb were returning from the Masters golf tournament in the late 1940s and stopped at a Greenville, South Carolina, liquor store. Cobb noticed that the man behind the counter was &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the Black Sox scandal. Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and after making his purchase an incredulous Cobb asked, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know me, Joe?&quot; &quot;Sure, I know you, Ty&quot; replied Jackson, &quot;but I wasn&#x27;t sure you wanted to know me. A lot of them don&#x27;t.&quot;

Cobb was mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

===Later life===

In 1949, at the age of 62, Cobb married a second time, to 40-year-old Frances Fairbairn Cass, a divorcée from Buffalo, New York. Their childless marriage ending with a divorce in 1956. At this time, Cobb became generous with his wealth, donating $100,000 in his parents&#x27; name for his hometown to build a modern 24-bed hospital, Cobb Memorial Hospital, which is now part of the Ty Cobb Healthcare System. He also established the Cobb Educational Fund, which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college, by endowing it with a $100,000 donation in 1953 (equivalent to approximately $ in current year dollars ).

Cobb knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both set the record straight on him and teach young players how to play. John McCallum spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography titled &quot;The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb&quot; that was published in 1956. In December 1959, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and Bright&#x27;s disease.

It was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography, &quot;My Life in Baseball: The True Record&quot;, with writer Al Stump. Cobb retained editorial control over the book and the published version presented him in a positive light. Stump said that the collaboration was contentious, and after Cobb&#x27;s death Stump published two more books and a short story giving what he said was the &quot;true story.&quot; One of these later books was used as the basis for the 1994 film &quot;Cobb&quot; (a box office flop starring Tommy Lee Jones as Cobb and directed by Ron Shelton). In 2010, an article by William R. &quot;Ron&quot; Cobb (no relation) in the peer-reviewed &quot;The National Pastime&quot; (the official publication of the Society for American Baseball Research) accused Stump of extensive forgeries of Cobb-related documents and diaries. The article further accused Stump of numerous false statements about Cobb in his last years, most of which were sensationalistic in nature and intended to cast Cobb in an unflattering light.

===Death===
In his last days, Cobb spent some time with the old movie comedian Joe E. Brown, talking about the choices he had made in his life. According to Brown, Cobb said he felt that he had made mistakes and that he would do things differently if he could. He had played hard and lived hard all his life, had no friends to show for it at the end, and regretted it. Publicly, however, he claimed to have no regrets: &quot;I&#x27;ve been lucky. I have no right to be regretful of what I did.&quot;

He was taken to Emory University Hospital for the last time in June 1961 after falling into a diabetic coma. His first wife Charlie, his son Jimmy, and other family members came to be with him for his final days. He died there on July 17, 1961, at age 74.

Approximately 150 friends and relatives attended a brief service in Cornelia, Georgia, and drove to the Cobb family mausoleum in Royston for the burial. Cobb&#x27;s family kept the event private, not trusting the media to report accurately on it. Baseball&#x27;s only representatives at his funeral were three old-time players, Ray Schalk, Mickey Cochrane, and Nap Rucker, and Sid Keener, the director of the Baseball Hall of Fame, but messages of condolence numbered in the hundreds and included notes from Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams. Family in attendance included Cobb&#x27;s former wife Charlie, his two daughters, his surviving son Jimmy, his two sons-in-law, his daughter-in-law Mary Dunn Cobb and her two children.

At the time of his death, Cobb&#x27;s estate was reported to be worth at least $11.78 million (equivalent to $ today), including $10 million worth of General Motors stock and $1.78 million in The Coca-Cola Company stock. His will left a quarter of his estate to the Cobb Educational Fund, and distributed the rest among his children and grandchildren. Cobb is interred in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Royston, Georgia. As of April 2021, the Ty Cobb Educational Foundation has distributed $19.2 million in college scholarships to needy college bound Georgia students.

==Legacy==


The historian Steven Elliott Tripp has explored the public&#x27;s reaction to Cobb as a pioneer sports celebrity and &quot;a player fans loved to hate.&quot; Tripp writes that Cobb was both loved and hated as a representative of a particular kind of masculinity on the field, inviting male spectators to participate in the contest through taunts directed at opposing players. Cobb&#x27;s own sense of manhood, according to Tripp, was a product of his Southern upbringing that prized individualism, excitement, and family honor. Russo wrote, &quot;There is no denying that Cobb ranks as one of baseball&#x27;s greatest players, if not the game&#x27;s fiercest competitor.&quot; Many of baseball&#x27;s greatest players were friends with Cobb. Mathewson and Walter Johnson were some of his closest friends. Others included Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Home Run Baker, and Eddie Collins. Following his retirement, Cobb even befriended one of his greatest rivals, Babe Ruth, whose wife Claire was from Georgia.

Cobb has been judged by some historians and journalists as the best player of the dead-ball era, and is generally seen as one of the greatest players of all time.

Some historians, including Wesley Fricks, Dan Holmes, and Charles Leerhsen, have defended Cobb against unfair portrayals of him in popular culture since his death. A noted case is the book written by sportswriter Al Stump in the months after Cobb died in 1961. Stump was later discredited when it became known that he had stolen items belonging to Cobb and also betrayed the access Cobb gave him in his final months. As a result of the movie &quot;Cobb&quot;, which starred Tommy Lee Jones, there are many myths surrounding Cobb&#x27;s life, including one that he sharpened his spikes to inflict wounds on opposing players. This accusation was common for many decades before the movie was released.

Writing in &quot;The Journal of American Culture&quot;, Hunter M. Hampton says that Leerhsen &quot;succeeds in debunking the myth of Cobb that Stump created, but he spawned a new myth by conflating Stump&#x27;s shortcomings to depict Cobb as an egalitarian.&quot;

In 1977, a statue of Ty Cobb, designed by the sculptor Felix de Weldon, was installed outside the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. It would later be relocated to the front of the public library in his hometown of Royston in 2017.

===Views on race===
Five years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, Cobb publicly supported blacks and whites playing baseball together, adding: &quot;Certainly it is okay for them to play. I see no reason in the world why we shouldn&#x27;t compete with colored athletes as long as they conduct themselves with politeness and gentility. Let me say also that no white man has the right to be less of a gentleman than a colored man; in my book that goes not only for baseball but in all walks of life.&quot; Using even stronger language, Cobb told the &quot;Sporting News&quot; in 1952 that &quot;the Negro should be accepted and not grudgingly but wholeheartedly.&quot; 

In 1953, black newspapers cited his praise for Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; catcher Roy Campanella, who Cobb said was &quot;among the all-time best catchers&quot; in the sport. Following Campanella&#x27;s accident that left him paralyzed, the Dodgers staged a tribute game where tens of thousands of spectators silently held lit matches above their heads. Cobb wrote the Dodgers owner to show appreciation &quot;for what you did for this fine man.&quot; Cobb also stated that Willie Mays was the &quot;only player I&#x27;d pay money to see.&quot; In the obituaries that ran in the black press following Cobb&#x27;s death, he was praised for &quot;[speaking] in favor of racial freedom in baseball.&quot;

Leerhesen also notes Cobb was the &quot;main defender and patron&quot; of Ulysses Simon Harrison, an African-American youth who was the Tigers&#x27; mascot from 1908 to 1910 under the name &quot;L&#x27;il Rastus&quot;. &quot;Rastus&quot; was then understood as the name of a stereotypical foolish, carefree or ignorant black man. Cobb, unlike most players, did not rub the boy&#x27;s head for good luck. Cobb took a protective attitude towards Harrison when the team was traveling in racially-segregated areas, and also employed him during the off-season at Cobb&#x27;s automobile dealership. As an adult, Harrison worked as a chauffeur for construction executive F. H. Goddard, a job he might have secured with Cobb&#x27;s assistance.

==Rivalry with Sam Crawford==
Sam Crawford and Ty Cobb were teammates for parts of thirteen seasons. They played beside each other in right and center field, and Crawford followed Cobb in the batting order year after year. Despite the physical closeness, the two had a complicated relationship.

Initially, they had a student-teacher relationship. Crawford was an established star when Cobb arrived, and Cobb eagerly sought his advice. The student–teacher relationship gradually changed to one of jealous rivals. Cobb was not popular with his teammates, and as Cobb became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given to Cobb. Cobb was allowed to show up late for spring training and was given private quarters on the road – perks not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four on a day when Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on. When it was reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.

In retirement, Cobb wrote a letter to a writer for &quot;The Sporting News&quot; accusing Crawford of not helping in the outfield and of intentionally fouling off balls when Cobb was stealing a base. Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a &quot;cheapskate&quot; who never helped his teammates. He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder, &quot;so he blamed me.&quot; Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases, insisting that Cobb had &quot;dreamed that up.&quot;

When asked about the feud, Cobb attributed it to envy. He felt that Crawford was &quot;a hell of a good player,&quot; but he was &quot;second best&quot; on the Tigers and &quot;hated to be an also ran.&quot; Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two &quot;only barely tolerated each other&quot; and agreed with Cobb that Crawford&#x27;s attitude was driven by Cobb&#x27;s having stolen Crawford&#x27;s thunder.

Although they may not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford developed an ability to communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They became one of the most successful double steal pairings in baseball history.

==Regular season statistics==
For several years, Cobb had the highest batting average in major league history, .366. In Cobb&#x27;s time, major league records were kept very well, but not with the absolute accuracy seen later. Thus, for many years, Cobb&#x27;s lifetime batting average was reported as .367, but rigorous research of source documents late 20th century found that this is wrong, as some games had been reported incorrectly.

All sources with standing agree that Cobb&#x27;s lifetime batting average is .366 (except MLB.com, see below); some show slightly different numbers for at-bats and hits, but all devolve to .366. SABR (the Society for American Baseball Research) (seconded by John Thorn and Pete Palmer, among others), the Baseball Almanac, and ESPN credit Cobb with 4,189 hits in 11,434 at-bats. Retrosheet gives Cobb the same number of hits in five more at-bats (11,439), and Baseball Reference and the Baseball Hall of Fame add one more at-bat (11,440). All of these round to .366.

MLB.com lists Cobb&#x27;s lifetime average as .367 (4,191 hits in 11,429 at-bats), the number that had been reported and believed true from Cobb&#x27;s retirement until the late 20th century. (Other pages on the website do give the correct value.) According to former Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, Major League Baseball continues and will continue to report the incorrect value on the basis of it being grandfathered in (&quot;The passage of 70 years, in our judgment, constitutes a certain statute of limitation as to recognizing any changes.&quot;)

According to Retrosheet, Cobb recorded 1 six-hit game, 13 five-hit games, and 82 four-hit games in his MLB career. 
Baseball (the sport) does not have official statistics. In &quot;C.B.C. Distribution Marketing v. Major League Baseball&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upholding a 2007 judgement by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, ruled that baseball statistics, as being mere facts, are in the public domain and are therefore not the property of Major League Baseball Enterprises, Inc. or any other private or public entity. However, because Major League Baseball Enterprises, Inc. does have some official legal rights and responsibilities concerning major league baseball – enforcing copyrights on team logos, making the official rules used by the teams, and so forth – and because Major League Baseball does empower the Elias Sports Bureau with &quot;official provider of MLB statistics&quot; status - confusion sometimes arises and thus a few sources can still describe Cobb&#x27;s major league batting average as being &quot;officially&quot; .367. &quot;Official&quot; in that sense of the word means merely &quot;from the office&quot; of Major League Baseball, the corporation. In 2024, MLB.com incorporated the records of more than 2,300 Negro Leagues players, making Josh Gibson&#x27;s .372 career batting average the new highest.

Cobb&#x27;s career totals from Baseball Reference are as follows. Other sources may have slightly different figures. Caught Stealing is not shown comprehensively because the stat was not regularly recorded until 1920.
Cobb&#x27;s career totals published by Major League Baseball Enterprises, Inc. are shown below:

<text>TAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first submarine transatlantic telephone cable system. It was laid between Kerrera, Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland. Two cables were laid between 1955 and 1956 with one cable for each direction. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956. The cable was able to carry 35 simultaneous telephone calls. A 36th channel was used to carry up to 22 telegraph lines.

==History==

The first transatlantic telegraph cable had been laid in 1858 (see Cyrus West Field). It only operated for a month, but was replaced with a successful connection in 1866. A radio-based transatlantic telephone service was started in 1927, charging £9 (about US$45, or roughly $550 in 2010 dollars) for three minutes and handling around 300,000 calls a year. Although a telephone cable was discussed at that time, it was not practical until a number of technological advances arrived in the 1940s.

The developments that made TAT-1 possible were coaxial cable, polyethylene insulation (replacing gutta-percha), very reliable vacuum tubes for the submerged repeaters and a general improvement in carrier equipment. Transistors were not used, being a recent invention of unknown longevity.

The agreement to make the connection was announced by the Postmaster General on December 1, 1953. The project was a joint one between the General Post Office of the UK, the American Telephone and Telegraph company, and the Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. The share split in the scheme was 40% British, 50% American, and 10% Canadian. The total cost was about £120 million.

There were to be two main cables, one for each direction of transmission. Each cable was produced and laid in three sections, two shallow-water armored sections, and one continuous central section long. The electronic repeaters were designed by the Bell Telephone Laboratories of the United States and they were inserted into the cable at intervals – for a total of 51 repeaters in the central section. The armored cables were manufactured southeast of London, at a factory in Erith, Kent, owned by Submarine Cables Ltd. (owned jointly by Siemens Brothers &amp; Co, Ltd, and The Telegraph Construction &amp; Maintenance Company, Ltd).

The cables were laid over the summers of 1955 and 1956, with the majority of the work done by the cable ship HMTS &quot;Monarch&quot;. At the land-end in Gallanach Bay near Oban, Scotland, the cable was connected to coaxial (and then 24-circuit carrier lines) carrying the transatlantic circuits via Glasgow and Inverness to the International Exchange at Faraday Building in London. At the cable landing point in Newfoundland the cable joined at Clarenville, then crossed the Cabot Strait by another submarine cable to Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia. From there the communications traffic was routed to the US border by a microwave radio relay link, and in Brunswick, Maine the route joined the main US network and branched to Montreal to connect with the Canadian network.

Opened on September 25, 1956, TAT-1 carried 588 London-US calls and 119 London-Canada calls in the first 24 hours of public service.

The original 36 channels were 4 kHz. The increase to 48 channels was accomplished by narrowing the bandwidth to 3 kHz. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment. Time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable&#x27;s capacity from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits.

TAT-1 carried the Moscow-Washington hotline between the American and Soviet heads of state, although using a teleprinter rather than voice calls as written communications were regarded as less likely to be misinterpreted. The link became operational on 13 July 1963 and was principally motivated as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis where it took the US, for example, nearly 12 hours to receive and decode the initial settlement message that contained approx. 3,000 words. By the time the message was decoded and interpreted, and an answer had been prepared, another, more aggressive message had been received.

In May 1957, TAT-1 was used to transmit a concert by the singer and civil rights activist, Paul Robeson performing in New York to St Pancras Town Hall in London. Due to McCarthyism, Robeson&#x27;s passport had been withdrawn by the United States authorities in 1950. Unable to accept numerous invitations to perform abroad, he stated &quot;We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing&quot;. The 15 minute connection, which required a music quality circuit, cost £300 (~£6,500 as of 2015). Robeson performed this way again in October 1957 when he linked up to the Grand Pavilion, Porthcawl, Wales, fulfilling an invitation to the eistedfodd there. A 10-inch record featuring selections from the event entitled &quot;Transatlantic Exchange&quot; was issued by South Wales area of the National Union of Mineworkers as a fundraiser and protest at Robeson&#x27;s treatment.

After the success of TAT-1, a number of other TAT cables were laid and TAT-1 was retired in 1978.
The TAT-1 was named an IEEE Milestone in 2006.

<text>Time travel is the hypothetical activity of traveling into the past or future. Time travel is a concept in philosophy and fiction, particularly science fiction. In fiction, time travel is typically achieved through the use of a device known as a time machine. The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

It is uncertain whether time travel to the past would be physically possible. Such travel, if at all feasible, may give rise to questions of causality. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time, is an extensively observed phenomenon and is well understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, such as a rotating black hole. Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics, and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes.

== History of the concept ==

=== Mythical time travel ===

Some ancient myths depict a character skipping forward in time. In Hindu mythology, the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; mentions the story of King Raivata Kakudmi, who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is surprised to learn when he returns to Earth that many ages have passed. The Buddhist Pāli Canon mentions the relativity of time. The Payasi Sutta tells of one of the Buddha&#x27;s chief disciples, Kumara Kassapa, who explains to the skeptic Payasi that time in the Heavens passes differently than on Earth. The Japanese tale of &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot;, first described in the &quot;Manyoshu&quot;, tells of a young fisherman named Urashima-no-ko () who visits an undersea palace. After three days, he returns home to his village and finds himself 300 years in the future, where he has been forgotten, his house is in ruins, and his family has died. 

=== Abrahamic religions ===
One story in Judaism concerns Honi HaMe&#x27;agel, a miracle-working sage of the 1st century BC, who was a historical character to whom various myths were attached. While traveling one day, Honi saw a man planting a carob tree and asked him about it. The man explained that the tree would take 70 years to bear fruit, and that he was planting it not for himself but for the generations to follow him. Later that day, Honi sat down to rest but fell asleep for 70 years; when he awoke, he saw a man picking fruit from a fully mature carob tree. Asked whether he had planted it, the man replied that he had not, but that his grandfather had planted it for him.

In Christian tradition, there is a similar, story of &quot;the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus&quot;, which recounts a group of early Christians who hid in a cave circa 250 AD, to escape the persecution of Christians during the reign of the Roman emperor Decius. They fell into a sleep and woke some 200 years later during the reign of Theodosius II, to discover that the Empire had become Christian. This Christian story is recounted by Islam and appears in a Sura of the Quran, Sura Al-Kahf. The version recalls a group of young monotheists escaping from persecution within a cave and emerging hundreds of years later. This narrative describes divine protection and time suspension. 

Another similar story in the Islamic tradition is of Uzair (usually identified with the Biblical Ezra) whose grief at the Destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians was so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness and she could see again. He meets his son who recognized him by a mole between his shoulders and was older than he was.

=== Science fiction ===
Time travel themes in science fiction and the media can be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-many-worlds interpretation. The non-scientific term &#x27;timeline&#x27; is often used to refer to all physical events in history, so that where events are changed, the time traveler is described as creating a new timeline.

Early science fiction stories feature characters who sleep for years and awaken in a changed society, or are transported to the past through supernatural means. Among them &quot;L&#x27;An 2440, rêve s&#x27;il en fût jamais&quot; (&quot;The Year 2440: A Dream If Ever There Was One&quot;, 1770) by Louis-Sébastien Mercier, &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1819) by Washington Irving, &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (1888) by Edward Bellamy, and &quot;When the Sleeper Awakes&quot; (1899) by H. G. Wells. Prolonged sleep is used as a means of time travel in these stories. 

The date of the earliest work about backwards time travel is uncertain. The Chinese novel &quot;A Supplement to the Journey to the West&quot; () by Dong Yue features magical mirrors and jade gateways that connect various points in time. The protagonist Sun Wukong travels back in time to the &quot;World of the Ancients&quot; (Qin dynasty) to retrieve a magical bell and then travels forward to the &quot;World of the Future&quot; (Song dynasty) to find an emperor who has been exiled in time. However, the time travel is taking place inside an illusory dream world created by the villain to distract and entrap him. Samuel Madden&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Twentieth Century&quot; (1733) is a series of letters from British ambassadors in 1997 and 1998 to diplomats in the past, conveying the political and religious conditions of the future. Because the narrator receives these letters from his guardian angel, Paul Alkon suggests in his book &quot;Origins of Futuristic Fiction&quot; that &quot;the first time-traveler in English literature is a guardian angel&quot;. Madden does not explain how the angel obtains these documents, but Alkon asserts that Madden &quot;deserves recognition as the first to toy with the rich idea of time-travel in the form of an artifact sent backward from the future to be discovered in the present&quot;. In the science fiction anthology &quot;Far Boundaries&quot; (1951), editor August Derleth claims that an early short story about time travel is &quot;An Anachronism; or, Missing One&#x27;s Coach&quot;, written for the &quot;Dublin Literary Magazine&quot; by an anonymous author in the June 1838 issue. While the narrator waits under a tree for a coach to take him out of Newcastle upon Tyne, he is transported back in time over a thousand years. He encounters the Venerable Bede in a monastery and explains to him the developments of the coming centuries. However, the story never makes it clear whether these events are real or a dream. Another early work about time travel is &quot;The Forebears of Kalimeros: Alexander, son of Philip of Macedon&quot; by Alexander Veltman published in 1836.

 Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843) has early depictions of mystical time travel in both directions, as the protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge, is transported to Christmases past and future. Other stories employ the same template, where a character naturally goes to sleep, and upon waking up finds themself in a different time. A clearer example of backward time travel is found in the 1861 book &quot;Paris avant les hommes&quot; (&quot;Paris before Men&quot;) by the French botanist and geologist Pierre Boitard, published posthumously. In this story, the protagonist is transported to the prehistoric past by the magic of a &quot;lame demon&quot; (a French pun on Boitard&#x27;s name), where he encounters a Plesiosaur and an apelike ancestor and is able to interact with ancient creatures. Edward Everett Hale&#x27;s &quot;Hands Off&quot; (1881) tells the story of an unnamed being, possibly the soul of a person who has recently died, who interferes with ancient Egyptian history by preventing Joseph&#x27;s enslavement. This may have been the first story to feature an alternate history created as a result of time travel.

=== Early time machines ===
One of the first stories to feature time travel by means of a machine is &quot;The Clock that Went Backward&quot; by Edward Page Mitchell, which appeared in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; in 1881. However, the mechanism borders on fantasy. An unusual clock, when wound, runs backwards and transports people nearby back in time. The author does not explain the origin or properties of the clock. Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau&#x27;s &quot;El Anacronópete&quot; (1887) may have been the first story to feature a vessel engineered to travel through time. Andrew Sawyer has commented that the story &quot;does seem to be the first literary description of a time machine noted so far&quot;, adding that &quot;Edward Page Mitchell&#x27;s story &quot;The Clock That Went Backward&quot; (1881) is usually described as the first time-machine story, but I&#x27;m not sure that a clock quite counts&quot;. H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895) popularized the concept of time travel by mechanical means.

== Time travel in physics ==
Some solutions to Einstein&#x27;s equations for general relativity suggest that suitable geometries of spacetime or specific types of motion in space might allow time travel into the past and future if these geometries or motions were possible. In technical papers, physicists discuss the possibility of closed timelike curves, which are world lines that form closed loops in spacetime, allowing objects to return to their own past. There are known to be solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe spacetimes which contain closed timelike curves, such as Gödel spacetime, but the physical plausibility of these solutions is uncertain.

Any theory that would allow backward time travel would introduce potential problems of causality. The classic example of a problem involving causality is the &quot;grandfather paradox,&quot; which postulates travelling to the past and intervening in the conception of one&#x27;s ancestors (causing the death of an ancestor before conception being frequently cited). Some physicists, such as Novikov and Deutsch, suggested that these sorts of temporal paradoxes can be avoided through the Novikov self-consistency principle or a variation of the many-worlds interpretation with interacting worlds.

=== General relativity ===
Time travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain general relativity spacetime geometries that permit traveling faster than the speed of light, such as cosmic strings, traversable wormholes, and Alcubierre drives. The theory of general relativity does suggest a scientific basis for the possibility of backward time travel in certain unusual scenarios, although arguments from semiclassical gravity suggest that when quantum effects are incorporated into general relativity, these loopholes may be closed. These semiclassical arguments led Stephen Hawking to formulate the chronology protection conjecture, suggesting that the fundamental laws of nature prevent time travel, but physicists cannot come to a definitive judgment on the issue without a theory of quantum gravity to join quantum mechanics and general relativity into a completely unified theory.

==== Different spacetime geometries ====
The theory of general relativity describes the universe under a system of field equations that determine the metric, or distance function, of spacetime. There exist exact solutions to these equations that include closed time-like curves, which are world lines that intersect themselves; some point in the causal future of the world line is also in its causal past, a situation that can be described as time travel. Such a solution was first proposed by Kurt Gödel, a solution known as the Gödel metric, but his (and others&#x27;) solution requires the universe to have physical characteristics that it does not appear to have, such as rotation and lack of Hubble expansion. Whether general relativity forbids closed time-like curves for all realistic conditions is still being researched.

==== Wormholes ====

Wormholes are a hypothetical warped spacetime permitted by the Einstein field equations of general relativity. A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced propulsion system, and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, time dilation causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become &quot;younger&quot;, than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently &quot;through&quot; the wormhole than &quot;outside&quot; it, so that synchronized clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around. This means that an observer entering the &quot;younger&quot; end would exit the &quot;older&quot; end at a time when it was the same age as the &quot;younger&quot; end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine; in essence, it is more of a path through time than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as &quot;exotic matter&quot;. More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various energy conditions, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition, and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Casimir effect in quantum physics. Although early calculations suggested that a very large amount of negative energy would be required, later calculations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitrarily small.

In 1993, Matt Visser argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other. Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for causality violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex &quot;Roman ring&quot; (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.

==== Other approaches based on general relativity ====
Another approach involves a dense spinning cylinder usually referred to as a Tipler cylinder, a GR solution discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos in 1924, but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves until an analysis by Frank Tipler in 1974. If a cylinder is infinitely long and spins fast enough about its long axis, then a spaceship flying around the cylinder on a spiral path could travel back in time (or forward, depending on the direction of its spiral). However, the density and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it. Physicist Ronald Mallett is attempting to recreate the conditions of a rotating black hole with ring lasers, in order to bend spacetime and allow for time travel.

A more fundamental objection to time travel schemes based on rotating cylinders or cosmic strings has been put forward by Stephen Hawking, who proved a theorem showing that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine of a special type (a &quot;time machine with the compactly generated Cauchy horizon&quot;) in a region where the weak energy condition is satisfied, meaning that the region contains no matter with negative energy density (exotic matter). Solutions such as Tipler&#x27;s assume cylinders of infinite length, which are easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough, he did not prove this. But Hawking points out that because of his theorem, &quot;it can&#x27;t be done with positive energy density everywhere! I can prove that to build a finite time machine, you need negative energy.&quot; This result comes from Hawking&#x27;s 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture, which Hawking states as &quot;The laws of physics do not allow the appearance of closed timelike curves.&quot;

=== Quantum physics ===

==== No-communication theorem ====
When a signal is sent from one location and received at another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity in the theory of relativity show that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event. When the signal travels faster than light, it is received &quot;before&quot; it is sent, in all reference frames. The signal could be said to have moved backward in time. This hypothetical scenario is sometimes referred to as a tachyonic antitelephone.

Quantum-mechanical phenomena such as quantum teleportation, the EPR paradox, or quantum entanglement might appear to create a mechanism that allows for faster-than-light (FTL) communication or time travel, and in fact some interpretations of quantum mechanics such as the Bohm interpretation presume that some information is being exchanged between particles instantaneously in order to maintain correlations between particles. This effect was referred to as &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; by Einstein.

Nevertheless, the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern quantum field theories, and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or FTL communication. In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed, more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal, some form of classical communication must also be used. The no-communication theorem also gives a general proof that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than classical signals.

==== Interacting many-worlds interpretation ====
A variation of Hugh Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics provides a resolution to the grandfather paradox that involves the time traveler arriving in a different universe than the one they came from; it&#x27;s been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe&#x27;s history and not their own history, this is not &quot;genuine&quot; time travel. The accepted many-worlds interpretation suggests that all possible quantum events can occur in mutually exclusive histories. However, some variations allow different universes to interact. This concept is most often used in science-fiction, but some physicists such as David Deutsch have suggested that a time traveler should end up in a different history than the one he started from. On the other hand, Stephen Hawking has argued that even if the MWI is correct, we should expect each time traveler to experience a single self-consistent history, so that time travelers remain within their own world rather than traveling to a different one. The physicist Allen Everett argued that Deutsch&#x27;s approach &quot;involves modifying fundamental principles of quantum mechanics; it certainly goes beyond simply adopting the MWI&quot;. Everett also argues that even if Deutsch&#x27;s approach is correct, it would imply that any macroscopic object composed of multiple particles would be split apart when traveling back in time through a wormhole, with different particles emerging in different worlds.

=== Experimental results ===
Certain experiments carried out give the impression of reversed causality, but fail to show it under closer examination.

The delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment performed by Marlan Scully involves pairs of entangled photons that are divided into &quot;signal photons&quot; and &quot;idler photons&quot;, with the signal photons emerging from one of two locations and their position later measured as in the double-slit experiment. Depending on how the idler photon is measured, the experimenter can either learn which of the two locations the signal photon emerged from or &quot;erase&quot; that information. Even though the signal photons can be measured before the choice has been made about the idler photons, the choice seems to retroactively determine whether or not an interference pattern is observed when one correlates measurements of idler photons to the corresponding signal photons. However, since interference can be observed only after the idler photons are measured and they are correlated with the signal photons, there is no way for experimenters to tell what choice will be made in advance just by looking at the signal photons, only by gathering classical information from the entire system; thus causality is preserved.

The experiment of Lijun Wang might also show causality violation since it made it possible to send packages of waves through a bulb of caesium gas in such a way that the package appeared to exit the bulb 62 nanoseconds before its entry, but a wave package is not a single well-defined object but rather a sum of multiple waves of different frequencies (see Fourier analysis), and the package can appear to move faster than light or even backward in time even if none of the pure waves in the sum do so. This effect cannot be used to send any matter, energy, or information faster than light, so this experiment is understood not to violate causality either.

The physicists Günter Nimtz and Alfons Stahlhofen, of the University of Koblenz, claim to have violated Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity by transmitting photons faster than the speed of light. They say they have conducted an experiment in which microwave photons traveled &quot;instantaneously&quot; between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to apart, using a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling. Nimtz told &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine: &quot;For the time being, this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of.&quot; However, other physicists say that this phenomenon does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light. Aephraim M. Steinberg, a quantum optics expert at the University of Toronto, Canada, uses the analogy of a train traveling from Chicago to New York, but dropping off train cars at each station along the way, so that the center of the train moves forward at each stop; in this way, the speed of the center of the train exceeds the speed of any of the individual cars.

Shengwang Du claims in a peer-reviewed journal to have observed single photons&#x27; precursors, saying that they travel no faster than &quot;c&quot; in a vacuum. His experiment involved slow light as well as passing light through a vacuum. He generated two single photons, passing one through rubidium atoms that had been cooled with a laser (thus slowing the light) and passing one through a vacuum. Both times, apparently, the precursors preceded the photons&#x27; main bodies, and the precursor traveled at &quot;c&quot; in a vacuum. According to Du, this implies that there is no possibility of light traveling faster than &quot;c&quot; and, thus, no possibility of violating causality.

=== Absence of time travelers from the future ===
Many have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically &quot;prove&quot; they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers. Some versions of general relativity suggest that time travel might only be possible in a region of spacetime that is warped a certain way, and hence time travelers would not be able to travel back to earlier regions in spacetime, before this region existed. Stephen Hawking stated that this would explain why the world has not already been overrun by &quot;tourists from the future&quot;.
Several experiments have been carried out to try to entice future humans, who might invent time travel technology, to come back and demonstrate it to people of the present time. Events such as Perth&#x27;s Destination Day, MIT&#x27;s Time Traveler Convention and Stephen Hawking&#x27;s Reception For Time Travellers heavily publicized permanent &quot;advertisements&quot; of a meeting time and place for future time travelers to meet. In 1982, a group in Baltimore, Maryland, identifying itself as the Krononauts, hosted an event of this type welcoming visitors from the future.

These experiments only stood the possibility of generating a positive result demonstrating the existence of time travel, but have failed so far—no time travelers are known to have attended either event. Some versions of the many-worlds interpretation can be used to suggest that future humans have traveled back in time, but have traveled back to the meeting time and place in a parallel universe.

== Time dilation ==
There is a great deal of observable evidence for time dilation in special relativity and gravitational time dilation in general relativity, for example in the famous and easy-to-replicate observation of atmospheric muon decay. The theory of relativity states that the speed of light is invariant for all observers in any frame of reference; that is, it is always the same. Time dilation is a direct consequence of the invariance of the speed of light. Time dilation may be regarded in a limited sense as &quot;time travel into the future&quot;: a person may use time dilation so that a small amount of proper time passes for them, while a large amount of proper time passes elsewhere. This can be achieved by traveling at relativistic speeds or through the effects of gravity.

For two identical clocks moving relative to each other without accelerating, each clock measures the other to be ticking slower. This is possible due to the relativity of simultaneity. However, the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates, allowing for less proper time to pass for one clock than the other. The twin paradox describes this: one twin remains on Earth, while the other undergoes acceleration to relativistic speed as they travel into space, turn around, and travel back to Earth; the traveling twin ages less than the twin who stayed on Earth, because of the time dilation experienced during their acceleration. General relativity treats the effects of acceleration and the effects of gravity as equivalent, and shows that time dilation also occurs in gravity wells, with a clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly; this effect is taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the Global Positioning System, and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a large gravity well such as a black hole.

A time machine that utilizes this principle might be, for instance, a spherical shell with a diameter of five meters and the mass of Jupiter. A person at its center will travel forward in time at a rate four times slower than that of distant observers. Squeezing the mass of a large planet into such a small structure is not expected to be within humanity&#x27;s technological capabilities in the near future. With current technologies, it is only possible to cause a human traveler to age less than companions on Earth by a few milliseconds after a few hundred days of space travel.

== Philosophy ==

Philosophers have discussed the philosophy of space and time since at least the time of ancient Greece; for example, Parmenides presented the view that time is an illusion. Centuries later, Isaac Newton supported the idea of absolute time, while his contemporary Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz maintained that time is only a relation between events and it cannot be expressed independently. The latter approach eventually gave rise to the spacetime of relativity.

=== Presentism vs. eternalism ===
Many philosophers have argued that relativity implies eternalism, the idea that the past and future exist in a real sense, not only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present. Philosopher of science Dean Rickles disagrees with some qualifications, but notes that &quot;the consensus among philosophers seems to be that special and general relativity are incompatible with presentism&quot;. Some philosophers view time as a dimension equal to spatial dimensions, that future events are &quot;already there&quot; in the same sense different places exist, and that there is no objective flow of time; however, this view is disputed.

Presentism is a school of philosophy that holds that the future and the past exist only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present, and they have no real existence of their own. In this view, time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to. Keller and Nelson have argued that even if past and future objects do not exist, there can still be definite truths about past and future events, and thus it is possible that a future truth about a time traveler deciding to travel back to the present date could explain the time traveler&#x27;s actual appearance in the present; these views are contested by some authors.

=== The grandfather paradox ===

A common objection to the idea of traveling back in time is put forth in the grandfather paradox or the argument of auto-infanticide. If one were able to go back in time, inconsistencies and contradictions would ensue if the time traveler were to change anything; there is a contradiction if the past becomes different from the way it &quot;is&quot;. The paradox is commonly described with a person who travels to the past and kills their own grandfather, prevents the existence of their father or mother, and therefore their own existence. Philosophers question whether these paradoxes prove time travel impossible. Some philosophers answer these paradoxes by arguing that it might be the case that backward time travel could be possible but that it would be impossible to actually &quot;change&quot; the past in any way, an idea similar to the proposed Novikov self-consistency principle in physics.

=== Ontological paradox ===
==== Compossibility ====
According to the philosophical theory of compossibility, what &quot;can&quot; happen, for example in the context of time travel, must be weighed against the context of everything relating to the situation. If the past &quot;is&quot; a certain way, it&#x27;s not possible for it to be any other way. What &quot;can&quot; happen when a time traveler visits the past is limited to what &quot;did&quot; happen, in order to prevent logical contradictions.

==== Self-consistency principle ====
The Novikov self-consistency principle, named after Igor Dmitrievich Novikov, states that any actions taken by a time traveler or by an object that travels back in time were part of history all along, and therefore it is impossible for the time traveler to &quot;change&quot; history in any way. The time traveler&#x27;s actions may be the &quot;cause&quot; of events in their own past though, which leads to the potential for circular causation, sometimes called a predestination paradox, ontological paradox, or bootstrap paradox. The term bootstrap paradox was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s story &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot;. The Novikov self-consistency principle proposes that the local laws of physics in a region of spacetime containing time travelers cannot be any different from the local laws of physics in any other region of spacetime.

The philosopher Kelley L. Ross argues in &quot;Time Travel Paradoxes&quot; that in a scenario involving a physical object whose world-line or history forms a closed loop in time there can be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Ross uses the film &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; as an example of such an ontological paradox, where a watch is given to a person, and 60 years later the same watch is brought back in time and given to the same character. Ross states that entropy of the watch will increase, and the watch carried back in time will be more worn with each repetition of its history. The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a statistical law, so decreasing entropy and non-increasing entropy are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it&#x27;s possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.

In 2005, Daniel Greenberger and Karl Svozil proposed that quantum theory gives a model for time travel where the past must be self-consistent.

<doc id="31593" wikidata="Q288" url="?curid=31593" title="Tours">
<text>Tours ( , ) is the largest city in the region of Centre-Val de Loire, France. It is the prefecture of the department of Indre-et-Loire. The commune of Tours had 136,463 inhabitants as of 2018 while the population of the whole metropolitan area was 516,973.

Tours sits on the lower reaches of the Loire, between Orléans and the Atlantic coast. Formerly named Caesarodunum by its founder, Roman Emperor Augustus, it possesses one of the largest amphitheaters of the Roman Empire, the Tours Amphitheatre. Known for the Battle of Tours in 732 AD, it is a National Sanctuary with connections to the Merovingians and the Carolingians, with the Capetians making the kingdom&#x27;s currency the Livre tournois. Saint Martin and Gregory of Tours were from Tours. Tours was once part of Touraine, a former province of France. Tours was the first city of the silk industry. It was taken by Louis XI, as the royal capital under the Valois Kings with its Loire castles and city of art with the School of Tours. The prefecture was partially destroyed during the French Wars of Religion in the late 16th century and again during the Second World War in June 1940.

The White and Blue city keeps a historical center registered in the UNESCO, and is home to the Vieux-Tours, a patrimonial site. The garden city has a green heritage and an urban landscape strongly influenced by its natural space. The historic city that is nicknamed &quot;Le Petit Paris&quot; and its region by its history and culture has always been a land of birth or host to many personalities, international sporting events, and is a university city with more than 30,000 students in 2019. Tours is a popular culinary city with specialties such as: rillettes, rillons, Touraine vineyards, AOC Sainte-Maure-de-Touraine cheeses and nougats. The city is also the end-point of the annual Paris–Tours cycle race.

== Etymology ==
A popular folk etymology of the word &quot;Tours&quot; is that it comes from &quot;Turonus&quot;, the nephew of Brutus. Turonus died in a war between Corineus and the king of Aquitaine, Goffarius Pictus, provoked by Corineus hunting in the king&#x27;s forests without permission. It is said that Turonus was buried in Tours and the city is founded around his grave.

==History==

In Gallic times, Tours was an important crossing point over the Loire. It became part of the Roman Empire during the 1st century AD, and the city was named &quot;&quot; (&quot;hill of Caesar&quot;). The name evolved in the 4th century when the original Gallic name, Turones, became &quot;Civitas Turonum&quot; and then &quot;Tours&quot;. It was at this time that the Tours Amphitheatre was built.

Tours became a metropolis in the Roman province of Lugdunum towards 380–388 AD, dominating Maine, Brittany, and the Loire Valley. One important figure in the city was Saint Martin of Tours, a bishop who shared his coat with a naked beggar in Amiens. The importance of Martin in the medieval Christian West made Tours, and its position on the route of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a major centre during the Middle Ages.

===Middle Ages===
In the 6th century, Gregory of Tours, author of the &quot;Ten Books of History&quot;, restored a cathedral destroyed by a fire in 561. Saint Martin&#x27;s monastery benefited from its inception, at the very start of the 6th century from patronage and support from the Frankish king, Clovis I, which increased considerably the influence of the saint, the abbey and the city in Gaul. In the 9th century, Tours was at the heart of the Carolingian Renaissance, in particular because of Alcuin, of York in Northumbria, a renowned book collector and an abbot of Marmoutier Abbey.

In 732, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi and an army of Muslim horsemen from Al-Andalus advanced deep into France, and were stopped at Moussais-la-Bataille (between Châtellerault and Poitiers) by Charles Martel and his infantry. This ignited the Battle of Tours. The Muslim army was defeated, preventing an Islamic conquest of France.

In 845, Tours repelled the first attack of the Viking chief Haesten. In 850, the Vikings settled at the mouths of the Seine and the Loire. Still led by Haesten, they went up the Loire again in 852 and sacked Angers, Tours and Marmoutier Abbey.

During the Middle Ages, Tours consisted of two juxtaposed and competing centres. The &quot;City&quot; in the east, successor of the late Roman &#x27;castrum&#x27;, was composed of the cathedral and palace of the archbishops as well as the castle of Tours. The castle of Tours acted as a seat of the authority of the Counts of Tours (later Counts of Anjou) and the King of France. In the west, the &quot;new city&quot; structured around the Abbey of Saint Martin was freed from the control of the city during the 10th century (an enclosure was built towards 918) and became &quot;Châteauneuf&quot;. This space, organized between Saint Martin and the Loire, became the economic centre of Tours. Between these two centres were Varennes, vineyards and fields, little occupied except for the Abbaye Saint-Julien established on the banks of the Loire. The two centres were linked during the 14th century.
Tours became the capital of the county of Tours or Touraine, a territory bitterly disputed between the counts of Blois and Anjou – the latter were victorious in the 11th century. It was the capital of France at the time of Louis XI, who had settled in the castle of Montils (today the castle of Plessis-les-Tours, at the junction of the Loire and the Indre rivers). Tours and Touraine remained a permanent residence of the kings and court until the 16th century. The Renaissance gave Tours and Touraine many private mansions and castles, joined to some extent under the generic name of the Châteaux of the Loire. It is also at the time of Louis XI that the silk industry was introduced – despite difficulties, the industry still survives to this day.

===16th–18th centuries===
Charles IX passed through the city at the time of his royal tour of France between 1564 and 1566, accompanied by the Court and various noblemen: his brother the Duke of Anjou, Henri de Navarre, the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine. At this time, the Catholics returned to power in Angers: the attendant assumed the right to nominate the aldermen. The Massacre of Saint-Barthelemy was not repeated at Tours. The Protestants were imprisoned by the aldermen – a measure which prevented their extermination. The permanent return of the Court to Paris and then Versailles marked the beginning of a slow but permanent decline. Guillaume the Metayer (1763–1798), known as Rochambeau, the well-known counter-revolutionary chief of Mayenne, was shot in Tours.

===19th to 20th centuries===
The arrival of the railway in the 19th century saved the city by making it an important nodal point. The main railway station is known as Tours-Saint-Pierre-des-Corps. At that time, Tours was expanding towards the south into a district known as the Prébendes. The importance of the city as a centre of communications contributed to its revival and, as the 20th century progressed, Tours became a dynamic conurbation, economically oriented towards the service sector.

====First World War====

The city was greatly affected by the First World War. A force of 25,000 American soldiers arrived in 1917, setting up textile factories for the manufacture of uniforms, repair shops for military equipment, munitions dumps, an army post office and an American military hospital at Augustins. Because of this, Tours became a garrison town with a resident general staff. The American presence is remembered today by the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Loire, which was officially opened in July 1918 and bears the name of the President of the United States from 1913 to 1921. Three American air force squadrons, including the 492nd, were based at the Parçay-Meslay airfield, their personnel playing an active part in the life of the city. Americans paraded at funerals and award ceremonies for the Croix de Guerre. They also took part in festivals and their YMCA organised shows for the troops. Some men married women from Tours.

====Inter-war years====
In 1920, the city hosted the Congress of Tours, which saw the creation of the French Communist Party. One future consequence of that congress was the presence of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese nationalist, who became one of the first members of the party.

====Second World War====
Tours was also marked by the Second World War, as the city suffered massive destruction in 1940. For four years it was a city of military camps and fortifications. From 10 to 13 June 1940, Tours was the temporary seat of the French government before its move to Bordeaux.

German incendiary bombs caused a huge fire, which blazed out of control from 20 to 22 June and destroyed part of the city centre. Some architectural masterpieces of the 16th and 17th centuries were lost, as was the monumental entry to the city. The Wilson Bridge, which carried a water main that supplied the city, was dynamited to slow the progress of the German advance. With the water main severed, nobody could extinguish the inferno. That made inhabitants have no option but to flee to safety. More heavy air raids by Allied forces devastated the area around the railway station in 1944, causing several hundred deaths.

====Post-war developments====
A plan for the rebuilding of the central area drawn up by the local architect Camille Lefèvre had been adopted even before the end of the war. The plan was for 20 small quadrangular blocks of housing to be arranged around the main road (la rue Nationale), which was widened. This regular layout attempted to echo but simplify the 18th-century architecture. Pierre Patout succeeded Lefèvre as the architect in charge of rebuilding in 1945. At one time, there was talk of demolishing the southern side of the rue Nationale to make it in keeping with the new development.

The recent history of Tours is marked by the personality of Jean Royer, who was mayor for 36 years and helped save the old town from demolition by establishing one of the first Conservation Areas. This example of conservation policy would later inspire the Malraux Law for the safeguarding of historic city centres. In the 1970s, Jean Royer also extended the city to the south by diverting the course of the Cher River to create the districts of Rives du Cher and des Fontaines. At the time, it was one of the largest urban developments in Europe. In 1970, the François Rabelais University was founded and centred on the bank of the Loire in the downtown area, not, as was the current practice, in a campus in the suburbs. The latter solution was also chosen by the twin university of Orleans. Royer&#x27;s long term as mayor was, however, not without controversy, as is exemplified by the construction of the practical but aesthetically unattractive motorway, which runs along the bed of a former canal just from the cathedral. Another bone of contention was the original Vinci Congress Centre by Jean Nouvel. The project incurred debts although it at least made Tours one of France&#x27;s principal conference centres.

Jean Germain, a member of the Socialist Party, became mayor in 1995 and made debt reduction his priority. Ten years later, his economic management was regarded as much wiser than that of his predecessor because of the financial stability of the city returning. However, his achievements were criticised by the municipal opposition for a lack of ambition. There were no large building projects instituted under his two terms. That position is disputed by those in power, who affirm their policy of concentrating on the quality of life, as evidenced by urban restoration, the development of public transport and cultural activities.

==Climate==
Tours has an oceanic climate that is very mild for such a northern latitude. Summers are influenced by its inland position, resulting in frequent days of or warmer, whereas winters are kept mild by Atlantic air masses. The entire valley between Orlans and Angers is famous for the luminosity of its air and for its fabulous châteaux, most of them Renaissance (over 600 between Orlans and Angers).

==Sights==


===Cathedral===
The Cathedral of Tours, dedicated to Saint Gatien, its canonized first bishop, was begun about 1170 to replace the cathedral that was burnt out in 1166 during the dispute between Louis VII of France and Henry II of England. The lowermost stages of the western towers belong to the 12th century, but the rest of the west end is in the profusely detailed 15th-century Flamboyant Gothic, which were completed just as the Renaissance was affecting the patrons who planned the châteaux of Touraine. The towers were being constructed at the same time as, for example, the Château de Chenonceau.

When the 15th-century illuminator Jean Fouquet was set the task of illuminating Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot;, his depiction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple was modelled on the nearly complete cathedral of Tours. The atmosphere of the Gothic cathedral close permeates Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s dark short novel of jealousy and provincial intrigues, &quot;Le Curé de Tours&quot; (&quot;The Curate of Tours&quot;) and his medieval story &quot;Maître Cornélius&quot; opens in the cathedral itself.

==Language==

Before the French Revolution, the inhabitants of Tours (&quot;Les Tourangeaux&quot;) were known for speaking the &quot;purest&quot; form of French in the entire country. The pronunciation of Touraine was traditionally regarded as the most standard pronunciation of the French language, until the 19th century when the standard pronunciation of French shifted to that of the Parisian bourgeoisie. That is explained by the fact that the court of France lived in Touraine between 1430 and 1530. French, the language of the court, had become the official language of the entire kingdom.

A Council of Tours in 813 decided that priests should preach sermons in different languages because the common people could no longer understand classical Latin. This was the first official recognition of an early French language distinct from Latin, and can be considered as the birth of French.

The Ordinance of Montils-lès-Tours, promulgated by Charles VII in 1454, made it mandatory to write laws and oral customs in the native language of the area.

An ordinance of Charles VIII (born in Amboise, near Tours) in 1490 and one of Louis XII (born in Blois, near Tours) in 1510 broaden the scope of the ordinance of Charles VII.

Finally, the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, signed into law by Francis I in 1539, called for the use of French in all legal acts, notarized contracts and official legislation to avoid any linguistic confusion.

Gregory of Tours wrote in the 6th century that some people in the area could still speak Gaulish.

==City==
The city has a population of 140,000 and is called &quot;Le Jardin de la France&quot; (&quot;The Garden of France&quot;). There are several parks located within the city. Tours is located between two rivers, the Loire to the north and the Cher to the south. The buildings of Tours are white with blue slate (called &quot;Ardoise&quot;) roofs; this style is common in the north of France, while most buildings in the south of France have terracotta roofs.

Tours is famous for its original medieval district, called &quot;le Vieux Tours&quot;. Unique to the Old City are its preserved half-timbered buildings and &quot;la Place Plumereau&quot;, a square with busy pubs and restaurants, whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square. The Boulevard Beranger crosses the Rue Nationale at the Place Jean-Jaures and is the location of weekly markets and fairs.

Tours is famous for its many bridges crossing the river Loire. One of them, Wilson Bridge, collapsed in 1978 but was rebuilt.

In the garden of the ancient Palais des Archevêques (now &quot;Musée des Beaux-Arts&quot;) is a huge cedar tree said to have been planted by Napoleon. The garden also has a stuffed elephant named Fritz. He escaped from the Barnum and Bailey circus during their stay in Tours in 1902. He went mad and had to be shot down, but the city paid to honor him, and he was taxidermied as a result.

Tours is home to University of Tours (formerly known as University François Rabelais of Tours), the site of one of the most important choral competitions, called &quot;Florilège Vocal de Tours&quot; International Choir Competition, and is a member city of the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing.

==Population==
The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Tours proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Tours absorbed the former commune of Saint-Étienne in 1845 and Sainte-Radegonde-en-Touraine and Saint-Symphorien in 1964.

==Transportation==

Today, with extensive rail (including TGV) and &quot;autoroute&quot; connections linking to the rest of the country, Tours is a jumping-off point for tourist visits to the Loire Valley and the royal châteaux.

Tours is on one of the main lines of the TGV. It is possible to travel to the west coast of Bordeaux in an hour and forty minutes. From there, the line follows the Mediterranean coast via Avignon, and then to Spain and Barcelona. There are also lines to Lyon, Strasbourg and Lille. It takes less than one hour by train to get from Tours to Paris by TGV and one and a half hours to get to Charles de Gaulle Airport. Tours has two main stations: Gare de Tours, the central station, and Gare de Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, used by trains that do not terminate in Tours.

Tours Loire Valley Airport connects the Loire Valley to European cities.

Historically, Tours was served by trams and trolleybuses, the trolleybus system lasting from 1949 to 1968.
Tram service returned to the city in 2013, when a new tram system began operation. Twenty-one Alstom Citadis trams were ordered.

There is also a bus service, the main central stop being &quot;Jean Jaurès&quot;, next to the Hôtel de Ville, and &quot;rue Nationale&quot;, the high street of Tours. The tram and bus networks are operated by Fil Bleu and they share a ticketing system. A second tram line is scheduled for 2025.

==Sport==
The city&#x27;s football team, Tours FC, currently play in Championnat National 3, the fifth level of French football. They also have a second team, CCSP Tours. CCSP&#x27;s home stadium is the Stade des Tourettes and they play in the Division d&#x27;Honneur Regionale de Centre, the seventh tier of the French football league system.

Tours has served as the finish location for Paris–Tours, a one-day road cycling classic race held almost every October since 1896.

Tours also has a volleyball club named the Tours VB.

==Catholics from Tours==

Tours is a special place for Catholics who follow the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus and the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. In 1843, Sister Marie of St Peter of Tours reported a vision which started the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, in reparation for the many insults Christ suffered in His Passion. The &quot;Golden Arrow Prayer&quot; was first made public by her.

The Venerable Leo Dupont also known as The Holy Man of Tours lived in Tours at about the same time. In 1849 he started the nightly adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, which spread throughout France. Upon hearing of Sister Marie of St Peter&#x27;s reported visions, he started to burn a vigil lamp continuously before a picture of the Holy Face of Jesus. The devotion was eventually approved by Pope Pius XII in 1958 and he formally declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. The Oratory of the Holy Face on Rue St. Etienne in Tours receives many pilgrims every year.

Tours was the site of the episcopal activity of St. Martin of Tours and has further Christian connotations in that the pivotal Battle of Tours in 732 is often considered the first decisive victory over the invading Islamic forces, turning the tide against them. The battle also helped lay the foundations of the Carolingian Empire.

<doc id="31596" wikidata="Q83319" url="?curid=31596" title="Typhoid fever">
<text>Typhoid fever, also known simply as typhoid, is a disease caused by &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; serotype Typhi bacteria, also called Salmonella Typhi. Symptoms vary from mild to severe, and usually begin six to 30 days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. This is commonly accompanied by weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, and mild vomiting. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases, people may experience confusion. Without treatment, symptoms may last weeks or months. Diarrhea may be severe, but is uncommon. Other people may carry it without being affected, but are still contagious. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever, along with paratyphoid fever. &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; Typhi is believed to infect and replicate only within humans.
Typhoid is caused by the bacterium &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; subsp. &quot;enterica&quot; serovar Typhi growing in the intestines, Peyer&#x27;s patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gallbladder, bone marrow and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include limited access to clean drinking water and poor sanitation. Those who have not yet been exposed to it and ingest contaminated drinking water or food are most at risk for developing symptoms. Only humans can be infected; there are no known animal reservoirs. Salmonella Typhi which causes typhoid fever is different from the other &quot;Salmonella&quot; bacteria that usually cause salmonellosis, a common type of food poisoning.

Diagnosis is performed by culturing and identifying &quot;S.&quot; Typhi from patient samples or detecting an immune response to the pathogen from blood samples. Recently, new advances in large-scale data collection and analysis have allowed researchers to develop better diagnostics, such as detecting changing abundances of small molecules in the blood that may specifically indicate typhoid fever. Diagnostic tools in regions where typhoid is most prevalent are quite limited in their accuracy and specificity, and the time required for a proper diagnosis, the increasing spread of antibiotic resistance, and the cost of testing are also hardships for under-resourced healthcare systems.

A typhoid vaccine can prevent about 40–90% of cases during the first two years. The vaccine may have some effect for up to seven years. For those at high risk or people traveling to areas where it is common, vaccination is recommended. Other efforts to prevent it include providing clean drinking water, good sanitation, and handwashing. Until an infection is confirmed as cleared, the infected person should not prepare food for others. Typhoid is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or third-generation cephalosporins. Resistance to these antibiotics has been developing, which has made treatment more difficult.
In 2015, 12.5 million new typhoid cases were reported. The disease is most common in India. Children are most commonly affected. Typhoid decreased in the developed world in the 1940s as a result of improved sanitation and the use of antibiotics. Every year about 400 cases are reported in the U.S. and an estimated 6,000 people have typhoid. In 2015, it resulted in about 149,000 deaths worldwide – down from 181,000 in 1990. Without treatment, the risk of death may be as high as 20%. With treatment, it is between 1% and 4%.

Typhus is a different disease, caused by unrelated species of bacteria. Owing to their similar symptoms, they were not recognized as distinct diseases until the 1800s. &quot;Typhoid&quot; means &quot;resembling typhus&quot;.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Classically, the progression of untreated typhoid fever has three distinct stages, each lasting about a week. Over the course of these stages, the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated.
* In the first week, the body temperature rises slowly, and fever fluctuations are seen with relative bradycardia (Faget sign), malaise, headache, and cough. A bloody nose (epistaxis) is seen in a quarter of cases, and abdominal pain is also possible. A decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells (leukopenia) occurs with eosinopenia and relative lymphocytosis; blood cultures are positive for &quot;S. enterica&quot; subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. The Widal test is usually negative.
* In the second week, the person is often too tired to get up, with high fever in plateau around and bradycardia (sphygmothermic dissociation or Faget sign), classically with a dicrotic pulse wave. Delirium can occur, where the patient is often calm, but sometimes becomes agitated. This delirium has given typhoid the nickname &quot;nervous fever&quot;. Rose spots appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients. Rhonchi (rattling breathing sounds) are heard in the base of the lungs. The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant, where a rumbling sound can be heard. Diarrhea can occur in this stage, but constipation is also common. The spleen and liver are enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly) and tender, and liver transaminases are elevated. The Widal test is strongly positive, with antiO and antiH antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive.
* In the third week of typhoid fever, possible complications include:
** The fever is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours. Dehydration ensues along with malnutrition, and the patient is delirious. A third of affected people develop a macular rash on the trunk.
** Intestinal haemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyer&#x27;s patches occurs; this can be very serious but is usually not fatal.
** Intestinal perforation in the distal ileum is a critical complication and often fatal. It may occur without alarming symptoms until sepsis or diffuse peritonitis sets in.
** Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and acute bronchitis
** Encephalitis
** Neuropsychiatric symptoms (described as &quot;muttering delirium&quot; or &quot;coma vigil&quot;), with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects.
** Metastatic abscesses, cholecystitis, endocarditis, and osteitis.
** Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is sometimes seen.

==Causes==
===Bacteria===
The Gram-negative bacterium that causes typhoid fever is &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. Based on the MLST subtyping scheme, the two main sequence types of the &quot;S.&quot; Typhi are ST1 and ST2, which are widespread globally. Global phylogeographical analysis showed dominance of a haplotype 58 (H58), which probably originated in India during the late 1980s and is now spreading through the world with multi-drug resistance. A more detailed genotyping scheme was reported in 2016 and is now widely used. This scheme reclassified the nomenclature of H58 to genotype 4.3.1.

=== Transmission ===
Unlike other strains of &quot;Salmonella&quot;, humans are the only known typhoid carriers. &quot;S. enterica&quot; subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is spread by the fecal-oral route from people who are infected and from asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium. An asymptomatic human carrier is someone who is still excreting typhoid bacteria in stool a year after the acute stage of the infection.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made by any blood, bone marrow, or stool cultures and with the Widal test (demonstration of antibodies against &quot;Salmonella&quot; antigens O-somatic and H-flagellar). In epidemics and less wealthy countries, after excluding malaria, dysentery, or pneumonia, a therapeutic trial time with chloramphenicol is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of the Widal test and blood and stool cultures.

=== Widal test ===
The Widal test is used to identify specific antibodies in the serum of people with typhoid by using antigen-antibody interactions.

In this test, the serum is mixed with a dead bacterial suspension of &quot;Salmonella&quot; with specific antigens. If the patient&#x27;s serum contains antibodies against those antigens, they get attached to them, forming clumps. If clumping does not occur, the test is negative. The Widal test is time-consuming and prone to significant false positives. It may also be falsely negative in recently infected people. But unlike the Typhidot test, the Widal test quantifies the specimen with titres.

===Rapid diagnostic tests===
Rapid diagnostic tests such as Tubex, Typhidot, and Test-It have shown moderate diagnostic accuracy.

==== Typhidot ====
Typhidot is based on the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50Kd OMP antigen. This test is carried out on a cellulose nitrate membrane where a specific &quot;S. typhi&quot; outer membrane protein is attached as fixed test lines. It separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM shows recent infection; IgG signifies remote infection.

The sample pad of this kit contains colloidal gold-anti-human IgG or gold-anti-human IgM. If the sample contains IgG and IgM antibodies against those antigens, they will react and turn red. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2–3 days of infection.

Two colored bands indicate a positive test. A single control band indicates a negative test. A single first fixed line or no band at all indicates an invalid test. Typhidot&#x27;s biggest limitation is that it is not quantitative, just positive or negative.

==== Tubex test ====
The Tubex test contains two types of particles: brown magnetic particles coated with antigen and blue indicator particles coated with O9 antibody. During the test, if antibodies are present in the serum, they will attach to the brown magnetic particles and settle at the base, while the blue indicator particles remain in the solution, producing a blue color, which means the test is positive.

If the serum does not have an antibody in it, the blue particles attach to the brown particles and settle at the bottom, producing a colorless solution, which means the test is negative.

== Prevention ==
Sanitation and hygiene are important to prevent typhoid. It can spread only in environments where human feces can come into contact with food or drinking water. Careful food preparation and washing of hands are crucial to prevent typhoid. Industrialization contributed greatly to the elimination of typhoid fever, as it eliminated the public health hazards associated with having horse manure in public streets, which led to a large number of flies, which are vectors of many pathogens, including &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp. According to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the chlorination of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever.

===Vaccination===
Two typhoid vaccines are licensed for use in the prevention of typhoid: the live, oral Ty21a vaccine (sold as Vivotif by Crucell Switzerland AG) and the injectable typhoid polysaccharide vaccine (sold as Typhim Vi by Sanofi Pasteur and Typherix by GlaxoSmithKline). Both are efficacious and recommended for travelers to areas where typhoid is endemic. Boosters are recommended every five years for the oral vaccine and every two years for the injectable form. An older, killed whole-cell vaccine is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available, but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use because it has more side effects (mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection).

To help decrease rates of typhoid fever in developing nations, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of a vaccination program starting in 1999. Vaccination has proven effective at controlling outbreaks in high-incidence areas and is also very cost-effective: prices are normally less than US$1 per dose. Because the price is low, poverty-stricken communities are more willing to take advantage of the vaccinations. Although vaccination programs for typhoid have proven effective, they alone cannot eliminate typhoid fever. Combining vaccines with public health efforts is the only proven way to control this disease.

Since the 1990s, the WHO has recommended two typhoid fever vaccines. The ViPS vaccine is given by injection and the Ty21a by capsules. Only people over age two are recommended to be vaccinated with the ViPS vaccine, and it requires a revaccination after 2–3 years, with a 55–72% efficacy. The Ty21a vaccine is recommended for people five and older, lasting 5–7 years with 51–67% efficacy. The two vaccines have proved safe and effective for epidemic disease control in multiple regions.

A version of the vaccine combined with a hepatitis A vaccine is also available.

Results of a phase 3 trial of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in December 2019 reported 81% fewer cases among children.

== Treatment ==
===Oral rehydration therapy===
The rediscovery of oral rehydration therapy in the 1960s provided a simple way to prevent many of the deaths of diarrheal diseases in general.

===Antibiotics===
Where resistance is uncommon, the treatment of choice is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Otherwise, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is the first choice. Cefixime is a suitable oral alternative.

Properly treated, typhoid fever is not fatal in most cases. Antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin have been commonly used to treat it. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to about 1%.

Without treatment, some patients develop sustained fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal symptoms, and occasionally pneumonia. In white-skinned patients, pink spots, which fade on pressure, appear on the skin of the trunk in up to 20% of cases. In the third week, untreated cases may develop gastrointestinal and cerebral complications, which may prove fatal in 10–20% of cases. The highest case fatality rates are reported in children under 4. Around 2–5% of those who contract typhoid fever become chronic carriers, as bacteria persist in the biliary tract after symptoms have resolved.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery is usually indicated if intestinal perforation occurs. One study found a 30-day mortality rate of 9% (8/88), and surgical site infections at 67% (59/88), with the disease burden borne predominantly by low-resource countries.

For surgical treatment, most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the peritoneum. Small bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations. If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the hepatobiliary carriage, the gallbladder should be resected. Cholecystectomy is sometimes successful, especially in patients with gallstones, but is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of persisting hepatic infection.

=== Resistance ===
As resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and streptomycin is now common, these agents are no longer used as first-line treatment of typhoid fever. Typhoid resistant to these agents is known as multidrug-resistant typhoid.

Ciprofloxacin resistance is an increasing problem, especially in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Many centres are shifting from ciprofloxacin to ceftriaxone as the first line for treating suspected typhoid originating in South America, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, or Vietnam. Also, it has been suggested that azithromycin is better at treating resistant typhoid than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone. Azithromycin can be taken by mouth and is less expensive than ceftriaxone, which is given by injection.

A separate problem exists with laboratory testing for reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; current recommendations are that isolates should be tested simultaneously against ciprofloxacin (CIP) and against nalidixic acid (NAL), that isolates sensitive to both CIP and NAL should be reported as &quot;sensitive to ciprofloxacin&quot;, and that isolates sensitive to CIP but not to NAL should be reported as &quot;reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin&quot;. But an analysis of 271 isolates found that around 18% of isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, the class to which CIP belongs (MIC 0.125–1.0 mg/L), would not be detected by this method.

== Epidemiology ==
In 2000, typhoid fever caused an estimated 21.7 million illnesses and 217,000 deaths. It occurs most often in children and young adults between 5 and 19 years old. In 2013, it resulted in about 161,000 deaths – down from 181,000 in 1990. Infants, children, and adolescents in south-central and Southeast Asia have the highest rates of typhoid. Outbreaks are also often reported in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2000, more than 90% of morbidity and mortality due to typhoid fever occurred in Asia. In the U.S., about 400 cases occur each year, 75% of which are acquired while traveling internationally.

Before the antibiotic era, the case fatality rate of typhoid fever was 10–20%. Today, with prompt treatment, it is less than 1%, but 3–5% of people who are infected develop a chronic infection in the gall bladder. Since &quot;S. enterica&quot; subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is human-restricted, these chronic carriers become the crucial reservoir, which can persist for decades for further spread of the disease, further complicating its identification and treatment. Lately, the study of &quot;S. enterica&quot; subsp. enterica serovar Typhi associated with a large outbreak and a carrier at the genome level provides new insight into the pathogenesis of the pathogen.

In industrialized nations, water sanitation and food handling improvements have reduced the number of typhoid cases. Third world nations have the highest rates. These areas lack access to clean water, proper sanitation systems, and proper healthcare facilities. In these areas, such access to basic public-health needs is not expected in the near future.

In 2004–2005 an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo resulted in more than 42,000 cases and 214 deaths. Since November 2016, Pakistan has had an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever.

In Europe, a report based on data for 2017 retrieved from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) on the distribution of confirmed typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases found that 22 EU/EEA countries reported a total of 1,098 cases, 90.9% of which were travel-related, mainly acquired during travel to South Asia.
===Outbreaks===

* Plague of Athens (suspected)
* Cocoliztli epidemics (suspected)
* &quot;Burning Fever&quot; outbreak among indigenous Americans. Between 1607 and 1624, 85% of the population at the James River died from a typhoid epidemic. The World Health Organization estimates the death toll was over 6,000 during this time.
* Maidstone, Kent outbreak in 1897–1898: 1,847 patients were recorded to have typhoid fever. This outbreak is notable because it was the first time a typhoid vaccine was deployed during a civilian outbreak. Almoth Edward Wright&#x27;s vaccine was offered to 200 healthcare providers, and of the 84 individuals who received the vaccine, none developed typhoid whereas 4 who had not been vaccinated became ill.
* American army in the Spanish-American war: government records estimate over 21,000 troops had typhoid, resulting in 2,200 deaths.
* In 1902 guests at mayoral banquets in Southampton and Winchester, England became ill and four died, including the Dean of Winchester, after consuming oysters. The infection was due to oysters sourced from Emsworth, where the oyster beds had been contaminated with raw sewage.
* Jamaica Plain neighborhood, Boston in 1908 – linked to milk delivery. See the history section, &quot;carriers&quot; for further details.
* Outbreak in upper-class New Yorkers who employed Mary Mallon – 51 cases and 3 deaths from 1907 to 1915.
* Aberdeen, Scotland, in summer 1964 – traced back to contaminated canned beef sourced from Argentina sold in markets. More than 500 patients were quarantined in the hospital for a minimum of four weeks, and the outbreak was contained without any deaths.
* Dushanbe, Tajikistan, in 1996–1997: 10,677 cases reported, 108 deaths.
* Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 2004: 43,000 cases and over 200 deaths. A prospective study of specimens collected in the same region between 2007 and 2011 revealed about one-third of samples obtained from patient samples were resistant to multiple antibiotics.
* Kampala, Uganda in 2015: 10,230 cases reported.

==History==

=== Early descriptions ===
The plague of Athens, during the Peloponnesian War, was most likely an outbreak of typhoid fever. During the war, Athenians retreated into a walled-in city to escape attack from the Spartans. This massive influx of humans into a concentrated space overwhelmed the water supply and waste infrastructure, likely leading to unsanitary conditions as fresh water became harder to obtain and waste became more difficult to collect and remove beyond the city walls. In 2006, examining the remains of a mass burial site from Athens from around the time of the plague (~430 B.C.) revealed that fragments of DNA similar to that of modern-day &quot;S.&quot; Typhi were detected, whereas &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; (plague), &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; (typhus), &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, cowpox virus, and &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot; were not detected in any of the remains tested.

It is possible that the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar had either a liver abscess or typhoid fever, and survived by using ice baths and cold compresses as a means of treatment for his fever. There is a statue of the Greek physician, Antonius Musa, who treated his fever.

===Definition and evidence of transmission===
The French doctors Pierre-Fidele Bretonneau and Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis are credited with describing typhoid fever as a specific disease, unique from typhus. Both doctors performed autopsies on individuals who died in Paris due to fever – and indicated that many had lesions on the Peyer&#x27;s patches which correlated with distinct symptoms before death. British medics were skeptical of the differentiation between typhoid and typhus because both were endemic to Britain at that time. However, in France, only typhoid was present circulating in the population. Pierre-Charlles-Alexandre Louis also performed case studies and statistical analysis to demonstrate that typhoid was contagious – and that persons who already had the disease seemed to be protected. Afterward, several American doctors confirmed these findings, and then Sir William Jenner convinced any remaining skeptics that typhoid is a specific disease recognizable by lesions in the Peyer&#x27;s patches by examining sixty-six autopsies from fever patients and concluding that the symptoms of headaches, diarrhea, rash spots, and abdominal pain were present only in patients who were found to have intestinal lesions after death; these observations solidified the association of the disease with the intestinal tract and gave the first clue to the route of transmission.

In 1847 William Budd learned of an epidemic of typhoid fever in Clifton, and identified that all 13 of 34 residents who had contracted the disease drew their drinking water from the same well. Notably, this observation was two years before John Snow first published an early version of his theory that contaminated water was the central conduit for transmitting cholera. Budd later became health officer of Bristol ensured a clean water supply, and documented further evidence of typhoid as a water-borne illness throughout his career.

===Cause===
Polish scientist Tadeusz Browicz described a short bacillus in the organs and feces of typhoid victims in 1874. Browicz was able to isolate and grow the bacilli but did not go as far as to insinuate or prove that they caused the disease.

In April 1880, three months before Eberth&#x27;s publication, Edwin Klebs described short and filamentous bacilli in the Peyer&#x27;s patches in typhoid victims. The bacterium&#x27;s role in disease was speculated but not confirmed.

In 1880, Karl Joseph Eberth described a bacillus that he suspected was the cause of typhoid. Eberth is given credit for discovering the bacterium definitively by successfully isolating the same bacterium from 18 of 40 typhoid victims and failing to discover the bacterium present in any &quot;control&quot; victims of other diseases. In 1884, pathologist Georg Theodor August Gaffky (1850–1918) confirmed Eberth&#x27;s findings. Gaffky isolated the same bacterium as Eberth from the spleen of a typhoid victim, and was able to grow the bacterium on solid media. The organism was given names such as Eberth&#x27;s bacillus, &quot;Eberthella&quot; Typhi, and Gaffky-Eberth bacillus. Today, the bacillus that causes typhoid fever goes by the scientific name &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; serovar Typhi.

=== Chlorination of water ===
Most developed countries had declining rates of typhoid fever throughout the first half of the 20th century due to vaccinations and advances in public sanitation and hygiene. In 1893 attempts were made to chlorinate the water supply in Hamburg, Germany, and in 1897 Maidstone, England, was the first town to have its entire water supply chlorinated. In 1905, following an outbreak of typhoid fever, the City of Lincoln, England, instituted permanent water chlorination. The first permanent disinfection of drinking water in the US was made in 1908 to the Jersey City, New Jersey, water supply. Credit for the decision to build the chlorination system has been given to John L. Leal. The chlorination facility was designed by George W. Fuller.

Outbreaks in traveling military groups led to the creation of the Lyster bag in 1915: a bag with a faucet that can be hung from a tree or pole, filled with water, and comes with a chlorination tablet to drop into the water. The Lyster bag was essential for the survival of American soldiers in the Vietnam War.

=== Direct transmission and carriers ===

There were several occurrences of milk delivery men spreading typhoid fever throughout the communities they served. Although typhoid is not spread through milk itself, there were several examples of milk distributors in many locations watering their milk down with contaminated water, or cleaning the glass bottles the milk was placed in with contaminated water. Boston had two such cases around the turn of the 20th century. In 1899 there were 24 cases of typhoid traced to a single milkman, whose wife had died of typhoid fever a week before the outbreak. In 1908, J.J. Fallon, who was also a milkman, died of typhoid fever. Following his death and confirmation of the typhoid fever diagnosis, the city conducted an investigation of typhoid symptoms and cases along his route and found evidence of a significant outbreak. A month after the outbreak was first reported, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; published a short statement declaring the outbreak over, stating &quot;[a]t Jamaica Plain there is a slight increase, the total being 272 cases. Throughout the city, there is a total of 348 cases.&quot; There was at least one death reported during this outbreak: Mrs. Sophia S. Engstrom, aged 46. Typhoid continued to ravage the Jamaica Plain neighborhood in particular throughout 1908, and several more people were reported dead due to typhoid fever, although these cases were not explicitly linked to the outbreak. The Jamaica Plain neighborhood at that time was home to many working-class and poor immigrants, mostly from Ireland.

The most notorious carrier of typhoid fever, but by no means the most destructive, was Mary Mallon, known as Typhoid Mary. Although other cases of human-to-human spread of typhoid were known at the time, the concept of an asymptomatic carrier, who was able to transmit disease, had only been hypothesized and not yet identified or proven. Mary Mallon became the first known example of an asymptomatic carrier of an infectious disease, making typhoid fever the first known disease being transmissible through asymptomatic hosts. The cases and deaths caused by Mallon were mainly upper-class families in New York City. At the time of Mallon&#x27;s tenure as a personal cook for upper-class families, New York City reported 3,000 to 4,500 cases of typhoid fever annually. In the summer of 1906 two daughters of a wealthy family and maids working in their home became ill with typhoid fever. After investigating their home water sources and ruling out water contamination, the family hired civil engineer George Soper to conduct an investigation of the possible source of typhoid fever in the home. Soper described himself as an &quot;epidemic fighter&quot;. His investigation ruled out many sources of food, and led him to question if the cook the family hired just prior to their household outbreak, Mallon, was the source. Since she had already left and begun employment elsewhere, he proceeded to track her down in order to obtain a stool sample. When he was able to finally meet Mallon in person he described her by saying &quot;Mary had a good figure and might have been called athletic had she not been a little too heavy.&quot; In recounts of Soper&#x27;s pursuit of Mallon, his only remorse appears to be that he was not given enough credit for his relentless pursuit and publication of her personal identifying information, stating that the media &quot;rob[s] me of whatever credit belongs to the discovery of the first typhoid fever carrier to be found in America.&quot; Ultimately, 51 cases and 3 deaths were suspected to be caused by Mallon.

In 1924 the city of Portland, Oregon, experienced an outbreak of typhoid fever, consisting of 26 cases and 5 deaths, all deaths due to intestinal hemorrhage. All cases were concluded to be due to a single milk farm worker, who was shedding large amounts of the typhoid pathogen in his urine. Misidentification of the disease, due to inaccurate Widal test results, delayed identification of the carrier and proper treatment. Ultimately, it took four samplings of different secretions from all of the dairy workers in order to successfully identify the carrier. Upon discovery, the dairy worker was forcibly quarantined for seven weeks, and regular samples were taken, most of the time the stool samples yielding no typhoid and often the urine yielding the pathogen. The carrier was reported as being 72 years old and appearing in excellent health with no symptoms. Pharmaceutical treatment decreased the amount of bacteria secreted, however, the infection was never fully cleared from the urine, and the carrier was released &quot;under orders never again to engage in the handling of foods for human consumption.&quot; At the time of release, the authors noted &quot;for more than fifty years he has earned his living chiefly by milking cows and knows little of other forms of labor, it must be expected that the closest surveillance will be necessary to make certain that he does not again engage in this occupation.&quot;

Overall, in the early 20th century the medical profession began to identify disease carriers and evidence of transmission independent of water contamination. In a 1933 American Medical Association publication, physicians&#x27; treatment of asymptomatic carriers is best summarized by the opening line &quot;Carriers of typhoid bacilli are a menace&quot;. Within the same publication, the first official estimate of typhoid carriers is given: 2–5% of all typhoid patients, and distinguished between temporary carriers and chronic carriers. The authors further estimate that there are four to five chronic female carriers to every one male carrier, although offered no data to explain this assertion of a gender difference in the rate of typhoid carriers. As far as treatment, the authors suggest: &quot;When recognized, carriers must be instructed as to the disposal of excreta as well as to the importance of personal cleanliness. They should be forbidden to handle food or drink intended for others, and their movements and whereabouts must be reported to the public health officers&quot;.

Today, typhoid carriers exist all over the world, but the highest incidence of asymptomatic infection is likely to occur in South/Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan countries. The Los Angeles County department of public health tracks typhoid carriers and reports the number of carriers identified within the county yearly; between 2006 and 2016 0–4 new cases of typhoid carriers were identified per year. Cases of typhoid fever must be reported within one working day from identification. As of 2018, chronic typhoid carriers must sign a &quot;Carrier Agreement&quot; and are required to test for typhoid shedding twice yearly, ideally every 6 months. Carriers may be released from their agreements upon fulfilling &quot;release&quot; requirements, based on completion of a personalized treatment plan designed with medical professionals. Fecal or gallbladder carrier release requirements: 6 consecutive negative feces and urine specimens submitted at 1-month or greater intervals beginning at least 7 days after completion of therapy. Urinary or kidney carrier release requirements: 6 consecutive negative urine specimens submitted at 1-month or greater intervals beginning at least 7 days after completion of therapy.

Due to the nature of asymptomatic cases, many questions remain about how individuals can tolerate infection for long periods, how to identify such cases, and efficient options for treatment. Researchers are working to understand asymptomatic infection with &quot;Salmonella&quot; species by studying infections in laboratory animals, which will ultimately lead to improved prevention and treatment options for typhoid carriers. In 2002, John Gunn described the ability of &quot;Salmonella&quot; sp. to form biofilms on gallstones in mice, providing a model for studying carriage in the gallbladder. Denise Monack and Stanley Falkow described a mouse model of asymptomatic intestinal and systemic infection in 2004, and Monack went on to demonstrate that a subpopulation of superspreaders are responsible for the majority of transmission to new hosts, following the 80/20 rule of disease transmission, and that the intestinal microbiota likely plays a role in transmission. Monack&#x27;s mouse model allows long-term carriage of &quot;Salmonella&quot; in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver.

=== Vaccine development ===

British bacteriologist Almroth Edward Wright first developed an effective typhoid vaccine at the Army Medical School in Netley, Hampshire. It was introduced in 1896 and used successfully by the British during the Second Boer War in South Africa. At that time, typhoid often killed more soldiers at war than were lost due to enemy combat. Wright further developed his vaccine at a newly opened research department at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London in 1902, where he established a method for measuring protective substances (opsonin) in human blood. Wright&#x27;s version of the typhoid vaccine was produced by growing the bacterium at body temperature in broth, then heating the bacteria to 60 °C to &quot;heat inactivate&quot; the pathogen, killing it, while keeping the surface antigens intact. The heat-killed bacteria was then injected into a patient. To show evidence of the vaccine&#x27;s efficacy, Wright then collected serum samples from patients several weeks post-vaccination, and tested their serum&#x27;s ability to agglutinate live typhoid bacteria. A &quot;positive&quot; result was represented by clumping of bacteria, indicating that the body was producing anti-serum (now called antibodies) against the pathogen.

Citing the example of the Second Boer War, during which many soldiers died from easily preventable diseases, Wright convinced the British Army that 10 million vaccine doses should be produced for the troops being sent to the Western Front, thereby saving up to half a million lives during World War I. The British Army was the only combatant at the outbreak of the war to have its troops fully immunized against the bacterium. For the first time, their casualties due to combat exceeded those from disease.

In 1909, Frederick F. Russell, a U.S. Army physician, adopted Wright&#x27;s typhoid vaccine for use with the Army, and two years later, his vaccination program became the first in which an entire army was immunized. It eliminated typhoid as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. military. Typhoid vaccination for members of the American military became mandatory in 1911. Before the vaccine, the rate of typhoid fever in the military was 14,000 or greater per 100,000 soldiers. By World War I, the rate of typhoid in American soldiers was 37 per 100,000.

During the Second World War, the United States Army authorized the use of a trivalent vaccine – containing heat-inactivated Typhoid, Paratyphi A and Paratyphi B pathogens.

In 1934, the discovery of the Vi capsular antigen by Arthur Felix and Miss S. R. Margaret Pitt enabled the development of the safer Vi Antigen vaccine – which is widely in use today. Arthur Felix and Margaret Pitt also isolated the strain Ty2, which became the parent strain of Ty21a, the strain used as a live-attenuated vaccine for typhoid fever today.

=== Antibiotics and resistance ===
Chloramphenicol was isolated from &quot;Streptomyces&quot; by David Gotlieb during the 1940s. In 1948 American army doctors tested its efficacy in treating typhoid patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Individuals who received a full course of treatment cleared the infection, whereas patients given a lower dose had a relapse. Asymptomatic carriers continued to shed bacilli despite chloramphenicol treatment – only ill patients were improved with chloramphenicol. Resistance to chloramphenicol became frequent in Southeast Asia by the 1950s, and today chloramphenicol is only used as a last resort due to the high prevalence of resistance.

==Terminology==
The disease has been referred to by various names, often associated with symptoms, such as gastric fever, enteric fever, abdominal typhus, infantile remittant fever, slow fever, nervous fever, pythogenic fever, drain fever, and low fever.

==Society and culture==
===Notable people===

* Emperor Augustus of Rome (suspected based on historical record but not confirmed), survived.
* Albert, Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, died 24 days after the first record of &quot;feeling horribly ill&quot;. Died 14 December 1861 after suffering loss of appetite, insomnia, fever, chills, profuse sweating, vomiting, rash spots, delusions, inability to recognize family members, worsening rash on abdomen, a change in tongue color, then finally a state of extreme fatigue. Attending physician William Jenner, an expert on typhoid fever at the time, diagnosed him.

<text>Time (stylized in all caps as TIME) is an American news magazine based in New York City. It was published weekly for nearly a century. Starting in March 2020, it transitioned to every other week. It was first published in New York City on March 3, 1923, and for many years it was run by its influential co-founder, Henry Luce.

A European edition (&quot;Time Europe&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Time Atlantic&quot;) is published in London and also covers the Middle East, Africa, and, since 2003, Latin America. An Asian edition (&quot;Time Asia&quot;) is based in Hong Kong. The South Pacific edition, which covers Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, is based in Sydney.

Since 2018, &quot;Time&quot; has been owned by Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, who acquired it from Meredith Corporation. Benioff currently publishes the magazine through the company Time USA, LLC.

==History==
===20th century===

&quot;Time&quot; has been based in New York City since its first issue published on March 3, 1923, by Briton Hadden (1898–1929) and Henry Luce (1898–1967). It was the first weekly news magazine in the United States. The two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor, respectively, of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. They first called the proposed magazine &quot;Facts&quot; to emphasize brevity so a busy man could read it in an hour. They changed the name to &quot;Time&quot; and used the slogan &quot;Take Time – It&#x27;s Brief&quot;. Hadden was considered carefree and liked to tease Luce. He saw &quot;Time&quot; as important but also fun, which accounted for its heavy coverage of celebrities and politicians, the entertainment industry, and pop culture, criticizing it as too light for serious news.

&quot;Time&quot; set out to tell the news through people, and until the late 1960s, the magazine&#x27;s cover depicted a single person. More recently, &quot;Time&quot; has incorporated &quot;People of the Year&quot; issues, which have grown in popularity over the years. The first issue of &quot;Time&quot; featured Joseph G. Cannon, the retired Speaker of the House of Representatives, on its cover; a facsimile reprint of Issue No. 1, including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original, was included with copies of the magazine&#x27;s issue from February 28, 1938, in commemoration of its 15th anniversary. The cover price was 15¢ (equivalent to $ in ).

Following Hadden&#x27;s death in 1929, Luce became the dominant man at &quot;Time&quot; and a significant figure in the history of 20th-century media. According to &quot;Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1972–2004&quot; by Robert Elson, &quot;Roy Edward Larsen ... was to play a role second only to Luce&#x27;s in the development of Time Inc&quot;. In his book &quot;The March of Time, 1935–1951&quot;, Raymond Fielding also noted that Larsen was &quot;originally circulation manager and then general manager of &quot;Time&quot;, later publisher of &quot;Life&quot;, for many years president of Time Inc., and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after Luce&quot;.

Around the time, they were raising $100,000 from wealthy Yale University alumni, including Henry P. Davison, partner of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., publicity man Martin Egan and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. banker Dwight Morrow; Henry Luce and Briton Hadden hired Larsen in 1922. Larsen was a Harvard University graduate, and Luce and Hadden were Yale graduates. After Hadden died in 1929, Larsen purchased 550 shares of Time Inc., using money he obtained from selling RKO stock he had inherited from his father, who was the head of the Benjamin Franklin Keith theater chain in New England. However, after Briton Hadden&#x27;s death, the largest Time, Inc. stockholder was Henry Luce, who ruled the media conglomerate in an autocratic fashion; &quot;at his right hand was Larsen&quot;, Time Inc.&#x27;s second-largest stockholder, according to &quot;Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923–1941&quot;. In 1929, Roy Larsen was also named a Time Inc. director and vice president. J. P. Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks, both over &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot;. Other shareholders were Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., and the New York Trust Company (Standard Oil).

After &quot;Time&quot; began publishing weekly in March 1923, Roy Larsen increased its circulation by using U.S. radio and movie theaters worldwide. It often promoted both &quot;Time&quot; magazine and U.S. political and corporate interests. According to &quot;The March of Time&quot;, as early as 1924, Larsen had brought &quot;Time&quot; into the infant radio business by broadcasting a 15-minute sustaining quiz show entitled &quot;Pop Question&quot; which survived until 1925. Then in 1928, Larsen &quot;undertook the weekly broadcast of a 10-minute programme series of brief news summaries, drawn from current issues of &quot;Time&quot; magazine ... which was originally broadcast over 33 stations throughout the United States&quot;.

Larsen next arranged for the 30-minute radio program &quot;The March of Time&quot; to be broadcast over CBS beginning on March 6, 1931. Each week, the program presented a dramatization of the week&#x27;s news for its listeners; thus &quot;Time&quot; magazine itself was brought &quot;to the attention of millions previously unaware of its existence&quot;, according to &quot;Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923–1941&quot;, leading to increased circulation during the 1930s. Between 1931 and 1937, Larsen&#x27;s &quot;The March of Time&quot; radio program was broadcast over CBS radio, and between 1937 and 1945, it was broadcast over NBC radio – except between 1939 and 1941, when it was not aired. &quot;People&quot; magazine was based on &quot;Time&quot; &quot;People&quot; page.

Time Inc. stock owned by Luce at the time of his death was worth about $109 million , and it had been yielding him a yearly dividend of more than $2.4 million , according to Curtis Prendergast&#x27;s &quot;The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise 1957–1983&quot;. The Larsen family&#x27;s Time Inc. stock was worth around $80 million during the 1960s. Roy Larsen was both a Time Inc. director and the chairman of its executive committee, later serving as Time Inc.&#x27;s board&#x27;s vice chairman until the middle of 1979. On September 10, 1979, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Larsen was the only employee in the company&#x27;s history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65.&quot;

In 1987, Jason McManus succeeded Henry Grunwald as editor-in-chief, and oversaw the transition before Norman Pearlstine succeeded him in 1995.

In 1989, when Time, Inc. and Warner Communications merged, &quot;Time&quot; became part of Time Warner, along with Warner Bros.

===21st century===
In 2000, &quot;Time&quot; became part of AOL Time Warner, which reverted to the name Time Warner in 2003.

In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; moved from a Monday subscription/newsstand delivery to a schedule where the magazine goes on sale Fridays and is delivered to subscribers on Saturday. The magazine was published on Fridays when it began in 1923.

In early 2007, the year&#x27;s first issue was delayed roughly a week due to &quot;editorial changes&quot;, including the layoff of 49 employees.

In 2009, Time announced it was introducing &quot;Mine&quot;, a personalized print magazine mixing content from various Time Warner publications based on the reader&#x27;s preferences. The new magazine was met with a poor reception, with criticism that its focus needed to be more broad to be truly personal.

The magazine has an online archive with the unformatted text for every article published. The articles were indexed and converted from scanned images using optical character recognition technology. The minor errors in the text are remnants of the conversion to the digital format.

In January 2013, Time Inc. announced that it would cut nearly 500 jobs – roughly 6% of its 8,000 staff worldwide.

Although &quot;Time&quot; magazine has maintained high sales, its ad pages have declined significantly.

Also in January 2013, Time Inc. named Martha Nelson as the first female editor-in-chief of its magazine division. In September 2013, Nancy Gibbs was named as the first female managing editor of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In November 2017, Meredith Corporation announced its acquisition of Time, Inc., backed by Koch Equity Development.

In 2017, editor and journalist Catherine Mayer, who also founded the Women&#x27;s Equality Party in the UK, sued &quot;Time&quot; through attorney Ann Olivarius for sex and age discrimination. The suit was resolved in 2018.

In March 2018, only six weeks after the closure of the sale, Meredith announced that it would explore the sale of &quot;Time&quot; and sister magazines &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, since they did not align with the company&#x27;s lifestyle brands.

In October 2018, Meredith Corporation sold &quot;Time&quot; to Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne for $190 million. Although Benioff is the chairman and co-CEO of Salesforce.com, &quot;Time&quot; was to remain separate from that company, and Benioff would not be involved in the magazine&#x27;s daily operations.

In late April 2023, &quot;Time&quot; announced the elimination of the website&#x27;s paywall effective June 1, 2023.

===&quot;Time&quot; Canada===
From 1942 until 1979, &quot;Time&quot; had a Canadian edition that included an insert of five pages of locally produced content and occasional Canadian covers. Following changes in the tax status of Canadian editions of American magazines, &quot;Time&quot; closed Canadian bureaus, except for Ottawa, and published identical content to the US edition but with Canadian advertising.

In December 2008, &quot;Time&quot; discontinued publishing a Canadian edition.

==Circulation==
During the second half of 2009, the magazine had a 34.9% decline in newsstand sales. During the first half of 2010, another decline of at least one-third in &quot;Time&quot; magazine sales occurred. In the second half of 2010, &quot;Time&quot; magazine newsstand sales declined by about 12% to just over 79,000 copies per week.

As of 2012, it had a circulation of 3.3 million, making it the 11th-most circulated magazine in the United States, and the second-most circulated weekly behind &quot;People&quot;. As of July 2017, its circulation was 3,028,013. In October 2017, &quot;Time&quot; cut its circulation to two million. Time currently has 1.3 million print subscribers and 250,000 digital subscribers. 

==Style==
===Writing===
&quot;Time&quot; initially possessed a distinctively &quot;acerbic, irreverent style&quot;, largely created by Haddon and sometimes called &quot;Timestyle&quot;. Timestyle made regular use of inverted sentences, as famously parodied in 1936 by Wolcott Gibbs in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind ... Where it all will end, knows God!&quot; &quot;Time&quot; also coined or popularized many neologisms like &quot;socialite&quot;, &quot;guesstimate&quot;, &quot;televangelist&quot;, &quot;pundit&quot;, and &quot;tycoon&quot;, as well as some less successful ones like &quot;cinemactress&quot; and &quot;radiorator&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; introduced the names &quot;World War I&quot; and &quot;World War II&quot; in 1939, as opposed to older forms like &quot;First World War&quot; and &quot;World War No. 2&quot;. The false title construction was popularized by &quot;Time&quot; and indeed is sometimes called a &quot;&quot;Time&quot;-style adjective&quot;.

===Sections===
====Milestones====
Since its first issue, &quot;Time&quot; has had a &quot;Milestones&quot; section about significant events in the lives of famous people, including births, marriages, divorces, and deaths. Until 1967, entries in Milestones were short and formulaic. A typical example from 1956:

Died. Lieut, (j.g.) David Greig (&quot;Skippy&quot;) Browning Jr., 24, star of the 1952 Olympics as the U.S.&#x27;s dazzling three-meter diving champion, national collegiate one-and three-meter diving champ (1951–52); in the crash of a North American FJ-3 Fury jet fighter while on a training flight; near Rantoul, Kans.

A reader wrote a parody of the older form to announce the change:

Died. Time&#x27;s delightful but confusing habit of listing names, ages, claims to fame, and other interesting tidbits about the famous newly deceased in its Milestones notices; then the circumstances of, and places where, the deaths occurred; of apparent good sentence structure; in New York.
====Listings====
Until the mid-1970s, &quot;Time&quot; had a weekly &quot;Listings&quot; section with capsule summaries or reviews of current significant films, plays, musicals, television programs, and literary bestsellers similar to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; &quot;Current Events&quot; section.

===Cover===
&quot;Time&quot; is also known for the red border on its cover, introduced in 1927. The iconic red border was homaged or satirized by Seattle&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot; newspaper in 2010. The border has only been changed eight times since 1927:
* The special issue released shortly after the September 11 attacks on the United States had a black border to symbolize mourning. The next regularly scheduled issue returned to the red border.
* The Earth Day issue from April 28, 2008, dedicated to environmental issues, had a green border.
* The issue from September 19, 2011, commemorating the 10th anniversary of September 11 attacks, had a metallic silver border.
* On December 31, 2012, the cover had a silver border, celebrating Barack Obama&#x27;s selection as Person of the Year.
* On November 28 and December 5, 2016, the magazine had a silver border covering the &quot;Most Influential Photos of All Time&quot;.
* The issue from June 15, 2020, covering the protests surrounding the murder of George Floyd, was the first time that the cover&#x27;s border included names of people. The cover, by artist Titus Kaphar, depicts an African-American mother holding her child.
* The issues from September 21 and 28, 2020, covering the American response to the coronavirus pandemic, had a black border.
* The issues from September 26 and October 3, 2022, covering the death of Queen Elizabeth II, had a silver border.

Former president Richard Nixon has been among the most frequently featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, having appeared 55 times from August 25, 1952, to May 2, 1994.

In October 2020, the magazine replaced its logo with the word &quot;Vote&quot;, explaining that &quot;Few events will shape the world to come more than the result of the upcoming US presidential election&quot;.

===2007 redesign===
In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; redesigned the magazine to update and modernize the format. Among other changes, the magazine reduced the red cover border to promote featured stories, enlarged column titles, reduced the number of featured stories, increased white space around articles, and accompanied opinion pieces with photographs of the writers. The changes were met with both criticism and praise.

==Special editions==

===Person of the Year===
&quot;Time&quot;″s most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual &quot;Person of the Year&quot; (formerly &quot;Man of the Year&quot;) cover story, in which &quot;Time&quot; recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the past 12 months. The distinction is supposed to go to the person who, &quot;for good or ill&quot;, has most affected the course of the year; it is, therefore, not necessarily an honor or a reward. In the past, such figures as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin have been Man of the Year.

In 2006, Person of the Year was &quot;You&quot;, and was met with split reviews. Some thought the concept was creative; others wanted an actual person of the year. Editors Pepper and Timmer reflected that, if it had been a mistake, &quot;we&#x27;re only going to make it once&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Time&quot; named the &quot;Silence Breakers&quot;, people who came forward with personal stories of sexual harassment, as Person of the Year.

===&quot;Time&quot; 100===
In recent years, &quot;Time&quot; has assembled an annual list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Originally, they had made a list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. These issues usually have the front cover filled with pictures of people from the list and devote a substantial amount of space within the magazine to the 100 articles about each person on the list. In some cases, over 100 people have been included, as when two people have made the list together, sharing one spot.

The magazine also compiled &quot;All-Time 100 best novels&quot; and &quot;All-Time 100 Movies&quot; lists in 2005, &quot;The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time&quot; in 2007, and &quot;All-Time 100 Fashion Icons&quot; in 2012.

In February 2016, &quot;Time&quot; mistakenly included the male author Evelyn Waugh on its &quot;100 Most Read Female Writers in College Classes&quot; list (he was 97th on the list). The error created much media attention and concerns about the level of basic education among the magazine&#x27;s staff. &quot;Time&quot; later issued a retraction. In a BBC interview with Justin Webb, Professor Valentine Cunningham of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, described the mistake as &quot;a piece of profound ignorance on the part of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&quot;.

===X covers===

During its history, on seven occasions, &quot;Time&quot; has released a special issue with a cover showing an X scrawled over the face of a man, a year, or a national symbol. The first &quot;Time&quot; magazine with an X cover was released on May 7, 1945, showing a red X over Adolf Hitler&#x27;s face which was published the week following his death. The second X cover was released more than three months later on August 20, 1945, with a black X (to date, the magazine&#x27;s only such use of a black X) covering the flag of Japan, representing the recent surrender of Japan and which signaled the end of World War II. Fifty-eight years later, on April 21, 2003, &quot;Time&quot; released another issue with a red X over Saddam Hussein&#x27;s face, two weeks after the start of the Invasion of Iraq. A third red X issue was that of June 19, 2006, after Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed, and a fourth red X cover issue was published on May 20, 2011, after the death of Osama bin Laden. A fifth red X cover issue, that of Dec. 14, 2020, had a red X scrawled over the pandemic-hit year 2020 and the declaration &quot;the worst year ever&quot;. , the most recent and seventh X cover issue of &quot;Time&quot;, that of Nov. 11, 2024, features a red X over the face of Yahya Sinwar following his killing by the Israel Defense Forces.

===Cover logo replaced by &quot;Vote&quot; logo===
The November 2, 2020, issue of the U.S. edition of the magazine, published the day before the 2020 United States presidential election, was the first time that the cover logo &quot;TIME&quot; was not used. The cover of that issue used the word &quot;VOTE&quot; as a replacement logo, along with artwork by Shepard Fairey of a voter wearing a pandemic face mask. The issue included information on how to vote safely during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal explained this decision for a one-time cover logo change as a &quot;rare moment, one that will separate history into before and after for generations&quot;.

==&quot;Time for Kids&quot;==

&quot;Time for Kids&quot; is a division magazine of &quot;Time&quot; that is specially published for children and is mainly distributed in classrooms. &quot;TFK&quot; contains some national news, a &quot;Cartoon of the Week&quot;, and a variety of articles concerning popular culture. An annual issue concerning the environment is distributed near the end of the U.S. school term. The publication rarely exceeds ten pages front and back.

==Time LightBox==
Time LightBox is a photography blog created and curated by the magazine&#x27;s photo department that was launched in 2011. In 2011, &quot;Life&quot; picked LightBox for its Photo Blog Awards.

== TimePieces NFTs ==
TimePieces is a Web3 community NFT initiative from &quot;Time&quot;. It included works from over 40 artists from multiple disciplines.

==Staff==
Richard Stengel was the managing editor from May 2006 to October 2013, when he joined the U.S. State Department. Nancy Gibbs was the managing editor from September 2013 until September 2017. She was succeeded by Edward Felsenthal, who had been &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s digital editor.

<doc id="31605" wikidata="Q233008" url="?curid=31605" title="Two-party system">
<text>A two-party system is a political party system in which two major political parties consistently dominate the political landscape. At any point in time, one of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the &quot;majority&quot; or &quot;governing party&quot; while the other is the &quot;minority&quot; or &quot;opposition party&quot;. Around the world, the term has different meanings. For example, in the United States, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Zimbabwe, the sense of &quot;two-party system&quot; describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to either of the two major parties, and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature. In such arrangements, two-party systems result from Duverger&#x27;s law, which states that winner-take-all systems tend to produce two-party systems.

In such systems, while chances for third-party candidates winning election to major national office are remote, it is possible for groups within the larger parties, or in opposition to one or both of them, to exert influence on the two major parties. In contrast, in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere, the term &quot;two-party system&quot; is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties or independents that do win some seats in the legislature, and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest. 

Other parties in these countries may have seen candidates elected to local or subnational office.

== Europe ==
=== Malta ===

Malta is somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is single transferable vote (STV), a form with proportional representation traditionally associated with a multi-party system, minor parties have not had much success. Politics is dominated between the center-left Labour Party and the centre-right Nationalist Party, with no third parties winning seats in Parliament between 1962 and 2017 and since 2022.
=== Spain ===

A report in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; in 2008 suggested that Spain was moving toward a &quot;greater two-party system&quot; while acknowledging that Spain has many small parties. A 2015 article published by &quot;WashingtonPost.com&quot; written by academic Fernando Casal Bértoa noted the decline in support for the two main parties, the People&#x27;s Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) in recent years, with these two parties winning only 52 percent of the votes in that year&#x27;s regional and local elections. He explained this as being due to the Spanish economic crisis, a series of political corruption scandals and broken campaign promises. He argued that the emergence of the new Citizens and Podemos parties would mean the political system would evolve into a two-bloc system, with an alliance of the PP and Citizens on the right facing a leftist coalition of PSOE, Podemos and the United Left. Far-right Vox party became the third largest group in the Spanish parliament in the late 2010s.
=== United Kingdom ===
In countries such as Britain, two major parties which have strong influence emerge and tend to elect most of the candidates, but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence, and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature. In political systems based on the Westminster system, which is a particular style of parliamentary democracy based on the British model and found in many Commonwealth countries, a majority party will form the government and the minority party will form the opposition, and coalitions of lesser parties are possible; in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority, a hung parliament arises. Sometimes these systems are described as &quot;two-party systems&quot;, but they are usually referred to as &quot;multi-party&quot; systems or a &quot;two-party plus&quot; system. There is not always a sharp boundary between a two-party system and a multi-party system.

== North America ==

=== Canada ===
Canada has a multiparty system at the federal and provincial levels. Some provinces have effectively become two-party systems in which only two parties regularly get members elected, while smaller parties largely fail to secure electoral representation, and two of the three territories are run under a non-partisan consensus government model rather than through a political party system. The provincial legislative assembly of Alberta currently has only two parties; two-party representation has also historically been common in the legislative assemblies of British Columbia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, although all did elect some third-party members in their most recent provincial elections.

=== Caribbean ===
The Commonwealth Caribbean while inheriting their basic political and voting system from Great Britain have become two-party systems. The politics of Jamaica are between the People&#x27;s National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party. The politics of Guyana are between the People&#x27;s Progressive Party and APNU which is actually a coalition of smaller parties. The politics of Trinidad and Tobago are between the People&#x27;s National Movement and the United National Congress. The Politics of Belize are between the United Democratic Party and the People&#x27;s United Party. The Politics of the Bahamas are between the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement. The politics of Barbados are between the Democratic Labour Party and the Barbados Labour Party.

=== United States ===

The United States has two dominant political parties; historically, there have been few instances in which third party candidates won an election. In the First Party System, only Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republican Party were significant political parties. Toward the end of the First Party System, the Democratic-Republicans were dominant (primarily under the presidency of James Monroe).

Under the Second Party System, the Democratic-Republican Party split during the 1824 United States presidential election into Adams&#x27; Men and Jackson&#x27;s Men. In the 1828 presidential election, the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson. The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams. After the National Republicans collapsed, the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed.

In 1854 began the Third Party System when the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs, Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists. The Republicans quickly became the dominant party nationally, and Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican President in the 1860 presidential election. The Democrats held a strong, loyal coalition in the Solid South. This period saw the American Civil War where the South (which was mostly dominated by the Southern Democrats) attempted to secede as the Confederate States of America, in an attempt to preserve racial slavery. The South lost the war and were forced to end slavery, and during the following Reconstruction Era the Republicans remained the most popular party nationally while the Democrats remained dominant in the South.

During the Fourth Party System from about 1896 to 1932, the Republicans remained the dominant presidential party, although Democrats Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were both elected to two terms (non-consecutively in the case of the former).

The 1932 United States elections saw the onset of the Fifth Party System and a long period of Democratic dominance due to the New Deal Coalition. Democrat President Franklin D. Roosevelt won landslides in four consecutive elections. Other than the two terms of Republican Dwight Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961, Democrats retained firm control of the presidency until the mid-1960s. In Congress, Democrats retained majorities in both houses for 60 years until the Republican Revolution, broken only by brief Republican majorities.

There was a significant change in U.S. politics in 1960, and this is seen by some as a transition to a sixth party system.

Since the mid-1960s, despite a couple of landslides (such as Richard Nixon carrying 49 states and 61% of the popular vote over George McGovern in 1972; Ronald Reagan carrying 49 states and 58% of the popular vote over Walter Mondale in 1984), presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the presidency for more than three consecutive terms.

Throughout every American party system, no third party has won a presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress. Despite that, third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support. In the election of 1912, Theodore Roosevelt won 27% of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a Progressive. In the 1992 presidential election, Ross Perot won 19% of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent.

Modern American politics, in particular the electoral college system, has been described as duopolistic since the Republican and Democratic parties have dominated and framed policy debate as well as the public discourse on matters of national concern for about a century and a half. Third Parties have encountered various blocks in getting onto ballots at different levels of government as well as other electoral obstacles, such as denial of access to general election debates. Since 1987, the Commission on Presidential Debates, established by the Republican and Democratic parties themselves, supplanted debates run since 1976 by the League of Women Voters. The League withdrew its support in protest in 1988 over objections of alleged stagecraft such as rules for camera placement, filling the audience with supporters, approved moderators, predetermined question selection, room temperature and others. The Commission maintains its own rules for admittance and has only admitted a single third-party candidate to a televised debate, Ross Perot, in 1992.

Some parts of the US have had their own party systems, distinct from the rest of the country.
* In Puerto Rico, there is a multi-party system with the Popular Democratic Party and New Progressive Party being the two strongest parties. Minor parties in the 2021 legislature include the Puerto Rican Independence Party, Citizens&#x27; Victory Movement and Project Dignity.
* In Guam, the Popular Party was the only political party from 1949-1954, and was dominant until 1967 when they became affiliated with the Democrats. Since then, the Democrats and Republicans have been the two main parties.
* In the Northern Mariana Islands, the Democrats and Republicans are the two main parties but as recently as 2013, the Governor was a member of the Covenant Party.
* In American Samoa, the American Samoa Fono (territorial legislature) is non-partisan, and on ballots only candidate names are displayed, not political parties. The Governor has typically been either Democrat or Republican.
* In the US Virgin Islands, the Democrats and Republicans have been the main two parties, but two Governors during the 1970s were part of the Independent Citizens Movement, and from 2015-2019 the Governor was an independent.

=== Ghana ===
The Republic of Ghana since its transition to democracy in 1992 have a strongly institutionalized two-party system led by New Patriotic Party and National Democratic Congress.

=== Zimbabwe ===
The politics of Zimbabwe are effectively a two-party system between the Robert Mugabe founded Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and the opposition coalition Movement for Democratic Change.

==Australia==
===House of Representatives===

Since the 1920s, the Australian House of Representatives (and thus the federal government) has in effect been a two-party system.

Since the end of World War II, Australia&#x27;s House of Representatives has been dominated by two factions:
* the centre-left Australian Labor Party
* the centre-right Coalition.

The Coalition has been in government about two thirds of time, broken by four periods of Labor governments: 1972–1975, 1983–1996, 2007–2013, and since 2022.

The ALP is Australia&#x27;s largest and oldest continuing political party, formed in 1891 from the Australian labour movement. The party has branches in every state and territory.

The Coalition is a near-permanent alliance of several parties, primarily the Liberal Party of Australia (Australia&#x27;s 2nd largest party) and National Party of Australia (4th largest). It was formed after the 1922 Australian federal election, when the Nationalist Party (ancestor of today&#x27;s Liberal Party) lost its absolute majority, and was only able to remain in government by allying with the Country Party (now called the National Party). Under the Coalition agreement, if the Coalition forms government then the Prime Minister will be the leader of the Liberals, and the Deputy Prime Minister will be the leader of the Nationals. In theory, disagreements between the Coalition&#x27;s constituent parties would lead to the Coalition being broken. However, the last time that this has happened at the federal level was in 1939-1940.

One reason for Australia&#x27;s two-party system is because the House of Representatives (which chooses the Prime Minister of Australia) is elected through the instant-runoff voting electoral system. Although voters can preference third parties and independents above the major parties, and the voting method has a reduced spoiler effect, there is still only one member per electoral division (ie: a winner-take-all system) and so major parties tend to win the vast majority of seats even if they need to rely on preferences to do so. For example, a Labor candidate may win a seat with 30% of the vote for Labor and 21% from Australian Greens voters who ranked Labor second.

===Senate===

On the other hand, the Australian Senate is effectively a multi-party system, and a Senate majority matching the House is very rare. It uses single transferable vote with multiple Senators for each state/territory. This results in rough proportional representation and as a result, third parties have much more influence and often hold the balance of power. Since 2004, the Australian Greens have been the third largest party in the country, with 8-13% of the national vote and an equivalent amount of Senators. Prior to this, the Australian Democrats was the third largest party. Other current and past parties include One Nation, the Liberal Democrats and Family First.

Some Australian states have seen the rise of minor parties at either the state or federal level (eg: Centre Alliance in South Australia, Katter&#x27;s Australian Party in northern Queensland, and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party in western New South Wales), while some have seen long periods of dominance by one party. Some parties are absent entirely in parts of the country.
* The Australian Capital Territory has had a Labor/Greens coalition government since 2012, opposed by the Liberals (Nationals not present). Labor was in government alone from 2001-2012.
** Notably, the ACT is the only state/territory where the Greens have been in power.
* In the Northern Territory, the two main parties are Labor and the Country Liberal Party (CLP), which aligns with the Coalition at the federal level.
* In Western Australia, the Liberal and National parties are not in a permanent coalition at the state level. At the 2021 Western Australian state election Labor won 53 out of 59 lower house seats in a landslide victory. The National Party won 4 seats making them the official opposition. The Liberals won only 2 seats, putting them on the crossbench.
* In New South Wales and Victoria, the main parties reflect the situation nationally: Labor versus the Coalition of the Liberals and Nationals. NSW is the only state where the Coalition has never split, but has also never merged into one party.
* In South Australia and Tasmania, the main parties are Labor and the Liberals, with the Nationals not holding any seats.
* In Queensland, the main parties are Labor and the Liberal-National Party (LNP). Historically, the Country Party was the largest Coalition member and they governed the state from 1957 until 1989. This was partially due to a malapportionment which heavily favoured rural seats. It had been originally designed by a Labor government, but ended up benefitting the Country Party as demographics shifted. Later, Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen increased his power by using Queensland Police to suppress political dissent, and enacted the Bjelkemander, worsening malapportionment in order to reduce the power of the Liberals so his Country Party could rule alone. Eventually, media reports and the Fitzgerald Inquiry revealed wide-ranging corruption police and government. Bjelke-Petersen was forced to resign in disgrace, while many high-ranking police and politicians were criminally charged. Labor has been in power for most of the time since then, with the state Country and Liberal parties merging into the LNP, which is a member of the Coalition federally.

==Latin America==
Most Latin American countries also have presidential systems very similar to the US often with winner takes all systems. Due to the common accumulation of power in the presidential office both the official party and the main opposition became important political protagonists causing historically two-party systems. Some of the first manifestations of this particularity was with the liberals and conservatives that often fought for power in all Latin America causing the first two-party systems in most Latin American countries which often lead to civil wars in places like Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Venezuela, the Central American Republic and Peru, with fights focusing specially on opposing/defending the privileges of the Catholic Church and the creole aristocracy. Other examples of primitive two-party systems included the Pelucones versus Pipiolos in Chile, Federalists versus Unitarians in Argentina, Colorados versus Liberals in Paraguay and Colorados versus Nationals in Uruguay.

As in other regions, the original rivalry between liberals and conservatives was overtaken by a rivalry between center-left (often social-democratic) parties versus center-right liberal conservative parties, focusing more in economic differences than in cultural and religious differences as it was common during the liberal versus conservative period. Examples of this include National Liberation Party versus Social Christian Unity Party in Costa Rica, the peronista Justicialist Party versus Radical Civic Union in Argentina, Democratic Action versus COPEI in Venezuela, the Colombian Liberal Party versus the Colombian Conservative Party in Colombia, Democratic Revolutionary Party versus Panameñista Party in Panama and Liberal Party versus National Party in Honduras. After the democratization of Central America following the end of the Central American crisis in the 1990s former far-left guerrillas and former right-wing authoritarian parties, now in peace, make some similar two-party systems in countries like Nicaragua between the Sandinista National Liberation Front and the Liberals and in El Salvador between the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front and the Nationalist Republican Alliance.

The traditional two-party dynamic started to break after a while, especially in the early 2000s; alternative parties won elections breaking the traditional two-party systems including Rafael Caldera&#x27;s (National Convergence) victory in Venezuela in 1993, Álvaro Uribe (Colombia First) victory in 2002, Tabaré Vázquez (Broad Front) victory in Uruguay in 2004, Fernando Lugo (Christian Democratic Party) victory in Paraguay in 2008, Ricardo Martinelli (Democratic Change) victory in 2009 in Panama, Luis Guillermo Solís (Citizens&#x27; Action Party) victory in 2014 in Costa Rica, Mauricio Macri (Republican Proposal) victory in 2015 in Argentina, Nayib Bukele (Grand Alliance for National Unity) victory in 2019 in El Salvador, and Gabriel Boric (Approve Dignity) victory in 2021, all of them from non-traditional third parties in their respective countries. In some countries like Argentina, Chile and Venezuela the political system is now split in two large multi-party alliances or blocs, one on the left and one on the right of the spectrum, such as Frente de Todos versus Juntos por el Cambio in Argentina, and the Unitary Platform versus Great Patriotic Pole in Venezuela.

=== Brazil ===

During the imperial period, since 1840, two great parties with a national base alternated its dominance between legislatures: the Liberal and the Conservative. These parties were dissolved in 1889, after the republic was instituted in Brazil, in which the registration of party directories came under the jurisdiction of the states.

Brazil also had a two-party system for most of its military dictatorship (1964–1985): on October 27, 1965, the Institutional Act 2 decree banned all existing parties and conditioned the creation of new parties to the quorum of 1/3 of the then-elected National Congress; resulting in the creation of two parties: a pro-government party, the National Renewal Alliance (ARENA) and an opposition party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB). Despite officially having a bipartisan system, complex electoral mechanisms, nominally neutral, were created to guarantee the prevalence of the ARENA in the National Congress, making Brazil, in practice, a dominant-party system in that period. The two parties were dissolved in 1979, when the regime allowed other parties to form.

== Asia ==

=== Lebanon ===

The Parliament of Lebanon is mainly made up of two bipartisan alliances. Although both alliances are made up of several political parties on both ends of the political spectrum the two-way political situation has mainly arisen due to strong ideological differences in the electorate. Once again this can mainly be attributed to the winner takes all thesis.

=== South Korea ===

South Korea has a multi-party system that has sometimes been described as having characteristics of a two-party system. Parties will have reconstructions based upon its leader, but the country continues to maintain two major parties. Currently these parties are the liberal Democratic Party of Korea and the conservative People Power Party.

==Comparison with other systems==

Two-party systems can be contrasted with:

*Multi-party systems. In these, the effective number of parties is greater than two but usually fewer than five; in a two-party system, the effective number of parties is two (according to one analysis, the actual average number of parties varies between 1.7 and 2.1). The parties in a multi-party system can control government separately or as a coalition; in a two-party system, coalition governments rarely form. Nations with multi-party systems include Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Ukraine, Suriname, Sweden and Thailand.

*Dominant-party systems are present where a dominant party holds a vast majority for decades and the party institutions may be intertwined with, or hard to distinguish from the major institutions of the state. Unlike in one-party-states, civil rights and freedom of press may be preserved. This can occur in countries which are formally democratic (such as the case of the People&#x27;s Action Party of Singapore, the African National Congress of South Africa, the Colorado Party in Paraguay, the SWAPO in Namibia, and the Dominica Labour Party in Dominica) or in countries which are only nominally democratic, where the allowance of the existence of multiple parties is merely a front to give the illusion of a democratic system (such as the case of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Tajikistan in Tajikistan, the New Azerbaijan Party in Azerbaijan, the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan in Turkmenistan, United Russia in Russia, the Union for the Republic in Togo, the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea in Equatorial Guinea, and the Cameroon People&#x27;s Democratic Movement in Cameroon).

*One-party systems happen in nations where no more than one party is codified in law and/or officially recognized, or where alternate parties are restricted (sometimes constitutionally) by or in favor of the dominant party which wields power. Examples are rule by the Communist Party of Vietnam and Communist Party of Cuba in the former case, and the Chinese Communist Party and Workers&#x27; Party of Korea in the latter case.

==Causes==
There are several reasons why, in some systems, two major parties dominate the political landscape. There has been speculation that a two-party system arose in the United States from early political battling between the federalists and anti-federalists in the first few decades after the ratification of the Constitution, according to several views. In addition, there has been more speculation that the winner-takes-all electoral system as well as particular state and federal laws regarding voting procedures helped to cause a two-party system.

Political scientists such as Maurice Duverger and William H. Riker claim that there are strong correlations between voting rules and type of party system. Jeffrey D. Sachs agreed that there was a link between voting arrangements and the effective number of parties. Sachs explained how the first-past-the-post voting arrangement tended to promote a two-party system:

Consider a system in which voters can vote for any candidate from any one of many parties. Suppose further that if a party gets 15% of votes, then that party will win 15% of the seats in the legislature. This is termed &quot;proportional representation&quot; or more accurately as &quot;party-proportional representation&quot;. Political scientists speculate that proportional representation leads logically to multi-party systems, since it allows new parties to build a niche in the legislature:

In contrast, a voting system that allows only a single winner for each possible legislative seat is sometimes termed a single-winner voting system and is usually described under the heading of a &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; arrangement in the case of a plurality voting system. Each voter can cast a single vote for any candidate within any given legislative district, but the candidate with the most votes wins the seat, although variants, such as requiring a majority, are sometimes used. What happens is that in a general election, a party that consistently comes in third in every district is unlikely to win any legislative seats even if there is a significant proportion of the electorate favoring its positions. This arrangement strongly favors large and well-organized political parties that are able to appeal to voters in many districts and hence win many seats, and discourages smaller or regional parties. Politically oriented people consider their only realistic way to capture political power is to run under the auspices of the two dominant parties, and legislators from both dominant parties have an incentive not to reform the system as it eliminates potential choices and multiple competing policy options, meaning that they do not necessarily need to adopt positions favorable to voters, but only need to be seen as marginally less unfavorable than the only other option to gain votes.

In the U.S., forty-eight states have a standard &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; electoral system for amassing presidential votes in the Electoral College system. The &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; principle applies in presidential elections, since if a presidential candidate gets the most votes in any particular state, &quot;all&quot; of the electoral votes from that state are awarded. In all but two states, Maine and Nebraska, the presidential candidate winning a plurality of votes wins all of the electoral votes, a practice called the unit rule.

Duverger concluded that &quot;plurality election single-ballot procedures are likely to produce two-party systems, whereas proportional representation and runoff designs encourage multipartyism.&quot; He suggested there were two reasons why &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; systems leads to a two-party system. First, the weaker parties are pressured to form an alliance, sometimes called a &quot;fusion&quot;, to try to become big enough to challenge a large dominant party and, in so doing, gain political clout in the legislature. Second, voters learn, over time, not to vote for candidates outside of one of the two large parties since their votes for third party candidates are usually ineffectual. As a result, weaker parties are eliminated by voters over time. Duverger pointed to statistics and tactics to suggest that voters tended to gravitate towards one of the two main parties, a phenomenon which he called &quot;polarization&quot;, and tend to shun third parties. For example, some analysts suggest that the Electoral College system in the United States, by favoring a system of winner-takes-all in presidential elections, is a structural choice favoring only two major parties.

Gary Cox suggested that America&#x27;s two-party system was highly related with economic prosperity in the country:

However, as of 2022, United States&#x27; Gini coefficient (which measures income inequality) ranks near the worst of OECD countries and in the bottom half of all countries, while the country ranks outside the top five countries in terms of GDP per capita.

An effort in 2012 by centrist groups to promote ballot access by third-party candidates called Americans Elect spent $15 million to get ballot access but failed to elect any candidates. The lack of choice in a two-party model in politics has often been compared to the variety of choices in the marketplace.

==Third parties==
Third parties, meaning a party other than one of the two dominant parties, are possible in two-party systems, but they are often unlikely to exert much influence by gaining control of legislatures or by winning elections. While there are occasional opinions in the media expressed about the possibility of third parties emerging in the United States, for example, political insiders such as the 1980 presidential candidate John Anderson think the chances of one appearing in the early twenty-first century is remote. A report in &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that American politics has been &quot;stuck in a two-way fight between Republicans and Democrats&quot; since the Civil War, and that third-party runs had little meaningful success.

Third parties in a two-party system can be:
* Built around a particular ideology or interest group
* Split off from one of the major parties or
* Focused on a charismatic individual.
When third parties are built around an ideology which is at odds with the majority mindset, many members belong to such a party not for the purpose of expecting electoral success but rather for personal or psychological reasons. In the U.S., third parties include older ones such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party and newer ones such as the Pirate Party. Many believe that third parties do not affect American politics by winning elections, but they can act as &quot;spoilers&quot; by taking votes from one of the two major parties. They act like barometers of change in the political mood since they push the major parties to consider their demands. An analysis in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; by Ryan Lizza in 2006 suggested that third parties arose from time to time in the nineteenth century around single-issue movements such as abolition, women&#x27;s suffrage, and the direct election of senators, but were less prominent in the twentieth century.

A so-called &quot;third party&quot; in the United Kingdom were historically the Liberal Democrats, prior to the Scottish National Party taken its place since the 2015 election by number of the House of Common seats. In the 2010 election, the Liberal Democrats received 23% of the votes but only 9% of the seats in the House of Commons. While electoral results do not necessarily translate into legislative seats, the Liberal Democrats can exert influence if there is a situation such as a hung parliament. In this instance, neither of the two main parties (at present, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party) have sufficient authority to run the government. Accordingly, the Liberal Democrats can in theory exert tremendous influence in such a situation since they can ally with one of the two main parties to form a coalition. This happened in the coalition government of 2010. The two party system in the United Kingdom allows for other parties to exist, although the main two parties tend to dominate politics (for example, the aforementioned coalition government was the first multi-party government since the government of Winston Churchill in the early- to mid-1940s); in this arrangement, other parties are not excluded and can win seats in Parliament. In contrast, the two party system in the United States has been described as a duopoly or an enforced two-party system, such that politics is almost entirely dominated by either the Republicans or Democrats, and third parties rarely win seats in Congress, state legislatures, or even at the local level.

==Advantages==
Some historians have suggested that two-party systems promote centrism and encourage political parties to find common positions which appeal to wide swaths of the electorate. It can lead to political stability, which leads, in turn, to economic growth. Historian Patrick Allitt of the Teaching Company suggested that it is difficult to overestimate the long-term economic benefits of political stability. Sometimes two-party systems have been seen as preferable to multi-party systems because they are simpler to govern, with less fractiousness and greater harmony, since it discourages radical minor parties, while multi-party systems can sometimes lead to hung parliaments. Italy, with a multi-party system, has had years of divisive politics since 2000, although analyst Silvia Aloisi suggested in 2008 that the nation may be moving closer to a two-party arrangement, although this no longer seemed the case by the 2010s, which saw the rise of the Five Star Movement and Lega. The two-party system has generally been identified as simpler since there are fewer voting choices.

==Disadvantages==
Two-party systems have been criticized for downplaying alternative views, being less competitive, failing the median voter theorem, encouraging voter apathy since there is a perception of fewer choices, and putting a damper on debate within a nation. In a proportional representation system, lesser parties can moderate policy since they are not usually eliminated from government. One analyst suggested the two-party approach may not promote inter-party compromise but may encourage partisanship. In &quot;The Tyranny of the Two-party system&quot;, Lisa Jane Disch criticizes two-party systems for failing to provide enough options since only two choices are permitted on the ballot. She wrote:

There have been arguments that the winner-take-all mechanism discourages independent or third-party candidates from running for office or promulgating their views. Ross Perot&#x27;s former campaign manager wrote that the problem with having only two parties is that the nation loses &quot;the ability for things to bubble up from the body politic and give voice to things that aren&#x27;t being voiced by the major parties.&quot; One analyst suggested that parliamentary systems, which typically are multi-party in nature, lead to a better &quot;centralization of policy expertise&quot; in government. Multi-party governments permit wider and more diverse viewpoints in government, and encourage dominant parties to make deals with weaker parties to form winning coalitions. Analyst Chris Weigant of &quot;the Huffington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;the parliamentary system is inherently much more open to minority parties getting much better representation than third parties do in the American system&quot;. After an election in which the party changes, there can be a &quot;polar shift in policy-making&quot; when voters react to changes.

Political analyst A. G. Roderick, writing in his book &quot;Two Tyrants&quot;, argued that the two American parties (the Republican Party and the Democratic Party) were highly unpopular (as of 2015), are not part of the political framework of state governments, and do not represent the 47% of the electorate who identify themselves as &quot;independents&quot;. He makes a case that the American president should be elected on a non-partisan basis, and asserts that both political parties are &quot;cut from the same cloth of corruption and corporate influence.&quot;

Others have accused two party systems of encouraging an environment which stifles individual thought processes and analysis. In a two party system, knowledge about political leaning facilitates assumptions to be made about an individual&#x27;s opinions on a wide variety of topics (e.g. abortion, taxes, the space program, a viral pandemic, human sexuality, the environment, warfare, opinions on police, etc.) which are not necessarily connected.&quot;The more destructive problem is the way this skews the discussion of the issues facing the nation. The media – meaning news sources from Fox News to the &quot;New York Times&quot; and everything in between – seem largely incapable of dealing with any issue outside of the liberal versus conservative paradigm. Whether it&#x27;s dealing with ISIS, the debt ceiling, or climate change, the media frames every issue as a simple debate between the Democratic and the Republican positions. This creates the ludicrous idea that every public policy problem has two, and only two, approaches. That&#x27;s nonsense. Certainly some problems have only two resolutions, some have only one, but most have a range of possible solutions. But the &quot;national&quot; debate presents every issue as a simplistic duality, which trivializes everything.&quot;

==History==
===British parties===
The two-party system, in the sense of the looser definition, where two parties dominate politics but in which third parties can elect members and gain some representation in the legislature, can be traced to the development of political parties in the United Kingdom. There was a division in English politics at the time of the Civil War and Glorious Revolution in the late 17th century. The Whigs supported Protestant constitutional monarchy against absolute rule and the Tories, originating in the Royalist (or &quot;Cavalier&quot;) faction of the English Civil War, were conservative royalist supporters of a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the republican tendencies of Parliament. In the following century, the Whig party&#x27;s support base widened to include emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants.

The basic matters of principle that defined the struggle between the two factions, were concerning the nature of constitutional monarchy, the desirability of a Catholic king, the extension of religious toleration to nonconformist Protestants, and other issues that had been put on the liberal agenda through the political concepts propounded by John Locke, Algernon Sidney and others.

Vigorous struggle between the two factions characterised the period from the Glorious Revolution to the 1715 Hanoverian succession, over the legacy of the overthrow of the Stuart dynasty and the nature of the new constitutional state. This proto two-party system fell into relative abeyance after the accession to the throne of George I and the consequent period of Whig supremacy under Robert Walpole, during which the Tories were systematically purged from high positions in government. Although the Tories were dismissed from office for 50 years, they retained a measure of party cohesion under William Wyndham and acted as a united, though unavailing, opposition to Whig corruption and scandals. At times they cooperated with the &quot;Opposition Whigs&quot;, Whigs who were in opposition to the Whig government. The ideological gap between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party.

===British emergence===
The old Whig leadership dissolved in the 1760s into a decade of factional chaos with distinct &quot;Grenvillite&quot;, &quot;Bedfordite&quot;, &quot;Rockinghamite&quot;, and &quot;Chathamite&quot; factions successively in power, and all referring to themselves as &quot;Whigs&quot;. Out of this chaos, the first distinctive parties emerged. The first such party was the Rockingham Whigs under the leadership of Charles Watson-Wentworth and the intellectual guidance of the political philosopher Edmund Burke. Burke laid out a philosophy that described the basic framework of the political party as &quot;a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed&quot;. As opposed to the instability of the earlier factions, which were often tied to a particular leader and could disintegrate if removed from power, the two party system was centred on a set of core principles held by both sides and that allowed the party out of power to remain as the Loyal Opposition to the governing party.
A genuine two-party system began to emerge, with the accession to power of William Pitt the Younger in 1783 leading the new Tories, against a reconstituted &quot;Whig&quot; party led by the radical politician Charles James Fox.

The two-party system matured in the early 19th century era of political reform, when the franchise was widened and politics entered into the basic divide between conservatism and liberalism that has fundamentally endured up to the present. The modern Conservative Party was created out of the &quot;Pittite&quot; Tories by Robert Peel, who issued the Tamworth Manifesto in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism – the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive, but an opposition to unnecessary change, that could lead to &quot;a perpetual vortex of agitation&quot;. Meanwhile, the Whigs, along with free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel, and independent Radicals, formed the Liberal Party under Lord Palmerston in 1859, and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle-class, under the long leadership of William Ewart Gladstone. The two party system had come of age at the time of Gladstone and his Conservative rival Benjamin Disraeli after the Reform Act 1867.

===American===
Although the Founding Fathers of the United States did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan, early political controversies in the 1790s saw the emergence of a two-party political system, the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party, centred on the differing views on federal government powers of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. A consensus on these issues ended party politics in 1816 for a decade, a period commonly known as the Era of Good Feelings.

Partisan politics revived in 1829 with the split of the Democratic-Republican Party into the Jacksonian Democrats led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, led by Henry Clay. The former evolved into the modern Democratic Party and the latter was replaced with the Republican Party as one of the two main parties in the 1850s.

<text>The Day After is an American television film that first aired on November 20, 1983, on the ABC television network. The film postulates a fictional war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact over Germany that rapidly escalates into a full-scale nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. The action itself focuses on the residents of Lawrence, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri, and several family farms near American missile silos. The cast includes JoBeth Williams, Steve Guttenberg, John Cullum, Jason Robards, and John Lithgow. The film was written by Edward Hume, produced by Robert Papazian, and directed by Nicholas Meyer.

More than 100 million people, in nearly 39 million households, watched the film during its initial broadcast. With a 46 rating and a 62% share of the viewing audience during the initial broadcast, the film was the seventh-highest-rated non-sports show until then, and in a 2009 Nielsen TV Ratings list was one of the highest-rated television films in US history.

The film was broadcast on Soviet state television in 1987, during the negotiations on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The producers demanded the Russian translation conform to the original script and the broadcast not be interrupted by commentary.

== Plot ==

Dr. Russell Oakes works at a hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, and spends time with family as his daughter Marilyn prepares to move away. In nearby Harrisonville, farmer Jim Dahlberg and family hold a wedding rehearsal for his eldest daughter Denise. Airman Billy McCoy, serving with the 351st Strategic Missile Wing, is stationed at a Minuteman launch site in nearby Sweetsage, one of many such silos in western Missouri. Next to the site, the Hendrys tend to their farm chores and mind their children. Background television and radio reports reveal information about a Soviet buildup on the East German border. East Germany blockades West Berlin, and the United States issues an ultimatum and places its forces on alert, recalling McCoy from his family at Whiteman Air Force Base.

The following day, NATO attempts to break through the blockade at Helmstedt-Marienborn. Warsaw Pact MiGs hit Würzburg, West Germany. Moscow is evacuated. At the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, near Kansas City, the word goes out that the Soviets have invaded West Germany. Soviet forces drive toward the Rhine in an armored thrust, using tactical nuclear weapons. Pre-med student Stephen Klein decides to hitchhike home to Joplin, Missouri, while Denise&#x27;s fiancé Bruce witnesses a crowd of shoppers frantically pulling items off the shelves as both sides attack naval targets in the Persian Gulf. Jim prepares his cellar. People start to flee Kansas City, and the Emergency Broadcast System is activated. NATO attempts to halt the advance by airbursting three nuclear warheads over Soviet troops, while a Soviet nuclear device destroys the NATO headquarters in Brussels. US Air Force personnel aboard the SAC Airborne Command Post receive notification of an incoming wave of 300 ICBMs, then activate their missile launch protocols, sending a wave of ICBMs towards Russia. The film leaves who fired first deliberately unclear.

McCoy flees his now-empty silo, telling his fellow airmen the war&#x27;s effectively over. A high-altitude nuclear explosion&#x27;s EMP disables vehicles and destroys the power grid. Nuclear missiles rain across the region on both military and civilian targets. Kansas City&#x27;s last minutes are frantic. Bruce, Marilyn Oakes, the Hendrys and McCoy&#x27;s family are among the thousands of people incinerated, while the young Danny Dahlberg is flash-blinded. Dr. Oakes, stranded on the highway, walks to University Hospital at Lawrence, takes charge, and begins treating patients. Klein finds the Dahlberg home and begs for refuge in the family&#x27;s basement.

Oakes receives fallout reports by shortwave from KU professor Joe Huxley in the science building: travel outdoors is fatal. Patients continue to come and supplies dwindle. Delirious after days in the basement shelter, Denise runs outside; Klein retrieves her, but both are exposed to the thick radioactive dust. McCoy heads towards Sedalia until he learns of its destruction from passing refugees. He befriends a mute man and travels to the hospital, where he dies of radiation poisoning. Oakes bonds with Nurse Nancy Bauer, who later dies of meningitis, and a pregnant woman pleads with him to tell her she&#x27;s wrong to be hopeless.

In a radio speech, the U.S. President announces a ceasefire, promises relief, and stresses no surrender and a reliance on American principles, set to shots of filthy, listless, or dead Americans among the ruins. Attempts at aid from the National Guard and infrastructural redevelopment prove fruitless, and summary executions become commonplace. Jim Dahlberg is eventually killed by squatters, while Denise, Klein, and Oakes are wasting away from radiation sickness. Returning to Kansas City to see his old home one last time, Oakes witnesses National Guardsmen blindfolding and executing looters. He finds squatters in the ruins of his home and attempts to drive them off, but is instead offered food. Oakes collapses and weeps, and one of the squatters comforts him. The film ends with an overlying audio clip of Huxley&#x27;s voice on the radio as the screen fades to black, asking if anybody can still hear him, only to be met with silence until the credits, as a Morse code signal transmits a single message to the viewer: M-A-D.

Most versions of &quot;The Day After&quot; include a textual ending disclaimer just before the end credits, stating that the film is fictional and that the real-life outcome of a nuclear war would be much worse than the events portrayed onscreen.

== Production ==

&quot;The Day After&quot; was the idea of ABC Motion Picture Division President Brandon Stoddard, who, after watching &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;, was so impressed that he envisioned creating a film exploring the effects of nuclear war on the United States. Stoddard asked his executive vice president of television movies and miniseries, Stu Samuels, to develop a script. Samuels created the title &quot;The Day After&quot; to emphasize that the story was about, not a nuclear war itself, but the aftermath. Samuels suggested several writers, and eventually, Stoddard commissioned the veteran television writer Edward Hume to write the script in 1981. ABC, which financed the production, was concerned about the graphic nature of the film and how to portray the subject appropriately on a family-oriented television channel. Hume undertook a massive amount of research on nuclear war and went through several drafts until ABC finally deemed the plot and characters acceptable.

Originally, the film was based more around and in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City was not bombed in the original script although Whiteman Air Force Base was, which made Kansas City suffer shock waves and the horde of survivors staggering into town. There was no Lawrence, Kansas in the story although there was a small Kansas town called &quot;Hampton.&quot; While Hume was writing the script, he and the producer Robert Papazian, who had great experience in on-location shooting, took several trips to Kansas City to scout locations and met with officials from the Kansas film commission and from the Kansas tourist offices to search for a suitable location for &quot;Hampton.&quot; It came down to a choice of either Warrensburg, Missouri, and Lawrence, Kansas, both college towns. Warrensburg was home of Central Missouri State University and was near Whiteman Air Force Base, and Lawrence was home of the University of Kansas and was near Kansas City. Hume and Papazian ended up selecting Lawrence because of the access to a number of good locations: a university, a hospital, football and basketball venues, farms, and a flat countryside. Lawrence was also agreed upon as being the &quot;geographic center&quot; of the United States. The Lawrence people were urging ABC to change the name &quot;Hampton&quot; to &quot;Lawrence&quot; in the script.

Back in Los Angeles, the idea of making a TV movie showing the true effects of nuclear war on average American citizens was still stirring up controversy. ABC, Hume, and Papazian realized that for the scene depicting the nuclear blast, they would have to use state-of-the-art special effects and so took the first step by hiring some of the best special effects people in the business to draw up some storyboards for the complicated blast scene. ABC then hired Robert Butler to direct the project. For several months, the group worked on drawing up storyboards and revising the script again and again. Then, in early 1982, Butler was forced to leave &quot;The Day After&quot; because of other contractual commitments. ABC then offered the project to two other directors, who both turned it down. Finally, in May, ABC hired the feature film director Nicholas Meyer, who had just completed the blockbuster &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Meyer was apprehensive at first and doubted ABC would get away with making a television film on nuclear war without the censors diminishing its effect. However, after reading the script, Meyer agreed to direct &quot;The Day After&quot;.

Meyer wanted to make sure that he would film the script he was offered. He did not want the censors to censor the film or the film to be a regular Hollywood disaster movie from the start. Meyer figured the more &quot;The Day After&quot; resembled such a film, the less effective it would be, and he preferred to present the facts of nuclear war to viewers. He made it clear to ABC that no big TV or film stars should be in &quot;The Day After&quot;. ABC agreed but wanted to have one star to help attract European audiences to the film when it would be shown theatrically there. Later, while flying to visit his parents in New York City, Meyer happened to be on the same plane with Jason Robards and asked him to join the cast.

Meyer plunged into several months of nuclear research, which made him quite pessimistic about the future, to the point of becoming ill each evening when he came home from work. Meyer and Papazian also made trips to the ABC censors and to the United States Department of Defense during their research phase and experienced conflicts with both. Meyer had many heated arguments over elements in the script that the network censors wanted cut out of the film. The Department of Defense said that it would cooperate with ABC if the script clarified that the Soviets launched their missiles first, which Meyer and Papazian took pains not to do.

Meyer, Papazian, Hume, and several casting directors spent most of July 1982 taking numerous trips to Kansas City. In between casting in Los Angeles, where they relied mostly on unknowns, they would fly to the Kansas City area to interview local actors and scout scenery. They were hoping to find some real Midwesterners for smaller roles. Hollywood casting directors strolled through shopping malls in Kansas City to look for local people to fill small and supporting roles, the daily newspaper in Lawrence ran an advertisement calling for local residents to sign up as extras, and a professor of theater and film at the University of Kansas was hired to head up local casting. Out of the eighty or so speaking parts, only fifteen were cast in Los Angeles. The remaining roles were filled in Kansas City and Lawrence.

While in Kansas City, Meyer and Papazian toured the Federal Emergency Management Agency offices in Kansas City. When asked about its plans for surviving nuclear war, a FEMA official replied that it was experimenting with putting evacuation instructions in telephone books in New England. &quot;In about six years, everyone should have them.&quot; That meeting led Meyer to later refer to FEMA as &quot;a complete joke.&quot; It was during that time that the decision was made to change &quot;Hampton&quot; in the script to &quot;Lawrence.&quot; Meyer and Hume figured since Lawrence was a real town, it would be more believable, and besides, it was a perfect choice to play a representative of Middle America. The town boasted a &quot;socio-cultural mix,&quot; sat near the exact geographic center of the Continental U.S., and was a prime missile target according to Hume and Meyer&#x27;s research because 150 Minuteman missile silos stood nearby. Lawrence had some great locations, and its people were more supportive of the project. Suddenly, less emphasis was put on Kansas City, the decision was made to have the city annihilated in the script, and Lawrence was made the primary location in the film.

=== Editing ===
ABC originally planned to air &quot;The Day After&quot; as a four-hour &quot;television event&quot; that would be spread over two nights with a total running time of 180 minutes without commercials. The director Nicholas Meyer felt the original script was padded, and suggested cutting out an hour of material to present the whole film in one night. The network stuck with its two-night broadcast plan, and Meyer filmed the entire three-hour script, as evidenced by a 172-minute workprint that has surfaced. Subsequently, the network found that it was difficult to find advertisers because of the subject matter . ABC relented and allowed Meyer to edit the film for a one-night broadcast version. Meyer&#x27;s original single-night cut ran two hours and twenty minutes, which he presented to the network. After that screening, many executives were deeply moved, and some even cried, which led Meyer to believe they approved of his cut.

Nevertheless, a further six-month struggle ensued over the final shape of the film. Network censors had opinions about the inclusion of specific scenes, and ABC itself was eventually intent on &quot;trimming the film to the bone&quot; and made demands to cut out many scenes that Meyer strongly lobbied to keep. Finally, Meyer and his editor, Bill Dornisch, balked. Dornisch was fired, and Meyer walked away from the project. ABC brought in other editors, but the network ultimately was not happy with the results they produced. It finally brought Meyer back and reached a compromise, with Meyer paring down &quot;The Day After&quot; to a final running time of 120 minutes.

=== &quot;The Day Before&quot; campaign ===
Josh Baran and Mark Graham were anti-nuclear activists who were secretly given a bootleg copy of the film by Nick Meyer prior to the ABC broadcast. They sent copies of the film to various peace groups, interviewed peace leaders about the film, and held screenings in homes, bars, and restaurants. There were post-screening discussion groups and town hall meetings. They held private screenings for the media, like &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and the BBC. As word got out about the film, higher ups wanted to see it including members of the House of Commons, and even the Pope. Baran and Graham called it &quot;The Day Before&quot; project to hijack ABC&#x27;s marketing of the film. One scholar said they &quot;pioneered the piggybacking of a public issue onto the release of a commercial media product&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the greatest PR campaign in history.&quot;

The consequences of Meyer&#x27;s bootleg copy and subsequent &quot;The Day Before&quot; PR campaign was a groundswell of public interest and discussion before the film was ever broadcast. This made it difficult for ABC executives to kill the film, because there were rumors they wanted to quietly shelve it, including rumors that Ronald Reagan had hinted to studio executives he didn&#x27;t want the film broadcast.

=== Broadcast ===
&quot;The Day After&quot; was initially scheduled to premiere on ABC in May 1983, but the post-production work to reduce the film&#x27;s length pushed back its initial airdate to November. Censors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about nuclear holocaust and then sitting up screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that it would disturb children. &quot;This strikes me as ludicrous,&quot; Meyer wrote in &quot;TV Guide&quot; at the time, &quot;not only in relation to the rest of the film, but also when contrasted with the huge doses of violence to be found on any average evening of TV viewing.&quot; In any case, a few more cuts were made, including to a scene in which Denise possesses a diaphragm. Another scene in which a hospital patient abruptly sits up screaming was excised from the original television broadcast but restored for home video releases. Meyer persuaded ABC to dedicate the film to the citizens of Lawrence and also to put a disclaimer at the end of the film after the credits to let the viewer know that &quot;The Day After&quot; downplayed the true effects of nuclear war so it could have a story. The disclaimer also included a list of books that provided more information on the subject.

&quot;The Day After&quot; received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Commercials aired several months in advance, and ABC distributed half-a-million &quot;viewer&#x27;s guides&quot; that discussed the dangers of nuclear war and prepared the viewer for the graphic scenes of mushroom clouds and radiation burn victims. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide.

=== Music ===
The composer David Raksin wrote original music and adapted music from &quot;The River&quot;, a documentary film score by the concert composer Virgil Thomson, by featuring an adaptation of the hymn &quot;How Firm a Foundation&quot;. Although he recorded just under 30 minutes of music, much of it was edited out of the final cut. Music from the &quot;First Strike&quot; footage, conversely, was not edited out.

=== Deleted and alternative scenes ===

The film was shortened from the original three hours of running time to two, which caused the scrapping of several planned special-effects scenes although storyboards were made in anticipation of a possible &quot;expanded&quot; version. They included a &quot;bird&#x27;s eye&quot; view of Kansas City at the moment of two nuclear detonations as seen from a Boeing 737 airliner approaching the city&#x27;s airport, simulated newsreel footage of U.S. troops in West Germany taking up positions in preparation of advancing Soviet armored units, and the tactical nuclear exchange in Germany between NATO and the Warsaw Pact after the attacking Warsaw Pact force breaks through and overwhelms the NATO lines.

ABC censors severely toned down scenes to reduce the body count or severe burn victims. Meyer refused to remove key scenes, but reportedly, some eight and a half minutes of excised footage still exist, significantly more graphic. Some footage was reinstated for the film&#x27;s release on home video. Additionally, the nuclear attack scene was longer and supposed to feature very graphic and very accurate shots of what happens to a human body during a nuclear blast. Examples included people being set on fire; their flesh carbonizing; being burned to the bone; eyes melting; faceless heads; skin hanging; deaths from flying glass and debris, limbs torn off, being crushed, and blown from buildings by the shockwave; and people in fallout shelters suffocating during the firestorm. Also cut were images of radiation sickness, as well as graphic post-attack violence from survivors such as food riots, looting, and general lawlessness as authorities attempted to restore order.

One cut scene showed surviving students battling over food. The two sides were to be athletes and the science students under the guidance of Professor Huxley. Another brief scene that was later cut related to a firing squad in which two U.S. soldiers are blindfolded and executed. In that scene, an officer reads the charges, verdict, and sentence as a bandaged chaplain reads the Last Rites. A similar sequence occurs in a 1965 British-produced faux documentary, &quot;The War Game&quot;. In the initial 1983 broadcast of &quot;The Day After&quot;, when the U.S. president addresses the nation, the voice was an imitation of President Reagan, who later stated that he watched the film and was deeply moved. In subsequent broadcasts, that voice was overdubbed by a stock actor.

Home video releases in the U.S. and internationally come in at various running times, many listed at 126 or 127 minutes. Full screen (4:3 aspect ratio) seems to be more common than widescreen. RCA videodiscs of the early 1980s were limited to 2 hours per disc so that full screen release appears to be closest to what originally aired on ABC in the U.S. A 2001 U.S. VHS version (Anchor Bay Entertainment, Troy, Michigan) lists a running time of 122 minutes. A 1995 double laser disc &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; version (Image Entertainment) runs 127 minutes, includes commentary by director Nicholas Meyer and is &quot;presented in its 1.75:1 European theatrical aspect ratio&quot; (according to the LD jacket).

Two different German DVD releases run at 122 and 115 minutes respectively; the edits reportedly downplay the Soviet Union&#x27;s role. A two disc Blu-ray special edition was released in 2018 by the video specialty label Kino Lorber and present the film in high definition. The release contains the 122-minute television cut, presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio as broadcast, as well as the 127-minute theatrical cut, presented in a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.

== Reception ==
On its original broadcast, on Sunday, November 20, 1983, John Cullum warned viewers before the film was premiered that the film contains graphic and disturbing scenes and encouraged parents who had young children watching to watch together and discuss the issues of nuclear warfare. ABC and local TV affiliates opened 1-800 hotlines with counselors standing by. There were no commercial breaks after the nuclear attack scenes. ABC then aired a live debate on &quot;Viewpoint&quot;, ABC&#x27;s occasional discussion program hosted by &quot;Nightline&quot;″s Ted Koppel, featuring the scientist Carl Sagan, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Elie Wiesel, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, General Brent Scowcroft, and the commentator William F. Buckley Jr. Sagan argued against nuclear proliferation, but Buckley promoted the concept of nuclear deterrence. Sagan described the arms race in the following terms: &quot;Imagine a room awash in gasoline, and there are two implacable enemies in that room. One of them has nine thousand matches, the other seven thousand matches. Each of them is concerned about who&#x27;s ahead, who&#x27;s stronger.&quot;

The film and its subject matter were prominently featured in the news media both before and after the broadcast, including on such covers as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report,&quot; and &quot;TV Guide.&quot; Critics tended to claim the film was sensationalizing nuclear war or that it was too tame. The special effects and realistic portrayal of nuclear war received praise. The film received 12 Emmy nominations and won two Emmy awards. It was rated &quot;way above average&quot; in &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; until all reviews for films exclusive to television were removed from the publication.

In the United States, 38.5 million households, or an estimated 100 million people, watched &quot;The Day After&quot; on its first broadcast, a record audience for a made-for-TV movie. Producers Sales Organization released the film theatrically around the world, in the Eastern Bloc, China, North Korea and Cuba (this international version contained six minutes of footage not in the telecast edition). Since commercials are not sold in those markets, Producers Sales Organization failed to gain revenue to the tune of an undisclosed sum. Years later, the international version was released to tape by Embassy Home Entertainment.

The actor and former Nixon adviser Ben Stein, critical of the movie&#x27;s message that the strategy of mutual assured destruction would lead to a war, wrote in the Los Angeles &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot; what life might be like in an America under Soviet occupation. Stein&#x27;s idea was eventually dramatized in the miniseries &quot;Amerika&quot;, also broadcast by ABC. The &quot;New York Post&quot; accused Meyer of being a traitor, writing, &quot;Why is Nicholas Meyer doing Yuri Andropov&#x27;s work for him?&quot; Phyllis Schlafly declared that &quot;This film was made by people who want to disarm the country, and who are willing to make a $7 million contribution to that cause&quot;. Richard Grenier in the &quot;National Review&quot; accused &quot;The Day After&quot; of promoting &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and pro-Soviet attitudes. Much press comment focused on the unanswered question in the film of who started the war. The television critic Matt Zoller Seitz, in his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall, &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;, named &quot;The Day After&quot; as the fourth-greatest American TV movie of all time: &quot;Very possibly the bleakest TV-movie ever broadcast, &quot;The Day After&quot; is an explicitly antiwar statement dedicated entirely to showing audiences what would happen if nuclear weapons were used on civilian populations in the United States.&quot;

=== Effects on policymakers ===

US President Ronald Reagan watched the film more than a month before its screening on Columbus Day, October 10, 1983. He wrote in his diary that the film was &quot;very effective and left me greatly depressed&quot; and that it changed his mind on the prevailing policy on a &quot;nuclear war&quot;. The film was also screened for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A government advisor who attended the screening, a friend of Meyer, told him: &quot;If you wanted to draw blood, you did it. Those guys sat there like they were turned to stone.&quot; In 1987, Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which resulted in the banning and reducing of their nuclear arsenal. In Reagan&#x27;s memoirs, he drew a direct line from the film to the signing. Reagan supposedly later sent Meyer a telegram after the summit: &quot;Don&#x27;t think your movie didn&#x27;t have any part of this, because it did.&quot; During an interview in 2010, Meyer said that the telegram was a myth and that the sentiment stemmed from a friend&#x27;s letter to Meyer. He suggested the story had origins in editing notes received from the White House during the production, which &quot;may have been a joke, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me, him being an old Hollywood guy.&quot; There is also an apocryphal story which claims that, after seeing the film, Ronald Reagan said: &quot;That will not happen on my watch.&quot;

The film also had impact outside the United States. In 1987, during the era of Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; reforms, the film was shown on Soviet television. Four years earlier, Georgia Representative Elliott Levitas and 91 co-sponsors introduced a resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives &quot;[expressing] the sense of the Congress that the American Broadcasting Company, the Department of State, and the U.S. Information Agency should work to have the television movie &quot;The Day After&quot; aired to the Soviet public.&quot;

<text>Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot;. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

== Names ==

In American English, the game is known as &quot;tic-tac-toe&quot;. It may also be spelled &quot;tick-tack-toe&quot;, &quot;tick-tat-toe&quot;, or &quot;tit-tat-toe&quot;.

In Commonwealth English (particularly British, South African, Indian, Australian, and New Zealand English), the game is known as &quot;noughts and crosses&quot;, alternatively spelled &quot;naughts and crosses&quot;. This name derives from the shape of the marks in the game (i.e the X and O); &quot;nought&quot; is another name for the number zero, while &quot;cross&quot; refers to the X shape.

Sometimes, tic-tac-toe (where players keep adding &quot;pieces&quot;) and three men&#x27;s morris (where pieces start to move after a certain number have been placed) are confused with each other.

== Gameplay ==

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

In the following example, the first player (&quot;X&quot;) wins the game in seven steps:
There is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.

Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

The game can be generalized to an &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-game, in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; board with the goal of getting &quot;k&quot; of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the 3,3,3-game. Harary&#x27;s generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as an &quot;n&quot;&quot;d&quot; game, specifically one in which &quot;n&quot; = 3 and &quot;d&quot; = 2. It can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary incidence structure, where rows are lines and cells are points. Tic-tac-toe&#x27;s incidence structure consists of nine points, three horizontal lines, three vertical lines, and two diagonal lines, with each line consisting of at least three points.

== History ==
Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.

An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called &quot;terni lapilli&quot; (&quot;three pebbles at a time&quot;) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game&#x27;s grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is three men&#x27;s morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish, and Picaria, a game of the Puebloans.

The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to &quot;noughts and crosses&quot; (nought being an alternative word for &#x27;zero&#x27;), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;. The first print reference to a game called &quot;tick-tack-toe&quot; occurred in 1884, but referred to &quot;a children&#x27;s game played on a slate, consisting of trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored&quot;. &quot;Tic-tac-toe&quot; may also derive from &quot;tick-tack&quot;, the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The US renaming of &quot;noughts and crosses&quot; to &quot;tic-tac-toe&quot; occurred in the 20th century.

In 1952, &quot;OXO&quot; (or &quot;Noughts and Crosses&quot;), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games. The computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently on display at the Computer History Museum.

== Combinatorics ==
When considering only the state of the board, and after taking into account board symmetries (i.e. rotations and reflections), there are only 138 terminal board positions. A combinatorics study of the game shows that when &quot;X&quot; makes the first move every time, the game outcomes are as follows:
*91 distinct positions are won by (X)
*44 distinct positions are won by (O)
*3 distinct positions are drawn (often called a &quot;cat&#x27;s game&quot;)

== Strategy ==
A player can play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe (to win or at least draw) if, each time it is their turn to play, they choose the first available move from the following list, as used in Newell and Simon&#x27;s 1972 tic-tac-toe program.

#Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.
#Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.
#Fork: Cause a scenario where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
#Blocking an opponent&#x27;s fork: If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player should block it. Otherwise, the player should block all forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to make two in a row. Otherwise, the player should make a two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it does not result in them producing a fork. For example, if &quot;X&quot; has two opposite corners and &quot;O&quot; has the center, &quot;O&quot; must not play a corner move to win. (Playing a corner move in this scenario produces a fork for &quot;X&quot; to win.)
#Center: A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a corner move gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)
#Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.
#Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.
#Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the four sides.

The first player, who shall be designated &quot;X&quot;, has three possible strategically distinct positions to mark during the first turn. Superficially, it might seem that there are nine possible positions, corresponding to the nine squares in the grid. However, by rotating the board, we will find that, in the first turn, every corner mark is strategically equivalent to every other corner mark. The same is true of every edge (side middle) mark. From a strategic point of view, there are therefore only three possible first marks: corner, edge, or center. Player X can win or force a draw from any of these starting marks; however, playing the corner gives the opponent the smallest choice of squares which must be played to avoid losing. This might suggest that the corner is the best opening move for X, however another study shows that if the players are not perfect, an opening move in the center is best for X.

The second player, who shall be designated &quot;O&quot;, must respond to X&#x27;s opening mark in such a way as to avoid the forced win. Player O must always respond to a corner opening with a center mark, and to a center opening with a corner mark. An edge opening must be answered either with a center mark, a corner mark next to the X, or an edge mark opposite the X. Any other responses will allow X to force the win. Once the opening is completed, O&#x27;s task is to follow the above list of priorities in order to force the draw, or else to gain a win if X makes a weak play.

More detailed, to guarantee a draw, O should adopt the following strategies:
* If X plays a corner opening move, O should take center, and then an edge, forcing X to block in the next move. This will stop any forks from happening. When both X and O are perfect players and X chooses to start by marking a corner, O takes the center, and X takes the corner opposite the original. In that case, O is free to choose any edge as its second move. However, if X is not a perfect player and has played a corner and then an edge, O should not play the opposite edge as its second move, because then X is not forced to block in the next move and can fork.
* If X plays edge opening move, O should take center or one of the corners adjacent to X, and then follow the above list of priorities, mainly paying attention to block forks. With perfect play, O can also force a draw by taking the opposite edge from X.
* If X plays the center opening move, O should take a corner, and then follow the above list of priorities, mainly paying attention to block forks.

When X plays corner first, and O is not a perfect player, the following may happen:
* If O responds with a center mark (best move for them), a perfect X player will take the corner opposite the original. Then O should play an edge. However, if O plays a corner as its second move, a perfect X player will mark the remaining corner, blocking O&#x27;s 3-in-a-row and making their own fork.
* If O responds with a corner mark, X is guaranteed to win. By taking any of the other two corners, O can only take the position between the two Xs, then by taking the remaining corner to create a fork, X will win on the next move.
* If O responds with an edge mark, X is guaranteed to win. By taking center, O can only take the corner opposite the corner which X plays first, then by taking a corner to create a fork, X will win on the next move.

=== Further details ===

Consider a board with the nine positions numbered as follows:

When X plays 1 as their opening move, then O should take 5. Then X takes 9 (in this situation, O should not take 3 or 7, O should take 2, 4, 6 or 8):

* X1 → O5 → X9 → O2 → X8 → O7 → X3 → O6 → X4, this game will be a draw.

or 6 (in this situation, O should not take 4 or 7, O should take 2, 3, 8 or 9. In fact, taking 9 is the best move, since a non-perfect player X may take 4, then O can take 7 to win).

* X1 → O5 → X6 → O2 → X8, then O should not take 3, or X can take 7 to win, and O should not take 4, or X can take 9 to win, O should take 7 or 9.
** X1 → O5 → X6 → O2 → X8 → O7 → X3 → O9 → X4, this game will be a draw.
** X1 → O5 → X6 → O2 → X8 → O9 → X4 (7) → O7 (4) → X3, this game will be a draw.
* X1 → O5 → X6 → O3 → X7 → O4 → X8 (9) → O9 (8) → X2, this game will be a draw.
* X1 → O5 → X6 → O8 → X2 → O3 → X7 → O4 → X9, this game will be a draw.
* X1 → O5 → X6 → O9, then X should not take 4, or O can take 7 to win, X should take 2, 3, 7 or 8.
** X1 → O5 → X6 → O9 → X2 → O3 → X7 → O4 → X8, this game will be a draw.
** X1 → O5 → X6 → O9 → X3 → O2 → X8 → O4 (7) → X7 (4), this game will be a draw.
** X1 → O5 → X6 → O9 → X7 → O4 → X2 (3) → O3 (2) → X8, this game will be a draw.
** X1 → O5 → X6 → O9 → X8 → O2 (3, 4, 7) → X4/7 (4/7, 2/3, 2/3) → O7/4 (7/4, 3/2, 3/2) → X3 (2, 7, 4), this game will be a draw.

In both of these situations (X takes 9 or 6 as the second move), X has a property to win.

If X is not a perfect player, X may take 2 or 3 as a second move. Then this game will be a draw, X cannot win.

* X1 → O5 → X2 → O3 → X7 → O4 → X6 → O8 (9) → X9 (8), this game will be a draw.
* X1 → O5 → X3 → O2 → X8 → O4 (6) → X6 (4) → O9 (7) → X7 (9), this game will be a draw.

If X plays 1 opening move, and O is not a perfect player, the following may happen:

Although O takes the only good position (5) as the first move, O takes a bad position as the second move:

* X1 → O5 → X9 → O3 → X7, then X can take 4 or 8 to win.
* X1 → O5 → X6 → O4 → X3, then X can take 7 or 9 to win.
* X1 → O5 → X6 → O7 → X3, then X can take 2 or 9 to win.

Although O takes good positions in the first two moves, O takes a bad position in the third move:

* X1 → O5 → X6 → O2 → X8 → O3 → X7, then X can take 4 or 9 to win.
* X1 → O5 → X6 → O2 → X8 → O4 → X9, then X can take 3 or 7 to win.

O takes a bad position as first move (except of 5, all other positions are bad):

* X1 → O3 → X7 → O4 → X9, then X can take 5 or 8 to win.
* X1 → O9 → X3 → O2 → X7, then X can take 4 or 5 to win.
* X1 → O2 → X5 → O9 → X7, then X can take 3 or 4 to win.
* X1 → O6 → X5 → O9 → X3, then X can take 2 or 7 to win.

== Variations ==
Many board games share the element of trying to be the first to get &quot;n&quot;-in-a-row, including three men&#x27;s morris, nine men&#x27;s morris, pente, gomoku, Qubic, Connect Four, Quarto, Gobblet, Order and Chaos, Toss Across, and Mojo. Tic-tac-toe is an instance of an m,n,k-game, where two players alternate taking turns on an &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; board until one of them gets &quot;k&quot; in a row. Harary&#x27;s generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization. The game can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary hypergraph, where rows are hyperedges and cells are vertices.

Other variations of tic-tac-toe include:
* 3-dimensional tic-tac-toe on a 3×3×3 board. In this game, the first player has an easy win by playing in the centre if 2 people are playing.
One can play on a board of 4x4 squares, winning in several ways. Winning can include: 4 in a straight line, 4 in a diagonal line, 4 in a diamond, or 4 to make a square.

Another variant, Qubic, is played on a 4×4×4 board; it was solved by Oren Patashnik in 1980 (the first player can force a win). Higher dimensional variations are also possible.
* In misère tic-tac-toe, the player wins if the opponent gets &quot;n&quot; in a row. A 3×3 game is a draw. More generally, the first player can draw or win on any board (of any dimension) whose side length is odd, by playing first in the central cell and then mirroring the opponent&#x27;s moves.

* In &quot;wild&quot; tic-tac-toe, players can choose to place either X or O on each move.
* Number Scrabble or Pick15 is isomorphic to tic-tac-toe but on the surface appears completely different. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not be repeated. The game is won by the player who has said three numbers whose sum is 15. If all the numbers are used and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3×3 magic square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged in a straight line if and only if they total 15.

* Another isomorphic game uses a list of nine carefully chosen words, for instance &quot;try&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;any&quot;, &quot;boat&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, &quot;ten&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;fear&quot;. Each player picks one word in turn and to win, a player must select three words with the same letter. The words may be plotted on a tic-tac-toe grid in such a way that a three-in-a-row line wins.
* Numerical tic-tac-toe is a variation invented by the mathematician Ronald Graham. The numbers 1 to 9 are used in this game. The first player plays with the odd numbers, and the second player plays with the even numbers. All numbers can be used only once. The player who puts down 15 points in a line wins (sum of 3 numbers).
* In the 1970s, there was a two-player game made by Tri-ang Toys &amp; Games called &quot;Check Lines&quot;, in which the board consisted of eleven holes arranged in a geometrical pattern of twelve straight lines each containing three of the holes. Each player had exactly five tokens and played in turn placing one token in any of the holes. The winner was the first player whose tokens were arranged in two lines of three (which by definition were intersecting lines). If neither player had won by the tenth turn, subsequent turns consisted of moving one of one&#x27;s own tokens to the remaining empty hole, with the constraint that this move could only be from an adjacent hole.
* There is also a variant of the game with the classic 3×3 field, in which it is necessary to make two rows to win, while the opposing algorithm only needs one.
* Quantum tic-tac-toe allows players to place a quantum superposition of numbers on the board, i.e. the players&#x27; moves are &quot;superpositions&quot; of plays in the original classical game. This variation was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs.

== In popular culture ==
* George Cooper wrote the words and John Rogers Thomas wrote the music for a song &quot;Tit, Tac, Toe&quot; in 1876.
*Episode 452 of &quot;This American Life&quot; recounts the true story of a legal defense team that sought to overturn the state of Florida&#x27;s decision to execute a mentally ill murderer by eliciting a tic-tac-toe-playing chicken as evidence. Arcade games with tic-tac-toe-playing chickens were popular in the mid-1970s; the animals were trained using operant conditioning, with the moves being chosen by computer and indicated to the chicken with a light invisible to the human player.
*In the 1983 science-fiction film &quot;WarGames&quot;, global thermonuclear war is described as similar to tic-tac-toe, in that if all sides engage in full-scale use of their arsenals with the most effective strategies possible, no side will actually win.

Various game shows have been based on tic-tac-toe and its variants:
* On &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, nine celebrities filled the cells of the tic-tac-toe grid; players put symbols on the board by correctly agreeing or disagreeing with a celebrity&#x27;s answer to a question. Variations of the show include &quot;Storybook Squares&quot; and &quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot;. The British version was &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;. Australia had various versions under the names of &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, &quot;Personality Squares&quot; and &quot;All Star Squares&quot;.
* In &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;, players put symbols up on the board by answering questions in various categories, which shuffle after both players have taken both turns.
* In &quot;Beat the Teacher&quot;, contestants answer questions to win a turn to influence a tic-tac-toe grid.
* On &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, several national variants feature a pricing game called &quot;Secret X&quot;, in which players must guess prices of two small prizes to win Xs (in addition to one free X) to place on a blank board. They must place the Xs in position to guess the location of the titular &quot;secret X&quot; hidden in the center column of the board and form a tic-tac-toe line horizontally (across) or diagonally (no vertical lines allowed). There are no Os in this variant of the game.
* On &quot;Minute to Win It&quot;, the game Ping Tac Toe has one contestant playing the game with nine water-filled glasses and white and orange ping-pong balls, trying to get three in a row of either color. They must alternate colors after each successful landing and must be careful not to block themself.

<text>Tallinn Airport () is the largest international airport in Estonia. The airport is also officially called Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport (&quot;&quot;) after the former president of Estonia Lennart Meri.

The airport is located southeast of the city centre of Estonian capital Tallinn, on the eastern shore of Lake Ülemiste. It was previously known until 2009 as Tallinn Ülemiste Airport. The airport has a single asphalt/concrete runway, 08/26, that is and large enough to handle wide-bodied aircraft such as the Boeing 747, six taxiways and seventeen terminal gates.

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Prior to the establishment of the present airport in Ülemiste area, Lasnamäe Airfield was the primary airport of Tallinn, serving as a base for Aeronaut airline. After Aeronaut went bankrupt in 1928, air service was continued by Deruluft, which used Nehatu instead, from the centre of Tallinn. The first seaplane harbour on the shores of Lake Ülemiste was built 1928 to 1929 in order to serve Finnish seaplanes. The use of this harbour ended in World War II. On 26 March 1929 Riigikogu passed an expropriation act in order to establish a public airport. 10 ha of land was expropriated from Dvigatel joint-stock company and another 22 ha was expropriated from descendants of Vagner. 10 million sents were paid to land-owners as indemnity. Land leveling and renovation works took another 5 million sents.
The building of Tallinn Airport started on 16 November 1931, and the first test landing was commenced by captain Reissar piloting Estonian Air Force Avro 594 Avian, tail number 120. The airport was opened officially on 20 September 1936, although it had been operational a good while before the official opening - LOT Polish Airlines, which commenced its first passenger flight from Tallinn on 18 August 1932 with Fokker F.VIIb/3m from Lasnamäe Airfield, later relocated the flights to Tallinn Airport and in 1935 the airport had 6 arrivals and departures on average every day. In April 1935 a ramp for seaplanes was built on a shore of Lake Ülemiste, together with a small arch bridge and a customs office, which allowed seaplanes to be relocated from a sea port. The same year the airport administration building was erected, which also served initially as a waiting place for travellers. The total cost of the whole airport project, including the cost of building flight hangars, was 25 million sents.

As the very first runways had soft surface, it made them unavailable for takeoffs and landings during spring and autumn seasons. Therefore, only seaplanes stationed at Lake Ülemiste were able to carry out flights, and during winter months, it was possible to use the frozen surface of the lake as a runway for small airplanes. The concrete paved runways of the first stage, inaugurated together with the opening of the airport, were about 40 metres wide and 300 metres long. As they were arranged in a form of a triangle, they allowed takeoffs and landings in six directions. These were the first concrete-paved runway in Estonia, it was needed some 5,396 cubic meters of stone, 4,100 cubic meters of construction aggregate and 137 tons of cement to construct them.
In addition, 3 km of pipeworks was laid for drainage purposes. Before World War II, Tallinn Airport had regular connections to abroad by at least Aerotransport (now part of the SAS Group), Deutsche Luft Hansa, LOT and the Finnish company Aero (now Finnair). On 5 April 1937 the Helsinki-Tallinn-Warsaw-Jerusalem route was inaugurated by Mr. Bobkowski, the assistant of the Polish Minister of Transport. The length of the route was and the journey time was 34 hours. Passengers and cargo numbers grew quickly, from 4,100 passengers and 6,730 kg of cargo in 1933 to 11,892 passengers and 14,726 kg of cargo in 1937. Preparation and design works for a new passenger terminal started in 1938. 14 various projects were submitted for the architectural contest of the new terminal building, with the one from the architect Artur Jürvetson winning the contest in February the same year. The construction costs were estimated at 300 thousand Estonian kroons. The first airplane of then the flag carrier of Estonia, AGO, arrived at Tallinn Airport on 5 October 1939, flying the route Dessau - Königsberg - Tallinn.

As Estonia was occupied by Soviet Union, on 22 July 1940 the order was made by Soviet occupation authorities to transfer the airport to Soviet Air Forces. All aircraft, which were at the airport at that time, including interned Polish Lockheed 14, two Junkers Ju 52 of AGO and PTO-4 trainer aircraft of Estonian Airclub, were relocated to Lasnamäe Airfield.

During the German occupation, regular international connections were announced on 16 October and already restored on 15 November 1941, when Deutsche Lufthansa and Aero O/Y started the route Helsinki-Tallinn-Riga-Königsberg-Berlin. From 1942 to 1944 &quot;Sonderstaffel Buschmann&quot; was based at Tallinn Airport.

===Soviet period===
Between 1945 and 1989, Aeroflot was the only airline that served Tallinn Airport.

The construction of the new passenger terminal, which was put on hold due to war, resumed. The building, which was redesigned in accordance with the Stalinist architecture, was finished in 1954 and commissioned on 7 November 1955. Regular flights with jet aircraft began on 2 October 1962 with a maiden passenger flight from Moscow with a Tu-124, which was the latest Soviet airliner. As the terminal built in 1954 became obsolete and unable to cope with growing airport traffic, the construction of the current terminal building began in 1976 and the terminal was opened in 1980, prior to the 1980 Summer Olympics sailing event, which was held in the city. The architect of the new terminal was Mihhail Piskov, who took visual inspiration from traditional Estonian housebarns, and the interior designer was Maile Grünberg. The runway was also lengthened then. The first foreign airline since World War II to operate regular flights from Tallinn was SAS, whose first flight to the airport took place on 25 November 1989.

===Modern development===
The construction works of the first cargo terminal (Cargo 1), located in the middle of future cargo area on the north side of the airport, were carried out from September 1997 until March 1998. The passenger terminal building was completely modernised in 1999, increasing its capacity to 1.4 million passengers per year and after that greatly expanded in 2008. The growing demand for extra space for cargo operations, created a situation where there was need for cargo terminal expansion, Cargo 2. In order to meet the growing demand for new cargo facilities at Tallinn Airport, the number of cargo terminals was later expanded to four. In year 2012 a new aircraft maintenance hangar was opened and a number of passengers passed two million mark the first time in the history of the airport. On 11 January 2013 the airport was accepted into Airport Carbon Accreditation emission managing and reduction programme by ACI. The year 2013 saw an introduction of an automatic border control system and a start of construction of a new business aviation hangar complex. 

====2008 expansion====

The airport underwent a large expansion project between January 2006 and September 2008. The existing terminal was expanded by and the architects of the project were Jean Marie Bonnard, Pia Tasa and Inge Sirkel-Suviste. The terminal was expanded in three directions, resulting in 18 new gates, separate lounges for Schengen and non-Schengen passengers, 10 new check-in desks and a new restaurant and cafes. Due to the gallery that connects all the gates and was constructed in the middle of the terminal building the terminal became T-shaped. The projecting terminal section enables a two-level traffic for international passengers. The renewed terminal has nine passenger bridges. The extensions constructed at the ends of the terminal building became additional rooms for registering for the flights and for delivering arriving luggage. Outside the terminal, the apron was refurbished and expanded and a new taxiway was added. The new terminal allows the airport to handle twice as many passengers as it could handle before. The renovated terminal received the award &quot;Concrete Building of the Year 2008&quot; by the Estonian Concrete Association.
====Renaming====
After the death of former president of Estonia Lennart Meri on 14 March 2006, journalist Argo Ideon from Eesti Ekspress proposed to honour the president&#x27;s memory by naming Tallinn Airport after him – &quot;&quot; (Lennart Meri International Airport), drawing parallels with John F. Kennedy International Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport, Sabiha Gökçen International Airport etc. Ideon&#x27;s article also mentioned the fact that Meri himself had shown concern for the condition of the then Soviet-era construction (in one memorable case Meri, having arrived from Japan, led the group of journalists that were expecting him, to the airport&#x27;s toilets to do the interview there, in order to point out the shoddy condition of the facilities).

The name change was discussed at a board meeting on 29 March 2006, and on the opening of the new terminal on 19 September 2008, Prime Minister Andrus Ansip officially announced the renaming would take place in March 2009

====Baltic Sea cruise turnarounds====

In 2011 a new project of cruise turnarounds was launched in cooperation with Tallinn Passenger Port and Happy Cruises. More than 7,000 Spanish passengers travelled that year on charter flights to and from Tallinn Airport. As the airport is located only 5 km from the city center cruise quay, transfer time from airport to cruise ship is under an hour.

In 2012, Pullmantur Air started its charter operations from Madrid–Barajas Airport with three Airbus A321s and two to three Boeing 747s. During the summer 2012 about 16,000 tourists were transferred. The company continued operations in 2013, transferring 25,000 tourists in five turnarounds, as well as there was one partial turnaround operation for the cruise ship MS Deutschland operated by Peter Deilmann Cruises.

In 2015, cruise tourists were attended to by four airlines – Iberia, Iberia Express, Wamos Air, and Vueling. Some 5,000 passengers were expected during three turnarounds for Pullmantur Cruises cruise line. Tallinn Airport served 9,369 cruise turnaround passengers in 2015. No cruise turnarounds are expected in summer 2016 due to construction works, but the airport plans to continue them in 2017.

====Demise of Estonian Air====
On 7 November 2015, Estonian Air was liquidated following an adverse decision by the European Commission. This meant a significant temporary loss of business for the airport, as Estonian Air had been the largest carrier, accounting for one third of all capacity in 2014.

==Future expansion==

According to Erik Sakkov, board member of Tallinn Airport, the future plans include expanding the runway by 600–700 metres to serve regular long-haul flights, also building of a brand-new taxiway, new storage facilities, a new point-to-point terminal and expansion of the existing passenger terminal, so it can serve arriving and departing passengers on two different levels. On 21 February 2013 the environmental impact assessment of the airport development project started. The project includes the runway lengthening by 720 metres, installation of the ILS Category II equipment, also lengthening of the existing northern taxiway till the end of the expanded runway, constructing of a whole new taxiway and a new apron area on the southern side of the airport, installation of the new perimeter security systems and constructing of an engine test facility and dedicated snow storage and de-icing areas. Among other benefits the extension would enable planes to fly higher above the city of Tallinn by moving threshold of the runway further from Lake Ülemiste, thus reducing noise level.

The public discussion of the runway extension environmental effects evaluation report took place on 16 December 2013 and the construction work to extend the runway has begun on 1 May 2016. The length of the renovated runway is 3480 meters, the construction contract was concluded with Lemminkäinen Eesti. On 17 November 2016 the airport administration reported, that the runway expansion works are completed, thus the runway became the longest one in the Baltic states. The runway and the main taxiway were extended to the east and a new system of navigation lights was installed. In the summer and autumn of 2016 the construction work caused restrictions on nighttime flight operations but had no impact on scheduled operations. The soil of the safety area around the extended runway was enforced to reduce potential risks to aircraft in the event of runway overrun or excursion. In the course of the expansion work in 2016 some 45,000 tons of asphalt and 4,000 m3 of concrete were laid down, also 60 kilometers of new duct access was built and 100 kilometers of new cables and 400 new navigation lights installed, as well as 10 kilometers of new rainwater removal infrastructure built. The expansion of the airstrip increased the airport&#x27;s safety area by 41 hectares and five kilometers of new service roads were built. The whole expansion works must be completed by the end of 2017.
On 12 June 2013 the City Administration of Tallinn approved a detailed planning for a 0.91 ha land plot, on which a new maintenance hangar is going to be built. Total five-year investment plan amounts of more than 100 million euros. The airport is investing €126 million during the 2015–2021 period. The most important project is the reconstruction of the runway infrastructure at cost of €75 million. Additional investment of €2.5 million would be made in flight terminal in order to change its layout and improve the terminal&#x27;s security, capacity and VIP area. А multi-storey car park for 1,200 vehicles and 150 taxis would be built due to the consistently increasing need for parking spots around the airport. Work on the task and procurement conditions of the parking structure began in 2014. It will be located in front of the passenger terminal and should be completed in 2017 according to current plans. On 10 April 2019, Tallinn Airport announced plans to expand the airport terminal and build an airport city by 2035. The expanded terminal is planned to serve 6 to 8 million passengers per year with an expanded area of 85 000 m2 and 26 gates instead of 13.

Tallinn Airport aims for carbon neutrality by 2030. Solar farms at five locations are expected to generate 40% of its electricity needs this year. Plans are also in place to switch to green electricity from the grid by 2027 and to produce green hydrogen from surplus solar energy.

===Planned Terminal 2===
As the airport&#x27;s current facilities could not serve more than 2.5 million passengers per year and the number of passengers is rapidly growing (38.2% in year 2011), a new terminal dedicated to low-cost airlines is planned to be built. On 12 April 2012 Tallinn Airport announced, that it will build next year a new terminal with five stands for low-cost airlines, which will be easily removable and extendable. The new terminal would be intended for low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian that do not want to pay that much to the airport and do not need many airport services. The new terminal is intended for the service of one million passengers and the space previously occupied by low-cost airlines would pass into the disposition of Nordica and other traditional airlines.

==Facilities==

There is one passenger terminal and four cargo terminals at the airport. These are located to the right of Runway 08&#x27;s threshold, with Runway 26 being connected to the terminal segment by a parallel taxiway as long as the runway.

===Terminal building===
Estonian EXPO Center year-round permanent exhibition is located near the Gate 3, acting as a live advertising space where promotion representatives introduce the companies taking part in the exhibition and help finding cooperation partners in particular fields of business. The center was opened on 22 July 2010. VKG has opened an oil shale themed exposition at Gate 4 on 9 January 2013, showing the history and development of Estonian oil shale industry. The Estonian Tourist Board has opened a brand new &quot;Visit Estonia&quot; themed exposition at Gate 5 on 2 October 2013. The gate is divided into three parts: a children&#x27;s territory with a Lotte-themed playhouse, an interactive, informative waiting area decorated with Estonian national patterns and a bridge from the gate to the airplane that introduces travellers to Estonian nature.

====Passenger facilities====

A lending library was opened on 9 May 2013 in a special area by Gate 1. All books were donated by public including Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves and the First Lady of Estonia Evelin Ilves. The library has books in ten different languages, the majority being in Estonian, Russian and English. There will also be a selection of children&#x27;s books. On 16 August 2013 Tallinn Airport unveiled a gallery and started exhibiting artists&#x27; work in the Passenger Terminal. The gallery of rotating exhibitions on the 1st floor of the Passenger Terminal is open to all arriving and departing passengers as well as those seeing them off or meeting them.

On 1 September 2013, the airport opened an automatic border control system, that was meant to accelerate procedures for passengers travelling out of the Schengen area. The fully automated border crossing system consists of two automated gates and six registering kiosks.

The Nordea Lounge services business class passengers of Air Baltic, Finnair, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa and SAS, as well as Priority Pass and members of the Metropolis loyalty programme.

Additional Tallinn Airport GH check-in terminal is located at the Radisson Blu Hotel Tallinn. Travellers can check in online and print boarding cards directly from the lobby. The system allows to check in 24 hours before departure and choose own specific seat.

===Airport museum and activity centre===
The museum is located in a small building near the terminal, also a relatively large area nearby will be transformed into open-air exhibition. Two ancient cult stones, which it is necessary to move during the expansion of the runway, will be transferred to that exhibition. The whole museum plot will be separated from the airfield.

<text>Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also called temporal arteritis, is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of large blood vessels. Symptoms may include headache, pain over the temples, flu-like symptoms, double vision, and difficulty opening the mouth. Complications can include blockage of the artery to the eye with resulting blindness, as well as aortic dissection, and aortic aneurysm. GCA is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. 
The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism involves inflammation of the small blood vessels that supply the walls of larger arteries. This mainly affects arteries around the head and neck, though some in the chest may also be affected. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms, blood tests, and medical imaging, and confirmed by biopsy of the temporal artery. However, in about 10% of people the temporal artery is normal.
Treatment is typical with high doses of steroids such as prednisone or prednisolone. Once symptoms have resolved, the dose is decreased by about 15% per month. Once a low dose is reached, the taper is slowed further over the subsequent year. Other medications that may be recommended include bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss and a proton-pump inhibitor to prevent stomach problems.
It affects about 1 in 15,000 people over the age of 50 per year. The condition mostly occurs in those over the age of 50, being most common among those in their 70s. Females are more often affected than males. Those of northern European descent are more commonly affected. Life expectancy is typically normal. The first description of the condition occurred in 1890.

==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms of giant cell arteritis include:
* bruits
* fever
* headache
* tenderness and sensitivity on the scalp
* jaw claudication (pain in jaw when chewing)
* tongue claudication (pain in tongue when chewing) and necrosis
* reduced visual acuity (blurred vision)
* acute visual loss (sudden blindness)
* diplopia (double vision)
*limb claudication
* polymyalgia rheumatica (in 50%)

The inflammation may affect blood supply to the eye; blurred vision or sudden blindness may occur. In 76% of cases involving the eye, the ophthalmic artery is involved, causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

Giant cell arteritis may present with atypical or overlapping features. Early and accurate diagnosis is important to prevent ischemic vision loss. Therefore, this condition is considered a medical emergency.

While studies vary as to the exact relapse rate of giant cell arteritis, relapse of this condition can occur. It most often happens at low doses of prednisone (&lt;20 mg/day), during the first year of treatment, and the most common signs of relapse are headache and polymyalgia rheumatica.

===Associated conditions===
The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antigen was found in 74% of temporal artery biopsies that were GCA-positive, suggesting that the VZV infection may trigger the inflammatory cascade.

The disorder may co-exist (in about half of cases) with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which is characterized by sudden onset of pain and stiffness in muscles (pelvis, shoulder) of the body and is seen in the elderly. GCA and PMR are so closely linked that they are often considered to be different manifestations of the same disease process. PMR usually lacks the cranial symptoms, including headache, pain in the jaw while chewing, and vision symptoms, that are present in GCA.

Giant cell arteritis can affect the aorta and lead to aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. Up to 67% of people with GCA having evidence of an inflamed aorta, which can increase the risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection. There are arguments for the routine screening of each person with GCA for this possible life-threatening complication by imaging the aorta. Screening should be done on a case-by-case basis based on the signs and symptoms of people with GCA.

==Mechanism==
The pathological mechanism is the result of an inflammatory cascade that is triggered by an as of yet undetermined cause resulting in dendritic cells in the vessel wall recruiting T cells and macrophages to form granulomatous infiltrates. These infiltrates erode the middle and inner layers of the arterial tunica media leading to conditions such as aneurysm and dissection. Activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells involved with interleukin (IL) 6, IL-17, IL-21 and IL-23 play a critical part; specifically, Th17 activation leads to further activation of Th17 through IL-6 in a continuous, cyclic fashion. This pathway is suppressed with glucocorticoids, and more recently it has been found that IL-6 inhibitors also play a suppressive role.

==Diagnosis==

===Physical exam===
* Palpation of the head reveals prominent temporal arteries with or without pulsation.
* The temporal area may be tender.
* Decreased pulses may be found throughout the body
* Evidence of ischemia may be noted on fundal exam.
* Bruits may be heard over the subclavian and axillary arteries
===Laboratory tests===
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an inflammatory marker, &gt;60 mm/hour (normal 1–40 mm/hour)
* C-reactive protein, another inflammatory marker, may be elevated
* LFTs, liver function tests, are abnormal particularly raised ALP- alkaline phosphatase
* Platelets may also be elevated

===Biopsy===

The gold standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis is biopsy, which involves removing a small part of the vessel under local anesthesia and examining it microscopically for giant cells infiltrating the tissue. However, a negative result does not definitively rule out the diagnosis; since the blood vessels are involved in a patchy pattern, there may be unaffected areas on the vessel and the biopsy might have been taken from these parts. Unilateral biopsy of a 1.5–3 cm length is 85-90% sensitive (1 cm is the minimum). Characterised as intimal hyperplasia and medial granulomatous inflammation with elastic lamina fragmentation with a CD4+ predominant T cell infiltrate, currently biopsy is only considered confirmatory for the clinical diagnosis, or one of the diagnostic criteria.

===Medical imaging===
Radiological examination of the temporal artery with ultrasound yields a halo sign. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI and CT are generally negative in this disorder. Recent studies have shown that 3T MRI using super high resolution imaging and contrast injection can non-invasively diagnose this disorder with high specificity and sensitivity. Temporal artery thickening on imaging has been demonstrated to have highest positive likelihood ratios for GCA when compared with other non invasive diagnostic tests.

===Early recognition===
Women and men approximately 45 years old and who suffer from several complaints (at least 5 of the 16 symptoms) listed below could have giant cell arteritis.

*Fatigue and apathy
* Stiffness in joints and/or muscles 
* Painful jaws when chewing
* Sensitive scalp 
* Physical malaise and/or weakness 
* Bloated arteries of the temples 
* Headaches, migraine 
* Tongue problems 
* Bleakness, depression 
* Changed eyesight 
* Poor or lack of appetite 
* Reduced eyesight, blindness 
* Unusual loss of weight 
* A temperature 
* Unusual perspiration
* Night sweats

==Treatment==
GCA is considered a medical emergency due to the potential of irreversible vision loss. Corticosteroids, typically high-dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day), should be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (even before the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy) to prevent irreversible blindness secondary to ophthalmic artery occlusion. Steroids do not prevent the diagnosis from later being confirmed by biopsy, although certain changes in the histology may be observed towards the end of the first week of treatment and are more difficult to identify after a couple of months. The dose of corticosteroids is generally slowly tapered over 12–18 months. Oral steroids are at least as effective as intravenous steroids, except in the treatment of acute visual loss where intravenous steroids appear to offer significant benefit over oral steroids. Short-term side effects of prednisone are uncommon but can include mood changes, avascular necrosis, and an increased risk of infection. Some of the side effects associated with long-term use include weight gain, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, glaucoma, cataracts, cardiovascular disease, and an increased risk of infection. It is unclear whether adding a small amount of aspirin is beneficial or not as it has not been studied. Injections of tocilizumab may also be used. Tocilizumab is a humanized antibody that targets the interleukin-6 receptor, which is a key cytokine involved in the progression of GCA. Tocilizumab has been found to be effective at minimizing both recurrence, and flares of GCA when used both on its own and with corticosteroids. Long term use of tocilizumab requires further investigation. Tocilizumab may increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation and infections, however it does not appear that there are more risks than using corticosteroids.

==Epidemiology==
Giant cell arteritis typically only occurs in those over the age of 50; particularly those in their 70s. It affects about 1 in 15,000 people over the age of 50 per year. It is more common in women than in men, by a ratio of 2:1, and more common in those of Northern European descent, as well as in those residing further from the Equator. Roughly 1 in 5 people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have giant cell arteritis.

==Disease impact==
Giant cell arteritis and its treatment impact on people&#x27;s lives because of symptoms, adverse effects of GCs and disruption to normal life. People with GCA have previously ranked ‘losing sight in both eyes permanently’, ‘having intense or severe pain’ and ‘feeling weak, tired or exhausted’ as important quality of life domains.

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;giant cell arteritis&quot; and &quot;temporal arteritis&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, because of the frequent involvement of the temporal artery. However, other large vessels such as the aorta can be involved. Giant-cell arteritis is also known as &quot;cranial arteritis&quot; and &quot;Horton&#x27;s disease&quot;. The name (giant cell arteritis) reflects the type of inflammatory cell involved.

<text>A transient ischemic attack (TIA), commonly known as a mini-stroke, is a temporary (transient) stroke with noticeable symptoms that end within 24 hours. A TIA causes the same symptoms associated with a stroke, such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, sudden dimming or loss of vision, difficulty speaking or understanding language or slurred speech.

All forms of stroke, including a TIA, result from a disruption in blood flow to the central nervous system. A TIA is caused by a temporary disruption in blood flow to the brain, or cerebral blood flow (CBF). The primary difference between a major stroke and the TIA&#x27;s minor stroke is how much tissue death (infarction) can be detected afterwards through medical imaging. While a TIA must by definition be associated with symptoms, strokes can also be asymptomatic or silent. In a silent stroke, also known as a &quot;silent cerebral infarct&quot; (SCI), there is permanent infarction detectable on imaging, but there are no immediately observable symptoms. The same person can have major strokes, minor strokes, and silent strokes, in any order.

The occurrence of a TIA is a risk factor for having a major stroke, and many people with TIA have a major stroke within 48 hours of the TIA. All forms of stroke are associated with increased risk of death or disability. Recognition that a TIA has occurred is an opportunity to start treatment, including medications and lifestyle changes, to prevent future strokes.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of TIA are widely variable and can mimic other neurologic conditions, making the clinical context and physical exam crucial in ruling in or out the diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms of TIA are focal neurologic deficits, which can include, but are not limited to:
* Amaurosis fugax (painless, temporary loss of vision)
* One-sided facial droop
* One-sided motor weakness
* Diplopia (double vision)
* Problems with balance and spatial orientation or dizziness
* Visual field deficits, such as homonymous hemianopsia or monocular blindness
* Sensory deficits in one or more limbs and of the face
* Loss of ability to understand or express speech (aphasia)
* Difficulty with articulation of speech (dysarthria)
* Unsteady gait
* Difficulties with swallowing (dysphagia)

Numbness or weakness generally occur on the opposite side of the body from the affected hemisphere of the brain.

A detailed neurologic exam, including a thorough cranial nerve exam, is important to identify these findings and to differentiate them from mimickers of TIA. Symptoms such as unilateral weakness, amaurosis fugax, and double vision have higher odds of representing TIA compared to memory loss, headache, and blurred vision. Below is a table of symptoms at presentation, and what percentage of the time they are seen in TIAs versus conditions that mimic TIA. In general, focal deficits make TIA more likely, but the absence of focal findings do not exclude the diagnosis and further evaluation may be warranted if clinical suspicion for TIA is high (see &quot;Diagnosis&quot; section below).

===TIA vis-à-vis mimics===

Non-focal symptoms such as amnesia, confusion, incoordination of limbs, unusual cortical visual symptoms (such as isolated bilateral blindness or bilateral positive visual phenomena), headaches and transient loss of consciousness are usually not associated with TIA, however patient assessment is still needed. Public awareness on the need to seek a medical assessment for these non-focal symptoms is also low, and can result in a delay by patients to seek treatment

Symptoms of TIAs can last on the order of minutes to one–two hours, but occasionally may last for a longer period of time. TIA is defined as ischemic events in the brain that last less than 24 hours. Given the variation in duration of symptoms, this definition holds less significance. A pooled study of 808 patients with TIAs from 10 hospitals showed that 60% lasted less than one hour, 71% lasted less than two hours, and 14% lasted greater than six hours. Importantly, patients with symptoms that last more than one hour are more likely to have permanent neurologic damage, making prompt diagnosis and treatment important to maximize recovery.

==Cause==
The most common underlying pathology leading to TIA and stroke is a cardiac condition called atrial fibrillation, where poor coordination of heart contraction may lead to a formation of a clot in the atrial chamber that can become dislodged and travel to a cerebral artery. Unlike in stroke, the blood flow can become restored prior to infarction which leads to the resolution of neurologic symptoms. Another common culprit of TIA is an atherosclerotic plaque located in the common carotid artery, typically by the bifurcation between the internal and external carotids, that becomes an embolism to the brain vasculature similar to the clot in the prior example. A portion of the plaque can become dislodged and lead to embolic pathology in the cerebral vessels.

In-situ thrombosis, an obstruction that forms directly in the cerebral vasculature unlike the remote embolism previously mentioned, is another vascular occurrence with possible presentation as TIA. Also, carotid stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis narrowing the diameter of the lumen and thus limiting blood flow is another common cause of TIA. Individuals with carotid stenosis may present with TIA symptoms, thus labeled symptomatic, while others may not experience symptoms and be asymptomatic.

===Risk factors===
Risk factors associated with TIA are categorized as modifiable or non-modifiable. Non-modifiable risk factors include age greater than 55, sex, family history, genetics, and race/ethnicity. Modifiable risk factors include cigarette smoking, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), diabetes, hyperlipidemia, level of carotid artery stenosis (asymptomatic or symptomatic) and activity level. The modifiable risk factors are commonly targeted in treatment options to attempt to minimize risk of TIA and stroke.

== Pathogenesis ==
There are three major mechanisms of ischemia in the brain: embolism traveling to the brain, in situ thrombotic occlusion in the intracranial vessels supplying the parenchyma of the brain, and stenosis of vessels leading to poor perfusion secondary to flow-limiting diameter. Globally, the vessel most commonly affected is the middle cerebral artery. Embolisms can originate from multiple parts of the body.

Common mechanisms of stroke and TIA:
== Diagnosis ==
The initial clinical evaluation of a suspected TIA involves obtaining a history and physical exam (including a neurological exam). History taking includes defining the symptoms and looking for mimicking symptoms as described above. Bystanders can be very helpful in describing the symptoms and giving details about when they started and how long they lasted. The time course (onset, duration, and resolution), precipitating events, and risk factors are particularly important.

The definition, and therefore the diagnosis, has changed over time. TIA was classically based on duration of neurological symptoms. The current widely accepted definition is called &quot;tissue-based&quot; because it is based on imaging, not time. The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) now define TIA as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction with a vascular cause, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour, and without evidence of significant infarction on imaging.

===Laboratory workup===
Laboratory tests should focus on ruling out metabolic conditions that may mimic TIA (e.g. hypoglycemia), in addition to further evaluating a patient&#x27;s risk factors for ischemic events. All patients should receive a complete blood count with platelet count, blood glucose, basic metabolic panel, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time as part of their initial workup. These tests help with screening for bleeding or hypercoagulable conditions. Other lab tests, such as a full hypercoagulable state workup or serum drug screening, should be considered based on the clinical situation and factors, such as age of the patient and family history. A fasting lipid panel is also appropriate to thoroughly evaluate the patient&#x27;s risk for atherosclerotic disease and ischemic events in the future. Other lab tests may be indicated based on the history and presentation; such as obtaining inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) to evaluate for giant cell arteritis (which can mimic a TIA) in those presenting with headaches and monocular blindness.

===Cardiac rhythm monitoring===
An electrocardiogram is necessary to rule out abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, that can predispose patients to clot formation and embolic events. Hospitalized patients should be placed on heart rhythm telemetry, which is a continuous form of monitoring that can detect abnormal heart rhythms. Prolonged heart rhythm monitoring (such as with a Holter monitor or implantable heart monitoring) can be considered to rule out arrhythmias like paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that may lead to clot formation and TIAs, however this should be considered if other causes of TIA have not been found.

===Imaging===
According to guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association Stroke Council, patients with TIA should have head imaging &quot;within 24 hours of symptom onset, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion sequences&quot;. MRI is a better imaging modality for TIA than computed tomography (CT), as it is better able to pick up both new and old ischemic lesions than CT. CT, however, is more widely available and can be used particularly to rule out intracranial hemorrhage. Diffusion sequences can help further localize the area of ischemia and can serve as prognostic indicators. Presence of ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted imaging has been correlated with a higher risk of stroke after a TIA.

Vessels in the head and neck may also be evaluated to look for atherosclerotic lesions that may benefit from interventions, such as carotid endarterectomy. The vasculature can be evaluated through the following imaging modalities: magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), CT angiography (CTA), and carotid ultrasonography/transcranial doppler ultrasonography. Carotid ultrasonography is often used to screen for carotid artery stenosis, as it is more readily available, is noninvasive, and does not expose the person being evaluated to radiation. However, all of the above imaging methods have variable sensitivities and specificities, making it important to supplement one of the imaging methods with another to help confirm the diagnosis (for example: screen for the disease with ultrasonography, and confirm with CTA). Confirming a diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis is important because the treatment for this condition, carotid endarterectomy, can pose significant risk to the patient, including heart attacks and strokes after the procedure. For this reason, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) &quot;recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population&quot;. This recommendation is for asymptomatic patients, so it does not necessarily apply to patients with TIAs as these may in fact be a symptom of underlying carotid artery disease (see &quot;Causes and Pathogenesis&quot; above). Therefore, patients who have had a TIA may opt to have a discussion with their clinician about the risks and benefits of screening for carotid artery stenosis, including the risks of surgical treatment of this condition.

Cardiac imaging can be performed if head and neck imaging do not reveal a vascular cause for the patient&#x27;s TIA (such as atherosclerosis of the carotid artery or other major vessels of the head and neck). Echocardiography can be performed to identify patent foramen ovale (PFO), valvular stenosis, and atherosclerosis of the aortic arch that could be sources of clots causing TIAs, with transesophageal echocardiography being more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in identifying these lesions.

===Differential diagnosis===
== Prevention ==
Although there is a lack of robust studies demonstrating the efficacy of lifestyle changes in preventing TIA, many medical professionals recommend them. These include:
* Avoiding smoking
* Cutting down on fats to help reduce the amount of plaque buildup
* Eating a healthy diet including plenty of fruits and vegetables
* Limiting sodium in the diet, thereby reducing blood pressure
* Exercising regularly
* Moderating intake of alcohol, stimulants, sympathomimetics, etc.
* Maintaining a healthy weight
In addition, it is important to control any underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of stroke or TIA, including:
* Hypertension
* High cholesterol
* Diabetes mellitus
* Atrial fibrillation

== Treatment ==
By definition, TIAs are transient, self-resolving, and do not cause permanent impairment. However, they are associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic strokes, which can be permanently disabling. Therefore, management centers on the prevention of future ischemic strokes and addressing any modifiable risk factors. The optimal regimen depends on the underlying cause of the TIA.

=== Lifestyle modification ===
Lifestyle changes have not been shown to reduce the risk of stroke after TIA. While no studies have looked at the optimal diet for secondary prevention of stroke, some observational studies have shown that a Mediterranean diet can reduce stroke risk in patients without cerebrovascular disease. A Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and limited in red meats and sweets. Vitamin supplementation has not been found to be useful in secondary stroke prevention.

=== Antiplatelet medications ===
The antiplatelet medications, aspirin and clopidogrel, are both recommended for secondary prevention of stroke after high-risk TIAs. The clopidogrel can generally be stopped after 10 to 21 days. An exception is TIAs due to blood clots originating from the heart, in which case anticoagulants are generally recommended. After TIA or minor stroke, aspirin therapy has been shown to reduce the short-term risk of recurrent stroke by 60–70%, and the long-term risk of stroke by 13%.

The typical therapy may include aspirin alone, a combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone. Clopidogrel and aspirin have similar efficacies and side effect profiles. Clopidogrel is more expensive and has a slightly decreased risk of GI bleed. Another antiplatelet, ticlopidine, is rarely used due to increased side effects.

=== Anticoagulant medications ===
Anticoagulants may be started if the TIA is thought to be attributable to atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm that may cause the formation of blood clots that can travel to the brain, resulting in TIAs or ischemic strokes. Atrial fibrillation increases stroke risk by five times, and is thought to cause 10-12% of all ischemic strokes in the US. Anticoagulant therapy can decrease the relative risk of ischemic stroke in those with atrial fibrillation by 67% Warfarin and direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, have been shown to be equally effective while also conferring a lower risk of bleeding. Generally, anticoagulants and antiplatelets are not used in combination, as they result in increased bleeding risk without a decrease in stroke risk. However, combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy may be warranted if the patient has symptomatic coronary artery disease in addition to atrial fibrillation.

Sometimes, myocardial infarction (&quot;heart attack&quot;) may lead to the formation of a blood clot in one of the chambers of the heart. If this is thought to be the cause of the TIA, people may be temporarily treated with warfarin or other anticoagulant to decrease the risk of future stroke.

=== Blood pressure control ===
Blood pressure control may be indicated after TIA to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. About 70% of patients with recent ischemic stroke are found to have hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mmHg. Until the first half of the 2010s, blood pressure goals have generally been SBP &lt; 140 mmHg and DBP &lt; 90 mmHg. However, newer studies suggest that a goal of SBP &lt;130 mmHg may confer even greater benefit. Blood pressure control is often achieved using diuretics or a combination of diuretics and angiotensin converter enzyme inhibitors, although the optimal treatment regimen depends on the individual.

Studies that evaluated the application of blood pressure‐lowering drugs in people who had a TIA or stroke, concluded that this type of medication helps to reduce the possibility of a recurrent stroke, of a major vascular event and dementia. The effects achieved in stroke recurrence were mainly obtained through the ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic.

=== Cholesterol control ===
There is inconsistent evidence regarding the effect of LDL-cholesterol levels on stroke risk after TIA. Elevated cholesterol may increase ischemic stroke risk while decreasing the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. While its role in stroke prevention is unclear, statin therapy has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and may be recommended after TIA.

=== Diabetes control ===
Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of ischemic stroke by 1.5–3.7 times, and may account for at least 8% of first ischemic strokes. While intensive glucose control can prevent certain complications of diabetes such as kidney damage and retinal damage, there has previously been little evidence that it decreases the risk of stroke or death. However, data from 2017 suggests that metformin, pioglitazone and semaglutide may reduce stroke risk.

=== Surgery ===
If the TIA affects an area that is supplied by the carotid arteries, a carotid ultrasound scan may demonstrate stenosis, or narrowing, of the carotid artery. For people with extra-cranial carotid stenosis, if 70-99% of the carotid artery is clogged, carotid endarterectomy can decrease the five-year risk of ischemic stroke by approximately half. For those with extra-cranial stenosis between 50 and 69%, carotid endarterectomy decreases the 5-year risk of ischemic stroke by about 16%. For those with extra-cranial stenosis less than 50%, carotid endarterectomy does not reduce stroke risk and may, in some cases, increase it. The effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting in reducing stroke risk in people with intra-cranial carotid artery stenosis is unknown.

In carotid endarterectomy, a surgeon makes an incision in the neck, opens up the carotid artery, and removes the plaque occluding the blood vessel. The artery may then be repaired by adding a graft from another vessel in the body, or a woven patch. In patients who undergo carotid endarterectomy after a TIA or minor stroke, the 30-day risk of death or stroke is 7%.

Carotid artery stenting is a less invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy for people with extra-cranial carotid artery stenosis. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small cut in the groin and threads a small flexible tube, called a catheter, into the patient&#x27;s carotid artery. A balloon is inflated at the site of stenosis, opening up the clogged artery to allow for increased blood flow to the brain. To keep the vessel open, a small wire mesh coil, called a stent, may be inflated along with the balloon. The stent remains in place, and the balloon is removed.

For people with symptomatic carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is associated with fewer perioperative deaths or strokes than carotid artery stenting. Following the procedure, there is no difference in effectiveness if you compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting procedures, however, endarterectomy is often the procedure of choice as it is a safer procedure and is often effective in the longer term for preventing recurrent stroke. For people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the increased risk of stroke or death during the stenting procedure compared to an endarterectomy is less certain.

People who undergo carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for stroke prevention are medically managed with antiplatelets, statins, and other interventions as well.

== Prognosis ==
Without treatment, the risk of an ischemic stroke in the three months after a TIA is about 20% with the greatest risk occurring within two days of the TIA. Other sources cite that 10% of TIAs will develop into a stroke within 90 days, half of which will occur in the first two days following the TIA. Treatment and preventative measures after a TIA (for example treating elevated blood pressure) can reduce the subsequent risk of an ischemic stroke by about 80%. The risk of a stroke occurring after a TIA can be predicted using the ABCD² score. One limitation of the ABCD² score is that it does not reliably predict the level of carotid artery stenosis, which is a major cause of stroke in TIA patients. The patient&#x27;s age is the most reliable risk factor in predicting any level of carotid stenosis in transient ischemic attack. The ABCD2 score is no longer recommended for triage (to decide between outpatient management versus hospital admission) of those with a suspected TIA due to these limitations.

== Epidemiology ==
With the difficulty in diagnosing a TIA due to its nonspecific symptoms of neurologic dysfunction at presentation and a differential including many mimics, the exact incidence of the disease is unclear. It was estimated to have an incidence of approximately 200,000 to 500,000 cases per year in the US in the early 2000s according to the American Heart Association. TIA incidence trends similarly to stroke, such that incidence varies with age, gender, and different race/ethnicity populations. Associated risk factors include age greater than or equal to 60, blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 systolic or 90 diastolic, and comorbid diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and atrial fibrillation. It is thought that approximately 15 to 30 percent of strokes have a preceding TIA episode associated.

<text>Transverse myelitis (TM) is a rare neurological condition wherein the spinal cord is inflamed. The adjective &quot;&quot; implies that the spinal inflammation (myelitis) extends horizontally throughout the cross section of the spinal cord; the terms &quot;partial transverse myelitis&quot; and &quot;partial myelitis&quot; are sometimes used to specify inflammation that affects only part of the width of the spinal cord. TM is characterized by weakness and numbness of the limbs, deficits in sensation and motor skills, dysfunctional urethral and anal sphincter activities, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to episodes of high blood pressure. Signs and symptoms vary according to the affected level of the spinal cord. The underlying cause of TM is unknown. The spinal cord inflammation seen in TM has been associated with various infections, immune system disorders, or damage to nerve fibers, by loss of myelin. As opposed to leukomyelitis which affects only the white matter, it affects the entire cross-section of the spinal cord. Decreased electrical conductivity in the nervous system can result.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs, deficits in sensation and motor skills, dysfunctional urethral and anal sphincter activities, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to episodes of high blood pressure. Symptoms typically develop for hours to a few weeks. Sensory symptoms of TM may include a sensation of pins and needles traveling up from the feet. The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts, but there is often a &quot;sensory level&quot; at the spinal ganglion of the segmental spinal nerve, below which sensation of pain or light touch is impaired. Motor weakness occurs due to the involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms.

Disturbances in sensory nerves and motor nerves and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system at the level of the lesion or below, are noted. Therefore, the signs and symptoms depend on the area of the spine involved. Back pain can occur at the level of any inflamed segment of the spinal cord.

If the upper cervical segment of the spinal cord is involved, all four limbs may be affected and there is the risk of respiratory failure – the phrenic nerve which is formed by the cervical spinal nerves C3, C4, and C5 innervates the main muscle of respiration, the diaphragm.

Lesions of the lower cervical region (C5–T1) will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs, and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Cervical lesions account for about 20% of cases.

A lesion of the thoracic segment (T1–12) will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs, presenting as a spastic paraparesis. This is the most common location of the lesion, and therefore most individuals will have weakness in the lower limbs.

A lesion of the lumbar segment, the lower part of the spinal cord (L1–S5) often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Lumbar lesions account for about 10% of cases.

==Causes==
TM is a heterogeneous condition, that is, there are several identified causes. Sometimes the term &quot;Transverse myelitis spectrum disorder&quot; is used. In 60% of patients the cause is idiopathic. In rare cases, it may be associated with meningococcal meningitis

When it appears as a comorbid condition with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), it is considered to be caused by NMO-IgG autoimmunity, and when it appears in multiple sclerosis (MS) cases, it&#x27;s misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) or seen as a type of MS. But NMO is a different condition.

Other causes of TM include infections, immune system disorders, and demyelinating diseases. Viral infections known to be associated with TM include HIV, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr. Flavivirus infections such as Zika virus and West Nile virus have also been associated. Viral association of transverse myelitis could result from the infection itself or from the response to it. Bacterial causes associated with TM include &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot;, and the types of &quot;Borrelia&quot; that cause Lyme disease. Lyme disease gives rise to neuroborreliosis which is seen in a small percentage (4 to 5 per cent) of acute transverse myelitis cases. The diarrhea-causing bacteria &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; is also a reported cause of transverse myelitis.

Other associated causes include the helminth infection schistosomiasis, spinal cord injuries, vascular disorders that impede the blood flow through vessels of the spinal cord, and paraneoplastic syndrome. Another exceptionally rare cause is heroin associated transverse myelitis.

==Pathophysiology==
This progressive loss of the fatty myelin sheath surrounding the nerves in the affected spinal cord occurs for unclear reasons following infections or due to multiple sclerosis. Infections may cause TM through direct tissue damage or by immune-mediated infection-triggered tissue damage. The lesions present are usually inflammatory. Spinal cord involvement is usually central, uniform, and symmetric in comparison to multiple sclerosis which typically affects the cord in a patchy way. The lesions in acute TM are mostly limited to the spinal cord with no involvement of other structures in the central nervous system.

===Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis===
A proposed special clinical presentation is the &quot;longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis&quot; (LETM), which is defined as a TM with a spinal cord lesion that extends over three or more vertebral segments. The causes of LETM are also heterogeneous and the presence of MOG auto-antibodies has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker.

==Diagnosis==
===Diagnostic criteria===
In 2002, the Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group proposed the following diagnostic criteria for idiopathic acute transverse myelitis:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* Inclusion criteria
** Motor, sensory or autonomic dysfunction attributable to spinal cord
** Signs and symptoms on both sides of the body (not necessarily symmetrical)
** Clearly defined sensory level
** Signs of inflammation (pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid, or elevated immunoglobulin G, or evidence of inflammation on gadolinium-enhanced (MRI) Magnetic resonance imaging)
** Peak of this condition can occur anytime between 4 hours to 21 days after onset
* Exclusion criteria
** Irradiation of the spine (e.g., radiotherapy) in the last 10 years
** Evidence of thrombosis of the anterior spinal artery
** Evidence of extra-axial compression on neuroimaging
** Evidence of arteriovenous malformation (abnormal flow voids on surface of spine)
** Evidence of connective tissue disease, e.g. sarcoidosis, Behçet&#x27;s disease, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus or mixed connective tissue disease
** Evidence of optic neuritis (diagnostic of neuromyelitis optica (NMO))
** Evidence of infection (syphilis, Lyme disease, Human immunodeficiency virus, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, mycoplasma, Herpes simplex virus, Varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Human herpesvirus 6 or enteroviruses)
** Evidence of multiple sclerosis (abnormalities detected on MRI and presence of oligoclonal antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF))

===Investigations===
Individuals who develop TM are typically transferred to a neurologist who can urgently investigate the patient in a hospital. If breathing is affected, particularly in upper spinal cord lesions, methods of artificial ventilation must be on hand before and during the transfer procedure. The patient should also be catheterized to test for and, if necessary, drain an over-distended bladder. A lumbar puncture can be performed after the MRI or at the time of CT myelography. Corticosteroids are often given in high doses when symptoms begin with the hope that the degree of inflammation and swelling of the spinal cord will be lessened, but whether this is truly effective is still debated.

===Differential diagnosis===
The differential diagnosis of acute TM includes demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, infections, such as herpes zoster and herpes simplex virus, and other types of inflammatory disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and neurosarcoidosis. It is important to also rule out an acute cause of compression on the spinal cord.

==Treatment==
If treated early, some people experience a complete or near complete recovery. Treatment options also vary according to the underlying cause. One treatment option includes plasmapheresis. Recovery from TM is variable between individuals and also depends on the underlying cause. Some patients begin to recover between weeks 2 and 12 following onset and may continue to improve for up to two years. Other patients may never show signs of recovery.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for TM depends on whether there is improvement in 3 to 6 months. Complete recovery is unlikely if no improvement occurs within this time. Incomplete recovery can still occur; however, aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation will be very important. One-third of people with TM experience full recovery, one-third experience fair recovery but have significant neurological deficits, such as spastic gait. The final third experience no recovery at all.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of TM is 4.6 per 1 million per year, affecting men and women equally. TM can occur at any age, but there are peaks around age 10, age 20, and after age 40.

==History==

The earliest reports describing the signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis were published in 1882 and 1910 by the English neurologist Henry Bastian.

In 1928, Frank Ford noted that in mumps patients who developed acute myelitis, symptoms only emerged after the mumps infection and associated symptoms began to recede. In an article in The Lancet, Ford suggested that acute myelitis could be a post-infection syndrome in most cases (i.e. a result of the body&#x27;s immune response attacking and damaging the spinal cord) rather than an infectious disease where a virus or some other infectious agent caused paralysis. His suggestion was consistent with reports in 1922 and 1923 of rare instances in which patients developed &quot;post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis&quot; subsequent to receiving the rabies vaccine which then was made from brain tissue carrying the virus. The pathological examination of those who had died from the disease revealed inflammatory cells and demyelination as opposed to the vascular lesions predicted by Bastian.

Ford&#x27;s theory of an allergic response being at the root of the disease was later shown to be only partially correct, as some infectious agents such as mycoplasma, measles and rubella were isolated from the spinal fluid of some infected patients, suggesting that direct infection could contribute to the manifestation of acute myelitis in certain cases.

In 1948, Dr. Suchett-Kaye described a patient with rapidly progressing impairment of lower extremity motor function that developed as a complication of pneumonia. In his description, he coined the term transverse myelitis to reflect the band-like thoracic area of altered sensation that patients reported. The term &#x27;acute transverse myelopathy&#x27; has since emerged as an acceptable synonym for &#x27;transverse myelitis&#x27;, and the two terms are currently used interchangeably in the literature.

The definition of transverse myelitis has also evolved over time. Bastian&#x27;s initial description included few conclusive diagnostic criteria; by the 1980s, basic diagnostic criteria were established, including acutely developing paraparesis combined with bilateral spinal cord dysfunction for &lt;4 weeks and a well-defined upper sensory level, no evidence of spinal cord compression, and a stable, non-progressive course. Later definitions, were written to exclude patients with underlying systemic or neurological illnesses and to include only those who progressed to maximum deficit in fewer than 4 weeks.

In 2016, former Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison revealed that he had been hospitalised by the disease in 2013 and that this was the reason for his controversial firing. As the first celebrity to publicly speak about having transverse myelitis, this helped to raise public awareness of the disease. Jordison died in his sleep on July 26, 2021, however it is not known whether the disease had any connection to his death.

==Etymology==
The word is from Latin: &quot;myelitis transversa&quot; and the disorder&#x27;s name is derived from Greek {{transliteration|el|&quot;myelós&quot;}} referring to the &quot;spinal cord&quot;, and the suffix &quot;&quot;, which denotes inflammation.

<text>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (also known as Alice Through the Looking-Glass or simply Through the Looking-Glass) is a novel published on 27 December 1871 by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics lecturer at Christ Church, University of Oxford, and the sequel to &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865). Alice again enters a fantastical world, this time by climbing through a mirror into the world that she can see beyond it. There she finds that, just like a reflection, everything is reversed, including logic (for example, running helps one remain stationary, walking away from something brings one towards it, chessmen are alive, nursery rhyme characters exist, and so on).

&quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; includes such verses as &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;, and the episode involving Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The mirror above the fireplace that is displayed at Hetton Lawn in Charlton Kings, Gloucestershire (a house that was owned by Alice Liddell&#x27;s grandparents, and was often visited by Alice and Lewis Carroll) resembles the one drawn by John Tenniel, and is cited as a possible inspiration for Carroll. The novel prompted a new-found appreciation for its predecessor when it was published.

== Plot summary ==
Alice is playing with a white kitten (whom she calls &quot;Snowdrop&quot;) and a black kitten (whom she calls &quot;Kitty&quot;) while pondering what the world is like on the other side of a mirror&#x27;s reflection. Climbing up onto a mantelpiece, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind a fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she can step through it. She finds herself in a reflected version of her own house and notices a book with looking-glass poetry, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.
Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers can speak. Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds.

The Red Queen reveals that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank in a chess match. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen&#x27;s pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, thus acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move. She arrives in a forest where a gnat teaches her about the looking glass insects, creatures part bug part object (e.g., bread and butterfly, rocking horse fly), before flying away. Continuing her journey, Alice crosses the &quot;wood where things have no names&quot;. There she forgets all nouns, including her own name. With the help of a fawn who has also forgotten his identity, she makes it to the other side, where they both remember everything. Realizing that he is a fawn, she is a human, and that fawns are afraid of humans, it runs off.
She then meets the twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from the nursery rhyme. After reciting a poem, they draw Alice&#x27;s attention to the Red King—sleeping under a nearby tree—and provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she is but an imaginary figure in his dreams. The brothers begin suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts.
Alice next meets the White Queen, who is absent-minded but can remember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard&#x27;s fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with shouting about &quot;crabs&quot; and &quot;feathers&quot;.

After crossing another brook into the sixth rank, Alice encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. In the process, he introduces Alice to the concept of portmanteau words, before his inevitable fall.

All the king&#x27;s horses and all the king&#x27;s men come to Humpty Dumpty&#x27;s assistance, and are accompanied by the White King, along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting with each other. The March Hare and Hatter appear in the guise of &quot;Anglo-Saxon messengers&quot; called &quot;Haigha&quot; and &quot;Hatta&quot;.

Upon leaving the Lion and Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who wants to capture the &quot;white pawn&quot;—Alice—until the White Knight comes to her rescue. Escorting her through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, the Knight recites a poem of his own composition and repeatedly falls off his horse.

Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook, and is automatically crowned a queen, with the crown materialising abruptly on her head. She soon finds herself in the company of both the White and Red Queens, who confound Alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion. They then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by Alice—of which Alice herself had no prior knowledge.

Alice arrives and seats herself at her own party, which quickly turns into chaos. Alice grabs the Red Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day&#x27;s nonsense, and begins shaking her.

Alice awakes in her armchair to find herself holding Kitty, whom she deduces to have been the Red Queen all along, with Snowdrop having been the White Queen. Alice then recalls the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have been a dream of the Red King, and that Alice might be a figment of his imagination.

==Symbolism==
===Mirrors===
One of the key motifs of &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; is that of mirrors, including the use of opposites, time running backwards, and so on, not to mention the title of the book itself. In fact, the themes and settings of the book make it somewhat of a mirror image of its predecessor, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865). The first book begins in the warm outdoors, on 4 May; uses frequent changes in size as a plot device; and draws on the imagery of playing cards. The second book, however, opens indoors on a snowy, wintry night exactly six months later, on 4 November (the day before Guy Fawkes Night); uses frequent changes in time and spatial directions as a plot device; and draws on the imagery of chess.

===Chess===

While the first &quot;Alice&quot; novel took playing cards as a theme, &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; instead used chess; most of the main characters are represented by chess pieces, with Alice being a pawn. The looking-glass world consists of square fields divided by brooks or streams, and the crossing of each brook typically signifies a change in scene, with Alice advancing one square. At the book&#x27;s beginning, Carroll provided and explained a chess composition with descriptive notation, corresponding to the events of the story. Although the piece movements follow the rules of chess, other basic rules are ignored: one player (White) makes several consecutive moves while the (Red/Black) opponent&#x27;s moves are skipped, and a late check (12... Qe8+) is left undealt with. Carroll also explained that certain items listed in the composition do not have corresponding piece moves but simply refer to the story, e.g. the &quot;castling of the three Queens, which is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace&quot;. Despite these liberties, the final position is an authentic checkmate.

The most extensive treatment of the chess motif in Carroll&#x27;s novel was made by Glen Downey in his master&#x27;s thesis, later expanded and incorporated into his dissertation on the use of chess as a device in Victorian fiction. In the former piece, Downey gave the composition&#x27;s moves in algebraic notation: 1... Qh5 2. d4 3. Qc4 4. Qc5 5. d5 6. Qf8 7. d6 8. Qc8 9. d7 Ne7+ 10. Nxe7 11. Nf5 12. d8=Q Qe8+ 13. Qa6 14. Qxe8#. In the latter piece, Downey treated the 21 items in the composition sequentially, identifying the above 16 coherent chess moves, and another five items as &quot;non-moves&quot; or pure story descriptors, per Carroll&#x27;s qualification.

The mating position nearly satisfies the conditions of a pure mate, a special type of checkmate where the mated king is prevented from moving to any of the adjacent squares in its field by exactly one enemy attack, among other conditions. The position is also nearly an ideal mate, a stronger form of pure mate in which every piece on the board of either colour contributes to the checkmate. The one feature of the position which prevents it from being either a pure or an ideal mate is that the Red (Black) King is unable to move to e3 for two reasons: the knight&#x27;s attack, and the (sustained) attack of the newly promoted, mating queen. Although pure and ideal mates are &quot;incidental&quot; in real games, they are objects of aesthetic interest to composers of chess problems.

===Language===
The White Queen offers to hire Alice as her lady&#x27;s maid and to pay her &quot;twopence a week, and jam every other day&quot;. Alice says that she does not want any jam today, to which the Queen replies, &quot;you couldn&#x27;t have it if you &quot;did&quot; want it. The rule is, jam tomorrow and jam yesterdaybut never jam &quot;to-day&quot;.&quot; This is a reference to the rule in Latin that the word &quot;iam&quot; or &quot;jam—&quot;which means &quot;now&quot;, in the sense of &quot;already&quot; or &quot;at that time&quot;—cannot be used to describe &quot;now&quot; in the present, which is &quot;nunc&quot; in Latin. Therefore, &quot;jam&quot; is never available today. This exchange is also a demonstration of the logical fallacy of equivocation.

== The Wasp in a Wig ==
Lewis Carroll decided to suppress a scene involving what was described as &quot;a wasp in a wig&quot; (possibly a play on the commonplace expression &quot;bee in the bonnet&quot;). A biography of Carroll, written by Carroll&#x27;s nephew, Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, suggests that one of the reasons for this suppression was a suggestion from his illustrator, John Tenniel, who wrote in a letter to Carroll dated 1 June 1870:

For many years, no one had any idea what this missing section was or whether it had survived. In 1974, a document purporting to be the galley proofs of the missing section was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s; the catalogue description, in part, read, &quot;the proofs were bought at the sale of the author&#x27;s…personal effects…Oxford, 1898&quot;. The document would be won by John Fleming, a Manhattan book dealer, for a bid of about . The contents were subsequently published in Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;More Annotated Alice&quot; (1990), and are also available as a hardback book.

The rediscovered section describes Alice&#x27;s encounter with a wasp wearing a yellow wig, and includes a full previously unpublished poem. If included in the book, it would have followed, or been included at the end of, Chapter 8the chapter featuring the encounter with the White Knight. The discovery is generally accepted as genuine, but the proofs have yet to receive any physical examination to establish age and authenticity.

The missing episode was included in the 1998 TV film adaptation &quot;Alice through the Looking Glass&quot;, with the character being portrayed by Ian Richardson. It was also included in the 2010 graphic novel &quot;The Complete Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

<text>The Book of Jacob: The Brother of Nephi (), usually referred to as the Book of Jacob, is the third of fifteen books that make up the Book of Mormon, a sacred text within the Latter Day Saint movement. 

== Structure ==
According to the text, it was written by the ancient prophet Jacob, younger brother of Nephi. While this book contains some history of the Nephites, including the death of Nephi, it is mainly a record of Jacob&#x27;s preaching to his people. Chapter 5 contains the Parable of the Olive Tree, a lengthy allegory of the scattering and gathering of Israel, comparing the Israelites and gentiles to tame and wild olive trees, respectively. Jacob is seven chapters long. 

According to Grant Hardy, professor of religious studies, Jacob 4-6 mirrors the structure of Nephi&#x27;s teachings in Second Nephi. He begins with a testimony of Christ, quotes the Brass Plates, and interprets what he has shared. Jacob&#x27;s focus, unlike Nephi&#x27;s focus on Isaiah, is on Zenos.

== Narrative ==
The book of Jacob can be divided into four parts:

===Transition to Jacob&#x27;s leadership===
The prophet Nephi grows old and transfers record keeping responsibility to Jacob. He instructs Jacob to only record spiritually important events, and Jacob writes that the goal of his writing is to convince the people to &quot;come unto Christ.&quot; Nephi dies, and rulers succeeding him are called &quot;second&quot; and &quot;third&quot; Nephi respectively. Jacob explains that he uses the term &quot;Nephite&quot; to refer to anyone who is friendly to the people of Nephi.

===Jacob&#x27;s sermon in the temple===
Jacob offers a speech in the temple in his office of priest and teacher. He identifies three wicked practices among the Nephites: desiring polygamy, or multiple wives, searching out gold and silver, and being prideful. To combat these tendencies, Jacob counsels the people to free captive people and take care of the hungry, poor, and sick. He says that the practice of having multiple wives injures women. He compares the Nephites unfavorably with the Lamanites.

===Jacob&#x27;s prophetic knowledge and the allegory of the olive tree===

Jacob expounds on the purpose of the plates and his knowledge of Christ and the resurrection, and how the Jews will reject Christ. Then he tells the allegory of the olive tree, citing it from Zenos, an extra-Biblical prophet quoted by multiple writers in the Book of Mormon. The story describes the Gathering of Israel in the last days, where the house of Israel is a tame olive tree whose branches partially die. Throughout the allegory, the master of the vineyard tries to revive the olive tree by grafting in wild branches in order to preserve its fruit. For a time this plan succeeds, but the wild branches get into the tree&#x27;s roots and the fruit becomes bad. Both wild and tame branches are grafted onto the tree, which saves it and its fruit. In a final harvest, the vineyard will be burned. After recounting the allegory, Jacob promises that it is true and calls his readers to repentance.

===Anti-Christ Sherem, Nephite militarization, and Jacob&#x27;s farewell===
The final section in the book tells the story of an antichrist named Sherem, who preaches that there will be no Christ, tells Jacob that no one can know the future, and asks him for a sign. Jacob prays, and God smites Sherem, who later confesses that he was lying about Christ and then dies. Subsequently the Nephites become righteous again and attempt to convert the Lamanites to their religion. According to Jacob, the Lamanites hated the Nephites and liked killing them, and the Nephites learned how to defend themselves. When Jacob finishes writing on the plates, he bequeaths them to his son Enos.

==Interpretation and themes==

=== Nephite organization ===
Jacob&#x27;s narrative shows that Nephi&#x27;s duties were divided as he passed them on. A man whose identity is not specified was named king and took up the name Nephi and Nephi&#x27;s brothers, Jacob and Joseph, were consecrated as priests. Jacob was assigned the task of recording on the small plates. Jacob shares that they kept the Law of Moses and looked forward to Christ&#x27;s coming. He also writes that they quickly gained prosperity.

=== Equality and kinship ===
In her chapter on kinship in the Book of Mormon published in Oxford press&#x27;s &quot;Americanist Approaches&quot;, Nancy Bentley, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in kinship in 19th-century America, analyzes Jacob&#x27;s speech. Jacob writes that God forbids polygamy to the Nephites in order to prioritize family harmony over multiple wives. While this was part of a larger argument the Book of Mormon makes in favor of valuing kinship relationships over contractual ones, it also made God the arbiter of moral family relationships. Jacob also argues that the difference in skin color between Nephites and Lamanites is not a biological property, but an external marker of whether or not individuals follow the &quot;family-based spirituality&quot; of the Nephites.

To explain the need for his temple discourse, Jacob cites an issue with pride and inequality among the Nephites. He teaches them that to become like God, they must work towards divine principles such as equality, additionally suggesting the need to rid themselves of inaccurate views of themselves and others. To overcome negative human tendency, the people must turn to God. Christian theology professor Deidre Nicole Green theorizes on Jacob&#x27;s emphasis to treat everyone as your neighbor, that it is vital to think of all others as equal in order to have charity towards them. Green proposes, &quot;Charity is not just tolerance.&quot;

==== Sexual fidelity ====
Jacob, says Green, preaches on different points of pride for the Nephites since they claim superiority over the Lamanites. One of these issues he points out is that the Lamanite women appear to be more respected than Nephite women, also suggesting that Lamanite families are more righteous in their love for each other. While the Nephites have begun to follow David and Solomon&#x27;s examples of having multiple women, according to Jacob, this practice has &quot;broken the hearts&quot; of their wives and lost them the confidence of their children. He insists they should follow the Lamanite example of sexual fidelity and have only one wife and no concubines. Jacob&#x27;s firm condemnation of the Nephites taking up plural marriage is surprising to some readers given polygamy practices of the Latter-day Saint movement during the 1800s.

The second chapter of Jacob, in verse thirty, contains what many believers during the 1800s saw as the allowance for polygamy. It says that God can command periods of plural marriage as an exception to his law. Journalist and religious studies scholar Jana Reiss writes that Latter-day Saints believe the 1830s are an example of such a period, which ended in 1904 when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced any members practicing polygamy would be excommunicated. Some churches which are part of the Latter-day Saint movement still take part in this practice.

=== Sherem ===
Riess contrasts Sherem with biblical instances of Ish Elohim, different anonymous &quot;men of God&quot; who appear to a leader and inform them of a needed change. The story often involves a sign of the Ish Elohim&#x27;s prophetic status and revolves around God&#x27;s punishment to those who take part in false worship. Sherem, according to Riess, is an &quot;upholder of the law&quot; and reproaches Jacob for leaving behind the established religion by preaching of a Christ. Despite this alignment with the &quot;man of God&quot; outline, Jacob includes more information about Sherem than is typically included in the anonymous Ish Elohim stories. Additionally, rather than revealing a sign of his prophetic calling, Sherem demands a sign and Jacob demonstrates his own calling.

Riess also compares Sherem&#x27;s story to René Girard&#x27;s scapegoat theory. The Nephites, she writes, were upset over some of Jacob&#x27;s teachings regarding their sins. Just as two brothers fighting over a toy unite again after insulting a common enemy, Sherem&#x27;s story may have been vital to bring the Nephites onto common ground.

Comparative religion researcher Jacob Rennaker identifies that Sherem&#x27;s smiting is never directly attributed to God in the text. The description that he was suffering for &quot;many days&quot; before dying may suggest inner turmoil and &quot;self-inflicted madness&quot;.

<text>The Book of Ether () is one of the books of the Book of Mormon. It describes the Jaredites, descendants of Jared and his companions, who were led by God to the Americas shortly after the confusion of tongues and the destruction of the Tower of Babel. Ether consists of fifteen chapters.

The title refers to Ether, a Jaredite prophet who, according to the Book of Mormon, lived at the end of the period covered by the book, believed to be circa 2600 or 2100 BC through 600 BC or later, at least 1500 but possibly as long as 2500 years.

==Narrative==
Jared and his people were among the many scattered peoples from the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The brother of Jared is described as &quot;a large and mighty man ... highly favored of the Lord&quot;, and seems to have been the spiritual leader of the group. He was given a vision of the history of the world, and inscribed prophecies, which were &quot;sealed up&quot; until the Lord decides to reveal them. The Lord told the brother of Jared to build unpowered submarines, termed &quot;barges&quot; or &quot;vessels&quot;, to cross the ocean to the promised land. The barges could circulate fresh air because of openings in the top and bottom of the vessel. The hole in the top could be &quot;stopped up&quot; when the waves crashed over the vessel to prevent scuttling. The hole in the bottom is assumed to have been constructed as a sort of moon pool with the lip above the waterline so it would not flood the vessel. This would also allow wave action and the buoying of the vessel to pump fresh air in and out of the vessel when the upper opening was uncapped.

Because the vessels could not sustain fire or windows for light, the brother of Jared went to a mountain and prayed for help. God touched several molten stones and made them shine. Because of the brother of Jared&#x27;s great faith, he saw the finger of God. He then saw and spoke with Jehovah. The people launched the vessels and traveled through great storms. After 344 days, they arrived at the Americas. Jared and his brother led the people to successfully establish a righteous nation.

==Parallels==
The Book of Ether parallels in many ways the story of the Book of Mormon as a whole. A small group (Jared and his companions; Lehi and his family) separate themselves from a wicked society (the Tower of Babel; Jerusalem just prior to its destruction) and establish a new nation (the Jaredites; the Nephites) in &quot;the promised land.&quot; In each case the group is divided following the death of the original leaders and the divisions contend for many generations. The fortunes of the nations are dependent upon their obedience to God—righteousness brings prosperity and wickedness brings destruction (sometimes delayed). Ultimately, the wicked prevail and the nation is destroyed.

These parallels are often emphasized in Mormonism as applicable to the present day. The Americas are still considered &quot;the promised land&quot; and the continued prosperity of the present nations are believed to be contingent on the righteousness of their people.

==Provenance==

As the story is told in the Book of Mormon, what later was named the Book of Ether was taken from a set of twenty-four plates written by Ether and discovered by the people of Limhi during the time of King Mosiah (son of King Benjamin). Joseph Smith claimed the book was abridged by Moroni onto the golden plates, which Joseph Smith claimed to translate into English.

However, according to Daniel H. Ludlow, it is not clarified in the Book of Mormon whether Moroni made his abridgment of the record of Ether from Mosiah&#x27;s earlier translation or whether Moroni took his account directly from the plates of Ether—in which case Joseph Smith would have needed to translate the record as well as abridge it.

<doc id="31627" wikidata="Q13972" url="?curid=31627" title="Tartu">
<text>Tartu is the second largest city in Estonia after Tallinn. Tartu has a population of 97,435 (as of 2023). It is southeast of Tallinn and 245 kilometres (152 miles) northeast of Riga, Latvia. Tartu lies on the Emajõgi river, which connects the two largest lakes in Estonia, Lake Võrtsjärv and Lake Peipus. From the 13th century until the end of the 19th century, Tartu was known in most of the world by variants of its historical name Dorpat.
Tartu, the largest urban centre of southern Estonia, is often considered the &quot;intellectual capital city&quot; of the country, especially as it is home to the nation&#x27;s oldest and most renowned university, the University of Tartu (founded in 1632). Tartu also houses the Supreme Court of Estonia, the Ministry of Education and Research, the Estonian National Museum, and the oldest Estonian-language theatre, Vanemuine. It is also the birthplace of the Estonian Song Festivals.

Tartu was designated as the European Capital of Culture in 2024.

==Names and etymology==

It is thought that the name derives from the word for aurochs, &quot;tarvas&quot;. Since Estonia became an independent country in 1918, the Estonian-language &quot;Tartu&quot; (), alternative South Estonian spelling: &quot;Tarto&quot;) has been the only name in official use but throughout its history there have also been various names for it in other languages. Most of them derive ultimately from the earliest attested form, the Estonian &quot;Tarbatu&quot;. In German, Swedish and Polish the town has been known, and up until the 20th century was sometimes referred to, as , a variant of &quot;Tarbatu&quot;. In Russian the city has been known as (&quot;Yur′yev&quot;, after Yuri, the baptismal name of grand prince Yaroslav I the Wise) and as (&quot;Derpt&quot;, from the Low German variant of &quot;Dorpat&quot;). Similarly the city has been known as &quot;Tērbata&quot; in Latvian, and Finnish speakers use the toponym &quot;Tartto&quot;.
Tartu lies on the Emajõgi River, whose name literally means &#x27;mother river&#x27; in Estonian. In Latvian, the name of Emajõgi river is Mētra. Therefore, Tartu&#x27;s historical unofficial name in Latvian is Mētraine. Historically, Tartu was the main center for Latvian academic education, which is the reason why the name of the city used to be Latvianized.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Archaeological evidence of the first permanent settlement on the site of modern Tartu dates to as early as the 5th century AD. By the 7th century, local inhabitants had built a wooden fortification on the east side of Toome Hill (&quot;Toomemägi&quot;). Over the next centuries the settlement grew, and around 9th–10th centuries became an inland trading center.

The first documented records of the area were made by later mediaeval chroniclers who described the events of early-11th-century Kievan Rus&#x27;. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (PVL) and &quot;Sofia First Chronicle&quot; (SPL), Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev, invaded the region of Tartu in 1030, and after defeating the &quot;Chud″&quot;, built his own fort there, and named it &quot;Yuryev&quot;. Tartu may have remained under Kievan Rus&#x27; control until 1061, when, according to the SPL, the &quot;Yuryev&quot; fort was burned down by &quot;Sosols&quot; (probably Oeselians, Sackalians, or another Estonian tribe). Soon afterwards the fort was rebuilt by locals. In the 12th century, local Ungannians on one side and troops from the neighbouring Novgorod Republic on the other side repeatedly raided each other. In those campaigns, the invaders were reportedly able to capture Tartu in 1133 or 1134, and in the winter of 1191–1192, however these temporary captures are not known to have brought any lasting territorial changes.

===Medieval bishopric===

During the period of Northern Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century the fort of &quot;Tarbatu&quot; (or &quot;Tharbata&quot;) was captured by the crusading Teutonic knights — also known as the Brothers of the Sword — and recaptured by Estonians on several occasions. In 1224, after the princes of Novgorod and Pskov had sent additional troops led by prince Vyachko of Kukenois to aid the Estonian defenders of the fort, it was besieged and conquered for one last time by the Teutonic crusaders. Subsequently, known as Dorpat (Latin: &quot;Tarbatum&quot;), Tartu became a commercial centre of considerable importance during the later Middle Ages and the capital of the semi-independent Bishopric of Dorpat.

In 1262 the army of prince Dmitri of Pereslavl launched an assault on Dorpat, capturing and destroying the town. His troops did not manage to capture the bishop&#x27;s fortress on Toome Hill. The event was recorded both in subsequent German and Old East Slavic chronicles, which also provided the first record of a settlement of German merchants and artisans which had arisen alongside the bishop&#x27;s fortress.

In medieval times, after the Livonian Order was subsumed into the Teutonic Knights in 1236, the town became an important trading city. In the 1280s Dorpat joined the Hanseatic League. 

===Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish rule===
In 1558, tsar Ivan the Terrible invaded Tartu beginning the Livonian War. Forces under the command of Pyotr Shuiski encircled the town and began the heavy bombardment. In light of this and without any prospect of external help the town surrendered. The local bishop was imprisoned in Moscow, which effectively ended the period of local self-government. Ivan Mikhailovich Viskovatyi, a leading diplomat and archivist of diplomatic records during Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s reign, argued that Tartu&#x27;s &quot;founding&quot; by Ancient Rus&#x27; justified Russia&#x27;s contemporary territorial claims to the region. In the effect of the Truce of Jam Zapolski of 1582, the city along with southern regions of Livonian Confederation became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1598 it became the capital of the Dorpat Voivodeship of the Duchy of Livonia. A Jesuit grammar school &quot;Gymnasium Dorpatense&quot; was established in 1583. In addition, a translators&#x27; seminary was organized in Tartu and the city received its red and white flag from the Polish king Stephen Báthory.

The activities of both the grammar school and the seminary were stopped by the Polish–Swedish War. Already in late 1600 the forces of Charles IX of Sweden besieged the city defended by three banners of reiters and the city&#x27;s burghers. Despite repeated assaults, the Swedes could not enter the city. Finally in 1601 Capt. Hermann Wrangel switched sides, assaulted the castellan and opened the gates for the Swedish forces. The town was retaken by Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on 13 April 1603 following a brief siege led by hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz; roughly 1000 Swedish soldiers surrendered and were escorted to Tallinn.

In the effect of yet another Polish-Swedish War, in 1625 Tartu was once again captured by Sweden, this time for good. In the effect of the 1629 Truce of Altmark the city became part of the Dominions of Sweden, which led to the foundation of the University of Tartu in 1632 by king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.

===Imperial Russia===
In 1704 the town was taken by the Russian army in the presence of Tsar Peter the Great himself. As a result, around a quarter of the town and much of the fortifications were damaged. In 1708 the remainder of the fortifications and houses, including the remains of bishops castle, were blown up, all movable property was looted and all citizens were deported to Russia. With the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, the city became part of the Russian Empire and was known as &quot;Derpt&quot;. Fires in the 18th century destroyed much of the medieval architecture, the Great Fire of Tartu in 1775 removed most of the buildings in the centre. The city was rebuilt along Late Baroque and Neoclassical lines including the Tartu Town Hall which was built between 1782 and 1789. In 1783 the city became the centre of Derpt uyezd within the Governorate of Livonia.

During the second half of the 19th century, Tartu was the cultural centre for Estonians in the era of Romantic nationalism. The city hosted Estonia&#x27;s first song festival in 1869. &quot;Vanemuine&quot;, the first national theatre, was established in 1870. Tartu was also the setting for the foundation of the Society of Estonian Writers in 1872.

Tartu railway station was opened in 1876 when Tapa–Tartu route was built. The station building was opened in 1877. In the history of tuberculosis, in 1891 The Veterinary College at Dorpat produced seminal research using the Tuberculin test on 1,000 cattle.

In 1893, the city was officially retitled to the ancient Russian name &quot;Yuryev&quot;. The university was subsequently russified from 1895 on with the introduction of compulsory Russian in teaching. Much of the university property was relocated to Voronezh in 1918 and during the German occupation, the university worked under the name Landesuniversität Dorpat. During the Estonian War of Independence the university of Tartu was re-opened as an Estonian language university on 1 December 1919.

===Independent Estonia (1918–1940)===

With Estonian independence after World War I, the city officially became known by the Estonian name &quot;Tartu&quot;. At the end of the 1918–1920 Estonian War of Independence following World War I, a peace treaty between the Bolshevik Russia and Estonia was signed on 2 February 1920 in Tartu (Treaty of Tartu). With the treaty, Soviet Russia renounced territorial claims to Estonia &quot;for all time&quot;.

In 1920, the peace treaty between Soviet Russia and Finland was also signed in Tartu.

During the interwar period Tähtvere neighbourhood was built, former Raadi Manor buildings started to house Estonian National Museum (destroyed during Tartu Offensive in 1944) and art school Pallas was opened.

===German and Soviet occupations (1940–1991)===

During World War II, the Stalinist Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia and Tartu in June 1940. Large parts of the city as well as the historical &quot;Kivisild&quot; (&quot;Stone bridge&quot;, built in 1776–1778) over the Emajõgi river were destroyed by the retreating Soviet Army, partly in 1941 and almost completely in 1944 by then retreating German Army. Already heavily damaged, Tartu was repeatedly bombed by the Soviet air forces on 27 January 1943, on 26 February 1944, on 7–8 March 1944, and on 25–26 March 1944. After the war ended, much of the city&#x27;s historic centre was left in ruins. Even the less damaged buildings in entire city blocks were demolished by the Soviet occupation authorities and large swathes of previously residential areas were turned into parks and parking lots.

After the war, the Soviet authorities declared Tartu a &quot;closed town for foreigners&quot;, as an airbase for bombers was constructed on Raadi Airfield, in the northeast outskirts of the city. It was one of the largest military airbases in the former Eastern Bloc and housed strategic bombers carrying nuclear bombs. On one end of an older strip of the runway, the new building of Estonian National Museum was built.

Tartu Airport was opened in the south of the city in 1946. Besides the airport Estonian Aviation Academy was established in 1993. Privately owned Estonian Aviation Museum, which is 5 km to the East of the airport (7 km by car), was opened to the public in 2002.
During the 1944–1991 Soviet occupation the population of Tartu almost doubled from 57,000 to above 100,000 — due to mass immigration from Russia and other areas of the former Soviet Union, in large part because of the military airbase. 
===Modern era===

Since Estonia regained its independence in 1991, the old town centre has been renovated. Notably, St. John&#x27;s Church, in ruins since World War II, has been restored. Many new commercial and business buildings have been erected (&quot;Tartu Kaubamaja&quot;, &quot;Tasku&quot;, &quot;Emajõe kaubanduskeskus&quot;, &quot;Lõunakeskus&quot;, &quot;Kvartal&quot;, etc.). The highest residential building and local landmark &quot;Tigutorn&quot; was opened in 2008.

The AHHAA science centre relocated to a new building in 2011 and the Estonian National Museum&#x27;s new main building opened in 2016.
== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Tartu lies within the temperate humid continental climate zone (Dfb). The climate is rather mild considering the high latitude, largely due to the proximity of the Baltic Sea and warm airflows from the Atlantic. Nevertheless, continental influence can be felt on hot summer days and cold spells in winter, when the temperature can occasionally (but rarely) drop below . Generally, summers are warm and winters are cold.

The Tartu weather station is located in Tõravere village, which is about 20 kilometers from the city, so the actual temperature in the city may be slightly warmer than the official average temperatures.
==Economy==

Mostly known as a university town, Tartu is also a site of heavy industry. The food industry has traditionally been important for the town&#x27;s economy and some bigger companies in the field include A. Le Coq, Tartu Mill and Salvest. Kroonpress is one of the leading printing press companies in the Baltics.

At the beginning of the 21st century, many ICT enterprises and other high-tech companies have taken a foothold in Tartu. Notable examples include Playtech Estonia, Nortal (formerly Webmedia Group), ZeroTurnaround, Tarkon, Reach-U and Raintree Estonia. Skype has an office in Tartu. The university is one of the largest employers, which explains the large proportion of highly skilled professionals – researchers, professors, doctors, and Tartu University Clinic has been considered the largest employer of Tartu.

==Transport==
The city is served by Tartu Airport. The distance to Estonia&#x27;s &quot;summer holiday capital&quot;, Pärnu (in the western Estonia) is and the fastest route there by road is through Viljandi and Kilingi-Nõmme. Tartu is connected to Riga, Tallinn, and other Estonian towns by many bus and train routes.

==Demographics==

Tartu&#x27;s historic population is presented in the following table, based on data from official censuses since 1881 and Estonian Statistical Office. Note that the data up to 2011 is not directly comparable to the most recent numbers, as the methodology of compiling population statistics has changed.

==Neighbourhoods==

Tartu is officially divided into 17 neighbourhoods, which carry no administrative purposes. Their names and borders are defined.







==Education and culture==

The city is best known for being home to the University of Tartu (formerly known as the University of Dorpat; ), founded under King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1632. Mainly for this reason, Tartu is also – tongue-in-cheek – known as &quot;Athens of the Emajõgi&quot; or as &quot;Heidelberg of the North&quot;.

Tartu is also the seat of the Estonian University of Life Sciences, the Baltic Defence College, Estonian Aviation Academy (formerly known as Tartu Aviation College), and the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research. Other notable institutions include the Supreme Court of Estonia (re-established in Tartu in autumn 1993), the Estonian Historical Archives, Estonian National Museum, Estonian Sports and Olympic Museum as well as the oldest and renowned theatre in the country, Vanemuine, where they have a well-respected ballet company as well as theatre, opera and musical productions.

In music, there exists the Tartu school of composition.

Most of the sculptures in Tartu are dedicated to historical figures. Among them, the most famous are the Barclay de Tolly monument on Barclay Square in downtown, the Kissing Students monument on the town hall square and Gustav II Adolf´s monument on King&#x27;s Square ().

==Science==
Tartu has been an intellectual centre of both Estonia and the Baltic countries for several centuries. Scholars hailing from Tartu include the pioneer of embryology Karl Ernst von Baer, a pioneer of animal behaviour studies Jakob von Uexküll, and a cultural theorist and semiotician Juri Lotman. Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, a Baltic German physician, naturalist, and entomologist, was born in Tartu. He was one of the earliest scientific explorers of the Pacific region, making significant collections of flora and fauna in Alaska, California, and Hawaii. Nobel Chemistry Prize laureate Wilhelm Ostwald studied and worked in Tartu. The Tartu School is one of the leading scientific schools in semiotics.

==Main sights==

The architecture and city planning of historical Tartu mainly go back to the pre-independence period, with Germans forming the upper and middle classes of society, and therefore contributing many architects, professors and local politicians.

Most notable are the old Lutheran St. John&#x27;s Church (, ), the 18th-century town hall, the university building, ruins of the 13th-century cathedral, the botanical gardens, the main shopping street, many buildings around the town hall square and Barclay Square.

The historical slum area called Supilinn (&quot;Soup Town&quot;) is located on the bank of river Emajõgi, near the town centre and is regarded as one of the few surviving &quot;poor&quot; neighbourhoods of 19th-century Europe. At the moment Supilinn is being rapidly renovated, undergoing a slow transformation from the historic slum into a prestigious high-class neighborhood. The active community embodied by the Supilinn Society is committed to preserving the heritage.

The Second World War destroyed large parts of the city centre and during the Soviet occupation, many new buildings were erected – notably the new Vanemuine Theater. The effects of the war are still witnessed by the relative abundance of parks and greenery in the historic centre. Typical Soviet-style neighbourhoods of blocks of high-rise flats were built between World War II and the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, the largest such district being Annelinn.

Presently, Tartu is also known for several modern buildings of the &quot;steel, concrete and glass&quot; variation, but has managed to retain a mix of old and new buildings in the centre of town. Notable examples include the Tigutorn Tower and the Emajõe Centre, both built during the current period of independence; Tartu&#x27;s tallest and second tallest towers, respectively. Tartu&#x27;s large student population means that it has a comparatively thriving nightlife, with many nightclubs, bars, and restaurants, including the world&#x27;s highest-ceiling pub, in the historic Gunpowder Cellar of Tartu.

Annually, in the summer, Tartu hosts the Hanseatic Days festival () to celebrate its Hanseatic heritage. The festival includes events such as handicraft markets, historic workshops and jousting tournaments.

==Sports==
The city hosts the Rally Estonia. It is the biggest motorsport event in the Baltic states. The rally was part of the European Rally Championship between 2014 and 2016. Since 2020 Rally Estonia is part of the World Rally Championship.

Tartu is the home for basketball club Tartu Ülikool/Rock, which participates in the Korvpalli Meistriliiga and the Latvian-Estonian Basketball League.

Football club JK Tammeka Tartu, one of the Meistriliiga clubs, is located in Tartu. Their home stadium is the Tamme Staadion, which has a capacity of 1600. The city is also home to the Tartu JK Welco and FC Santos Tartu clubs, which play in the Esiliiga, the second division.

Tartu has a professional volleyball club, Bigbank Tartu, as well as the handball team, the Tartu Ülikool/Glassdrive, which plays in the second division of Estonian handball.

Tartu is also the hometown of Clement &quot;Puppey&quot; Ivanov, captain of Team Secret, a professional Dota 2 team. He won the first International, and was runner-up two years in a row with Natus Vincere.

The 2017 World Orienteering Championships were held in Tartu.

The annual running event Tartu Sügisjooks takes place in Tartu.

<text>The Chemical Brothers are an English electronic music duo formed by Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands in Manchester in 1992. They were pioneers in bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture.

Originally known as The Dust Brothers, they changed their name due to the existence of another band with the same name. Their first album &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; sold over one million copies and debuted at No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart. After attracting Virgin Records, the duo achieved further success with their second album &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; (1997), which topped the UK chart. They have had six No. 1 albums and 13 top-20 singles in the UK, including two chart-toppers. They have won six Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Instrumental Performance, Best Dance Recording, and Best Dance/Electronic Album.

==History==
=== 1984–1995: Formation and early incarnations ===
Ed Simons (born 9 June 1970) was born the son of a barrister mother and a father he described as &quot;absent&quot;. After finishing at Dulwich College, an &quot;expensive&quot; public school with 11 O levels and three A levels, he studied history, at the University of Manchester.

Tom Rowlands (born 11 January 1971) was raised in Henley-on-Thames having attended Reading Blue Coat School in Sonning-On-Thames. He met Simons at the University of Manchester in 1989; they shared an interest in raves and club-going. Rowlands chose Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene, particularly the Fac 51 Hacienda.

Rowlands was in a band called Ariel prior to meeting Simons. He formed Ariel in London with friends Brendan Melck and Mathew Berry. Their first single was &quot;Sea of Beats&quot;, which was essentially a white label record. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was &quot;Bokadilo&quot;. Other songs, released on 12-inch, included &quot;Mustn&#x27;t Grumble&quot; and their best-known, &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;. After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the record label deConstruction. They insisted on a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman Sally Ann Marsh, and after some disappointing songs such as &quot;Let It Slide&quot; (Rowlands would later describe it as &quot;a stinker&quot;), the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song &quot;T Baby&quot;, which was remixed by the pair.

Rowlands and Simons started to DJ in 1992 at a club called Naked Under Leather, located in the back of a pub called the Swinging Sporran (later renamed Retro Bar and currently operated by the University of Manchester). There, they were known by the alias &quot;237 Turbo Nutters&quot;, after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn raving days. The pair would play hip hop, techno, and house. The two called themselves The Dust Brothers after the US production duo, famous for their work with the Beastie Boys. After a while, Rowlands and Simons began to run out of suitable instrumental hip hop tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a Hitachi hi-fi system, an Atari ST, a sampler, and a keyboard, they recorded &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, which sampled This Mortal Coil. &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; was released on their own record label, which they called Diamond Records (after Ed&#x27;s nickname). At this point the Dust Brothers were the first-ever backroom DJs in the Sumptuous Locarno Lounge at The Job Club in Gossips night club in Dean Street, Soho from April 1992 till April 1993.

In October 1992, they pressed 500 white label copies and took them to dance-record shops around London, but all refused to play it, saying it was too slow (the track played at 111 BPM). They sent a copy to London DJ Andrew Weatherall, who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. In May 1993 Steven Hall signed the duo and Junior Boy&#x27;s Own released &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;.

Around June 1993, the Dust Brothers recorded their first remixes. The first was &quot;Packet of Peace&quot; for Justin Robertson&#x27;s Lionrock group, followed by songs from Leftfield, Republica, and the Sandals. Later in 1993, Rowlands and Simons completed work on their &quot;Fourteenth Century Sky&quot; EP, released in January 1994. It contained the groundbreaking &quot;Chemical Beats&quot;, which epitomised the duo&#x27;s genre-defining big beat sound. The EP also contained &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, which for the first time showed their less intense, more chilled-out side. Both &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot; and &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; would later appear on their debut album. &quot;Fourteenth Century Sky&quot; was followed later in 1994 by the &quot;My Mercury Mouth EP&quot;. &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the &quot;Wipeout&quot; video game series, having been featured in &quot;Wipeout&quot; for the PlayStation in 1995.

In October 1994, the Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small but influential Heavenly Sunday Social Club at the Albany pub in London&#x27;s Great Portland Street. Noel Gallagher, Paul Weller, James Dean Bradfield, and Tim Burgess were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by Manic Street Preachers and the Charlatans, plus Primal Scream&#x27;s &quot;Jailbird&quot; and the Prodigy&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo People&quot;. These two remixes received television exposure, being playlisted by MTV Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Party Zone&quot; in 1995.

In March 1995, the Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States – where they played with Orbital and Underworld – then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, objections were filed by the original Dust Brothers over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name. They decided to call themselves the Chemical Brothers after &quot;Chemical Beats&quot;.

In June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. &quot;Leave Home&quot; was released on Junior Boy&#x27;s Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band&#x27;s first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.

=== 1995–1998: &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; and &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; ===
In July 1995, the Chemical Brothers released their debut album &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; (the title inspired by their name change) on Junior Boy&#x27;s Own. It debuted on the UK chart at No. 9, and featured guest vocalist Beth Orton on the song &quot;Alive Alone&quot;. It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the science fiction TV series pilot &quot;Virtuality&quot;. Shortly after its release, the Chemical Brothers signed to Virgin Records, to which they took their own offshoot label, Freestyle Dust. For their next single, &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;, released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of the Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK singles chart. The single was also &quot;Select&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Single of the Month&quot; for October. The release included a Daft Punk remix of &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;.

In October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents of Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills and also in Liquid Rooms in Tokyo. In November, the Chemical Brothers played the Astoria Theatre in London. The duo also supported The Prodigy in December on dates at Brixton Academy and in Blackpool.

In January 1996, &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; was certified gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the &quot;Loops of Fury&quot; EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK chart at No. 13. &quot;NME&quot; described the lead track as &quot;splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats&quot;. The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of &quot;Chemical Beats&quot;, and two other new tracks, &quot;Get Up on It Like This&quot; and &quot;(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up&quot;.

In February 1996, &quot;Select&quot; magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, the Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at Knebworth, where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.

During the 1995 Glastonbury Festival, Noel Gallagher had told them how much he liked &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot;, and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way Tim Burgess had worked on &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;. They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis&#x27; &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, plus the complexities of dealing with each other&#x27;s record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track they thought would benefit from a vocal. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message early next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called &quot;Setting Sun&quot; and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK chart at the top, giving the duo their first ever No. 1 single. &quot;Setting Sun&quot; was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track &quot;Buzz Tracks&quot;, which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of the Beatles&#x27; lawyers later wrote to the Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming they had sampled &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. Virgin Records hired a musicologist to prove they did not sample the song.

In 1996, &quot;Live at the Social Volume 1&quot; was released by Heavenly Records, which became the Chemical Brothers&#x27; first mix CD (excluding &quot;Xmas Dust Up&quot;, a free album that came in a 1994 issue of &quot;NME&quot;). It was also the duo&#x27;s first live album (excluding the EP &quot;Live 05&quot;).

In March 1997, the Chemical Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album. &quot;Block Rockin&#x27; Beats&quot; contained a Schoolly D vocal sample and re-working of the bass-line from 23 Skidoo&#x27;s single &quot;Coup&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; named it &quot;Single of the Week&quot; and said: &quot;It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of amyl.&quot; It later won them a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In the US at this time, &quot;Setting Sun&quot; was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Hot 100, after selling around 80,000 copies. Sales from &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; were also around 150,000.

On 7 April 1997, the Chemical Brothers released their second album, &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot;. It was recorded at the band&#x27;s own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received, with &quot;Mixmag&quot; rating it 10/10 and calling it &quot;mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables&quot;.

During the summer of 1997, the Chemical Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. In August, the Chemical Brothers achieved a rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single &quot;Elektrobank&quot;. They themselves also became highly sought-after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot;, &quot;Elektrobank&quot; was released. In November, the pair played at Dublin&#x27;s Point Theatre, with support from Carl Cox. They also began a US tour in Detroit.

At the end of the year, &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot;″s final track, the nine-minute-long &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot;, gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The B-side consisted of a live version of &quot;Setting Sun&quot;, recorded at the Lowlands Festival, Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, the Chemical Brothers toured the UK, concluding in a sold-out show at Brixton Academy, London.

In 1998, they concentrated more on DJing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including &quot;I Think I&#x27;m in Love&quot; from Spiritualized. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Chemical Brothers was &quot;Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp&quot; by Mercury Rev. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev&#x27;s Jonathon Donahue contributed to &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot; on &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot;.

In September 1998, a second mix album, &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot;, was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as Renegade Soundwave, Meat Beat Manifesto, Carlos &quot;After Dark&quot; Berrios, and Kenny &#x27;Dope&#x27; Gonzales.

=== 1999–2002: &quot;Surrender&quot; and &quot;Come with Us&quot; ===
In May 1999, the Chemical Brothers played three UK dates, their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot;. This was more house-influenced than big beat. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK chart.

Their third album, &quot;Surrender&quot;, was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev&#x27;s Jonathan Donahue, and Mazzy Star&#x27;s Hope Sandoval. As &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot; had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album&#x27;s stand out tracks, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, New Order&#x27;s Bernard Sumner supported by Primal Scream&#x27;s Bobby Gillespie provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. The Michel Gondry-directed music video for &quot;Let Forever Be&quot;, which utilised ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman&#x27;s nightmares, also received a lot of attention.

Later that summer, the Chemical Brothers performed at the Woodstock &#x27;99 concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the Glastonbury dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included Homelands Scotland on 4 September. In November, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the Sasha remix. The final single from &quot;Surrender&quot;, in February 2000, was the five track &quot;Music: Response&quot; EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus Electronic Battle Weapon 4, named &quot;Freak of the Week&quot;, and a track called &quot;Enjoyed&quot;, which was essentially a remix of &quot;Out of Control&quot; by the Chemical Brothers themselves. A CD copy of &quot;Surrender&quot; was placed in the third &quot;Blue Peter&quot; time capsule, buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream&#x27;s album &quot;Xtrmntr&quot; at track 11 with a remix.

In June 2000, they played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at Creamfields festival, Ireland. In December 2000, the Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot; at their New York DJ gigs, supporting U2.

In 2001, they were active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled &quot;Chemical Four&quot;. The first track which fans got a taste of was &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;, as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in California in April 2001, at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Another new track, &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;, also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot; was first pressed as a promo, as part of the &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon&quot; series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the &quot;anthems&quot; in Ibiza as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.

Rowlands and Simons also remixed a track from Fatboy Slim&#x27;s &quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars&quot;, entitled &quot;Song for Shelter&quot;. This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;) as the CD2 single for &quot;Song for Shelter / Ya Mama&quot;. It reached No. 30 in the UK singles chart (sales were combined with the CD1 single).

The Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, &quot;Come with Us&quot;, in October 2001. It featured collaborations with Richard Ashcroft of the Verve (&quot;The Test&quot;), and long-time collaborator Beth Orton (&quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot;). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, &quot;Star Guitar&quot;, a melodic Balearic beat number, with a promotional video by Michel Gondry that featured passing scenery synchronised to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;, was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. &quot;Star Guitar&quot; was also released as a DVD single, the pair&#x27;s first. &quot;Come with Us&quot;, was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by Fatboy Slim as part of a double A-sided release with &quot;The Test&quot;.

During the summer of 2002, the Chemical Brothers travelled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled &quot;AmericanEP&quot;). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced New Order&#x27;s &quot;Here to Stay&quot;, written for the film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; and released as a single to promote the soundtrack, and remixed the song as well. One of their other major songs from this album was &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;, which was popular and featured as the main title music for the Xbox game &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;. It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;. &quot;Star Guitar&quot; was featured as a song on the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s &quot;Lumines II&quot;.

Two other songs, &quot;Come with Us (Introduction)&quot; and &quot;Star Guitar (Title Screen)&quot;, were featured on a PlayStation 2 racing game titled &quot;WRC II: Extreme&quot;. Both songs are instrumental. The song &quot;My Elastic Eye&quot; from the album &quot;Come with Us&quot; was played in the 2004 film &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Push the Button&quot; ===
Early 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including &quot;The Golden Path&quot;, a collaboration with Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a &quot;best of&quot; album, entitled &quot;Singles 93–03&quot;, marking ten years of the Chemical Brothers&#x27; releases. &quot;Singles 93–03&quot; included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to &quot;The Golden Path&quot;, was included on the album, called &quot;Get Yourself High&quot;. &quot;Singles 93–03&quot; was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. &quot;Get Yourself High&quot;, which featured Canadian rapper k-os on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.

In late 2003 and 2004, the Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of &quot;Slow&quot; by Kylie Minogue. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot;) and on 12-inch vinyl picture disc (containing two other Minogue remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival, Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited South America for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. It was during these sets that they played new material, including &quot;Acid Children&quot;, which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.

In September 2004, the Chemical Brothers released the seventh &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon&quot;. &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 7&quot; was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12-inch, containing &quot;Acid Children&quot;. A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers&#x27; previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming &quot;You Are All My Children Now!&quot;, which is lifted from the horror film &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.

The &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon&quot; series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.

In 2004, the Chemical Brothers began work on &quot;Push the Button&quot;, their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with Tim Burgess, Kele Okereke, and Anwar Superstar, amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.

&quot;Galvanize&quot;, which features rapper Q-Tip on vocals, was the first single to be taken from &quot;Push the Button&quot;, and premiered on iTunes. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, &quot;Believe&quot; (featuring Kele Okereke from Bloc Party), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. &quot;The Boxer&quot;, featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo&#x27;s first single to fail to crack the top 40.

The album and single &quot;Galvanize&quot; won a Grammy at the Grammy Awards of 2006. The track &quot;Surface to Air&quot; features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to the Strokes song &quot;The Modern Age&quot;.

An unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled &quot;Flip the Switch&quot; was released as a free download, along with the &quot;Believe&quot; EP, featuring six further remixes of &quot;Believe&quot;.

In September 2006, the Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in Tate Tracks. Tate Modern invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery&#x27;s collection of modern art and then write a track about it. The Chemical Brothers&#x27; submission, &quot;Rock Drill&quot;, was inspired by the Jacob Epstein sculpture &quot;Torso in Metal from the Rock Drill&quot;, and could be heard on headphones in front of the work in the gallery. From October 2006, it also became available to hear online at the Tate Tracks website.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;We Are the Night&quot; ===
The Brothers announced in June 2006 on their official web forum that the duo had been working on new material, specifically an album, code-named &quot;Chemical 6&quot;. Simons also wrote that the band would be playing select venues in the Summer 2007 season, specifying Rome, and also Fabric in London. Simons was also quoted as saying that the duo were &quot;hoping to put a battle weapon out for the summer&quot;, possibly referring to the Electronic Battle Weapon series, the somewhat experimental tracks the band occasionally released on white label record.

&quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 8&quot; and &quot;9&quot; were debuted on Pete Tong&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show on 8 December 2006. The double-sided vinyl was finally released just before the Chemical Brothers&#x27; much anticipated New Year&#x27;s Eve gig at the famous Turnmills in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and was received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 8&quot;, at about six and a half minutes, was very distinct from the &quot;big acid&quot; style that the earlier &quot;Electronic Battle Weapons&quot; adhered to. It was characterised by &#x27;thundering&#x27; drums with a rising synth line. A version of this track featured on the &quot;We Are the Night&quot; album and was entitled &quot;Saturate&quot;. &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 9&quot; was a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark vocoder vocals coupled with sirens and a basic &#x27;tribal&#x27; melody.

At the same Turnmills gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as &quot;Burst Generator&quot;, found on the forthcoming album &quot;We Are the Night&quot;. Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one-off experiments or signalled a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band&#x27;s 100th released song.

On 21 March 2007, the Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on Myspace. The new album, entitled &quot;We Are the Night&quot;, was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States. The Chemical Brothers cited a delay in the production of artwork for this delay. EMI subsequently released an online Chemical Brothers computer game as an apology. The track listing was released on the official mailing list on 10 April. Collaborations featured heavily on the album, including Klaxons (&quot;All Rights Reversed&quot;), Midlake (&quot;The Pills Won&#x27;t Help You Now&quot;), Ali Love (&quot;Do It Again&quot;), and Willy Mason (&quot;Battle Scars&quot;).

On 12 April 2007, &quot;Do It Again&quot; aired on Pete Tong&#x27;s &quot;In New Music We Trust&quot; show on BBC Radio 1. The official release of the single was 4 June (digital download) and 14 June (12-inch, 7-inch and CD). The album went on general release in the UK on 2 July 2007.

The Chemical Brothers supplied a new track for the &quot;Heroes&quot; soundtrack, titled &quot;Keep My Composure&quot;. An alternate version of this track was released on &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, the duo&#x27;s second singles compilation, which also featured the new single &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; and a second disc of every Electronic Battle Weapon released to date. The Chemical Brothers continued to tour into 2008 to promote the collection, including a landmark date at Olympia London.

=== 2010–2012: &quot;Further&quot;, &quot;Hanna&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Think&quot; ===
On 30 March 2010, the band announced on their website that their seventh studio album, titled &quot;Further&quot;, would be released on 22 June and would be &quot;the band&#x27;s first to be released with corresponding films made specifically to match each of the 8 audio tracks.&quot; The films were made with long-time visuals collaborators Adam Smith and Marcus Lyall. Before the release of the album, the band played four shows in May at the London Roundhouse where they played the album and its accompanying films in their entirety. The films were released on a special edition DVD and on the iTunes LP edition.

Most reviews were positive, with BBC Music declaring that &quot;... synths are brutally manhandled and pushed to their limits across the eight tracks&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that &quot;This is a very impressive collection that is carried along with a stirring sense of velocity and momentum&quot;. However, praise was not unanimous for the album, with the American rock magazine &quot;Spin&quot; giving it a rating of three out of five stars.

At the New York Comic Con, on 10 October 2010, film director Joe Wright announced that the Chemical Brothers would be scoring the soundtrack to his forthcoming film, &quot;Hanna&quot;. Wright, who had worked with the Chemical Brothers in the past as a member of the visual company Vegetable Vision, stated that he was &quot;very excited to finally ... work with a more modern beat. There&#x27;s a lot of bass, it&#x27;s very loud.&quot; The soundtrack was released on iTunes on 15 March 2011 and on CD on 4 July 2011.

The duo also contributed a new version of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Think&quot; titled &quot;Nina Frequency&quot;, as well as two new songs &quot;Electric Hands&quot; and &quot;Danka Jane&quot;, to the soundtrack of the 2010 film &quot;Black Swan&quot; directed by Darren Aronofsky. All three songs have not been released.

The Chemical Brothers released their first concert film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think&quot;, in 2012, documenting their performance at Fuji Rock Festival in Japan in 2011. The film debuted in February in theaters around the world, including a premiere in London where attendees – including Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Keira Knightley – were seen dancing in aisles and seats, leading one reviewer to remark &quot;at times it was impossible to tell which &#x27;hands in the air&#x27; were on screen and which were in the room.&quot; The film was the first concert film to be mixed in 7.1 surround sound, and was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and CD on 26 March 2012.

On 7 March 2012, it was announced that the Chemical Brothers would be scoring their second film soundtrack, for the bank heist film &quot;Now You See Me&quot;, but the band had to pull out of the project in the early stages due to scheduling conflicts. In July 2012, the duo composed an official piece of music to soundtrack the cycling events at the 2012 Summer Olympics, titled &#x27;Theme for Velodrome&#x27;.

=== 2012–2017: Rowlands&#x27; solo work and &quot;Born in the Echoes&quot; ===
After &quot;Hanna&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Think&quot;, Tom Rowlands worked on a number of solo projects. He remixed and produced music for Tinie Tempah, the Klaxons, I Break Horses, and New Order, scored the film &quot;Trespass Against Us&quot; starring Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson and directed by longtime visual collaborator and film and television director Adam Smith, and the theatrical production of &quot;Life of Galileo&quot; directed by Joe Wright performed at the Young Vic, and released 12-inch single &quot;Through Me / Nothing but Pleasure&quot; on Erol Alkan&#x27;s label Phantasy in May 2013.

On 21 October 2014, the Chemical Brothers released a single &quot;This Is Not a Game&quot;, which was created for &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1&quot;, featuring Miguel and Lorde. In December 2014, they announced an appearance at the 2015 Sónar festival and a new album, scheduled for release in 2015.

In April 2015, videos containing animation and audio loops appeared on the official Chemical Brothers Facebook page and website, thechemicalbrothers.com, ahead of the imminent release of new music. On 23 April, their new song &quot;Sometimes I Feel so Deserted&quot; premiered on BBC Radio 1. On 17 July, the duo released &quot;Born in the Echoes&quot;, their eighth album. Singles from this album included &quot;Go&quot;; an up-beat reunion with guest vocalist Q-Tip and director Michel Gondry and &quot;Wide Open&quot; in collaboration with Beck. St. Vincent, Ali Love, and Cate Le Bon also feature on the album.

Along with the new album announcement, it was revealed that Simons would &quot;take a break&quot; from touring to focus on unspecified academic work. Adam Smith filled in for him on stage during the 2015 tour. During the tour, Simons attended a few shows as an audience member, and both he and Rowlands expressed concern in interviews that this could mark a permanent retirement. The first concert without Simons was performed at Siemens Arena in Lithuania. Smith continued to fill in through the end of 2015, most notably at Glastonbury and the Apple Music Festival, and uniquely controlled both lights and music from the stage.

Simons returned to live performances in 2016, performing at the Parklife Festival in Manchester, which included a new setlist and a cover of New Order&#x27;s &quot;Temptation&quot; with Sumner&#x27;s recorded vocals. In November 2016, the duo released the non-album single &quot;C-H-E-M-I-C-A-L&quot;, which premiered on BBC Radio 1. The song originally debuted as a demo in 2012, created to open the duo&#x27;s DJ sets from 2012 to 2015.

=== 2018–2021: &quot;No Geography&quot; ===
On 10 January 2018, the Chemical Brothers confirmed production of their ninth album, &quot;No Geography&quot;, via Instagram and other social media platforms. They released their first song in three years on 28 September 2018, titled &quot;Free Yourself&quot;, from the forthcoming album.

On 7 March 2019, Formula 1 announced a collaboration with the Chemical Brothers, which was released the next day in the form of the song &quot;We&#x27;ve Got To Try&quot;.

The Chemical Brothers&#x27; ninth studio album, &quot;No Geography&quot;, was released on 12 April 2019 to positive reviews. In 2020, the album won three Grammy Awards including Best Dance/Electronic Album, Best Dance Recording, and Best Music Video.

In 2019, &quot;We&#x27;ve Got to Try&quot; won the overall award and &quot;Best Director&quot; category at the Berlin Music Video Awards. The video for &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;, directed by Ollie Tong, took the 2nd place at the 2020 edition in the Best Art Director category.

=== 2021–present: biography and tenth album &quot;For That Beautiful Feeling&quot;===
On 22 April 2021, the Chemical Brothers released a then non-album single, &quot;The Darkness That You Fear&quot;. with another song, &quot;Work Energy Principle&quot;, being released as a B-side on 15 July.

On 17 March 2023, the Chemical Brothers released the second single, &quot;No Reason&quot;. with the B-Side in form of &quot;All of a Sudden&quot; being released on 28 April alongside the Vinyl version of the single.

On 13 April 2023, two days before their performance at Coachella 2023, the Chemical Brothers revealed that a new album would be released autumn 2023 via a billboard announcement in the desert, which they shared an image of on their social media.

On 28 June, the Chemical Brothers released the 3rd single &quot;Live Again&quot; (featuring Halo Maud); they also announced that a biography titled &quot;Paused in Cosmic Reflection&quot;, would be coming out in late October.

On 19 July, the Chemical Brothers announced their tenth album, &quot;For That Beautiful Feeling&quot;, which was released on 8 September 2023.

<text>Threads is a 1984 British apocalyptic war drama television film jointly produced by the BBC, Nine Network and Western-World Television Inc. Written by Barry Hines and directed and produced by Mick Jackson, it is a dramatic account of nuclear war and its effects in Britain, specifically on the city of Sheffield in Northern England. The plot centres on two families as a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union erupts. As the nuclear exchange between NATO and the Warsaw Pact begins, the film depicts the medical, economic, social, and environmental consequences of nuclear war.

Shot on a budget of £400,000 (), the film was the first of its kind to depict a nuclear winter. It has been called &quot;a film which comes closest to representing the full horror of nuclear war and its aftermath, as well as the catastrophic impact that the event would have on human culture.&quot; It has been compared to the earlier Academy Award-winning programme &quot;The War Game&quot; (1966) produced in the United Kingdom two decades prior and its contemporary counterpart &quot;The Day After&quot;, a 1983 ABC television film depicting a similar scenario in the United States. It was nominated for seven BAFTA awards in 1985 and won for Best Single Drama, Best Design, Best Film Cameraman, and Best Film Editor.

==Plot==

In the English city of Sheffield, young adults Ruth Beckett and Jimmy Kemp plan to marry after learning of Ruth&#x27;s unplanned pregnancy. Meanwhile, an international crisis develops after the Soviet Union invades northern Iran in response to an American-backed coup in the country. The situation rapidly escalates when the sinks and American troops are deployed to unoccupied western Iran to defend its oil supplies. Daily life in Sheffield continues while an American ultimatum demanding joint withdrawal from Iran expires. After a limited nuclear exchange in Mashhad, the crisis culminates in armed conflict breaking out between the two superpowers. News of the breakout of fighting spurs British citizens into panic buying and looting, resulting in the enabling of emergency government powers across the UK for civil defence purposes. Officials of Sheffield City Council and many others across the nation take shelter in makeshift basement bunkers to command the area should central government be destroyed, with many being forced to leave their families behind. As Britain prepares for the possibility of nuclear war, over the course of two days society gradually destabilizes as panic buying, looting, and violent suppression of anti-war protests takes place across the country. 

Early in the morning, the Soviets launch a nuclear strike, first disabling communications across Britain and northwestern Europe before attacking NATO military targets, then economic and industrial centres. The attack injures and kills tens of millions, and causes fires and devastation. Jimmy attempts to find Ruth and is never seen again, his brother Michael is killed in the initial firestorm, his mother is horribly burned and later dies, while his father suffers from the subsequent radiation poisoning. (Jimmy&#x27;s sister, Alison, seems to be the only survivor of the family, though she is only ever seen in a makeshift prison and never seen again after that.)

The damage quickly results in societal collapse: firefighting and rescue attempts are halted to avoid spreading fallout, hospitals are overwhelmed and under-equipped, and the Sheffield officials die in their bunker, buried under the rubble of Sheffield Town Hall, over the course of a month. Local authority breaks down, martial law is implemented, and survivors are mostly left to fend for themselves. Food becomes scarce as a result of looting and nuclear winter-induced crop failures, resulting in it becoming the only form of currency, awarded for labour and withheld as punishment. The nuclear winter blocks out sunlight and drops temperatures drastically, resulting in a severely diminished harvest and the death of many survivors. The military punishes looting and crime through capital punishment as summary executions begin to occur.

Following the death of her grandmother, Ruth flees her family&#x27;s basement shelter. She returns to Jimmy&#x27;s destroyed house, finding only his mother&#x27;s corpse and Jimmy’s bird book, which she takes with her. By the time she returns home, her parents have been killed by looters. Making her way to the countryside near Buxton, where local authorities unsuccessfully attempt to convince the residents to house refugees, she is reunited with Jimmy&#x27;s friend, Bob, for a time. Ruth later gives birth to her daughter alone in an abandoned barn while being howled at by a mad, chained dog. One year later, sunlight levels have mostly returned to normal, though damage to the ozone layer means that higher ultraviolet radiation levels have increased the risks of suffering cataracts and skin cancer.

10 years later, what remains of Britain&#x27;s surviving population has dropped to a medieval level of 4 to 11 million people, and the UK remains devastated. Survivors primarily work in cultivating crops by hand or with basic tools. Children born after the war speak a reduced and broken form of English due to the absence of organised schooling, the long-term psychological effects of fetal radiation exposure, and the elective mutism of adult survivors. Ruth dies in bed, prematurely aged and blinded by cataracts. She is survived by her daughter, Jane, who stands by Ruth’s bed as she dies. She responds with apathy to her mother’s death, and steals the last of her possessions, leaving behind Jimmy’s bird book which Ruth had still kept with her. 

Three years after Ruth&#x27;s death, industry begins to return with limited electricity achieved through steam power, but the population continues to live in squalor. Jane and two boys are caught stealing food. One of the boys is shot dead, and Jane and the other boy engage in a struggle for food that degenerates into &quot;crude intercourse.&quot; Months later, Jane gives birth in a makeshift hospital. The nurse wraps the silent baby in a bloody sheet and gives it to Jane, who looks at it in horror.

==Production and themes==
&quot;Threads&quot; was first commissioned (under the working title &quot;Beyond Armageddon&quot;) by the Director-General of the BBC Alasdair Milne, after he watched the 1966 drama-documentary &quot;The War Game&quot;, which had not been shown on the BBC when it was made, due to pressure from the Wilson government, although it had a limited release in cinemas. Mick Jackson was hired to direct the film, as he had previously worked in the area of nuclear apocalypse in 1982, producing the BBC &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; documentary &quot;A Guide to Armageddon&quot;. This was considered a breakthrough at the time, considering the previous banning of &quot;The War Game&quot;, which BBC staff believed would have resulted in mass suicides if aired. Jackson subsequently travelled around the UK and the US, consulting leading scientists, psychologists, doctors, defence specialists and strategic experts to create the most realistic depiction of nuclear war possible for his next film. Jackson consulted various sources in his research, including the 1983 &quot;Science&quot; article &quot;Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions&quot;, penned by Carl Sagan and James B. Pollack. Details of a possible attack scenario and the extent of the damage were derived from &quot;Doomsday, Britain after Nuclear Attack&quot; (1983), while the ineffective post-war plans of the UK government came from Duncan Campbell&#x27;s 1982 exposé &quot;War Plan UK&quot;. In portraying the psychological damage suffered by survivors, Jackson took inspiration from the behaviour of the Hibakusha and Magnus Clarke&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;Nuclear Destruction of Britain&quot;. Sheffield was chosen as the main location partly because of its &quot;nuclear-free zone&quot; policy that made the council sympathetic to the local filming and partly because it seemed likely that the USSR would strike an industrial city in the centre of the country.

Jackson hired Barry Hines to write the script because of his political awareness. The relationship between the two was strained on several occasions, as Hines spent much of his time on set, and apparently disliked Jackson on account of his middle class upbringing. They also disagreed about Paul Vaughan&#x27;s narration, which Hines felt was detrimental to the drama. As part of their research, the two spent a week at the Home Office training centre for &quot;official survivors&quot; in Easingwold which, according to Hines, showed just &quot;how disorganised [post-war reconstruction] would be&quot;.

Auditions were advertised in &quot;The Star&quot;, and took place in the ballroom of Sheffield City Hall, where 1,100 candidates turned up. Extras were chosen on the basis of height and age, and were all told to look &quot;miserable&quot; and to wear ragged clothes; the majority were CND supporters. The makeup for extras playing third-degree-burn victims consisted of Rice Krispies and tomato ketchup. The scenes taking place six weeks after the attack were shot at Curbar Edge in the Peak District National Park; because weather conditions were considered too fine to pass off as a nuclear winter, stage snow had to be spread around the rocks and heather, and cameramen installed light filters on their equipment to block out the sunlight. Although Jackson initially considered casting actors from Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, he later decided to take a neorealist approach, and opted to cast relatively unknown actors to heighten the film&#x27;s impact through the use of characters the audience could relate to.

Supporting artist Michael Beecroft appears briefly in the film as an injured traffic warden. His image endured in the popular memory and has been used prominently in promotional material. Beecroft&#x27;s identity was unknown until 2024, when he was found by BBC Radio Sheffield.

For the horror of &quot;Threads&quot; to work, Jackson made an effort to leave some things unseen: &quot;to let images and emotion happen in people&#x27;s minds, or rather in the extensions of their imaginations&quot;. He later recalled that while BBC productions would usually be followed by phone calls of congratulations from friends or colleagues immediately after airing, no such calls came after the first screening of &quot;Threads&quot;. Jackson later &quot;realised...that people had just sat there thinking about it, in many cases not sleeping or being able to talk&quot;. He stated that he had it on good authority that Ronald Reagan watched the film when it aired in the US. Along with Hines, Jackson also received a letter of praise from Labour leader Neil Kinnock, stating &quot;the dangers of complacency are much greater than any risks of knowledge&quot;.

The conception of Jane&#x27;s child towards the end of the film has been interpreted as rape.

==Release history==
===Broadcast===
&quot;Threads&quot; was a co-production of the BBC, Nine Network and Western-World Television, Inc. It was first broadcast on BBC Two on 23 September 1984 at 9:30 pm, and achieved the highest ratings on the channel (6.9 million) of the week. Around six hundred extras from the Sheffield area were invited to a private screening ahead of the official broadcast. It was repeated on BBC One on 1 August 1985 as part of a week of programmes marking the fortieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which also saw the first television screening of &quot;The War Game&quot; (which had been deemed too disturbing for television in the 20 years since it had been made). &quot;Threads&quot; was not shown again on British screens until the digital channel BBC Four broadcast it in October 2003. It was also shown on UKTV Documentary in September 2004 and April 2005. In January 2018, nuclear history journalist Julie McDowall led a distributed viewing of the film, encouraging the audience to share their reactions on Twitter under the hashtag #threaddread, as part of a campaign to ask the BBC to show the film for the first time since 2003. A new BBC broadcast, again on BBC Four, eventually took place on 9 October 2024 to mark the film&#x27;s fortieth anniversary.

&quot;Threads&quot; was broadcast in the United States on cable network Superstation TBS on 13 January 1985, with Ted Turner presenting the introduction. This was followed the next day by a broadcast of an episode of BBC documentary series &quot;Natural World&quot;, &quot;On the Eighth Day&quot;, about nuclear winter, and a panel discussion on nuclear war. It was also shown in syndication to local commercial stations and, later, on many PBS stations. In Canada, &quot;Threads&quot; was broadcast on Citytv in Toronto, CKVU in Vancouver and CKND in Winnipeg, in New Zealand on TVNZ in September 1984, and in Australia it was shown on the Nine Network on 19 June 1985. Unusually for a commercial network, it broadcast the film without commercial breaks; many commercial outlets in the United States and Canada that broadcast the film also did so without commercial interruption, or interrupting only for disclaimers or promos.

===Home media===
&quot;Threads&quot; was originally released by BBC Video (on VHS and, for a very short period, Betamax) in 1987 in the United Kingdom. The film was re-released on both VHS and DVD in 2000 on the Revelation label, followed by a new DVD edition in 2005. Due to licensing difficulties the 1987 release replaced Chuck Berry&#x27;s recording of his song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; with an alternative recording of the song. In all these cases, the original music over the opening narration was removed, again due to licensing problems; this was an extract from the Alpine Symphony by Richard Strauss, performed by the Dresden State Opera Orchestra, conducted by Rudolf Kempe (HMV ASD 3173).

On 13 February 2018, &quot;Threads&quot; was released by Severin Films on Blu-ray in the United States. The programme was scanned in 2K from a broadcast print for this release, including extras such as an audio commentary with Director Mick Jackson and interviews with actress Karen Meagher, Director Of Photography Andrew Dunn, Production Designer Christopher Robilliard and film writer Stephen Thrower. This is also the first home video release in which the extract from the Alpine Symphony remains intact.

On 9 April 2018, Simply Media released a Special Edition DVD in the UK, featuring a different 2K scan, restored and remastered from the original BBC 16mm CRI prints, which Severin did not have access to. This also featured all the original music, for the first time on home video in the UK. The Special Edition included commentaries and associated documentaries.

==Reception and legacy==

===Contemporary===

&quot;Threads&quot; was not widely reviewed, but the critics who reviewed it gave generally positive reviews. John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is not a balanced discussion about the pros and cons of nuclear armaments. It is a candidly biased warning. And it is, as calculated, unsettlingly powerful.&quot; Rick Groen of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that &quot;[t]he British crew here, headed by writer Barry Hines and producer/director Mick Jackson, accomplish what would seem to be an impossible task: depicting the carnage without distancing the viewer, without once letting him retreat behind the safe wall of fictitious play. Formidable and foreboding, Threads leaves nothing to our imagination, and Nothingness to our conscience.&quot; In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a rating of three stars (out of a possible four). He called &quot;Threads&quot; &quot;Britain&#x27;s answer to &quot;The Day After&quot;&quot; and wrote that the film was &quot;unrelentingly graphic and grim, sobering, and shattering- as it should be&quot;.

===Retrospective===

Retrospective reviews have been very positive. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 92 based on 5 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, whilst it has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100% based on 10 reviews (with an average score of 8.90/10). The critical consensus reads: &quot;An urgent warning against nuclear conflict, &quot;Threads&quot; is a chilling hypothetical that achieves visceral horror with its matter-of-fact presentation of an apocalypse&quot;.

Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, writing: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until I saw &quot;Threads&quot; that I found that something on screen could make me break out in a cold, shivering sweat and keep me in that condition for 20 minutes, followed by weeks of depression and anxiety&quot;. Sam Toy of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film a perfect score, writing that &quot;this British work of (technically) science fiction teaches an unforgettable lesson in true horror&quot; and went on to praise its ability &quot;to create an almost impossible illusion on clearly paltry funds&quot;. Jonathan Hatfull of &quot;SciFiNow&quot; gave a perfect score to the remastered DVD of the film. &quot;No one ever forgets the experience of watching &quot;Threads&quot;. [...It] is arguably the most devastating piece of television ever produced. It&#x27;s perfectly crafted, totally human and so completely harrowing you&#x27;ll think that you&#x27;ll probably never want to watch it again.&quot; He praised the pacing and Hines&#x27; &quot;impeccable&quot; screenplay and described its portrayal of the &quot;immediate effects&quot; of the bombing as &quot;jaw-dropping [...] watching the survivors in the days and weeks to come is heart-breaking&quot;. Both &quot;Little White Lies&quot; and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; have emphasized the film&#x27;s contemporary relevance, especially in light of political events such as Brexit. According to the former, the film paints a &quot;nightmarish picture of a Britain woefully unprepared for what is coming, and reduced, when it does come, to isolation, collapse and medieval regression, with a failed health service, very little food being harvested, mass homelessness, and the pound and the penny losing all value&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
The film was nominated for seven BAFTA awards in 1985. It won for Best Single Drama, Best Design, Best Film Cameraman and Best Film Editor. Its other nominations were for Best Costume Design, Best Make-Up, and Best Film Sound.

<text>UseModWiki is a wiki software written in Perl and licensed under the GNU General Public License. Pages in UseModWiki are stored in ordinary files, not in a relational database. Wikipedias in English and many other languages were powered by UseModWiki until switching to MediaWiki.

== History ==

After Ward Cunningham created the first wiki website WikiWikiWeb, there were various &quot;WikiWikiClones&quot; that implemented the functions and design of WikiWikiWeb&#x27;s engine (&quot;WikiBase&quot;), mainly written in Perl. Peter Merel developed which was an early WikiWikiClone released partially under the GNU Lesser General Public License, and Markus Denker then developed which was released under the GNU General Public License and based on CVWiki.

In the 1990s, Clifford Adams initiated the Usenet Moderation project that would allow users to share rating, editing, and eventually summary/change information about Usenet postings. It was replaced by the concept of wikis in 1999, and the development of UseModWiki started on October 11 as a simplified fork of AtisWiki. From version 0.4 (&quot;WikiFour&quot;) in November 1999, more functions and improvements were introduced to UseModWiki. In 2000, the second UseModWiki website MeatballWiki was launched and hosted in &quot;usemod.com&quot;, along with the official website of UseModWiki.

In 2001, as Adams was both of the UseModWiki developer and a Wikipedian, he brought many improvements for the usages of an encyclopedia to v0.91 and v0.92, especially &quot;s&quot; that uses double square-brackets (e.g., codice_1) as an option for linking to another page, supplementing the older functionality of using camel case. In September 2003, after two years of development from the previous version, the release of version 1.0 introduced many new features including CSS, RSS, file uploads, UTF-8.

The development was then halted, and a cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2004-1397) was discovered in December 2004. It was patched in July 2007 when Markus Lude took over the project of UseModWiki from Clifford Adams, with the release of version 1.0.1. Only bug fixing versions were released since that. The official domain was moved to &quot;usemod.org&quot; in late September 2023, and a minor update for that change was released later in November.

== Use by Wikipedia ==

The wiki software for the English Wikipedia was UseModWiki (phase I, retroactively) since the establishment on January 15, 2001, and as of January 2002, Wikipedias in 22 languages were powered by UseModWiki. The English edition switched to &quot;&quot; (phase II) on January 25, 2002, a new wiki software based on UseModWiki but rewritten in PHP. On July 20, &quot;the PHP script&quot; was then replaced by its own rewritten wiki software (phase III), currently known as MediaWiki, for better performance and functionality.

Other language editions gradually switched to MediaWiki afterwards, and as of late 2003, only a few active editions including Catalan Wikipedia were still powered by UseModWiki. In 2004, the last-remaining UseModWiki editions switched to MediaWiki.
