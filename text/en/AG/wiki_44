<text>Tyre (; ; ; ; ) is a city in Lebanon, and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It was one of the earliest Phoenician metropolises and the legendary birthplace of Europa, her brothers Cadmus and Phoenix, and Carthage&#x27;s founder Dido (Elissa). The city has many ancient sites, including the Tyre Hippodrome, and was added as a whole to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1984. The historian Ernest Renan noted that &quot;One can call Tyre a city of ruins, built out of ruins&quot;.

Tyre is the fifth-largest city in Lebanon after Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon, and Baalbek. It is the capital of the Tyre District in the South Governorate. There were approximately 200,000 inhabitants in the Tyre urban area in 2016, including many refugees, as the city hosts three of the twelve Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon: Burj El Shimali, El Buss, and Rashidieh.

Tyre juts out from the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and is located about south of Beirut. It originally consisted of two distinct urban centres: Tyre itself, which was on an island just 500 to 700m offshore, and the associated settlement of Ushu on the adjacent mainland, later called &quot;Palaetyrus&quot;, meaning &quot;Old Tyre&quot; in Ancient Greek. The fortified city was on top of a rock from which its name was inherited as &quot;S‘r&quot; is the Phoenician word for &quot;rock&quot;. It had two ports, the &quot;Sidonian port&quot; to the north, still partly existing today, and the &quot;Egyptian port&quot; to the south which has perhaps been discovered very recently.
Throughout history from prehistoric times onwards, all settlements in the Tyre area profited from the abundance of fresh water supplies, especially from the nearby springs of Rashidieh and Ras Al Ain in the South. In addition, there are the springs of Al Bagbog and Ain Ebreen in the North as well as the Litani River, also known as Alqasymieh. The present city of Tyre covers a large part of the original island and has expanded onto and covers most of the causeway built by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE. This isthmus increased greatly in width over the centuries because of extensive silt depositions on either side. The part of the original island not covered by the modern city of Tyre is mostly of an archaeological site showcasing remains of the city from ancient times.

Four municipalities contribute to Tyre city&#x27;s 16.7 km2 built-up area, though none are included in their entirety: Sour municipality contains the heart of the city, excluding the Natural and Coastal Reserve; Burj El Shimali to the East without unpopulated agricultural lands; Abbasiyet Sour to the North without agricultural lands and a dislocated village; and Ain Baal to the South-East, also without agricultural lands and dislocated villages. Tyre&#x27;s urban area lies on a fertile coastal plain, which explains the fact that as of 2017 about 44% of its territory was used for intra-urban agriculture, while built-up land constituted over 40%.

In terms of geomorphology and seismicity, Tyre is close to the Roum Fault and the Yammouneh Fault. Though it has suffered a number of devastating earthquakes over the millennia, the threat level is considered to be low in most places and moderate in a few others. However, a tsunami following an earthquake and subsequent landslides and floods pose major natural risks to the Tyrian population.

Vast reserves of natural gas are estimated to lie beneath Lebanese waters, much of it off Tyre&#x27;s coast, but exploitation has been delayed by border disputes with Israel.

==Etymology==
Early names of Tyre include Akkadian , Phoenician (), and Hebrew (). In Semitic languages, the name of the city means &#x27;rock&#x27; after the rocky formation on which the town was originally built.

The predominant form in Classical Greek was (), which was first seen in the works of Herodotus but may have been adopted considerably earlier. It gave rise to Latin , which entered English during the Middle English period as &quot;Tyre&quot;. The demonym for Tyre is &quot;Tyrian&quot;, and the inhabitants are &quot;Tyrians&quot;.

== Climate ==

Tyre has a Hot-summer mediterranean climate (classified as &quot;Csa&quot; under the Köppen climate classification), characterized by six months of drought from May to October. On average, it has 300 days of sun a year and a yearly temperature of 20.8°C. The average maximum temperature reaches its highest at 30.8 °C in August and the average minimum temperature its lowest at 10 °C in January. On average, the mean annual precipitation reaches up to 645 mm. The temperature of the sea water reaches a minimum of 17 °C in February and a maximum of 32 °C in August. At a depth of 70 m it is constantly at 17–18 °C.

Meanwhile, rising sea levels due to global warming threaten coastal erosion to Tyre&#x27;s peninsula and bay areas.

==History==
The ancient city of Tyre is located along the coast of Phoenicia in modern Lebanon. The site has been occupied since the Bronze Age. The city became a prominent Phoenician city-state between the 9th and 6th centuries BCE, settling prestigious colonies around the Mediterranean Sea, such as Carthage and Leptis Magna. It went under Persian rule in 572 BCE, before being conquered by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE. Monumental archaeological remains dated from the subsequent Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Medieval periods led to its inscription on its archaeological remains on the UNESCO World’s Heritage list in 1984.&lt;br&gt;

The Roman historian Justin wrote that the original founders arrived from the nearby city of Sidon in the quest to establish a new harbour. The famous Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE), born in the city of Halicarnassus, visited Tyre around 450 BCE at the end of the Greco-Persian Wars (499–449 BCE), and wrote in his &quot;Histories&quot; that according to the priests there, the city was founded 2300 years earlier (around 2750 BCE), as a walled place upon the mainland, now known as &quot;Paleotyre&quot; (Old Tyre). &lt;br&gt;

The Phoenician Tyrians&#x27; international trade network was based on its two harbours which are mentioned by ancient writers (Arrian, Anabasis, 2, 24; Strabo, Geography, 16,2,23). The northern harbour opened toward the Phoenician city of Sidon and has been therefore referred to as the “Sidonian Harbour” by 19th and 20th century scholars, but it was referred to as the &quot;Port of Astronoe&quot; during Late Antiquity. The southern harbour opened toward Egypt and was referred to as the “Egyptian Harbour”. The location of the two harbours has been the subject of speculations since the 17th Century. The submarine excavation of a large, 4-6th Century BCE breakwater north of the city, and the discovery of 250 BCE to 500 CE harbour sediments behind this breakwater demonstrated the existence of a northern harbour repeatedly, if not permanently, throughout Antiquity under the modern harbour of Tyre. &lt;br&gt;

The location of the southern harbour is more elusive. Renan (1864–1874) envisioned it as an extensive structure now located offshore, south of the former island. Subsequent diving surveys identified submerged man-made structures on the seafloor within 150 m of the former island. Antoine Poidebard, who was the first to have them explored by divers in 1939, saw in these structures former breakwaters enclosing a harbour with two entrances. The geographic area enclosed within these structures is therefore often referred to as the “Southern Harbour”. These structures have also been interpreted as a polder-like area protecting an urban district (El-Amouri et al., 2005; Frost, 1971; Renan, 1864–1874). A Phoenician-style breakwater was recently found within this area, but excavation is needed to confirm its age ascription. Harbour sediments found behind the structure suggest that the breakwater was part of the Egyptian harbour. Harbour sediments found near Hiram&#x27;s Tower, further north, mark an early location of the Sidonian Harbour. &lt;br&gt;

The development of Tyre was profoundly affected by the construction of a causeway built by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE to seize the city. This reportedly 750 m-long and 60 m-wide causeway was laid over a submarine shoal less than 5.4 m deep. This shoal was interpreted as a sandbank (also called a ‘salient’), formed by the accretion of sand in the lee of the island, under the effects of the refraction and diffraction of waves around the island. The causeway interrupted longshore sand transport, forcing sand to accumulate along the causeway, rapidly creating an emerged sandy isthmus (or tombolo), linking the island to the mainland.

This sandy isthmus rapidly inflated during the centuries following the construction of the causeway. By early Imperial Roman times, monumental buildings had been built over most of its surface. Their layout implies that the isthmus was by then nearly as wide as today. Therefore, the isthmus had completely reshaped the eastern coast of Tyre Island within 6–10 centuries after the construction of the causeway, spurring a radical transformation of the city.

== Coast Nature Reserve ==

Tyre enjoys a reputation of having some of the cleanest beaches and waters of Lebanon. However, a UN HABITAT profile found that &quot;seawater is also polluted due to wastewater discharge especially in the port area&quot;. There is still also considerable pollution by solid waste.

The Tyre Coast Nature Reserve (TCNR) was decreed in 1998 by the Ministry of Public Works. It is long and covers over . The TCNR is within the best preserved stretch of sandy coastline in southern Lebanon and divided into two section zones: a 1.8 km sand lined beach, 1.8 km long and 500 meters wide-ranging from the Tyre Rest House in the north to the Rashidieh Refugee Camp in the South, and a stretch of 2 km with agriculture lands of small family farms and the springs of Ras El Ain with three constantly flowing artesian wells, ranging from Rashidieh to the village of Chaetiyeh in the South.

The former is divided into two zones: one for tourism that features a public beach of some 900 m and restaurant tents during the summer season hosting up to 20,000 visitors on a busy day, and another 900 m of conservation zone as a sanctuary for sea turtles and migrating birds.

Due to its diverse flora and fauna, the reserve was designated a Ramsar Site in 1999 according to the international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of Wetlands, since it is considered &quot;the last bio-geographic ecosystem in Lebanon&quot;. It is an important nesting site for migratory birds, the endangered Loggerhead and green sea turtle, the Arabian spiny mouse and many other creatures (including wall lizards, common pipistrelle, and European badger). Also, there are frequent sighting of dolphins in the waters off Tyre. Altogether, the TCNR includes:

275 species distributed over 50 families. In addition, the reserve is home to seven regionally and nationally threatened species, 4 endemic and 10 rare species, whilst 59 species are restricted to the Eastern Mediterranean area. It is also worthy to indicate that, several bio-indicator species as well as 25 medicinal species were recognized. TCNR encloses flora species belonging to the various habitats: the sandy shore, rocky shore, littoral and Freshwater ecosystems. A wide number of Gramineae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae and Umbellifereae families dominate the floristic resources.

However, the biodiversity of the TCNR is threatened as shown by a strong decrease in the numbers of the caspian terrapin &quot;Mauremys caspica&quot;, the green toad &quot;Bufo viridis&quot; and the tree frog &quot;Hyla savigny&quot;. Also, since the 2000s, the North American camphorweed &quot;Heterotheca subaxillaris&quot; has invaded the TCNR as a neophyte from Haifa across the Blue Line.

During the 2006 war, turtle breeding areas were affected when the IDF bombed the conservation site.

The oil spill which devastated the coast north of Ashkelon in February 2021 also contaminated Tyre&#x27;s beaches.

== Historical and cultural heritage ==
Arguably the most lasting Phoenician legacy for the Tyrian population has been the linguistic mark that the Syriac and Akkadian languages have left on the Arabic spoken in the region of Tyre. Most notably, the widely used term &quot;Ba&#x27;ali&quot; – which is used especially to describe vegetables and fruits from rain-fed, untreated agricultural production – originates from the Baal religion. The Tyrian municipality of Ain Baal is apparently also named after the Phoenician deity. The most visible part of ancient and medieval history on the other side have been the archaeological sites though:

The first archaeological excavations were by Ernest Renan in 1860 and 1861. He was followed in the 1870s by Johannes Nepemuk Sepp. His most notable work was excavating at the cathedral in an attempt to find the bones of Frederick Barbarossa. More work was undertaken in 1903 by the Greek archaeologist Theodore Makridi, curator of the Imperial Museum at Constantinople. Important findings like fragments of marble sarcophagi were sent to the Ottoman capital.

An archaeological survey of Tyre was done by a French team under the leadership of Denyse Le Lasseur in 1921. It was followed by another mission between 1934 and 1936 that included aerial surveys and diving expeditions. It was led by the Jesuit missionary Antoine Poidebard, a pioneer of aerial archaeology.

Large-scale excavations started in 1946 under the leadership of Emir Maurice Chéhab (1904–1994), &quot;the father of modern Lebanese archaeology&quot; who for decades headed the Antiquities Service in Lebanon and was the curator of the National Museum of Beirut. His teams uncovered most remains in the Al Bass/Hippodrome and the City Site/Roman baths.

During the 1960s, Honor Frost (1917–2010) – the Cyprus-born pioneer of underwater archaeology initiated several investigations &quot;aimed at identifying and documenting the significant archaeological potential for harbour facilities within coastal Tyre&quot;. Based on the results, she suggested that the Al Mobarakee Tower may actually date back to Hellenistic times.

All those works stopped though soon after the 1975 beginning of the Civil War and many records were lost.

In 1984, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) declared Tyre a World Heritage Site in an attempt to halt the damage being done to the archaeological sites by the armed conflict and by anarchic urban development.

In the late 1980s, &quot;clandestine excavations&quot; took place in the Al-Bass cemetery, which &quot;flooded the antiquities market&quot;.

Regular excavation activities only started again in 1995 under the supervision of Ali Khalil Badawi. Shortly afterwards, an Israeli bomb destroyed an apartment block in the city and evidence for an early church was revealed underneath the rubble. Its unusual design suggests that this was the site of the Cathedral of Paulinus which had been inaugurated in 315 CE.

In 1997, the first Phoenician cremation cemetery was uncovered in the al-Bass site, near the Roman necropolis. Meanwhile, Honor Frost mentored local Lebanese archaeologists to conduct further underwater investigations, which in 2001 confirmed the existence of a human-made structure within the northern harbour area of Tyre.

In 2003, Randa Berri, president of the National Association for the Preservation of South Lebanon&#x27;s Archaeology and Heritage and wife of Nabih Berri, veteran leader of the Amal Movement and longtime Speaker of the Parliament of Lebanon, patronized a plan to renovate Khan Sour / Khan Al Askaar, the former Ma&#x27;ani palace, and convert it into a museum. As of 2019, nothing was done in that regard and the ruins have kept on crumbling.

The hostilities of the 2006 Lebanon War put the ancient structures of Tyre at risk. This prompted UNESCO&#x27;s Director-General to launch a &quot;Heritage Alert&quot; for the site. Following the cessation of hostilities in September 2006, a visit by conservation experts to Lebanon observed no direct damage to the ancient city of Tyre. However, the bombardment had damaged frescoes in a Roman funerary cave at the Tyre Necropolis. Additional site degradation was also noted, including &quot;the lack of maintenance, the decay of exposed structures due to lack of rainwater regulation and the decay of porous and soft stones&quot;.

Since 2008, a Lebanese French team under the direction by Pierre-Louis Gatier of the University of Lyon has been conducting archaeological and topographical work. When international archeological missions in Syria came to a halt after 2012 due to the war there, some of them instead started excavations in Tyre, amongst them a team headed by Leila Badre, director of the Archeological Museum of the American University of Beirut (AUB), and Belgian archaeologists.

Threats to Tyre&#x27;s ancient cultural heritage include development pressures and the illegal antiquities trade. A highway, planned for 2011, was expected to be built in areas that are deemed archaeologically sensitive. A small-scale geophysical survey indicated the presence of archaeological remains at proposed construction sites. The sites have not been investigated. Despite the relocation of a proposed traffic interchange, the lack of precise site boundaries confuses the issue of site preservation.

A 2018 study of Mediterranean world heritage sites found that Tyre&#x27;s City site has &quot;the highest risk of coastal erosion under current climatic conditions, in addition to &#x27;moderate&#x27; risk from extreme sea levels.&quot; Further coastal inspection was conducted in 2019, leading to a new hypothesis about the local relative sea level rise and to discovery of yet unreported submerged coastal structures.

Like many of the cities in the Levant and in Lebanon, the architecture since the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s has been of poor quality, which tend to threaten the cultural heritage in the built environment before the war. Meanwhile, historical buildings from the Ottoman period like Khan Rabu and Khan Sour / Khan Ashkar have partly collapsed after decades of total neglect and lack of any maintenance whatsoever.

In 2013, the International Association to Save Tyre (IAST) made headlines when it launched an online raffle in association with Sotheby&#x27;s to fund the artisans&#x27; village Les Ateliers de Tyr at the outskirts of the city. Participants could purchase tickets for 100 euros to win the 1914 &quot;Man in the Opera Hat&quot; painting by Pablo Picasso. The proceeds totaled US$5.26 million. The painting was won by a 25-year-old fire-safety official from Pennsylvania. IAST president Maha al-Khalil Chalabi is a daughter of feudal lord and politician Kazem el-Khalil. In September 2017, she opened &quot;Les Atelier&quot;, which is located in the middle of an orange grove covering an area of 7.300 m2 at the northeastern outskirts of Tyre.

During the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the Tyre archaeological sites to safeguard them from damage.

=== Biblical description ===
The city of Tyre appears in many biblical traditions:

==== Hebrew Bible / Old Testament ====
* According to Joshua 19, &quot;the fortified city of Tyre&quot; was allotted to the Tribe of Asher.
* King Hiram I of Tyre allied himself with David and Solomon in 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 1 Chronicles. Hiram provided architects, workmen, cedar wood, and gold to build the royal palace in Jerusalem, as well as the Temple.
*Tyre is listed among an alliance of ten nations that would conspire against God&#x27;s people. 
* Tyre is mentioned in the Book of Isaiah as being forgotten for 70 years when her &quot;fortress is destroyed&quot; and after which &quot;her profit and her prostitute&#x27;s wages will be sacred to the Lord.&quot;
*The Book of Joel groups Tyre, Sidon and Philistia together and it states that the people of Judah and Jerusalem were sold to the Greeks, and there would thus be punishment because of it.
*Tyre is also mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel, Book of Amos, the Psalms, and the Book of Zechariah which prophesied its destruction.

==== New Testament ====
* Jesus visited the region or &quot;coasts&quot; (King James Version) of Tyre and Sidon and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching, leading to the stark contrast in Matthew 11:21 to his reception in Korazin and Bethsaida.
*Herod was said to be angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon and he delivered a public address upon which he was struck down by God after not giving glory to him once he received praise arrogantly according to the Book of Acts. The same book describes Paul&#x27;s voyage to Tyre where he stayed for seven days.
* In the Book of Revelation, chapter 18 alludes extensively to the mercantile description of Tyre in Ezekiel 26–28.

=== Other writings ===
* &quot;Apollonius of Tyre&quot; is the subject of an ancient short novella, popular in the Middle Ages. Existing in numerous forms in many languages, the text is thought to be translated from an ancient Greek manuscript, now lost.
* &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; is a Jacobean play written at least in part by William Shakespeare and George Wilkins. It is included in modern editions of his collected works despite questions over its authorship.
* In 19th-century Britain, Tyre was several times taken as an of the mortality of great power and status, for example by John Ruskin in the opening lines of &quot;&quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;&quot; and by Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Recessional.
* Tyrus is the title and subject of a poem by the Cumbrian poet Norman Nicholson in his collection &#x27;Rock Face&#x27; of 1948.
* The French comic book artist Albert Uderzo published in 1981 &quot;Asterix and the Black Gold&quot; which describes Asterix&#x27;s and Obelix&#x27;s voyage to the Middle East featuring James Bond and biblical themes: in their quest for petroleum, they sail on board a Phoenician ship, but the Roman regime closes off the ports of Tyre in order to deny their landing.
* In 2015, the French Lebanese artist Joseph Safieddine published the graphic novel drama &quot;Yallah Bye&quot; which offers an account of his family&#x27;s fate during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, when they sought refuge in the Christian quarter of Tyre. An English version followed in 2017 and an Arabic one in 2019.

=== Astronomical objects ===
A multi-ring structured region on Europa, the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, is named after Tyre, the legendary birthplace of princess Europa. Originally called &quot;Tyre Macula&quot;, it is some 140 kilometers in diameter (about the size of the island of Hawaii) and thought to be the site where an asteroid or comet impacted Europa&#x27;s ice crust.

The asteroid 209 Dido is named after the legendary Tyrian-Carthaginian princess. It is a very large main-belt asteroid, classified as a C-type asteroid which is probably composed of carbonaceous materials. 209 Dido was discovered in 1879 by C. H. F. Peters.

== Cultural life ==
The first cinema in Tyre opened in the late 1930s when a café owner established makeshift film screenings. Hamid Istanbouli – a fisherman by profession, who was also a traditional storyteller (&quot;hakawati&quot;) and thus interested in cinema – projected films on the wall of a Turkish hammam. In 1939 the Roxy opened, followed in 1942 by the &quot;Empire&quot;:

By the mid-1950s there were four cinemas in Tyre, and four more soon opened in nearby Nabatieh. Many also hosted live performances by famous actors and musicians, serving as community spaces where people from different backgrounds came together.

In 1959, the &quot;Cinema Rivoli of Tyre&quot; opened and quickly became one of the prime movie theatres of the country. According to UNIFIL, it was visited &quot;by celebrity who&#x27;s whos of the time, including Jean Marais, Brigitte Bardot, Rushdi Abaza and Omar Hariri.&quot; In 1964, the &quot;Dunia&quot; opened, two years later followed by the &quot;Al Hamra Cinema&quot;, which became a venue for some of the Arab world&#x27;s most famous performers, like Mahmoud Darwish, Sheikh Imam, Ahmed Fouad Negm, Wadih el-Safi, and Marcel Khalife.

Meanwhile, two Tyrian artists had a major impact on the development of Lebanese music: Halim el-Roumi (1919–1983) and Ghazi Kahwaji (1945–2017). Some sources claim that the famous musician, composer, singer and actor el-Roumi was born in Tyre to Lebanese parents. However, others suggest that he was born in Nazareth and moved to Tyre from Palestine. For some time, he worked as a teacher at the Jafariya High School there. In 1950 he became director of Radio Lebanon&#x27;s music department, where he discovered the singer Fairuz and introduced her to the Rahbani brothers. Roumi composed music for and with them in close collaborations.

Kahwaji was Lebanon&#x27;s first scenographer and for three decades the artistic general director for the Rahbani brothers and Fairuz. He used this prominent position to promote &quot;against confessionalism and fundamentalism&quot;. Kahwaji, who was also a professor at the Lebanese University (LU) and the Saint Joseph University in Beirut, published between 2008 and 2010 the sarcastic three-volume book series &quot;Kahwajiyat&quot; about social injustice in the Arab world.

By then, cultural life in Tyre had been severely affected by armed conflict as well. In 1975, the commercial &quot;Festivals de Tyr&quot; – organised by Maha al-Khalil Chalabi, the daughter of feudal landlord and politician Kazem al-Khalil – were supposed to debut but stopped at the outbreak of the Civil War.

Some cinemas were damaged by Israeli bombardment in 1982 and all of them eventually closed down, the last ones in 1989: the Hamra and the AK2000.

In the mid-nineties though, first the idea of a commercial Tyre International Festival was revived. It has been organised since then annually in the ancient site of the Roman hippodrome, featuring international artists like Elton John and Sarah Brightman, as well as Lebanese stars Wadih El Safi, Demis Roussos, Kadim Al-Saher, Melhem Barakat, Julia Boutros, and Majida El Roumi, the daughter of Halim el-Roumi.

In 2006, the &quot;Centre de Lecture et d’Animation Culturelle&quot; (C.L.A.C.) was opened by Tyre&#x27;s municipality as the first public library of the city, with support from the Lebanese Ministry of Culture and the French Embassy in Beirut. It is located in the historical building of the &quot;Beit Daoud&quot; next to the &quot;Beit El Medina&quot;, the former Mamluk House, in the old town.

In 2014, the NGO Tiro Association for Arts rehabilitated the defunct cinema Al Hamra under the leadership of &quot;Palestinian-Lebanese street theater performer, actor, comedian, and theater director&quot; Kassem Istanbouli (*1986). His grandfather was one of the founders of cinema in Tyre and his father used to repair cinema projectors.

In 2018, the Istanbouli Theatre troupe rehabilitated and moved to the Rivoli Cinema, which had been closed since 1988, to establish the non-commercial Lebanese National Theater as a free cultural space with free entrance and a special focus on training children and youth in arts. It also runs the &quot;Mobile Peace Bus&quot;, which is decorated with graffiti of Lebanese cultural icons, to promote arts in the villages of the neighbouring countryside. Istanbouli has argued:

In Tyre, we have 400 shops for shisha, one library, and one theatre. But if there are places, people will come.

In 2019, the film &quot;Manara&quot; (Arabic for &quot;lighthouse&quot;) by Lebanese director Zayn Alexander, who shot the movie at the Al Fanar resort in Tyre, won the Laguna Sud Award for Best Short Film at the Venice Days Strand festival.

== Education ==

There are many universities in Lebanon. 

The Jafariya School was founded in 1938 by Imam Abdul Hussein Sharafeddin. It soon expanded thanks mainly to donations from rich émigrés and thus was upgraded in 1946 to be a Secondary School, the first in Southern Lebanon (see above). It has remained one of the main schools in Tyre ever since.

An important role in the Tyrian education landscape is played by the charity organisation of the vanished Imam Musa al-Sadr, which has been headed since his disappearance in 1978 by his sister Rabab al-Sadr. While the foundation operates in various parts of the country, its main base is a compound on the southern entry of the Tyre peninsula close to the sea. A major focus is its Orphanages, but it also runs adult educational and vocational training programmes, especially for young women, in addition to health and development projects.

Musa Sadr also laid the groundwork for establishing the Islamic University of Lebanon (IUL) which was finally licensed in 1996 and opened a branch on the seafront,in Tyre. Its board of trustees is dominated by representatives of the Supreme Shiite Council, founded by Sadr in 1967.

The Lebanese Evangelical School in Tyre with a history of more than 150 years is arguably the largest school in town. Collège Élite, a French international school opened in 1996, is another one of a host of private schools in Tyre. The Cadmous College - a pre-kindergarten to grade 12 school, run by the Maronite missionaries - has about 10% Christian and 90% Muslim pupils.

In August 2019, the 17-year-old Ismail Ajjawi – a Palestinian resident of Tyre and graduate of the UNRWA &#x27;Deir Yassin&#x27; High School in the El-Buss refugee camp – made global headlines when he scored top-results to earn a scholarship to study at Harvard, but was deported upon arrival in Boston despite valid visa. He was readmitted ten days later to start his studies in time.

==Demographics==
In 2014, Muslims made up 78.64% and Christians made up 21.02% of registered voters in Tyre. 66.29% of the voters were Shiite Muslims, 12.33% were Sunni Muslims and 12.03% were Greek Catholics.
An accurate statistical accounting is not possible, since the government of Lebanon has released only rough estimates of population numbers since 1932.

The Lebanese nationality population of Tyre is predominantly Shia Muslim with a small but noticeable Christian community. In 2010, it was estimated that Christians accounted for 15% of Tyre&#x27;s population. In 2017, the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tyre counted about 42,500 members. Most of them live in the mountains of Southern Lebanon, while there are just some 500 Maronites in Tyre itself. The Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Tyre – which not only covers the District of Tyre in the South Governorate but also neighbouring areas in the Nabatieh Governorate – registered 2,857 members in that year.

===Refugees===

The city of Tyre has become home to more than 60,000 Palestinian refugees who are mainly Sunni Muslims with some Christian families. Tyre hosted Shias from the seven villages that were depopulated in 1948, they settled in suburbs like Shabriha. As of June 2018, there were 12,281 registered persons in the Al Buss camp, 24,929 in Burj El Shimali and 34,584 in Rashidieh. In the ramshackle &quot;gathering&quot; of Jal Al Bahar next to the coastal highway, the number of residents was estimated to be around 2,500 in 2015.

In all camps, the number of refugees from Syria and Palestinian refugees from Syria increased in recent years. Tensions developed since these new arrivals would often accept work in the citrus and banana groves &quot;for half the daily wage&quot; that local Palestinian refugees used to earn.

In early 2019, some 1,500 Syrian refugees were evicted from their informal settlements around the Litani river for allegedly polluting the waters which are already heavily contaminated.

===Foreign workers===
Tyre is known as &quot;Little West Africa&quot;. Many families in Tyre have relatives in the Western Africa diaspora, especially in Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. In Senegal, most immigrants originated from Tyre. Member of the Tyrian communities there are &quot;primarily second, third and fourt generation migrants, many of whom have never been to Lebanon.&quot; One of Tyre&#x27;s main promenades is called &quot;Avenue du Senegal&quot;.

As there were an estimated 250,000 foreign workers – mostly Ethiopian women – under the discriminatory Kafala system of sponsorship in Lebanon by 2019, there is also a large community of African migrants in Tyre. They are mainly Ethiopian women who work as domestic servants. Some of them celebrate church service at the Greek-Catholic Cathedral of Saint Thomas, which has devoted a chapel on its compound to Tyre-born Saint Frumentius, the first bishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. In April 2014 one Ethiopian made headlines in an apparent suicide in Tyre:

Media reports said the woman had fled last week from her employer&#x27;s home. Security forces later detained the Ethiopian and returned her to her employer

===Poverty===

The 2016 UN HABITAT profile found that:

Approximate calculations suggest that 43% of Lebanese in Tyre urban area are living in poverty.

== Economy ==

The economy of urban Tyre mostly depends on tourism, contracting services, the construction sector, and remittances from Tyrians in the diaspora, especially in West Africa.

UNIFIL contributes greatly to the purchasing power in the Tyrian economy as well, both through spending by its individual members as well as through &quot;quick-impact projects&quot; like gravelling road, rehabilitating public places etc.

As of 2016, Olive trees were reported to comprise 38% of Tyre&#x27;s agricultural land, but producers lacked a collective marketing strategy. While Citrus reportedly comprised 25% of the agricultural land, 20% of its harvest ended up wasted.

Tyre houses one of the nation&#x27;s major ports, though much smaller than the ports of Beirut, Tripoli, and also Sidon/Saida. Its cargo traffic has been limited to the periodical import of used cars. One day after the 2020 Beirut explosion which devastated the Port of Beirut and much of the national capital on 4 August the national government reportedly decided to use the Port of Tyre as a back-up for the Port of Tripoli.

In the harbour area, the Barbour family of shipbuilders continues to build wooden boats. Tyre is thus one of only a few cities in the Mediterranean that has kept this ancient tradition, although the Barbour business has been struggling to survive as well. By 2004, there were &quot;over 600 fishermen [..] striving to make ends meet in Tyre alone&quot;.

Lebanon&#x27;s General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (GDLRC) recorded for Tyre a 4.4 percent growth rate for land transactions between 2014 and 2018, the highest rate in the country during that period. This increase in real estate prices has been largely attributed to the inflow of remittances from diaspora Tyrians.

Off the Tyrian coast, block 9 has been awarded for deepwater drilling of natural gas to a consortium of French company TotalEnergies, Italy-based Eni, and Russian Novatek.

== Sports ==

Tadamon Sour Sporting Club, or simply Tadamon (meaning &quot;Solidarity&quot;), nicknamed &quot;The Ambassador of the South&quot;, was founded in 1946 and is thus the historically most established football club of Tyre. They play their home matches at the Tyre Municipal Stadium and have won one Lebanese FA Cup (2000–01) and two Lebanese Challenge Cups (2013 and 2018). Tadamon&#x27;s traditional rivals, Salam Sour Sports Club, are also based in Tyre.

According to BBC reports, Tadamon SC was stripped of its Lebanese Premier League championship title in 2001 following match-fixing allegations.

In the same year the club scored arguably one of its biggest transfers when Roda Antar from its own youth teams was loaned to Germany&#x27;s Hamburger SV for two seasons. After eight years in Germany with Hamburg, SC Freiburg and 1. FC Köln he played another six years in the Chinese Super League and then returned to Tadamon for one final season before retirement.

A number of Lebanese Premier League professional footballers, who have also played for the Lebanon national team, originate from Tyre, namely Rabih Ataya, and Nassar Nassar.

<text>Tarja Kaarina Halonen (, born 24 December 1943) is a Finnish politician who served as the 11th president of Finland, and the first and to date only woman to hold the position, from 2000 to 2012. She first rose to prominence as a lawyer with the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), and as the Prime Minister&#x27;s parliamentary secretary (1974–1975) and a member of the City Council of Helsinki (1977–1996). Halonen was a Social Democratic Party member of parliament from 1979 until her election to the presidency in 2000. She also served as a minister at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health from 1987 to 1990, as Minister of Justice from 1990 to 1991, and as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1995 to 2000.

Halonen was an extremely popular president, with her approval ratings reaching a peak of 88 percent in December 2003. She was re-elected in 2006, defeating National Coalition Party candidate Sauli Niinistö in the second round by 51% to 48%. Ineligible to run in the 2012 presidential elections because of term limits, Halonen left office on 1 March 2012 and was succeeded by Niinistö.

Widely known for her interest in human rights issues, Halonen served as the chairperson of the Finnish LGBT rights organization Seta in the 1980s, and she actively participated in the discussion of issues such as women&#x27;s rights and the problems of globalization during her presidency. In 2006, she was mentioned by various commentators as a potential candidate for the United Nations Secretary-General selection, but she denied an interest at that time, stating that she wanted to finish her term as president before thinking about other career options. In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; named her among the 100 most powerful women in the world.

Halonen is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

Since the death of Martti Ahtisaari in 2023, Halonen is currently the oldest living former president of Finland.

==Early life and career==

Tarja Halonen was born on 24 December 1943 in the district of Kallio, which at the time was a traditional working-class area in central Helsinki. Her mother Lyyli Elina Loimola was a set-dresser and her father Vieno Olavi Halonen worked as a welder. Halonen&#x27;s parents married at the beginning of World War II and Tarja was born a few years later. Vieno Halonen was at the frontline during the Continuation War and Lyyli Halonen was working in a shoe factory when their daughter was born. When Halonen was two years old, her father Vieno Halonen went to the kiosk to buy a magazine and no longer returned home to his family. Halonen has not commented much on the incident since, but Halonen&#x27;s parents officially divorced in 1948. Vieno Halonen was an award-winning soldier who fought in the 26th Infantry Regiment, so-called &quot;Ace Regiment&quot;. Vieno Halonen was wounded three times during the war and after the war he was awarded first, second and fourth class Order of the Cross of Liberty medals. In later interviews, Tarja Halonen has said that she has met her father only a few times.

After the divorce, in 1950, Lyyli Halonen married her new husband Thure Forss, who worked as an electrician and was very active in the working-class community. Both Halonen&#x27;s mother and her stepfather influenced her world view extensively. Halonen later said that her mother was a true survivor, always an extremely active and resilient person who valued good, honest and modest hardworking people. When she entered politics, Halonen stated that these are also the qualities and attributes she respects in people.

In 1950 she began her studies in Kallio Elementary school from where she later moved to Kallio Gymnasium and finally finished her matriculation examination in 1962. She began to study Art History in the University of Helsinki in 1962 but in autumn 1963 she changed her studies to law, and obtained her Master of Laws degree in 1968 specializing in criminal law.

She began to work as a lawyer, already before obtaining her degree, in a credit surveillance company &quot;Luotonvalvonta oy&quot; in 1967. After working there for a few years, she was hired by the National Union of University Students in Finland to work as a Social Affairs and General Secretary from 1969 to 1970. Her work in the Union spurred her interest in politics, and in 1970 she obtained a post as a lawyer in the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions, being the first female ever to work as a lawyer in the Union.

==Political career: 1970–2000==
=== Trade unionist ===
In 1971, Halonen joined the Social Democratic Party which had close ties with the trade unions in which she worked as a lawyer from 1970 to 1974.

In early 1970, she was elected to represent Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions in a committee that called for the recognition of East Germany. Later she became the Vice-President of the committee, which lobbied then-President Urho Kekkonen. During the presidential elections of 2006 she was criticized by rivals for this. She responded that the committee was formed by members from many different political parties including conservative parties. In 1973, Finland recognized both East Germany and West Germany as sovereign states.

===First elections===

In 1974, Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa appointed Halonen as his parliamentary secretary. She became acquainted with the world of Finnish politics and government and her political career took a great step forward, as she went on to hold a number of public offices. Sorsa later said that he wanted his parliamentary secretary to have good ties with the trade unions of Finland and have skills in jurisprudence.

Working in Parliament made Halonen even more interested in politics and she decided to take part in the municipal elections of 1976. She was elected to the City Council of Helsinki, a position she held continuously for five terms from 1977 to 1996. Additionally in 1979, she was elected into Parliament as a representative of the Helsinki constituency. She served five full terms and less than a year of her sixth term in Parliament until her inauguration as president in 2000. In Parliament, her first formal post was as the chairman of the Social Committee, which she held from 1984 to 1987.

===Ministerial career===
In 1987, Halonen was appointed Minister of Social Affairs and Health by Prime Minister Harri Holkeri. Halonen held the position until 1990. In addition to this, she served as Minister for Nordic Cooperation from 1989 to 1991, the same year in which she was also appointed the chairman of the International Solidarity Foundation, a post she relinquished in 2000.

From 1990 to 1991, she served as Minister of Justice, and from 1995 until her election to the presidency, she served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Lipponen I Cabinet.

==Presidential campaign==
===2000 presidential campaign===
Halonen announced in 1999 that she wished to stand as a candidate for president in the 2000 presidential elections. In the preliminary elections of the Social Democrats Halonen ran against Pertti Paasio, a member of the European Parliament and former party chairman, and Jacob Söderman, the European Ombudsman. The incumbent, Martti Ahtisaari, refused to run in party preliminaries and thus announced that he would not run for a second term. Halonen won the preliminaries by a landslide, getting 7,800 out of 12,800 votes.

Halonen was a surprising candidate as she did not represent many traditional values: she was known as a left-wing social democratic party member, who lived in a domestic partnership, was a single parent and had resigned from the national church. Despite starting from fourth place in the presidential election polls, in the first round of the elections, Halonen received the most votes, 40.0%. Her nearest opponent, former prime minister Esko Aho of the Centre Party, received 34.4% of votes.

Since neither of the two candidates got over 50% of the votes, a second round was held. In the second round, Halonen narrowly defeated her opponent with 51.6% against 48.4%, thus becoming Finland&#x27;s first female head of state. Her first term began on 1 March 2000.

===2006 presidential campaign===

On 20 May 2005, Halonen held a press conference in Mäntyniemi where she announced her willingness to run for a second term. Officially, this was the desired answer for the SDP delegation that had visited her two days earlier. In addition to her own party&#x27;s support, the leader of the Left Alliance, Suvi-Anne Siimes, gave her support for Halonen&#x27;s future campaign.

SAK openly lobbied for her re-election. It used its members&#x27; money on mudslinging campaigns on behalf of Halonen. In those flyers, &quot;Niinistö is presented as the horror of worker, whereas SAK-supported Halonen is like a worker&#x27;s dream&quot;. Halonen said she approved of the flyers.

A study analyzed newspaper articles and concluded that the main newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; produced almost exclusively positive tone stories about Halonen and much more negative tone articles about candidates Niinistö, Vanhanen and Hautala.

American talk show host Conan O&#x27;Brien made recurring jokes about Halonen on his show, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, because of his own resemblance to her. He endorsed Halonen and produced humorous mock campaign ads and attack ads against her opponents. He went as far as visiting Finland and meeting Halonen.

On 19 November, the SDP&#x27;s party council meeting was held; praised as &quot;the president of the whole nation&quot;, she was unanimously chosen as the presidential candidate. Shortly thereafter, the party council of the Left Alliance gave the party&#x27;s official support to Halonen.

Halonen&#x27;s received 46% of the first round vote in the election. Sauli Niinistö (of the National Coalition Party) was second with 24%. They faced each other in a runoff on 29 January 2006, where Halonen was re-elected with 51.8% of the vote against Mr. Niinistö&#x27;s 48.2%. The re-election was a close call. She led in the advance voting, but she eventually received fewer votes on the actual voting day than Mr. Niinistö did.

==Presidency==
===First term: 2000–2006===

After her narrow election victory in the first election, Halonen&#x27;s approval ratings rose and reached a peak of 88% in December 2003.

In a 2001 interview Halonen said that she was worried about the Russian response if NATO approved membership bids by Baltic countries. Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga asked what she meant and whether Halonen is actively opposing NATO membership of Baltic countries.

In the &quot;Iraqgate&quot; scandal, Halonen&#x27;s advisor Martti Manninen leaked confidential documents to the Centre Party leader Anneli Jäätteenmäki, who had become prime minister. The revelations led to the resignation of Jäätteenmäki.

Halonen has opposed the use of landmines in Finnish military doctrine.

Halonen has defended cluster bombs and did not sign a treaty which would have banned Finland from using these kinds of weapons.

===Second term: 2006–2012===


In 2008, Halonen nominated SDP-affiliated Ritva Viljanen for a second term in the Ministry of the Interior. The government had nominated Ilkka Laitinen. Over the course of the previous 50 years, the President had only once chosen to not obey the government&#x27;s consensus, leading to Halonen thusly being accused of cronyism.

In September 2008, Halonen was perceived as insulting Estonia by saying that the Estonians suffer from a &quot;post-Soviet stress condition&quot;. President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves commented on the issue, saying that &quot;Estonia has never condemned, and will not condemn the foreign affairs decisions of another EU country. It will also not assess the psychiatric state of other EU countries&quot;. In 2009, Halonen rejected calls to apologize for Finland&#x27;s attitude towards Estonian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

At the end of her second term Halonen&#x27;s presidency and economic views received harsh criticism from Björn Wahlroos, the chairman of the two largest banks in Finland.

==Political views==
Early in her political career Halonen represented the far-left wing of the SDP. She publicly opposed the proposed free trade agreement of the European Economic Community in 1973, by signing a petition along with 500 other prominent social democrats and socialists. Otherwise she was loyal to President Kekkonen&#x27;s foreign policy, which was founded on Finnish neutrality and good relations with the Soviet Union. Markku Salomaa&#x27;s 2021 book &quot;Tarza – Pasifistin odysseia voimapolitiikan maailmassa&quot; states that Chancellor Angela Merkel had a very negative attitude towards Halonen, precisely because of her pro-Soviet and far-left wing world of ideas. Since 2004, rumors have been circulating on Internet that Halonen gave a May Day speech at Hakaniemi Market Square in 1976 and hoped that Finland would join the Soviet Union, saying: &quot;Finland would be blessed to join the Soviet Union by peaceful means. At the same time, we would get rid of the yoke of capitalism, because capitalism will die in 20 years. Finland, together with the Soviet Union, could be a pioneer towards a communist society.&quot; In an interview with &quot;STT&quot;, Halonen herself has completely rejected the gossip, saying: &quot;I have not given any May Day speech in Hakaniemi in 1976, nor can the text be found in the Informant. And if a Social Democrat SAK lawyer had given such a May Day speech in the 1970s, the employment relationship would have been rather short.&quot;

Throughout her political career, Halonen has described herself as a supporter of &quot;international solidarity&quot;. She describes herself as a &quot;relative pacifist&quot;, meaning that she does not support unilateral disarmament. She has strongly defended the President&#x27;s role as the commander in chief of the military. She opposed NATO membership during her tenure. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Finnish public opinion had turned, and the Parliament had debated the issue and decided, in favor of submitting an application for NATO membership, Halonen also voiced her support on Twitter, calling the move &quot;a necessary measure in the changed security situation in Europe&quot;. Her strong stands on these issues have characterised her presidential term and shaped Finnish foreign policy, in part in cooperation with the like-minded former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Erkki Tuomioja.

Halonen has publicly supported the involvement of the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) in politics.

The Constitution of Finland and Halonen&#x27;s decision to take part in some European Union meetings with the prime minister has created the so-called &quot;problem of two dinner plates&quot; in Finland. Since most other countries only have their prime ministers representing them, it was also decided in Finland that the task is reserved for the Prime Minister in most cases.

On 20 March 2013, Halonen publicly voiced her support for same-sex marriage.

==Personal life==

Halonen says her interests include art history, the theatre and swimming. She says she speaks Finnish, Swedish, and English, and is studying Estonian. Halonen had two cats during her presidential term. After they died, she was given a &quot;Neva Masquerade&quot; cat in 2013 by Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.

On 26 August 2000, Halonen married her longtime partner, Dr. Pentti Arajärvi, in a civil ceremony at her official residence, Mäntyniemi, after a relationship of more than fifteen years. Halonen&#x27;s adult daughter Anna, and Arajärvi&#x27;s adult son Esko, acted as witnesses. Both children are from previous relationships.

She promotes Finland in her personal accoutrements, such as wearing a Moomin watch.

In the 1960s, she left the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, to which the majority of Finns belong, to protest against its policy of taxing church members and its stance against female priests. The church has since accepted women as priests, and Halonen has stated that she has no personal reason not to return to the church but refrains from doing so in order not to give a signal that might be misinterpreted. In the 1990s, Halonen acted as the chairman of &quot;Suomen setlementtiliitto&quot;, a Christian social work organization. After her presidential term, Halonen rejoined the Evangelical-Lutheran Church. According to her statements, she had previously refrained from it as it might have been considered an attempt to garner political support. Since then, Halonen has even preached publicly in a divine service of her home parish of Kallio. This is a privilege that the parish priest may grant only in exceptional cases to persons known for their Christian conviction.

In 1980–1981 Halonen served as the chairman of Seta, the main LGBT rights organization in Finland.

== Criticism ==

== In popular culture ==
A long-running joke, which stems from the recurring segment &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien Hates My Homeland&quot;, is that American talk show host Conan O&#x27;Brien resembles Tarja Halonen. After joking about this for several months (which led to his endorsement of her campaign), O&#x27;Brien travelled to Finland, appeared on several television shows and met President Halonen. The trip was filmed and aired as a special.

Halonen also appears as an animated character in the political satire TV series &quot;The Autocrats&quot;.

<text>Truso was a Viking Age port of trade (emporium) set up by the Scandinavians at the banks of the Nogat delta branch of the Vistula River, close to a bay (the modern Drużno lake), where it emptied into the shallow and brackish Vistula Lagoon. This sizeable lagoon is separated from the Gdańsk Bay by the Vistula Spit at the southern Baltic Sea coast. In the 9th century, the merchant Wulfstan of Hedeby travelled to Truso in the service of the English King Alfred the Great and wrote his account of the place at a prominent location of the Amber Road, which attracted merchants from central and southern Europe, who supplied the markets in the Mediterranean and the Middle East with the highly valued commodity.

The account of the voyage to the town of Truso in the land of the &quot;Pruzzens&quot; around the year 890 by Wulfstan of Hedeby has been included in Alfred the Great&#x27;s translation of Orosius&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;. Moreover, Wulfstan named Truso as being near &quot;Estmere&quot; (which is his rendition of the Old Prussian &quot;Aīstinmari&quot; and Lithuanian &quot;Aistmarės&quot; for Vistula Lagoon). In the words of Marija Gimbutas, &quot;the name of the town is the earliest known historically in the Baltic Sea area&quot;.

== History ==

Truso was situated in a central location upon the Eastern European trade routes, which led from Birka in Sweden via Visby on the island of Gotland towards the southern Baltic Sea shore, where in the 13th-century the Hanseatic city of Elbing was established. From there, trade continued further south along the Amber Road to Carnuntum in the Alps. These ancient roads led further south-west and south-east to the Black Sea and eventually to North Africa and the Middle East. Gimbutas has observed thatFor Old Prussia, Truso played the same central role as Haithabu for north-western Germany or the Slavic Vineta for Pomerania.East–western trade routes lead from Truso and Wiskiauten (a rival trading centre in Old Prussia, at the south-western corner of the Courish Lagoon), along the Baltic Sea to Jutland and from there up the Slien inlet to Haithabu (Hedeby), the large trading center in Jutland. This town, located close to the modern city of Schleswig in Schleswig-Holstein, was centrally located and could be reached from all four directions over land as well as from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.

Around the year 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby embarked on his seven-day journey from Hedeby to Truso at the behest of king Alfred the Great. He named the lands and the coasts he had passed as the ship was travelling under sail all the way. Weonodland was on his right and Langland, Laeland, Falster and Sconey on his left, all land that is subject to Denmark.

Wulfstan resumes: Then on our left we had the land of the Burgundians, who have a king to themselves. Then, after the land of the Burgundians, we had on our left the lands that have been called from the earliest times Blekingey, and Meore, and Eowland, and Gotland, all which territory is subject to the Sweons; and Weonodland (the land of the Wends) was all the way on our right, as far as the Vistula estuary.The most sought after commodities of Truso were amber, animal furs and (pagan) slaves, while the industries of blacksmithing and amber working provided processed trading goods. The beginnings of the town has been dated back to approximately the end of the 7th century, while in the second half of the 10th century siltation in the Nogat had begun to cut off the town from the Vistula lagoon and the Baltic Sea. The town&#x27;s importance as trading port began to decline and was eventually eclipsed by the ascent of Gdańsk as the local trading center, that was situated right by the sea.

Historians still debate the motive for this expedition. King Alfred obviously needed allies in his defense against the Danish and Norwegian Vikings, who had already taken over most of England. However, that reason for the journey is rather unlikely, since Truso was at the time little more than a trading center and Alfred the Great, the West Saxon ruler, already kept in close contact with the continental Saxons and the Franks. 

== Archaeology ==
First attempts at finding the exact location of the town date back to the early sixteenth century. Based on Prussian archaeological finds from 1897 and excavations which began in the 1920s, archaeologists located Truso near Elbing (since 1945 Janów Pomorski near Elbląg). Found artifacts, dating from the 7th to 12th century, were stored in the Elbing Museum, now the Elbląg Museum. In the 1980s, the Polish archaeologist Marek Jagodziński had resumed excavations and cleared a site of circa 20 hectare, in which a series of structures had burnt down around the year 1,000.

Trade must have been of great importance at the settlements, as the numerous merchant graves along the river testify. Artefacts unearthed at the site include scales, weights, silver horseshoe brooches, belt buckles, swords, coins, elaborate jewelry imported from Scandinavia, garment accessories and armament components. Scandinavian traders and craftmen lived and worked in central and port area, while peripheral area might be inhabited also by Balts and Slavs. The Scandinavian influence on these settlements and artefacts is particularly obvious and confirms Viking expansion of settlement activity to Courland and Livland. As early as the 8th century, the first incursions of North Germanic groups took place, which lead to the founding of the Grobin/Seeburg settlement near Liepája. Archbishop Rimbert of Bremen recorded the immigration of a group under the Svea king Olaf during the 9th century. 

Author Gwyn Jones noted that at the circa 20 ha sized area &quot;no true town has been found and excavated&quot; and that the identification of the site in Elbląg with Truso is based on &quot;finds of Norse weapons&quot; and the presence of &quot;a large Viking Age cemetery&quot; nearby, According to Mateusz Bogucki &quot;by now, there is no doubt that the settlement really is Wulfstan&#x27;s Truso&quot; The Elbląg Museum brochure: &quot;Truso- A Discovered Legend&quot;, by Marek F. Jagodziński, describes a large number of buildings found during the recent excavations, with burnt remains of posts suggesting buildings of around and long houses of about . A thick layer of ash, debris and numerous arrowheads suggest that the city was destroyed by pirates or invaders.

Mateusz Bogucki of the Polish Academy of Sciences at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology, states in his book &quot;Coin finds in the viking Age emporium at Janów Pomorski (Truso) and the Prussian phenomenon&quot; about &quot;...the end of Truso as a port of trade...a strong political power, probably of Piast origin...sent warriors to try to take control...and destroyed the town.&quot;

<text>The tragedy of the commons is the concept that, if many people enjoy unfettered access to a finite, valuable resource, such as a pasture, they will tend to overuse it and may end up destroying its value altogether. Even if some users exercised voluntary restraint, the other users would merely replace them, the predictable result being a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all. The concept has been widely discussed, and criticised, in economics, ecology and other sciences.

The metaphorical term is the title of a 1968 essay by ecologist Garrett Hardin. The concept itself did not originate with Hardin but rather extends back to classical antiquity, being discussed by Aristotle. The principal concern of Hardin&#x27;s essay was overpopulation of the planet. To prevent the inevitable tragedy (he argued) it was necessary to reject the principle (supposedly enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) according to which every family has a right to choose the number of its offspring, and to replace it by &quot;mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon&quot;.

Some scholars have argued that over-exploitation of the common resource is by no means inevitable, since the individuals concerned may be able to achieve mutual restraint by consensus. Others have contended that the metaphor is inapposite because its exemplar – unfettered access to common land – did not exist historically, the right to exploit common land being controlled by law. The work of Elinor Ostrom, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics, is seen by some economists as having refuted Hardin&#x27;s claims. Hardin&#x27;s views on over-population have been criticised as simplistic and racist.

==Expositions==

===Classical===
The concept of unrestricted-access resources becoming spent, where personal use does not incur personal expense, has been discussed for millennia. Aristotle wrote that &quot;That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own: they care less for what is common.&quot;

===Lloyd&#x27;s pamphlet===
In 1833, the English economist William Forster Lloyd published &quot;Two Lectures on the Checks to Population&quot;, a pamphlet that included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they were each entitled to let their cows graze.

He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, while the whole group shared the resulting damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.

Lloyd&#x27;s pamphlet was written after the enclosure movement had eliminated the open field system of common property as the standard model for land exploitation in England (though there remained, and still remain, millions acres of &quot;common land&quot;: see 
 before). Carl Dahlman and others have asserted that his description was historically inaccurate, pointing to the fact that the system endured for hundreds of years without producing the disastrous effects claimed by Lloyd.

===Garrett Hardin&#x27;s article===
In 1968, ecologist Garrett Hardin explored this social dilemma in his article &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot;, published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. The essay derived its title from the pamphlet by Lloyd, which he cites, on the over-grazing of common land:
Hardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means, as distinct from those with solutions that require &quot;a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality&quot;. Hardin focused on human population growth, the use of the Earth&#x27;s natural resources, and the welfare state.

Hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone, and not on the relationship between society and man, then people will treat other people as resources, which would lead to the world population growing and for the process to continue. Parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately. Such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom. Hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death, if overbreeding was its own punishment, then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families.

====Political inferences====

Hardin blamed the welfare state for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports over breeding as a fundamental human right, a Malthusian catastrophe is inevitable. Consequently, in his article, Hardin lamented the following proposal from the United Nations:

In addition, Hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others, all resources would still eventually be depleted. Overall, Hardin argued against relying on conscience as a means of policing commons, suggesting that this favors selfish individuals – often known as free riders – over those who are more altruistic.

In the context of avoiding over-exploitation of common resources, Hardin concluded by restating Hegel&#x27;s maxim (which was quoted by Engels), &quot;freedom is the recognition of necessity&quot;. He suggested that &quot;freedom&quot; completes the tragedy of the commons. By recognizing resources as commons in the first place, and by recognizing that, as such, they require management, Hardin believed that humans &quot;can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms&quot;.

===The &quot;Commons&quot; as a modern resource concept===
Hardin&#x27;s article marked the mainstream acceptance of the term &quot;commons&quot; as used to connote a shared resource. As Frank van Laerhoven and Elinor Ostrom have stated: &quot;Prior to the publication of Hardin’s article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words &#x27;the commons&#x27;, &#x27;common pool resources&#x27;, or &#x27;common property&#x27; were very rare in the academic literature.&quot; They go on to say: &quot;In 2002, Barrett and Mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology. They report that Hardin’s 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited&quot;. However, the Ostroms point out that Hardin&#x27;s analysis was based on crucial misconceptions about the nature of common property systems.

=== System archetype ===

In systems theory, the commons problem is one of the ten most common system archetypes. The Tragedy of the Commons archetype can be illustrated using a causal loop diagram.

==Application==

===Metaphoric meaning===
Like Lloyd and Thomas Malthus before him, Hardin was primarily interested in the problem of human population growth. But in his essay, he also focused on the use of larger (though finite) resources such as the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and oceans, as well as pointing out the &quot;negative commons&quot; of pollution (i.e., instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource, a &quot;negative commons&quot; deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost, pollution).

As a metaphor, the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally. The &quot;tragedy&quot; is not in the word&#x27;s conventional or theatric sense, nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it. Similarly, Hardin&#x27;s use of &quot;commons&quot; has frequently been misunderstood, leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work &quot;The Tragedy of the Unregulated Commons&quot;.

The metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize the use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptive nature of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.

The same concept is sometimes called the &quot;tragedy of the fishers&quot;, because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet.

===Modern commons===

The &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as sustainability. The commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today, such as water, forests, fish, and non-renewable energy sources such as oil, gas, and coal.

Hardin&#x27;s model posits that the tragedy of the commons may emerge if individuals prioritize self-interest. 

Another case study involves beavers in Canada, historically crucial for natives who, as stewards, organized to hunt them for food and commerce. Non-native trappers, motivated by fur prices, contributed to resource degradation, wresting control from the indigenous population. Conservation laws enacted in the 1930s in response to declining beaver populations led to the expulsion of trappers, legal acknowledgment of natives, and enforcement of customary laws. This intervention resulted in productive harvests by the 1950s.

Situations exemplifying the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; include the overfishing and destruction of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the destruction of salmon runs on rivers that have been dammed (most prominently in modern times on the Columbia River in the Northwest United States and historically in North Atlantic rivers), and the devastation of the sturgeon fishery (in modern Russia, but historically in the United States as well). In terms of water supply, another example is the limited water available in arid regions (e.g., the area of the Aral Sea and the Los Angeles water system supply, especially at Mono Lake and Owens Lake).

In economics, an externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. Negative externalities are a well-known feature of the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;. For example, driving cars has many negative externalities; these include pollution, carbon emissions, and traffic accidents. Every time Person A gets in a car, it becomes more likely that Person Z will suffer in each of those areas. Economists often urge the government to adopt policies that &quot;internalize&quot; an externality.

The &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; can also refer to the idea of open data. Anonymised data are crucial for useful social research and represent therefore a public resource better said, a common good which is liable to exhaustion. Some feel that the law should provide a safe haven for the dissemination of research data, since it can be argued that current data protection policies overburden valuable research without mitigating realistic risks.

An expansive application of the concept can also be seen in Vyse&#x27;s analysis of differences between countries in their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vyse argues that those who defy public health recommendations can be thought of as spoiling a set of common goods, &quot;the economy, the healthcare system, and the very air we breathe, for all of us. In a similar vein, it has been argued that higher sickness and mortality rates from COVID-19 in individualistic cultures with less obligatory collectivism, is another instance of the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;.

=== Tragedy of the digital commons ===
In the past two decades, scholars have been attempting to apply the concept of the tragedy of the commons to the digital environment. However, between scholars there are differences on some very basic notions inherent to the tragedy of the commons: the idea of finite resources and the extent of pollution. On the other hand, there seems to be some agreement on the role of the digital divide and how to solve a potential tragedy of the digital commons.

==== Resources ====
Many digital resources have properties that make them vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons, including data, virtual artifacts and even limited user attention. Closely related are the physical computational resources, such as CPU, RAM, and network bandwidth, that digital communities on shared servers rely upon and govern. Some scholars argue that digital resources are infinite, and therefore immune to the tragedy of the commons, because downloading a file does not constitute the destruction of the file in the digital environment, and because it can be replicated and disseminated throughout the digital environment. However, it can still be considered a finite resource within the context of privacy laws and regulations that limit access to it.

Finite digital resources can thus be digital commons. An example is a database that requires persistent maintenance, such as Wikipedia. As a non-profit, it survives on a network of people contributing to maintain a knowledge base without expectation of direct compensation. This digital resource will deplete as Wikipedia may only survive if it is contributed to and used as a commons. The motivation for individuals to contribute is reflective of the theory because, if humans act in their own immediate interest and no longer participate, then the resource becomes misinformed or depleted. Arguments surrounding the regulation and mitigation requirements for digital resources may become reflective of natural resources.

This raises the question whether one can view access itself as a finite resource in the context of a digital environment. Some scholars argue this point, often pointing to a proxy for access that is more concrete and measurable. One such proxy is bandwidth, which can become congested when too many people try to access the digital environment. Alternatively, one can think of the network itself as a common resource which can be exhausted through overuse. Therefore, when talking about resources running out in a digital environment, it could be more useful to think in terms of the access to the digital environment being restricted in some way; this is called information entropy.

==== Pollution ====

In terms of pollution, there are some scholars who look only at the pollution that occurs in the digital environment itself. They argue that unrestricted use of digital resources can cause an overproduction of redundant data which causes noise and corrupts communication channels within the digital environment. Others argue that the pollution caused by the overuse of digital resources also causes pollution in the physical environment. They argue that unrestricted use of digital resources causes misinformation, fake news, crime, and terrorism, as well as problems of a different nature such as confusion, manipulation, insecurity, and loss of confidence.

==== Digital divide and solutions ====
Scholars disagree on the particularities underlying the tragedy of the digital commons; however, there does seem to be some agreement on the cause and the solution. The cause of the tragedy of the commons occurring in the digital environment is attributed by some scholars to the digital divide. They argue that there is too large a focus on bridging this divide and providing unrestricted access to everyone. Such a focus on increasing access without the necessary restrictions causes the exploitation of digital resources for individual self-interest that is underlying any tragedy of the commons.

In terms of the solution, scholars agree that cooperation rather than regulation is the best way to mitigate a tragedy of the digital commons. The digital world is not a closed system in which a central authority can regulate the users, as such some scholars argue that voluntary cooperation must be fostered. This could perhaps be done through digital governance structure that motivates multiple stakeholders to engage and collaborate in the decision-making process. Other scholars argue more in favor of formal or informal sets of rules, like a code of conduct, to promote ethical behaviour in the digital environment and foster trust. Alternative to managing relations between people, some scholars argue that it is access itself that needs to be properly managed, which includes expansion of network capacity.

==== Patents and technology ====
Patents are effectively a limited-time exploitation monopoly given to inventors. Once the period has elapsed, the invention is in principle free to all, and many companies do indeed commercialize such products, now market-proven. However, around 50% of all patent applications do not reach successful commercialization at all, often due to immature levels of components or marketing failures by the innovators. Scholars have suggested that since investment is often connected to patentability, such inactive patents form a rapidly &quot;growing&quot; category of underprivileged technologies and ideas that, under current market conditions, are effectively unavailable for use. 
Thus, &quot;Under the current system, people are encouraged to register new patents, and are discouraged from using publicly available patents.&quot; The case might be particularly relevant to technologies that are relatively more environmentally/human damaging but also somewhat costlier than other alternatives developed contemporaneously.

==Examples==
More general examples (some alluded to by Hardin) of potential and actual tragedies include:
* Physical resources
** Uncontrolled human population growth leading to overpopulation.
** Atmosphere: through the release of pollution that leads to ozone depletion, global warming, ocean acidification (by way of increased atmospheric being absorbed by the sea), and particulate pollution.
** Light pollution: with the loss of the night sky for research and cultural significance, affected human, flora and fauna health, nuisance, trespass and the loss of enjoyment or function of private property.
** Water: Water pollution, water crisis of over-extraction of groundwater and wasting water due to overirrigation.

===Application to evolutionary biology===
A parallel was drawn in 2006 between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that, through acting selfishly, eventually diminish or destroy their common host. The idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of virulence or sexual conflict, where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings.

The idea of evolutionary suicide, where adaptation at the level of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct, can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons. From an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide us with advanced therapeutic methods.

Microbial ecology studies have also addressed if resource availability modulates the cooperative or competitive behaviour in bacteria populations. When resources availability is high, bacterial populations become competitive and aggressive with each other, but when environmental resources are low, they tend to be cooperative and mutualistic.

Ecological studies have hypothesised that competitive forces between animals are major in high carrying capacity zones (i.e., near the Equator), where biodiversity is higher, because of natural resources abundance. This abundance or excess of resources, causes animal populations to have reproduction strategies (many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short time until sexual maturity), so competition is affordable for populations. Also, competition could select populations to have behaviour in a positive feedback regulation.

Contrarily, in low carrying capacity zones (i.e., far from the equator), where environmental conditions are harsh, &quot;K&quot; strategies are common (longer life expectancy, produce relatively fewer offspring and tend to be altricial, requiring extensive care by parents when young) and populations tend to have cooperative or mutualistic behaviours. If populations have a competitive behaviour in hostile environmental conditions, they mostly are filtered out (die) by environmental selection; hence, populations in hostile conditions are selected to be cooperative.

===Climate change===

The effects of climate change have been given as a mass example of the tragedy of the commons. This perspective proposes that the earth, being the commons, has suffered a depletion of natural resources without regard to the externalities, the impact on neighboring and future populations. The collective actions of individuals, organisations, and governments continue to contribute to environmental degradation. Mitigation of the long-term impacts and tipping points require strict controls or other solution, but this may come as a loss to different industries. The sustainability of population and industry growth is the subject of climate change discussion. The global commons of environmental resource consumption or selfishness, as in the fossil fuel industry has been theorised as not realistically manageable. This is due to the crossing of irreversible thresholds of impact before the costs are entirely realised.

==Commons dilemma==

The &quot;commons dilemma&quot; is a specific class of social dilemma in which people&#x27;s short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the common good. In academia, a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it, including &quot;resource dilemma&quot;, &quot;take-some dilemma&quot;, and &quot;common pool resource&quot;.

Commons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or over-harvest common resources in both the laboratory and field. Research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational, strategic, and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons.

In game theory, which constructs mathematical models for individuals&#x27; behavior in strategic situations, the corresponding &quot;game&quot;, developed by Hardin, is known as the Commonize Costs – Privatize Profits Game (CC–PP game).

===Psychological factors===
Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick (2002), in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas, identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives, gender, payoff structure, uncertainty, power and status, group size, communication, causes, and frames. They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) and situational factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.

Empirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables. Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework. An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness, suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: &quot;What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?&quot;

===Strategic factors===
Strategic factors also matter in commons dilemmas. One often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource. In simultaneous play, all people harvest at the same time, whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence – first, second, third, etc. There is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first – the leaders – are higher than the harvest of those coming later – the followers. The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more. With sequential play, individuals adopt a first come-first served rule, whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule. Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations. Research found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations. Moreover, those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group.

===Structural factors===
Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that &quot;Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.&quot; One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic leadership exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.

The provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources. Selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation – for example, through installing water and electricity meters in houses. Selective rewards work, provided that they are open to everyone. An experimental carpool lane in the Netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool. The rewards do not have to be tangible. In Canada, utilities considered putting &quot;smiley faces&quot; on electricity bills of customers below the average consumption of that customer&#x27;s neighborhood.

==Solutions==

Articulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of political philosophy. In some situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.

===Non-governmental solution===
Robert Axelrod contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate, because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests. Anthropologist G. N. Appell criticised those who cited Hardin to &quot;impos[e] their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge.&quot;

Political scientist Elinor Ostrom, who was awarded 2009&#x27;s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her work on the issue, and others revisited Hardin&#x27;s work in 1999. They found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves. For example, another group found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the interest of the users of a commons to keep them functioning and so complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency. Another prominent example of this is the deliberative process of granting legal personhood to a part of nature, for example rivers, with the aim of preserving their water resources and prevent environmental degradation. This process entails that a river is regarded as its own legal entity that can sue against environmental damage done to it while being represented by an independently appointed guardian advisory group. This has happened as a bottom-up process in New Zealand: Here debates initiated by the Whanganui Iwi tribe have resulted in legal personhood for the river. The river is considered as a living whole, stretching from mountain to sea and even includes not only the physical but also its metaphysical elements.

Similarly, geographer Douglas L. Johnson remarks that many nomadic pastoralist societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact &quot;balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound&quot;, reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit; in spite of this, it was often the case that &quot;the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces.&quot; Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as Ibn Khaldun as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples, governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin&#x27;s work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual sedentarization of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis. Examining relations between historically nomadic Bedouin Arabs and the Syrian state in the 20th century, Dawn Chatty notes that &quot;Hardin&#x27;s argument was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the steppe land&quot; in development schemes for the arid interior of the country, downplaying the larger role of agricultural overexploitation in desertification as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful.

Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g. land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better. A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.

Many of the economic and social structures recommended by Ostrom coincide with the structures recommended by anarchists, particularly green anarchism. The largest contemporary societies that use these organizational strategies are the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities and the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria which have heavily been influenced by anarchism and other versions of libertarian and ecological socialism.

Individuals may act in a deliberate way to avoid consumption habits that deplete natural resources. This consciousness promotes the boycotting of products or brands and seeking alternative, more sustainable options.

==== Altruistic punishment ====
Various well-established theories, such as theory of kin selection and direct reciprocity, have limitations in explaining patterns of cooperation emerging between unrelated individuals and in non-repeatable short-term interactions. Studies have shown that punishment is an efficacious motivator for cooperation among humans.

Altruistic punishment entails the presence of individuals that punish defectors from a cooperative agreement, although doing so is costly and provides no material gain. These punishments effectively resolve tragedy of the commons scenarios by addressing both first-order free rider problems (i.e. defectors free riding on cooperators) and second-order free rider problems (i.e. cooperators free riding on work of punishers). Such results can only be witnessed when the punishment levels are high enough.

While defectors are motivated by self-interest and cooperators feel morally obliged to practice self-restraint, punishers pursue this path when their emotions are clouded by annoyance and anger at free riders.

===Governmental solutions===
Governmental solutions are used when the above conditions are not met (such as a community being larger than the cohesion of its social network). Examples of government regulation include population control, privatization, regulation, and internalizing the externalities.

====Population control====

In Hardin&#x27;s essay, he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on &quot;mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon&quot; and result in &quot;relinquishing the freedom to breed&quot;. Hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book, &quot;Managing the Commons,&quot; co-written with John A. Baden. He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the &quot;reproductive right&quot;, to safeguard all other rights. Several countries have a variety of population control laws in place.

In the context of United States policy debates, Hardin advocated restrictions on migration, particularly of non-whites. In a 1991 article, he stated

====Privatization====
One solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property (Coase 1960), giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability. Libertarians and classical liberals cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government. They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.

In England, this solution was attempted in the inclosure acts. According to Karl Marx in , this solution leads to increasing numbers of people being pushed into smaller and smaller pockets of common land which has yet to be privatised, thereby merely displacing and exacerbating the problem while putting an increasing number of people in precarious situations. Economic historian Bob Allen coined the term &quot;Engels&#x27; pause&quot; to describe the period from 1790 to 1840, when British working-class wages stagnated and per-capita gross domestic product expanded rapidly during a technological upheaval.

====Regulation====
In a typical example, governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual. Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining, fishing, hunting, livestock raising, and timber extraction are examples of this approach. Similarly, limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons. This idea is used by the United Nations Moon Treaty, Outer Space Treaty and Law of the Sea Treaty as well as the UNESCO World Heritage Convention (treaty) which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the Common Heritage of Mankind.

German historian Joachim Radkau thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies. An asserted impending &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict private property and espouse expansion of public property.

Giving legal rights of personhood to objects in nature is another proposed solution. The idea of giving land a legal personality is intended to enable the democratic system of the rule of law to allow for prosecution, sanction, and reparation for damage to the earth. For example, this has been put into practice in Ecuador in the form of a constitutional principle known as &quot;Pacha Mama&quot; (Mother Earth).

====Internalizing externalities====
Privatization works when the person who owns the property (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons. &quot;Internalizing the externalities&quot;, in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.

=== The mid-way solution ===
One of the significant actions areas which can dwell as potential solution is to have co-shared communities that have partial ownership from governmental side and partial ownership from the community. By ownership, here it is referred to planning, sharing, using, benefiting and supervision of the resources which ensure that the power is not held in one or two hands only. Since, involvement of multiple stakeholders is necessary responsibilities can be shared across them based on their abilities and capacities in terms of human resources, infrastructure development ability, and legal aspects, etc.

==Criticism==
===Commons in historical reality===
The status of common land in England as mentioned in Lloyd&#x27;s pamphlet has been widely misunderstood.

Millions of acres were &quot;common land&quot;, but this did not mean public land open to everybody, a popular fallacy. There was no such thing as ownerless land. Every parcel of &quot;common&quot; land had a legal owner, who was a private person or corporation. The owner was called the &quot;lord of the manor&quot; (which, like &quot;landlord&quot;, was a legal term denoting ownership, not aristocratic status).

It was true that there were local people, called &quot;commoners&quot;, defined as those who had a legal right to use his land for some purpose of their own, typically grazing their animals. Certainly their rights were strong, because the lord was not entitled to build on his own land, or fence off any part of it, unless he could prove he had left enough pasture for the commoners. But these individuals were not the general public at large: not everyone in the vicinity was a commoner.

Furthermore the commoners&#x27; right to graze the lord&#x27;s land with their animals was restricted by law – precisely in order to prevent overgrazing. If overgrazing did nevertheless occur, which it sometimes did, it was because of incompetent or weak land management, and not because of the pressure of an unlimited right to graze, which did not exist.

Hence Christopher Rodgers said that &quot;Hardin&#x27;s influential thesis on the &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27; ... has no application to common land in England and Wales. It is based on a false premise&quot;. Rodgers, professor of law at Newcastle University, added:

Every productive unit (&quot;manor&quot;) had a manorial court; without it, the manor ceased to exist. Manorial courts could fine commoners, and the lord of the manor for that matter, for breaches of customary law, e.g. grazing too many cattle on the land. Customary law varied locally. It could not be altered without the consent of the whole body of the commoners, except by getting an Act of Parliament.

By the time of Lloyd&#x27;s pamphlet (1833) the majority of land in England had been enclosed and had ceased to be common land. That which remained may not have been good agricultural land anyway, or the best managed. Lloyd takes for granted that common lands were inferior and argues his over-grazing theory to explain it. He does not examine other possible causes e.g. common land was difficult to drain, to keep disease-free, and to use for improved cattle breeding.

Likewise, Susan Jane Buck Cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground, and misrepresents what she terms was actually the &quot;triumph of the commons&quot;: the successful common usage of land for many centuries. She argues that social changes and agricultural innovation, and not the behaviour of the commoners, led to the demise of the commons. In a similar vein, Carl Dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing.

===Others===
Hardin&#x27;s work is criticised as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the demographic transition, and for failing to distinguish between common property and open access resources. Radical environmentalist Derrick Jensen claims the tragedy of the commons is used as propaganda for private ownership. He says it has been used by the political right wing to hasten the final enclosure of the &quot;common resources&quot; of third world and indigenous people worldwide, as a part of the Washington Consensus. He argues that in true situations, those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them. He says that rather than being called &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot;, it should be called &quot;the Tragedy of the Failure of the Commons&quot;.

Marxist geographer David Harvey has a similar criticism: &quot;The dispossession of indigenous populations in North America by &#x27;productive&#x27; colonists, for instance, was justified because indigenous populations did not produce value&quot;, asking: &quot;Why, for instance, do we not focus in Hardin&#x27;s metaphor on the individual ownership of the cattle rather than on the pasture as a common?&quot;

Some authors, like Yochai Benkler, say that with the rise of the Internet and digitalisation, an economics system based on commons becomes possible again. He wrote in his book &quot;The Wealth of Networks&quot; in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction: &quot;as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system&quot;. He uses the term &quot;networked information economy&quot; to refer to a &quot;system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies&quot;. He also coined the term &quot;commons-based peer production&quot; for collaborative efforts based on sharing information. Examples of commons-based peer production are Wikipedia, free and open source software and open-source hardware.

The tragedy of the commons has served as a pretext for powerful private companies and/or governments to introduce regulatory agents or outsourcing on less powerful entities or governments, for the exploitation of their natural resources. Powerful companies and governments can easily corrupt and bribe less powerful institutions or governments, to allow them exploit or privatize their resources, which causes more concentration of power and wealth in powerful entities. This phenomenon is known as the resource curse.

Other criticisms have focused on Hardin&#x27;s racist and eugenicist views, claiming that his arguments are directed towards forcible population control, particularly for people of color.

==Comedy of the commons==
In certain cases, exploiting a resource more may be a good thing. Carol M. Rose, in a 1986 article, discussed the concept of the &quot;comedy of the commons&quot;, where the public property in question exhibits &quot;increasing returns to scale&quot; in usage (hence the phrase, &quot;the more the merrier&quot;), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one. Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities. According to Rose, public resources with the &quot;comedic&quot; characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.

A modern example presented by Garrett Richards in environmental studies is that the issue of excessive carbon emissions can be tackled effectively only when the efforts are directly addressing the issues along with the collective efforts from the world economies. Additionally, the more that nations are willing to collaborate and contribute resources, the higher the chances are for successful technological developments.

<doc id="30805" wikidata="Q2429654" url="?curid=30805" title="Tape bias">
<text>Tape bias is the term for two techniques, AC bias and DC bias, that improve the fidelity of analogue tape recorders. DC bias is the addition of direct current to the audio signal that is being recorded. AC bias is the addition of an inaudible high-frequency signal (generally from 40 to 150 kHz) to the audio signal. Most contemporary tape recorders use AC bias.

When recording, magnetic tape has a nonlinear response as determined by its coercivity. Without bias, this response results in poor performance, especially at low signal levels. A recording signal that generates a magnetic field strength less than the tape&#x27;s coercivity cannot magnetise the tape and produces little playback signal. Bias increases the signal quality of most audio recordings significantly by pushing the signal into more linear zones of the tape&#x27;s magnetic transfer function.

== History ==
Magnetic recording was proposed as early as 1878 by Oberlin Smith, who on 4 October 1878 filed, with the U.S. patent office, a caveat regarding the magnetic recording of sound and who published his ideas on the subject in the 8 September 1888 issue of &quot;The Electrical World&quot; as &quot;Some possible forms of phonograph&quot;. By 1898, Valdemar Poulsen had demonstrated a magnetic recorder and proposed magnetic tape. Fritz Pfleumer was granted a German patent for a non-magnetic &quot;Sound recording carrier&quot; with a magnetic coating, on 1 January 1928. Years earlier, Joseph O&#x27;Neil had created a similar recording medium, yet had not made a working machine that could record sound.

=== DC bias ===
The earliest magnetic recording systems simply applied the unadulterated (baseband) input signal to a recording head, resulting in recordings with poor low-frequency response and high distortion. Within short order, the addition of a suitable direct current to the signal, a DC bias, was found to reduce distortion by operating the tape substantially within its linear-response region. The principal disadvantage of DC bias was that it left the tape with a net magnetization, which generated significant noise on replay because of the grain of the tape particles. However: the earlier wire recorders were largely immune to the problem due to their high running speed and relatively large wire size. Some early DC-bias systems used a permanent magnet that was placed near the record head. It had to be swung out of the way for replay. DC bias was replaced by AC bias but was later re-adopted by some very low-cost cassette recorders.

=== AC bias ===
The original patent for AC bias was filed by Wendell L. Carlson and Glenn L. Carpenter in 1921, eventually resulting in a patent in 1927. The value of AC bias was somewhat masked by the fact that wire recording gained little benefit from the technique and Carlson and Carpenter&#x27;s achievement was largely ignored. The first rediscovery seems to have been by Dean Wooldridge at Bell Telephone Laboratories, around 1937, but their lawyers found the original patent, and Bell simply kept silent about their rediscovery of AC bias.

Teiji Igarashi, Makoto Ishikawa, and Kenzo Nagai of Japan published a paper on AC biasing in 1938 and received a Japanese patent in 1940. Marvin Camras (USA) also rediscovered high-frequency (AC) bias independently in 1941 and received a patent in 1944.

The reduction in distortion and noise provided by AC bias was accidentally rediscovered in 1940 by Walter Weber while working at the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (RRG) when a DC-biased Magnetophon that he had been working on developed an &#x27;unwanted&#x27; oscillation in its record circuitry. 

The last production DC biased Magnetophon machines had harmonic distortion in excess of 10 percent; a dynamic range of 40 dB and a frequency response of just 50 Hz to 6 kHz at a tape speed slightly in excess of 30 inches per second (76.8 cm/sec). The AC biased Magnetophon machines reduced the harmonic distortion to well under 3 percent; extended the dynamic range to 65 dB and the frequency response was now from 40 Hz to 15 kHz at the same tape speed. These AC biased magnetophons provided a fidelity of recording that outperformed any other recording system of the time.

<text>In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the &quot;root&quot; node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most node in the tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or &quot;loops&quot; (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes (parent and children nodes of a node under consideration, if they exist) in a single straight line (called edge or link between two adjacent nodes).

Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of children for each parent to at most two. When the order of the children is specified, this data structure corresponds to an ordered tree in graph theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node in the tree, or sometimes only with the &quot;leaf nodes&quot;, which have no children nodes.

The abstract data type (ADT) can be represented in a number of ways, including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list). Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes or ancestor lists for performance.

Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and trees in descriptive set theory.

==Applications==
Trees are commonly used to represent or manipulate hierarchical data in applications such as:
* File systems for:
** Directory structure used to organize subdirectories and files (symbolic links create non-tree graphs, as do multiple hard links to the same file or directory)
** The mechanism used to allocate and link blocks of data on the storage device
* Class hierarchy or &quot;inheritance tree&quot; showing the relationships among classes in object-oriented programming; multiple inheritance produces non-tree graphs
* Abstract syntax trees for computer languages
* Natural language processing:
** Parse trees
** Modeling utterances in a generative grammar
** Dialogue tree for generating conversations
* Document Object Models (&quot;DOM tree&quot;) of XML and HTML documents
* Search trees store data in a way that makes an efficient search algorithm possible via tree traversal
** A binary search tree is a type of binary tree
* Representing sorted lists of data
* Computer-generated imagery:
** Space partitioning, including binary space partitioning 
** Digital compositing
* Storing Barnes–Hut trees used to simulate galaxies
* Implementing heaps
* Nested set collections
* Hierarchical taxonomies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification with sections of increasing specificity.
* Hierarchical temporal memory
* Genetic programming
* Hierarchical clustering

Trees can be used to represent and manipulate various mathematical structures, such as:
* Paths through an arbitrary node-and-edge graph (including multigraphs), by making multiple nodes in the tree for each graph node used in multiple paths
* Any mathematical hierarchy

Tree structures are often used for mapping the relationships between things, such as:
* Components and subcomponents which can be visualized in an exploded-view drawing
* Subroutine calls used to identify which subroutines in a program call other subroutines non recursively
* Inheritance of DNA among species by evolution, of source code by software projects (e.g. Linux distribution timeline), of designs in various types of cars, etc.
* The contents of hierarchical namespaces

JSON and YAML documents can be thought of as trees, but are typically represented by nested lists and dictionaries.

==Terminology==
A node is a structure which may contain data and connections to other nodes, sometimes called edges or links. Each node in a tree has zero or more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are drawn with &quot;descendants&quot; going downwards). A node that has a child is called the child&#x27;s parent node (or superior). All nodes have exactly one parent, except the topmost root node, which has none. A node might have many ancestor nodes, such as the parent&#x27;s parent. Child nodes with the same parent are sibling nodes. Typically siblings have an order, with the first one conventionally drawn on the left. Some definitions allow a tree to have no nodes at all, in which case it is called &quot;empty&quot;.

An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any node that does not have child nodes.

The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its &quot;root path&quot;). Thus the root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such are allowed) has height −1.

Each non-root node can be treated as the root node of its own subtree, which includes that node and all its descendants.

==Examples of trees and non-trees==

==Common operations==
* Enumerating all the items
* Enumerating a section of a tree
* Searching for an item
* Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree
* Deleting an item
* Pruning: Removing a whole section of a tree
* Grafting: Adding a whole section to a tree
* Finding the root for any node
* Finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes

===Traversal and search methods===

Stepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between parents and children, is called walking the tree, and the action is a &quot;walk&quot; of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before its children is called a pre-order walk; a walk in which the children are traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a post-order walk; a walk in which a node&#x27;s left subtree, then the node itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in-order traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a binary tree.) A level-order walk effectively performs a breadth-first search over the entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until all nodes in the tree have been traversed.

==Representations==

There are many different ways to represent trees. In working memory, nodes are typically dynamically allocated records with pointers to their children, their parents, or both, as well as any associated data. If of a fixed size, the nodes might be stored in a list. Nodes and relationships between nodes might be stored in a separate special type of adjacency list. In relational databases, nodes are typically represented as table rows, with indexed row IDs facilitating pointers between parents and children.

Nodes can also be stored as items in an array, with relationships between them determined by their positions in the array (as in a binary heap).

A binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists: the head of a list (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree). This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions, where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.

Ordered trees can be naturally encoded by finite sequences, for example with natural numbers.

==Type theory==

As an abstract data type, the abstract tree type with values of some type is defined, using the abstract forest type (list of trees), by the functions:
: value: → 
: children: → 
: nil: () → 
: node: × → 

with the axioms:
: value(node(, )) = 
: children(node(, )) = 

In terms of type theory, a tree is an inductive type defined by the constructors (empty forest) and (tree with root node with given value and children).

==Mathematical terminology==

Viewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an ordered tree, generally with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be non-empty):
* A rooted tree with the &quot;away from root&quot; direction (a more narrow term is an &quot;arborescence&quot;), meaning:
** A directed graph,
** whose underlying undirected graph is a tree (any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path),
** with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),
** which determines the direction on the edges (arrows point away from the root; given an edge, the node that the edge points from is called the &quot;parent&quot; and the node that the edge points to is called the &quot;child&quot;), together with:
* an ordering on the child nodes of a given node, and
* a value (of some data type) at each node.

Often trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) branching factor (outdegree), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty, hence &quot;at most&quot; two &quot;non-empty&quot; child nodes), hence a &quot;binary tree&quot;.

Allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are allowed the above definition instead becomes &quot;an empty tree or a rooted tree such that ...&quot;. On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree (possibly empty).

<text>In mathematics, the tangent space of a manifold is a generalization of to curves in two-dimensional space and to surfaces in three-dimensional space in higher dimensions. In the context of physics the tangent space to a manifold at a point can be viewed as the space of possible velocities for a particle moving on the manifold.

== Informal description ==

In differential geometry, one can attach to every point formula_1 of a differentiable manifold a &quot;tangent space&quot;—a real vector space that intuitively contains the possible directions in which one can tangentially pass through formula_1. The elements of the tangent space at formula_1 are called the &quot;tangent vectors&quot; at formula_1. This is a generalization of the notion of a vector, based at a given initial point, in a Euclidean space. The dimension of the tangent space at every point of a connected manifold is the same as that of the manifold itself.

For example, if the given manifold is a formula_5-sphere, then one can picture the tangent space at a point as the plane that touches the sphere at that point and is perpendicular to the sphere&#x27;s radius through the point. More generally, if a given manifold is thought of as an embedded submanifold of Euclidean space, then one can picture a tangent space in this literal fashion. This was the traditional approach toward defining parallel transport. Many authors in differential geometry and general relativity use it. More strictly, this defines an affine tangent space, which is distinct from the space of tangent vectors described by modern terminology.

In algebraic geometry, in contrast, there is an intrinsic definition of the &quot;tangent space at a point&quot; of an algebraic variety formula_6 that gives a vector space with dimension at least that of formula_6 itself. The points formula_8 at which the dimension of the tangent space is exactly that of formula_6 are called &quot;non-singular&quot; points; the others are called &quot;singular&quot; points. For example, a curve that crosses itself does not have a unique tangent line at that point. The singular points of formula_6 are those where the &quot;test to be a manifold&quot; fails. See Zariski tangent space.

Once the tangent spaces of a manifold have been introduced, one can define vector fields, which are abstractions of the velocity field of particles moving in space. A vector field attaches to every point of the manifold a vector from the tangent space at that point, in a smooth manner. Such a vector field serves to define a generalized ordinary differential equation on a manifold: A solution to such a differential equation is a differentiable curve on the manifold whose derivative at any point is equal to the tangent vector attached to that point by the vector field.

All the tangent spaces of a manifold may be &quot;glued together&quot; to form a new differentiable manifold with twice the dimension of the original manifold, called the &quot;tangent bundle&quot; of the manifold.

== Formal definitions ==

The informal description above relies on a manifold&#x27;s ability to be embedded into an ambient vector space formula_11 so that the tangent vectors can &quot;stick out&quot; of the manifold into the ambient space. However, it is more convenient to define the notion of a tangent space based solely on the manifold itself.

There are various equivalent ways of defining the tangent spaces of a manifold. While the definition via the velocity of curves is intuitively the simplest, it is also the most cumbersome to work with. More elegant and abstract approaches are described below.

=== Definition via tangent curves ===

In the embedded-manifold picture, a tangent vector at a point formula_1 is thought of as the &quot;velocity&quot; of a curve passing through the point formula_1. We can therefore define a tangent vector as an equivalence class of curves passing through formula_1 while being tangent to each other at formula_1.

Suppose that formula_16 is a formula_17 differentiable manifold (with smoothness formula_18) and that formula_19. Pick a coordinate chart formula_20, where formula_21 is an open subset of formula_16 containing formula_1. Suppose further that two curves formula_24 with formula_25 are given such that both formula_26 are differentiable in the ordinary sense (we call these &quot;differentiable curves initialized at formula_1&quot;). Then formula_28 and formula_29 are said to be &quot;equivalent&quot; at formula_30 if and only if the derivatives of formula_31 and formula_32 at formula_30 coincide. This defines an equivalence relation on the set of all differentiable curves initialized at formula_1, and equivalence classes of such curves are known as &quot;tangent vectors&quot; of formula_16 at formula_1. The equivalence class of any such curve formula_37 is denoted by formula_38. The &quot;tangent space&quot; of formula_16 at formula_1, denoted by formula_41, is then defined as the set of all tangent vectors at formula_1; it does not depend on the choice of coordinate chart formula_20.

To define vector-space operations on formula_41, we use a chart formula_20 and define a map formula_46 by formula_47 where formula_48. The map formula_49 turns out to be bijective and may be used to transfer the vector-space operations on formula_50 over to formula_41, thus turning the latter set into an formula_52-dimensional real vector space. Again, one needs to check that this construction does not depend on the particular chart formula_20 and the curve formula_37 being used, and in fact it does not.

=== Definition via derivations ===

Suppose now that formula_16 is a formula_56 manifold. A real-valued function formula_57 is said to belong to formula_58 if and only if for every coordinate chart formula_20, the map formula_60 is infinitely differentiable. Note that formula_58 is a real associative algebra with respect to the pointwise product and sum of functions and scalar multiplication.

A &quot;derivation&quot; at formula_19 is defined as a linear map formula_63 that satisfies the Leibniz identity
formula_64
which is modeled on the product rule of calculus.

(For every identically constant function formula_65 it follows that formula_66).

Denote formula_41 the set of all derivations at formula_68 Setting
* formula_69 and
* formula_70
turns formula_41 into a vector space.

==== Generalizations ====
Generalizations of this definition are possible, for instance, to complex manifolds and algebraic varieties. However, instead of examining derivations formula_72 from the full algebra of functions, one must instead work at the level of germs of functions. The reason for this is that the structure sheaf may not be fine for such structures. For example, let formula_73 be an algebraic variety with structure sheaf formula_74. Then the Zariski tangent space at a point formula_75 is the collection of all formula_76-derivations formula_77, where formula_76 is the ground field and formula_79 is the stalk of formula_74 at formula_8.

=== Equivalence of the definitions ===
For formula_82 and a differentiable curve formula_83 such that formula_84 define formula_85 (where the derivative is taken in the ordinary sense because formula_86 is a function from formula_87 to formula_88). One can ascertain that formula_89 is a derivation at the point formula_90 and that equivalent curves yield the same derivation. Thus, for an equivalence class formula_91 we can define formula_92 where the curve formula_48 has been chosen arbitrarily. The map formula_94 is a vector space isomorphism between the space of the equivalence classes formula_38 and that of the derivations at the point formula_96

=== Definition via cotangent spaces === 

Again, we start with a formula_97 manifold formula_16 and a point formula_19. Consider the ideal formula_100 of formula_101 that consists of all smooth functions formula_102 vanishing at formula_1, i.e., formula_104. Then formula_100 and formula_106 are both real vector spaces, and the quotient space formula_107 can be shown to be isomorphic to the cotangent space formula_108 through the use of Taylor&#x27;s theorem. The tangent space formula_109 may then be defined as the dual space of formula_107.

While this definition is the most abstract, it is also the one that is most easily transferable to other settings, for instance, to the varieties considered in algebraic geometry.

If formula_72 is a derivation at formula_1, then formula_113 for every formula_114, which means that formula_72 gives rise to a linear map formula_116. Conversely, if formula_117 is a linear map, then formula_118 defines a derivation at formula_1. This yields an equivalence between tangent spaces defined via derivations and tangent spaces defined via cotangent spaces.

== Properties ==

If formula_16 is an open subset of formula_50, then formula_16 is a formula_56 manifold in a natural manner (take coordinate charts to be identity maps on open subsets of formula_50), and the tangent spaces are all naturally identified with formula_50.

=== Tangent vectors as directional derivatives ===

Another way to think about tangent vectors is as directional derivatives. Given a vector formula_126 in formula_50, one defines the corresponding directional derivative at a point formula_128 by
:formula_129
This map is naturally a derivation at formula_1. Furthermore, every derivation at a point in formula_50 is of this form. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between vectors (thought of as tangent vectors at a point) and derivations at a point.

As tangent vectors to a general manifold at a point can be defined as derivations at that point, it is natural to think of them as directional derivatives. Specifically, if formula_126 is a tangent vector to formula_16 at a point formula_1 (thought of as a derivation), then define the directional derivative formula_135 in the direction formula_126 by
:formula_137
If we think of formula_126 as the initial velocity of a differentiable curve formula_37 initialized at formula_1, i.e., formula_141, then instead, define formula_135 by
:formula_143

=== Basis of the tangent space at a point ===

For a formula_56 manifold formula_16, if a chart formula_146 is given with formula_147, then one can define an ordered basis formula_148 of formula_149 by
:formula_150
Then for every tangent vector formula_151, one has
:formula_152
This formula therefore expresses formula_126 as a linear combination of the basis tangent vectors formula_154 defined by the coordinate chart formula_20.

=== The derivative of a map ===

Every smooth (or differentiable) map formula_156 between smooth (or differentiable) manifolds induces natural linear maps between their corresponding tangent spaces:
:formula_157
If the tangent space is defined via differentiable curves, then this map is defined by
:formula_158
If, instead, the tangent space is defined via derivations, then this map is defined by
:formula_159

The linear map formula_49 is called variously the &quot;derivative&quot;, &quot;total derivative&quot;, &quot;differential&quot;, or &quot;pushforward&quot; of formula_161 at formula_1. It is frequently expressed using a variety of other notations:
:formula_163
In a sense, the derivative is the best linear approximation to formula_161 near formula_1. Note that when formula_166, then the map formula_167 coincides with the usual notion of the differential of the function formula_161. In local coordinates the derivative of formula_161 is given by the Jacobian.

An important result regarding the derivative map is the following:

This is a generalization of the inverse function theorem to maps between manifolds.

<text>The Tao or Dao is the natural way of the universe, primarily as conceived in East Asian philosophy and religion. This seeing of life cannot be grasped as a concept. Rather, it is seen through actual living experience of one&#x27;s everyday being. The concept is represented by the Chinese character , which has meanings including &#x27;way&#x27;, &#x27;path&#x27;, &#x27;road&#x27;, and sometimes &#x27;doctrine&#x27; or &#x27;principle&#x27;. 

In the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, the ancient philosopher Laozi explains that the Tao is not a name for a thing, but the underlying natural order of the universe whose ultimate essence is difficult to circumscribe because it is non-conceptual yet evident in one&#x27;s being of aliveness. The Tao is &quot;eternally nameless&quot; and should be distinguished from the countless named things that are considered to be its manifestations, the reality of life before its descriptions of it.

== Description and uses of the concept ==
The word &quot;Tao&quot; has a variety of meanings in both the ancient and modern Chinese language. Aside from its purely prosaic use meaning road, channel, path, principle, or similar, the word has acquired a variety of differing and often confusing metaphorical, philosophical, and religious uses. In most belief systems, the word is used symbolically in its sense of &quot;way&quot; as the right or proper way of existence, or in the context of ongoing practices of attainment or of the full coming into being, or the state of enlightenment or spiritual perfection that is the outcome of such practices.

Some scholars make sharp distinctions between the moral or ethical usage of the word &quot;Tao&quot; that is prominent in Confucianism and religious Taoism and the more metaphysical usage of the term used in philosophical Taoism and most forms of Mahayana Buddhism; others maintain that these are not separate usages or meanings, seeing them as mutually inclusive and compatible approaches to defining the principle. The original use of the term was as a form of praxis rather than theory—a term used as a convention to refer to something that otherwise cannot be discussed in words—and early writings such as the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and &quot;I Ching&quot; make pains to distinguish between &quot;conceptions of&quot; the Tao (sometimes referred to as &quot;named Tao&quot;) and the Tao itself (the &quot;unnamed Tao&quot;), which cannot be expressed or understood in language. Liu Da asserts that the Tao is properly understood as an experiential and evolving concept and that there are not only cultural and religious differences in the interpretation of the Tao but personal differences that reflect the character of individual practitioners.

The Tao can be roughly thought of as the &quot;flow of the universe&quot;, or as some essence or pattern behind the natural world that keeps the Universe balanced and ordered. It is related to qi, the essential energy of action and existence. The Tao is a non-dualistic principle—it is the greater whole from which all the individual elements of the Universe derive. Catherine Keller considers it similar to the negative theology of Western scholars, but the Tao is rarely an object of direct worship, being treated more like the Hindu concepts of karma, dharma, or &quot;Ṛta&quot; than as a divine object. The Tao is more commonly expressed in the relationship between &quot;wu&quot; (void or emptiness, in the sense of &quot;wuji&quot;) and the natural, dynamic balance between opposites, leading to its central principle of &quot;wu wei&quot; (inaction or inexertion).

The Tao is usually described in terms of elements of nature, and in particular, as similar to water. Like water it is undifferentiated, endlessly self-replenishing, soft and quiet but immensely powerful, and impassively generous. The Song dynasty painter Chen Rong popularized the analogy with his painting &quot;Nine Dragons&quot;.

Much of Taoist philosophy centers on the cyclical continuity of the natural world and its contrast to the linear, goal-oriented actions of human beings, as well as the perception that the Tao is &quot;the source of all being, in which life and death are the same.&quot;

In all its uses, the Tao is considered to have ineffable qualities that prevent it from being defined or expressed in words. It can, however, be &quot;known&quot; or &quot;experienced&quot;, and its principles (which can be discerned by observing nature) can be followed or practiced. Much of East Asian philosophical writing focuses on the value of adhering to the principles of the Tao and the various consequences of failing to do so.
The Tao was shared with Confucianism, Chan Buddhism and Zen, and more broadly throughout East Asian philosophy and religion in general. In Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, and Confucianism, the object of spiritual practice is to &quot;become one with the Tao&quot; (&quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;) or to harmonize one&#x27;s will with nature to achieve &#x27;effortless action&#x27;. This involves meditative and moral practices. Important in this respect is the Taoist concept of &quot;de&quot; (&#x27;virtue&#x27;). In Confucianism and religious forms of Taoism, these are often explicitly moral/ethical arguments about proper behavior, while Buddhism and more philosophical forms of Taoism usually refer to the natural and mercurial outcomes of action (comparable to karma). The Tao is intrinsically related to the concepts of yin and yang, where every action creates counter-actions as unavoidable movements within manifestations of the Tao, and proper practice variously involves accepting, conforming to, or working with these natural developments.

In Taoism and Confucianism, the Tao was sometimes traditionally seen as a &quot;transcendent power that blesses&quot; that can &quot;express itself directly&quot; through various ways, but most often shows itself through the speech, movement, or traditional ritual of a &quot;prophet, priest, or king.&quot; Tao can serve as a life energy instead of qi in some Taoist belief systems.

===&quot;De&quot;===
&quot;De&quot; () is the term generally used to refer to proper adherence to the Tao. &quot;De&quot; is the active living or cultivation of the way. Particular things (things with names) that manifest from the Tao have their own inner nature that they follow in accordance with the Tao, and the following of this inner nature is &quot;De&quot;. &quot;Wu wei&quot;, or &#x27;naturalness&#x27;, is contingent on understanding and conforming to this inner nature, which is interpreted variously from a personal, individual nature to a more generalized notion of human nature within the greater Universe.

Historically, the concept of De differed significantly between Taoists and Confucianists. Confucianism was largely a moral system emphasizing the values of humaneness, righteousness, and filial duty, and so conceived De in terms of obedience to rigorously defined and codified social rules. Taoists took a broader, more naturalistic, more metaphysical view on the relationship between humankind and the Universe and considered social rules to be at best a derivative reflection of the natural and spontaneous interactions between people and at worst calcified structure that inhibited naturalness and created conflict. This led to some philosophical and political conflicts between Taoists and Confucians. Several sections of the works attributed to Zhuang Zhou are dedicated to critiques of the failures of Confucianism.

==Interpretations==

===Taoism===
The translator Arthur Waley observed that
[Tao] means a road, path, way; and hence, the way in which one does something; method, doctrine, principle. The Way of Heaven, for example, is ruthless; when autumn comes &#x27;no leaf is spared because of its beauty, no flower because of its fragrance&#x27;. The Way of Man means, among other things, procreation; and eunuchs are said to be &#x27;far from the Way of Man&#x27;. &quot;Chu Tao&quot; is &#x27;the way to be a monarch&#x27;, i.e. the art of ruling. Each school of philosophy has its &quot;tao&quot;, its doctrine of the way in which life should be ordered. Finally in a particular school of philosophy whose followers came to be called Taoists, &quot;tao&quot; meant &#x27;the way the universe works&#x27;; and ultimately something very like God, in the more abstract and philosophical sense of that term.

&quot;Tao&quot; gives Taoism its name in English, in both its philosophical and religious forms. The Tao is the fundamental and central concept of these schools of thought. Taoism perceives the Tao as a natural order underlying the substance and activity of the Universe. Language and the &quot;naming&quot; of the Tao is regarded negatively in Taoism; the Tao fundamentally exists and operates outside the realm of differentiation and linguistic constraints.

There is no single orthodox Taoist view of the Tao. All forms of Taoism center around Tao and De, but there is a broad variety of distinct interpretations among sects and even individuals in the same sect. Despite this diversity, there are some clear, common patterns and trends in Taoism and its branches.

The diversity of Taoist interpretations of the Tao can be seen across four texts representative of major streams of thought in Taoism. All four texts are used in modern Taoism with varying acceptance and emphasis among sects. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; is the oldest text and representative of a speculative and philosophical approach to the Tao. The &quot;Daotilun&quot; is an eighth century exegesis of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, written from a well-educated and religious viewpoint that represents the traditional, scholarly perspective. The devotional perspective of the Tao is expressed in the &quot;Qingjing Jing&quot;, a liturgical text that was originally composed during the Han dynasty and is used as a hymnal in religious Taoism, especially among eremites. The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; uses literary devices such as tales, allegories, and narratives to relate the Tao to the reader, illustrating a metaphorical method of viewing and expressing the Tao.
The forms and variations of religious Taoism are incredibly diverse. They integrate a broad spectrum of academic, ritualistic, supernatural, devotional, literary, and folk practices with a multitude of results. Buddhism and Confucianism particularly affected the way many sects of Taoism framed, approached, and perceived the Tao. The multitudinous branches of religious Taoism accordingly regard the Tao, and interpret writings about it, in innumerable ways. Thus, outside of a few broad similarities, it is difficult to provide an accurate yet clear summary of their interpretation of the Tao.

A central tenet in most varieties of religious Taoism is that the Tao is ever-present, but must be manifested, cultivated, and/or perfected to be realized. It is the source of the Universe, and the seed of its primordial purity resides in all things. Breathing exercises, according to some Taoists, allowed one to absorb &quot;parts of the universe.&quot; Incense and certain minerals were seen as representing the greater universe as well, and breathing them in could create similar effects. The manifestation of the Tao is &quot;de&quot;, which rectifies and invigorates the world with the Tao&#x27;s radiance.

Alternatively, philosophical Taoism regards the Tao as a non-religious concept; it is not a deity to be worshiped, nor is it a mystical Absolute in the religious sense of the Hindu brahman. Joseph Wu remarked of this conception of the Tao, &quot;Dao is not religiously available; nor is it even religiously relevant.&quot; The writings of Laozi and Zhuangzi are tinged with esoteric tones and approach humanism and naturalism as paradoxes. In contrast to the esotericism typically found in religious systems, the Tao is not transcendent to the self, nor is mystical attainment an escape from the world in philosophical Taoism. The self steeped in the Tao is the self grounded in its place within the natural Universe. A person dwelling within the Tao excels in themselves and their activities.
However, this distinction is complicated by hermeneutic difficulties in the categorization of Taoist schools, sects, and movements.

Some Taoists believe the Tao is an entity that can &quot;take on human form&quot; to perform its goals.

The Tao represents human harmony with the universe and even more phenomena in the world and nature.

===Confucianism===
The Tao of Confucius can be translated as &#x27;truth&#x27;. Confucianism regards the Way, or Truth, as concordant with a particular approach to life, politics, and tradition. It is held as equally necessary and well regarded as &quot;de&quot; and &quot;ren&quot; (&#x27;compassion&#x27;, &#x27;humanity&#x27;). Confucius presents a humanistic Tao. He only rarely speaks of the &#x27;Way of Heaven&#x27;. The early Confucian philosopher Xunzi explicitly noted this contrast. Though he acknowledged the existence and celestial importance of the Way of Heaven, he insisted that the Tao principally concerns human affairs.

As a formal religious concept in Confucianism, Tao is the Absolute toward which the faithful move. In &quot;Zhongyong&quot; (The Doctrine of the Mean), harmony with the Absolute is the equivalent to integrity and sincerity. The &quot;Great Learning&quot; expands on this concept explaining that the Way illuminates virtue, improves the people, and resides within the purest morality. During the Tang dynasty, Han Yu further formalized and defined Confucian beliefs as an apologetic response to Buddhism. He emphasized the ethics of the Way. He explicitly paired &quot;Tao&quot; and &quot;De&quot;, focusing on humane nature and righteousness. He also framed and elaborated on a &quot;tradition of the Tao&quot; in order to reject the traditions of Buddhism.

Ancestors and the Mandate of Heaven were thought to emanate from the Tao, especially during the Song dynasty.

===Buddhism===
Buddhism first started to spread in China during the first century AD and was experiencing a golden age of growth and maturation by the fourth century AD. Hundreds of collections of Pali and Sanskrit texts were translated into Chinese by Buddhist monks within a short period of time. &quot;Dhyana&quot; was translated as , and later as &quot;zen&quot;, giving Zen Buddhism its name. The use of Chinese concepts, such as the Tao, that were close to Buddhist ideas and terms helped spread the religion and make it more amenable to the Chinese people. However, the differences between the Sanskrit and Chinese terminology led to some initial misunderstandings and the eventual development of Buddhism in East Asia as a distinct entity. As part of this process, many Chinese words introduced their rich semantic and philosophical associations into Buddhism, including the use of &quot;Tao&quot; for central concepts and tenets of Buddhism.

Pai-chang Huai-hai told a student who was grappling with difficult portions of &quot;suttas&quot;, &quot;Take up words in order to manifest meaning and you&#x27;ll obtain &#x27;meaning&#x27;. Cut off words and meaning is emptiness. Emptiness is the Tao. The Tao is cutting off words and speech.&quot; Zen Buddhists regard the Tao as synonymous with both the Buddhist Path and the results of it, the Noble Eightfold Path and Buddhist enlightenment. Pai-chang&#x27;s statement plays upon this usage in the context of the fluid and varied Chinese usage of &quot;Tao&quot;. Words and meanings are used to refer to rituals and practices. The &quot;emptiness&quot; refers to the Buddhist concept of &quot;sunyata&quot;. Finding the Tao and Buddha-nature is not simply a matter of formulations, but an active response to the Four Noble Truths that cannot be fully expressed or conveyed in words and concrete associations. The use of &quot;Tao&quot; in this context refers to the literal &quot;way&quot; of Buddhism, the return to the universal source, dharma, proper meditation, and nirvana, among other associations. &quot;Tao&quot; is commonly used in this fashion by Chinese Buddhists, heavy with associations and nuanced meanings.

===Neo-Confucianism===
During the Song dynasty, neo-Confucians regarded the Tao as the purest thing-in-itself. Shao Yong regarded the Tao as the origin of heaven, earth, and everything within them. In contrast, Zhang Zai presented a vitalistic Tao that was the fundamental component or effect of qi, the motive energy behind life and the world. A number of later scholars adopted this interpretation, such as Tai Chen during the Qing dynasty.

Zhu Xi, Cheng Ho, and Cheng Yi perceived the Tao in the context of &quot;li&quot; (&#x27;principle&#x27;) and &quot;t&#x27;ien li&quot; (&#x27;principle of Heaven&#x27;). Cheng Hao regarded the fundamental matter of &quot;li&quot;, and thus the Tao, to be humaneness. Developing compassion, altruism, and other humane virtues is following of the Way. Cheng Yi followed this interpretation, elaborating on this perspective of the Tao through teachings about interactions between yin and yang, the cultivation and preservation of life, and the axiom of a morally just universe.

On the whole, the Tao is equated with totality. Wang Fuzhi expressed the Tao as the &quot;taiji&quot;, or &#x27;great ultimate&#x27;, as well as the road leading to it. Nothing exists apart from the Principle of Heaven in Neo-Confucianism. The Way is contained within all things. Thus, the religious life is not an elite or special journey for Neo-Confucians. The normal, mundane life is the path that leads to the Absolute, because the Absolute is contained within the mundane objects and events of daily life.

=== Chinese folklore ===
Yayu, the son of Zhulong who was reincarnated on Earth as a violent hybrid between a bull, a tiger, and a dragon, was allowed to go to an afterlife that was known as &quot;the place beyond the Tao&quot;. This shows that some Chinese folk storytelling and mythological traditions had very differing interpretations of the Tao between each other and orthodox religious practices.

===Christianity===
Noted Christian author C.S. Lewis used the word Tao to describe &quot;the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, the kind of thing the Universe is and the kind of things we are.&quot; He asserted that every religion and philosophy contains foundations of universal ethics as an attempt to line up with the Tao—the way mankind was designed to be. In Lewis&#x27;s thinking, God created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of Jesus Christ.

Similarly, Eastern Orthodox hegumen Damascene (Christensen), a pupil of noted monastic and scholar of East Asian religions Seraphim Rose, identified &quot;logos&quot; with the Tao. Damascene published a full commented translation of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; under the title &quot;Christ the Eternal Tao&quot;.

In some Chinese translations of the New Testament, the word (&quot;logos&quot;) is translated as , in passages such as John 1:1, indicating that the translators considered the concept of Tao to be somewhat equivalent to the Hellenic concept of &quot;logos&quot; in Platonism and Christianity.

== Linguistic aspects ==

The Chinese character is highly polysemous: its historical alternate pronunciation as possessed an additional connotation of &#x27;guide&#x27;. The history of the character includes details of orthography and semantics, as well as a possible Proto-Indo-European etymology, in addition to more recent loaning into English and other world languages.

===Orthography===

&quot;Tao&quot; is written with the Chinese character using both traditional and simplified characters. The traditional graphical interpretation of dates back to the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; dictionary published in 121 CE, which describes it as a rare &quot;compound ideogram&quot; or &quot;ideographic compound&quot;. According to the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, combines the &#x27;go&#x27; radical (a variant of ) with . This construction signified a &quot;head going&quot; or &quot;leading the way&quot;.

&quot;Tao&quot; is graphically distinguished between its earliest nominal meaning of &#x27;way&#x27;, &#x27;road&#x27;, &#x27;path&#x27;, and the later verbal sense of &#x27;say&#x27;. It should also be contrasted with . The simplified character for has in place of .

The earliest written forms of &quot;Tao&quot; are bronzeware script and seal script characters from the Zhou dynasty (1045–256 BCE) bronzes and writings. These ancient forms more clearly depict the element as hair above a face. Some variants interchange the &#x27;go&#x27; radical with , with the original bronze &quot;crossroads&quot; depiction written in the seal character with two and .

Bronze scripts for occasionally include an element of or , which occurs in . The linguist Peter A. Boodberg explained,
This &quot;&quot;tao&quot; with the hand element&quot; is usually identified with the modern character &quot;tao&quot; &lt; &quot;d&#x27;ôg&quot;, &#x27;to lead,&#x27;, &#x27;guide&#x27;, &#x27;conduct&#x27;, and considered to be a &quot;derivative&quot; or verbal cognate of the noun &quot;tao&quot;, &quot;way,&quot; &quot;path.&quot; The evidence just summarized would indicate rather that &quot;&quot;tao&quot; with the hand&quot; is but a &quot;variant&quot; of the basic &quot;tao&quot; and that the word itself combined both nominal and verbal aspects of the etymon. This is supported by textual examples of the use of the primary &quot;tao&quot; in the verbal sense &quot;to lead&quot; (e. g., &quot;Analects&quot; 1.5; 2.8) and seriously undermines the unspoken assumption implied in the common translation of Tao as &quot;way&quot; that the concept is essentially a nominal one. Tao would seem, then, to be etymologically a more dynamic concept than we have made it translation-wise. It would be more appropriately rendered by &quot;lead way&quot; and &quot;lode&quot; (&quot;way,&quot; &quot;course,&quot; &quot;journey,&quot; &quot;leading,&quot; &quot;guidance&quot;; cf. &quot;lodestone&quot; and &quot;lodestar&quot;), the somewhat obsolescent deverbal noun from &quot;to lead.&quot;
These Confucian &quot;Analects&quot; citations of &quot;dao&quot; verbally meaning &#x27;to guide&#x27;, &#x27;to lead&#x27; are: &quot;The Master said, &#x27;In guiding a state of a thousand chariots, approach your duties with reverence and be trustworthy in what you say&quot; and &quot;The Master said, &#x27;Guide them by edicts, keep them in line with punishments, and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame.&quot;

===Phonology===
In modern Standard Chinese, &#x27;s two primary pronunciations are tonally differentiated between falling tone and dipping tone (usually written as ).

Besides the common specifications and (with variant ), has a rare additional pronunciation with the level tone, , seen in the regional &quot;chengyu&quot; , a reduplication of and from northeast China.

In Middle Chinese () tone name categories, and were and . Historical linguists have reconstructed and as and (Bernhard Karlgren), and and , and (William H. Baxter), and and .

In Old Chinese () pronunciations, reconstructions for and are (Karlgren), (Zhou), and , , and and .

===Semantics===
The word has many meanings. For example, the &quot;Hanyu Da Zidian&quot; dictionary defines 39 meanings for and 6 for .

John DeFrancis&#x27;s Chinese-English dictionary gives twelve meanings for , three for , and one for . Note that brackets clarify abbreviations and ellipsis marks omitted usage examples.

===Etymology===
The etymological linguistic origins of &quot;dao&quot; &quot;way; path&quot; depend upon its Old Chinese pronunciation, which scholars have tentatively reconstructed as *&quot;d&#x27;ôg&quot;, *&quot;dəgwx&quot;, *&quot;dəw&quot;, *&quot;luʔ&quot;, and *&quot;lûʔ&quot;.

Boodberg noted that the &quot;shou&quot; &quot;head&quot; phonetic in the &quot;dao&quot; character was not merely phonetic but &quot;etymonic&quot;, analogous with English &quot;to head&quot; meaning &quot;to lead&quot; and &quot;to tend in a certain direction,&quot; &quot;ahead,&quot; &quot;headway&quot;.
Paronomastically, &quot;tao&quot; is equated with its homonym &quot;tao&quot; &lt; &quot;d&#x27;ôg&quot;, &quot;to trample,&quot; &quot;tread,&quot; and from that point of view it is nothing more than a &quot;treadway,&quot; &quot;headtread,&quot; or &quot;foretread &quot;; it is also occasionally associated with a near synonym (and possible cognate) &quot;ti&quot; &lt; &quot;d&#x27;iôk&quot;, &quot;follow a road,&quot; &quot;go along,&quot; &quot;lead,&quot; &quot;direct&quot;; &quot;pursue the right path&quot;; a term with definite ethical overtones and a graph with an exceedingly interesting phonetic, &quot;yu&quot; &lt; &quot;djôg&quot;,&quot; &quot;to proceed from.&quot; The reappearance of C162 [] &quot;walk&quot; in &quot;ti&quot; with the support of C157 [] &quot;foot&quot; in &quot;tao&quot;, &quot;to trample,&quot; &quot;tread,&quot; should perhaps serve us as a warning not to overemphasize the headworking functions implied in &quot;tao&quot; in preference to those of the lower extremities.

Victor H. Mair proposes a connection with Proto-Indo-European &quot;drogh&quot;, supported by numerous cognates in Indo-European languages, as well as semantically similar Semitic Arabic and Hebrew words.
The archaic pronunciation of Tao sounded approximately like &quot;drog&quot; or &quot;dorg&quot;. This links it to the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;drogh&quot; (to run along) and Indo-European &quot;dhorg&quot; (way, movement). Related words in a few modern Indo-European languages are Russian &quot;doroga&quot; (way, road), Polish &quot;droga&quot; (way, road), Czech &quot;dráha&quot; (way, track), Serbo-Croatian &quot;draga&quot; (path through a valley), and Norwegian dialect &quot;drog&quot; (trail of animals; valley). ... The nearest Sanskrit (Old Indian) cognates to Tao (&quot;drog&quot;) are &quot;dhrajas&quot; (course, motion) and &quot;dhraj&quot; (course). The most closely related English words are &quot;track&quot; and &quot;trek&quot;, while &quot;trail&quot; and &quot;tract&quot; are derived from other cognate Indo-European roots. Following the Way, then, is like going on a cosmic trek. Even more unexpected than the panoply of Indo-European cognates for Tao (&quot;drog&quot;) is the Hebrew root &quot;d-r-g&quot; for the same word and Arabic &quot;t-r-q&quot;, which yields words meaning &quot;track, path, way, way of doing things&quot; and is important in Islamic philosophical discourse.

Axel Schuessler&#x27;s etymological dictionary presents two possibilities for the tonal morphology of &quot;dào&quot; &quot;road; way; method&quot; &lt; Middle Chinese &quot;dâu&quot;B &lt; Old Chinese *&quot;lûʔ&quot; and &quot;dào&quot; or &quot;to go along; bring along; conduct; explain; talk about&quot; &lt; Middle &quot;dâu&quot;C &lt; Old *&quot;lûh&quot;. Either &quot;dào&quot; &quot;the thing which is doing the conducting&quot; is a Tone B (&quot;shangsheng&quot; &quot;rising tone&quot;) &quot;endoactive noun&quot; derivation from &quot;dào&quot; &quot;conduct&quot;, or &quot;dào&quot; is a Later Old Chinese (Warring States period) &quot;general tone C&quot; (&quot;qusheng&quot; &quot;departing tone&quot;) derivation from &quot;dào&quot; &quot;way&quot;. For a possible etymological connection, Schuessler notes the ancient &quot;Fangyan&quot; dictionary defines &quot;yu&quot; &lt; *&quot;lokh&quot; and &quot;lu&quot; &lt; *&quot;lu&quot; as Eastern Qi State dialectal words meaning &quot;dào&quot; &lt; *&quot;lûʔ&quot; &quot;road&quot;.

===Other languages===
Many languages have borrowed and adapted &quot;Tao&quot; as a loanword.

In Chinese, this character is pronounced as Cantonese &quot;dou6&quot; and Hokkian &quot;to7&quot;. In Sino-Xenic languages, is pronounced as Japanese &quot;dō&quot;, &quot;tō&quot;, or &quot;michi&quot;; Korean &quot;do&quot; or &quot;to&quot;; and Vietnamese &quot;đạo&quot;.

Since 1982, when the International Organization for Standardization adopted Pinyin as the standard romanization of Chinese, many Western languages have changed from spelling this loanword &quot;tao&quot; in national systems (e.g., French EFEO Chinese transcription and English Wade–Giles) to &quot;dao&quot; in Pinyin.

The &quot;tao&quot;/&quot;dao&quot; &quot;the way&quot; English word of Chinese origin has three meanings, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.
1. a. In Taoism, an absolute entity which is the source of the universe; the way in which this absolute entity functions.
1. b. = &quot;Taoism&quot;, &quot;taoist&quot;
2. In Confucianism and in extended uses, the way to be followed, the right conduct; doctrine or method.
The earliest recorded usages were &quot;Tao&quot; (1736), &quot;Tau&quot; (1747), &quot;Taou&quot; (1831), and &quot;Dao&quot; (1971).

The term &quot;Taoist priest&quot; (), was used already by the Jesuits Matteo Ricci and Nicolas Trigault in their &quot;De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas&quot;, rendered as &quot;Tausu&quot; in the original Latin edition (1615), and &quot;Tausa&quot; in an early English translation published by Samuel Purchas (1625).

<doc id="30809" wikidata="Q210756" url="?curid=30809" title="The Thing (1982 film)">
<text>The Thing is a 1982 American science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter from a screenplay by Bill Lancaster. Based on the 1938 John W. Campbell Jr. novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;, it tells the story of a group of American researchers in Antarctica who encounter the eponymous &quot;Thing&quot;, an extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates, then imitates, other organisms. The group is overcome by paranoia and conflict as they learn that they can no longer trust each other and that any of them could be the Thing. The film stars Kurt Russell as the team&#x27;s helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady, with A. Wilford Brimley, T. K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas G. Waites in supporting roles.

Production began in the mid-1970s as a faithful adaptation of the novella, following 1951&#x27;s &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;. &quot;The Thing&quot; went through several directors and writers, each with different ideas on how to approach the story. Filming lasted roughly twelve weeks, beginning in August 1981, and took place on refrigerated sets in Los Angeles as well as in Juneau, Alaska, and Stewart, British Columbia. Of the film&#x27;s $15million budget, $1.5million was spent on Rob Bottin&#x27;s creature effects, a mixture of chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form.

&quot;The Thing&quot; was released in 1982 to negative reviews. Critics both praised the special effects achievements and criticized their visual repulsiveness, while others found the characters poorly realized. The film grossed $19.6million during its theatrical run. Many reasons have been cited for its failure to impress audiences: competition from films such as &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, which offered an optimistic view of alien visitation; a summer that had been filled with successful science fiction and fantasy films; and an audience living through a recession, diametrically opposed to &quot;The Thing&quot;″s nihilistic and bleak tone.

The film eventually found a cult following when it was released on home video and television, and it has since been reappraised as one of the best science fiction and horror films ever made. Numerous filmmakers have noted its influence on their work, and it has been referred to in other media such as television and video games. &quot;The Thing&quot; has spawned a variety of merchandiseincluding a 1982 novelization, comic book sequels, haunted house attractions, and board gamesas well as a video game of the same title and a 2011 prequel film of the same title.

==Plot==

In Antarctica, a Norwegian helicopter pursues a sled dog to an American research station. The Americans witness the passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter in addition to himself. The pilot fires a rifle and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burnt corpse of a malformed humanoid, which they transfer to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, autopsies the remains and finds a normal set of human organs.

Clark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs several of the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team, and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the Dog-Thing and surmises it is an organism that can perfectly imitate other life forms. Data recovered from the Norwegian base leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, which Norris estimates has been buried for over a hundred thousand years, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Blair grows paranoid after running a computer simulation that indicates the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The group implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation.

The remains of the malformed humanoid assimilate an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. The team also imprisons Blair in a tool shed after he sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. Copper suggests testing for infection by comparing the crew&#x27;s blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry&#x27;s leadership, and MacReady takes command. He, Windows, and Nauls find Fuchs&#x27; burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady&#x27;s shack. During their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack.

The team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack. As Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper&#x27;s arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life-form with its own survival instinct. He proposes testing blood samples from each survivor with a heated piece of wire and has each man restrained, but is forced to kill Clark after he lunges at MacReady with a scalpel. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood recoils from the heat. Exposed, the Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both.

Childs is left on guard while the others go to test Blair, but they find that he has escaped, and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer, which they destroy. Upon their return, Childs is missing, and the power generator is destroyed, leaving the men without heat. MacReady speculates that, with no escape left, the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls agree that the Thing cannot be allowed to escape and set explosives to destroy the station, but the Blair-Thing kills Garry, and Nauls disappears. The Blair-Thing transforms into an enormous creature and breaks the detonator, but MacReady triggers the explosives with a stick of dynamite, destroying the station.

While MacReady sits by the burning remnants, Childs returns, claiming he got lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share a bottle of Scotch whisky.

==Cast==

* Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, the helicopter pilot
* A. Wilford Brimley as Blair, the senior biologist
* T. K. Carter as Nauls, the cook
* David Clennon as Palmer, the assistant mechanic
* Keith David as Childs, the chief mechanic
* Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, the physician
* Charles Hallahan as Norris, the geologist
* Peter Maloney as George Bennings, the meteorologist
* Richard Masur as Clark, the dog handler
* Donald Moffat as Garry, the station commander
* Joel Polis as Fuchs, the assistant biologist
* Thomas Waites as Windows, the radio operator

&quot;The Thing&quot; also features Norbert Weisser as one of the Norwegians, and an uncredited dog, Jed, as the Dog-Thing. The only female presence in the film is the voice of MacReady&#x27;s chess computer, voiced by Carpenter&#x27;s then-wife, Adrienne Barbeau. Producer David Foster, associate producer Larry Franco, and writer Bill Lancaster, along with other members of the crew, make a cameo appearance in a recovered photograph of the Norwegian team. Camera operator Ray Stella stood in for the shots where needles were used to take blood, telling Carpenter that he could do it all day. Franco also played the Norwegian wielding a rifle and hanging out of the helicopter during the opening sequence. Stunt coordinator Dick Warlock also made a number of cameos in the film, most notably in an off-screen appearance as the shadow on the wall during the scene where the Dog-Thing enters one of the researcher&#x27;s living quarters. Clennon was originally intended to be in the scene, but due to his shadow being easily identifiable Carpenter decided to use Warlock instead. Warlock also played Palmer-Thing and stood in for Brimley in a few scenes that involved Blair.

==Production==
===Development===
Development of the film began in the mid-1970s when David Foster and fellow producer Lawrence Turman suggested to Universal Pictures an adaptation of the 1938 John W. Campbell novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;. It had been loosely adapted once before in Howard Hawks&#x27; and Christian Nyby&#x27;s 1951 film &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, but Foster and Turman wanted to develop a project that stuck more closely to the source material. Screenwriters Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins held the rights to make an adaptation, but passed on the opportunity to make a new film, so Universal obtained the rights from them. In 1976, Wilbur Stark had purchased the remake rights to 23 RKO Pictures films, including &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, from three Wall Street financiers who did not know what to do with them, in exchange for a return when the films were produced. Universal in turn acquired the rights to remake the film from Stark, resulting in him being given an executive producer credit on all print advertisements, posters, television commercials, and studio press material.

John Carpenter was first approached about the project in 1976 by co-producer and friend Stuart Cohen, but Carpenter was mainly an independent film director, so Universal chose &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974) director Tobe Hooper as they already had him under contract. The producers were ultimately unhappy with Hooper and his writing partner Kim Henkel&#x27;s concept. After several more failed pitches by different writers, and attempts to bring on other directors, such as John Landis, the project was put on hold. Even so, the success of Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 science fiction horror film &quot;Alien&quot; helped revitalize the project, at which point Carpenter became loosely attached following his success with his influential slasher film &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978).

Carpenter was reluctant to join the project, for he thought Hawks&#x27; adaptation would be difficult to surpass, although he considered the film&#x27;s monster to be unnotable. Cohen suggested that he read the original novella. Carpenter found the &quot;creepiness&quot; of the imitations conducted by the creature, and the questions it raised, interesting. He drew parallels between the novella and Agatha Christie&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1939), and noted that the story of &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; was &quot;timely&quot; for him, meaning he could make it &quot;true to [his] day&quot; as Hawks had in his time. Carpenter, a fan of Hawks&#x27; adaptation, paid homage to it in &quot;Halloween&quot;, and he watched &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; several times for inspiration before filming began. Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey first worked together on &quot;Halloween&quot;, and &quot;The Thing&quot; was their first big-budget project for a major film studio.

After securing the writer and crew, the film was stalled again when Carpenter nearly quit, believing that a passion project of his, &quot;El Diablo&quot; (1990), was on the verge of being made by EMI Films. The producers discussed various replacements including Walter Hill, Sam Peckinpah and Michael Ritchie, but the development of &quot;El Diablo&quot; was not as imminent as Carpenter believed, and he remained with &quot;The Thing&quot;.

Universal initially set a budget of $10million, with $200,000 for &quot;creature effects&quot;, which at the time was more than the studio had ever allocated to a monster film. Filming was scheduled to be completed within 98 days. Universal&#x27;s production studios estimated that it would require at least $17million before marketing and other costs, as the plan involved more set construction, including external sets and a large set piece for the original scripted death of Bennings, which was estimated to cost $1.5million alone. As storyboarding and designs were finalized, the crew estimated they would need at least $750,000 for creature effects, a figure Universal executives agreed to after seeing the number of workers employed under Rob Bottin, the special make-up effects designer. Larry Franco was responsible for making the budget work for the film; he cut the filming schedule by a third, eliminated the exterior sets for on-site shooting, and removed Bennings&#x27; more extravagant death scene. Cohen suggested reusing the destroyed American camp as the ruined Norwegian camp, saving a further $250,000. When filming began in August, &quot;The Thing&quot; had a budget of $11.4million, and indirect costs brought it to $14million. The effects budget ran over, eventually totaling $1.5million, forcing the elimination of some scenes, including Nauls&#x27; confrontation of a creature dubbed the &quot;box Thing&quot;. By the end of production, Carpenter had to make a personal appeal to executive Ned Tanen for $100,000 to complete a simplified version of the Blair-Thing. The final cost was $12.4million, and overhead costs brought it to $15million.

===Writing===
Several writers developed drafts for &quot;The Thing&quot; before Carpenter became involved, including &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1967) writer William F. Nolan, novelist David Wiltse, and Hooper and Henkel, whose draft was set at least partially underwater, and which Cohen described as a &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;-like story in which &quot;The Captain&quot; did battle with a large, non-shapeshifting creature. As Carpenter said in a 2014 interview, &quot;they were just trying to make it work&quot;. The writers left before Carpenter joined the project. He said the scripts were &quot;awful&quot;, as they changed the story into something it was not, and ignored the chameleon-like aspect of the Thing. Carpenter did not want to write the project himself, after recently completing work on &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), and having struggled to complete a screenplay for &quot;The Philadelphia Experiment&quot; (1984). He was wary of taking on writing duties, preferring to let someone else do it. Once Carpenter was confirmed as the director, several writers were asked to script &quot;The Thing&quot;, including Richard Matheson, Nigel Kneale, and Deric Washburn.

Bill Lancaster initially met with Turman, Foster and Cohen in 1977, but he was given the impression that they wanted to closely replicate &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, and he did not want to remake the film. In August 1979, Lancaster was contacted again. By this time he had read the original &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; novella, and Carpenter had become involved in the project. Lancaster was hired to write the script after describing his vision for the film, and his intention to stick closely to the original story, to Carpenter, who was a fan of Lancaster&#x27;s work on &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976). Lancaster conceived several key scenes in the film, including the Norris-Thing biting Dr. Copper, and the use of blood tests to identify the Thing, which Carpenter cited as the reason he wanted to work on the film. Lancaster said he found some difficulty in translating &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; to film, as it features very little action. He also made some significant changes to the story, such as reducing the number of characters from 37 to 12. Lancaster said that 37 was excessive and would be difficult for audiences to follow, leaving little screen time for characterization. He also opted to alter the story&#x27;s structure, choosing to open his in the middle of the action, instead of using a flashback as in the novella. Several characters were modernized for contemporary audiences; MacReady, originally a meteorologist, became a tough loner described in the script as &quot;35. Helicopter pilot. Likes chess. Hates the cold. The pay is good.&quot; Lancaster aimed to create an ensemble piece where one person emerged as the hero, instead of having a Doc Savage-type hero from the start.

Lancaster wrote thirty to forty pages but struggled with the film&#x27;s second act, and it took him several months to complete the script. After it was finished, Lancaster and Carpenter spent a weekend in northern California refining the script, each having different takes on how a character should sound, and comparing their ideas for scenes. Lancaster&#x27;s script opted to keep the creature largely concealed throughout the film, and it was Bottin who convinced Carpenter to make it more visible to have a greater impact on the audience. Lancaster&#x27;s original ending had both MacReady and Childs turn into the Thing. In the spring, the characters are rescued by helicopter, greeting their saviors with &quot;Hey, which way to a hot meal?&quot;. Carpenter thought this ending was too shallow. In total, Lancaster completed four drafts of the screenplay. The novella concludes with the humans clearly victorious, but concerned that birds they see flying toward the mainland may have been infected by the Thing. Carpenter opted to end the film with the survivors slowly freezing to death to save humanity from infection, believing this to be the ultimate heroic act. Lancaster wrote this ending, which eschews a &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;-style twist or the destruction of the monster, as he wanted to instead have an ambiguous moment between the pair, of trust and mistrust, fear and relief.

===Casting===
Anita Dann served as casting director. Kurt Russell had worked with Carpenter twice before and was involved in the production before being cast, helping Carpenter develop his ideas. Russell was the last actor to be cast, in June 1981, by which point second unit filming was starting in Juneau, Alaska. Carpenter wanted to keep his options open for the lead R.J. MacReady, and discussions with the studio considered Christopher Walken, Jeff Bridges, and Nick Nolte, who were either unavailable or declined, and Sam Shepard, who showed interest but was never pursued. Tom Atkins and Jack Thompson were strong early and late contenders for the role of MacReady, but the decision was ultimately made to go with Russell. In part, Carpenter cited the practicality of choosing someone he had found reliable before, and who would not balk at the difficult filming conditions. It took Russell about a year to grow his hair and beard out for the role. At various points, the producers also met with Brian Dennehy, Kris Kristofferson, John Heard, Ed Harris, Tom Berenger, Jack Thompson, Scott Glenn, Fred Ward, Peter Coyote, Tom Atkins, and Tim McIntire. Some passed on the idea of starring in a monster film, while Dennehy became the choice to play Copper. Each actor was to be paid $50,000, but after the more-established Russell was cast, his salary increased to $400,000.

Geoffrey Holder, Carl Weathers, and Bernie Casey were considered for the role of mechanic Childs, and Carpenter also looked at Isaac Hayes, having worked with him on &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. Ernie Hudson was the front-runner and was almost cast until they met with Keith David. &quot;The Thing&quot; was David&#x27;s first significant film role, and coming from a theater background, he had to learn on set how to hold himself back and not show every emotion his character was feeling, with guidance from Richard Masur and Donald Moffat in particular. Masur (dog handler Clark) and David discussed their characters in rehearsals and decided that they would not like each other. For senior biologist Blair, the team chose the then-unknown Wilford Brimley, as they wanted an everyman whose absence would not be questioned by the audience until the appropriate time. The intent with the character was to have him become infected early in the film but offscreen, so that his status would be unknown to the audience, concealing his intentions. Carpenter wanted to cast Donald Pleasence, but it was decided that he was too recognizable to accommodate the role. T. K. Carter was cast as the station&#x27;s cook Nauls, but comedian Franklyn Ajaye also came in to read for the role. Instead, he delivered a lengthy speech about the character being a stereotype, after which the meeting ended.

Bottin lobbied hard to play assistant mechanic Palmer, but it was deemed impossible for him to do so alongside his existing duties. As the character has some comedic moments, Universal brought in comedians Jay Leno, Garry Shandling, and Charles Fleischer, among others, but opted to go with actor David Clennon, who was better suited to play the dramatic elements. Clennon had read for the Bennings character, but he preferred Palmer&#x27;s &quot;blue-collar stoner&quot; role to a &quot;white collar science man&quot;. Powers Boothe, Lee Van Cleef, Jerry Orbach, and Kevin Conway were considered for the role of station commander Garry, and Richard Mulligan was also considered when the production experimented with the idea of making the character closer to MacReady in age. Masur also read for Garry, but he asked to play the dog handler Clark instead, as he liked the character&#x27;s dialogue and was also a fan of dogs. Masur worked daily with the wolfdog Jed and his handler, Clint Rowe, during rehearsals, as Rowe was familiarizing Jed with the sounds and smells of people. This helped Masur&#x27;s and Jed&#x27;s performance onscreen, as the dog would stand next to him without looking for his handler. Masur described his character as one uninterested in people, but who loves working with dogs. He went to a survivalist store and bought a flip knife for his character, and used it in a confrontation with David&#x27;s character. Masur turned down a role in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; to play Clark. William Daniels and Dennehy were both interested in playing Dr. Copper, and it was a last-second decision by Carpenter to go with Richard Dysart.

In early drafts, Windows was called Sanchez, and later Sanders. The name Windows came when the actor for the role, Thomas Waites, was in a costume fitting and tried on a large pair of dark glasses, which the character wears in the film. Russell described the all-male story as interesting since the men had no one to posture for without women.

===Filming===
&quot;The Thing&quot; was storyboarded extensively by Mike Ploog and Mentor Huebner before filming began. Their work was so detailed that many of the film&#x27;s shots replicate the image layout completely. Cundey pushed for the use of anamorphic format aspect ratio, believing that it allowed for placing several actors in an environment, and making use of the scenic vistas available, while still creating a sense of confinement within the image. It also enabled the use of negative space around the actors to imply something may be lurking just offscreen.
Principal photography began on August 24, 1981, in Juneau, Alaska. Filming lasted about twelve weeks. Carpenter insisted on two weeks of rehearsals before filming as he wanted to see how scenes would play out. This was unusual at the time because of the expense involved. Filming then moved to the Universal lot, where the outside heat was over . The internal sets were climate-controlled to to facilitate their work. The team considered building the sets inside an existing refrigerated structure but were unable to find one large enough. Instead, they collected as many portable air conditioners as they could, closed off the stage, and used humidifiers and misters to add moisture to the air. After watching a roughly assembled cut of filming to date, Carpenter was unhappy that the film seemed to feature too many scenes of men standing around talking. He rewrote some already completed scenes to take place outdoors to be shot on location when principal photography moved to Stewart, British Columbia.

Carpenter was determined to use authentic locations instead of studio sets, and his successes on &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980) gave him the credibility to take on the much bigger-budget production of &quot;The Thing&quot;. A film scout located an area just outside Stewart, along the Canadian coast, which offered the project both ease of access and scenic value during the day. On December 2, 1981, roughly 100 American and Canadian crew members moved to the area to begin filming. During the journey there, the crew bus slid in the snow toward the unprotected edge of the road, nearly sending it down a embankment. Some of the crew stayed in the small mining town during filming, while others lived on residential barges on the Portland Canal. They would make the drive up a small, winding road to the filming location in Alaska where the exterior outpost sets were built.

The sets had been built in Alaska during the summer, atop a rocky area overlooking a glacier, in preparation for snow to fall and cover them. They were used for both interior and exterior filming, meaning they could not be heated above freezing inside to ensure there was always snow on the roof. Outside, the temperature was so low that the camera lenses would freeze and break. The crew had to leave the cameras in the freezing temperatures, as keeping them inside in the warmth resulted in foggy lenses that took hours to clear. Filming, greatly dependent on the weather, took three weeks to complete, with heavy snow making it impossible to film on some days. Rigging the explosives necessary to destroy the set in the film&#x27;s finale required 8 hours.

Keith David broke his hand in a car accident the day before he was to begin shooting. David attended filming the next day, but when Carpenter and Franco saw his swollen hand, they sent him to the hospital where it was punctured with two pins. He returned wearing a surgical glove beneath a black glove that was painted to resemble his complexion. His left hand is not seen for the first half of the film. Carpenter filmed the Norwegian camp scenes after the end scenes, using the damaged American base as a stand-in for the charred Norwegian camp. The explosive destruction of the base required the camera assistants to stand inside the set with the explosives, which were activated remotely. The assistants then had to run to a safe distance while seven cameras captured the base&#x27;s destruction. Filmed when the heavy use of special effects was rare, the actors had to adapt to having Carpenter describe to them what their characters were looking at, as the effects would not be added until post-production. There were some puppets used to create the impression of what was happening in the scene, but in other cases, the cast would be looking at a wall or an object marked with an &quot;X&quot;.

Art director John J. Lloyd oversaw the design and construction of all the sets, as there were no existing locations used in the film. Cundey suggested that the sets should have ceilings and pipes seen on camera to make the spaces seem more claustrophobic.

===Post-production===
Several scenes in the script were omitted from the film, sometimes because there was too much dialogue that slowed the pace and undermined the suspense. Carpenter blamed some of the issues on his directorial method, noting that several scenes appeared to be repeating events or information. Another scene featuring a snowmobile chase pursuing dogs was removed from the shooting script as it would have been too expensive to film. One scene present in the film, but not the script, features a monologue by MacReady. Carpenter added this partly to establish what was happening in the story and because he wanted to highlight Russell&#x27;s heroic character after taking over the camp. Carpenter said that Lancaster&#x27;s experience writing ensemble pieces did not emphasize single characters. Since &quot;Halloween&quot;, several horror films had replicated many of the scare elements of that film, something Carpenter wanted to move away from for &quot;The Thing&quot;. He removed scenes from Lancaster&#x27;s script that had been filmed, such as a body suddenly falling into view at the Norwegian camp, which he felt were too clichéd. Approximately three minutes of scenes were filmed from Lancaster&#x27;s script that elaborated on the characters&#x27; backgrounds.

A scene with MacReady absentmindedly inflating a blow-up doll while watching the Norwegian tapes was filmed but was not used in the finished film. The doll would later appear as a jump scare with Nauls. Other scenes featured expanded or alternate deaths for various characters. In the finished film, Fuchs&#x27; charred bones are discovered, revealing he has died offscreen, but an alternate take sees his corpse impaled on a wall with a shovel. Nauls was scripted to appear in the finale as a partly assimilated mass of tentacles, but in the film, he simply disappears. Carpenter struggled with a method of conveying to the audience what assimilation by the creature actually meant. Lancaster&#x27;s original set piece of Bennings&#x27; death had him pulled beneath a sheet of ice by the Thing, before resurfacing in different areas in various stages of assimilation. The scene called for a set to be built on one of Universal&#x27;s largest stages, with sophisticated hydraulics, dogs, and flamethrowers, but it was deemed too costly to produce. A scene was filmed with Bennings being murdered by an unknown assailant, but it was felt that assimilation, leading to his death, was not explained enough. Short on time, and with no interior sets remaining, a small set was built, Maloney was covered with K-Y Jelly, orange dye, and rubber tentacles. Monster gloves for a different creature were repurposed to demonstrate partial assimilation.

Carpenter filmed multiple endings for &quot;The Thing&quot;, including a &quot;happier&quot; ending because editor Todd Ramsay thought that the bleak, nihilistic conclusion would not test well with audiences. In the alternate take, MacReady is rescued and given a blood test that proves he is not infected. Carpenter said that stylistically this ending would have been &quot;cheesy&quot;. Editor Verna Fields was tasked with reworking the ending to add clarity and resolution. It was finally decided to create an entirely new scene, which omitted the suspicion of Childs being infected by removing him completely, leaving MacReady alone. This new ending tested only slightly better with audiences than the original, and the production team agreed to the studio&#x27;s request to use it. It was set to go to print for theaters when the producers, Carpenter, and executive Helena Hacker decided that the film was better left with ambiguity instead of nothing at all. Carpenter gave his approval to restore the ambiguous ending, but a scream was inserted over the outpost explosion to posit the monster&#x27;s death. Universal executive Sidney Sheinberg disliked the ending&#x27;s nihilism and, according to Carpenter, said, &quot;Think about how the audience will react if we see the [Thing] die with a giant orchestra playing&quot;. Carpenter later noted that both the original ending and the ending without Childs tested poorly with audiences, which he interpreted as the film simply not being heroic enough.

===Music===

Ennio Morricone composed the film&#x27;s score, as Carpenter wanted &quot;The Thing&quot; to have a European musical approach. Carpenter flew to Rome to speak with Morricone to convince him to take the job. By the time Morricone flew to Los Angeles to record the score, he had already developed a tape filled with an array of synthesizer music because he was unsure what type of score Carpenter wanted. Morricone wrote complete separate orchestral and synthesizer scores and a combined score, which he knew was Carpenter&#x27;s preference. Carpenter picked a piece, closely resembling his own scores, that became the main theme used throughout the film. He also played the score from &quot;Escape from New York&quot; for Morricone as an example. Morricone made several more attempts, bringing the score closer to Carpenter&#x27;s own style of music. In total, Morricone produced a score of approximately one hour that remained largely unused but was later released as part of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Carpenter and his longtime collaborator Alan Howarth separately developed some synth-styled pieces used in the film. In 2012, Morricone recalled:
I&#x27;ve asked [Carpenter], as he was preparing some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, &quot;Why did you call me, if you want to do it on your own?&quot; He surprised me, he said&quot;I got married to your music. This is why I&#x27;ve called you.&quot;... Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn&#x27;t exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I&#x27;ve written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [Carpenter] took the electronic score.

Carpenter said:
[Morricone] did all the orchestrations and recorded for me 20 minutes of music I could use wherever I wished but without seeing any footage. I cut his music into the film and realized that there were places, mostly scenes of tension, in which his music would not work... I secretly ran off and recorded in a couple of days a few pieces to use. My pieces were very simple electronic piecesit was almost tones. It was not really music at all but just background sounds, something today you might even consider as sound effects.

==Design==
===Creature effects===
&quot;The Thing&quot;″s special effects were largely designed by Bottin, who had previously worked with Carpenter on &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980). When Bottin joined the project in mid-1981, pre-production was in progress, but no design had been settled on for the alien. Artist Dale Kuipers had created some preliminary paintings of the creature&#x27;s look, but he left the project after being hospitalized following a traffic accident before he could develop them further with Bottin. Carpenter conceived the Thing as a single creature, but Bottin suggested that it should be constantly changing and able to look like anything. Carpenter initially considered Bottin&#x27;s description of his ideas as &quot;too weird&quot;, and had him work with Ploog to sketch them instead. As part of the Thing&#x27;s design, it was agreed anyone assimilated by it would be a perfect imitation and would not know they were the Thing. The actors spent hours during rehearsals discussing whether they would know they were the Thing when taken over. Clennon said that it did not matter, because everyone acted, looked and smelled exactly the same before (or after) being taken over. At its peak, Bottin had a 35-person crew of artists and technicians, and he found it difficult to work with so many people. To help manage the team, he hired Erik Jensen, a special effects line producer who he had worked with on &quot;The Howling&quot; (1981), to be in charge of the special make-up effects unit. Bottin&#x27;s crew also included mechanical aspect supervisor Dave Kelsey, make-up aspect coordinator Ken Diaz, moldmaker Gunnar Ferdinansen, and Bottin&#x27;s longtime friend Margaret Beserra, who managed painting and hair work.
In designing the Thing&#x27;s different forms, Bottin explained that the creature had been all over the galaxy. This allowed it to call on different attributes as necessary, such as stomachs that transform into giant mouths and spider legs sprouting from heads. Bottin said the pressure he experienced caused him to dream about working on designs, some of which he would take note of after waking. One abandoned idea included a series of dead baby monsters, which was deemed &quot;too gross&quot;. Bottin admitted he had no idea how his designs would be implemented practically, but Carpenter did not reject them. Carpenter said, &quot;What I didn&#x27;t want to end up with in this movie was a guy in a suit... I grew up as a kid watching science-fiction monster movies, and it was always a guy in a suit.&quot; According to Cundey, Bottin was very sensitive about his designs, and worried about the film showing too many of them. At one point, as a preemptive move against any censorship, Bottin suggested making the creature&#x27;s violent transformations and the appearance of the internal organs more fantastical using colors. The decision was made to tone down the color of the blood and viscera, although much of the filming had been completed by that point. The creature effects used a variety of materials including mayonnaise, creamed corn, microwaved bubble gum, and K-Y Jelly.

During filming, then-21-year-old Bottin was hospitalized for exhaustion, double pneumonia, and a bleeding ulcer, caused by his extensive workload. Bottin himself explained he would &quot;hoard the work&quot;, opting to be directly involved in many of the complicated tasks. His dedication to the project saw him spend over a year living on the Universal lot. Bottin said he did not take a day off during that time and slept on the sets or in locker rooms. To take some pressure off his crew, Bottin enlisted the aid of special effects creator Stan Winston to complete some of the designs, primarily the Dog-Thing. With insufficient time to create a sophisticated mechanical creature, Winston opted to create a hand puppet. A cast was made of makeup artist Lance Anderson&#x27;s arm and head, around which the Dog-Thing was sculpted in oil-based clay. The final foam-latex puppet, worn by Anderson, featured radio-controlled eyes and cable-controlled legs, and was operated from below a raised set on which the kennel was built. Slime from the puppet would leak onto Anderson during the two days it took to film the scene, and he had to wear a helmet to protect himself from the explosive squibs simulating gunfire. Anderson pulled the tentacles into the Dog-Thing and reverse motion was used to create the effect of them slithering from its body. Winston refused to be credited for his work, insisting that Bottin deserved sole credit; Winston was given a &quot;thank you&quot; in the credits instead.
In the &quot;chest chomp&quot; scene, Dr. Copper attempts to revive Norris with a defibrillator. Revealing himself as the Thing, Norris-Thing&#x27;s chest transforms into a large mouth that severs Copper&#x27;s arms. Bottin accomplished this scene by recruiting a double amputee and fitting him with prosthetic arms filled with wax bones, rubber veins and Jell-O. The arms were then placed into the practical &quot;stomach mouth&quot; where the mechanical jaws clamped down on them, at which point the actor pulled away, severing the false arms. The effect of the Norris-Thing&#x27;s head detaching from the body to save itself took many months of testing before Bottin was satisfied enough to film it. The scene involved a fire effect, but the crew were unaware that fumes from the rubber foam chemicals inside the puppet were flammable. The fire ignited the fumes, creating a large fireball that engulfed the puppet. It suffered only minimal damage after the fire had been put out, and the crew successfully filmed the scene. Stop-motion expert Randall William Cook developed a sequence for the end of the film where MacReady is confronted by the gigantic Blair-Thing. Cook created a miniature model of the set and filmed wide-angle shots of the monster in stop motion, but Carpenter was not convinced by the effect and used only a few seconds of it. It took fifty people to operate the actual Blair-Thing puppet.

The production intended to use a camera centrifugea rotating drum with a fixed camera platformfor the Palmer-Thing scene, allowing him to seem to run straight up the wall and across the ceiling. Again, the cost was too high and the idea abandoned for a stuntman falling into frame onto a floor made to look like the outpost&#x27;s ceiling. Stuntman Anthony Cecere stood in for the Palmer-Thing after MacReady sets it on fire and it crashes through the outpost wall.

===Visuals and lighting===
Cundey worked with Bottin to determine the appropriate lighting for each creature. He wanted to show off Bottin&#x27;s work because of its details, but he was conscious that showing too much would reveal its artificial nature, breaking the illusion. Each encounter with the creature was planned for areas where they could justify using a series of small lights to highlight the particular creature-model&#x27;s surface and textures. Cundey would illuminate the area behind the creature to detail its overall shape. He worked with Panavision and a few other companies to develop a camera capable of automatically adjusting light exposure at different film speeds. He wanted to try filming the creature at fast and slow speeds thinking this would create a more interesting visual effect, but they were unable to accomplish this at the time. For the rest of the set, Cundey created a contrast by lighting the interiors with warmer lights hung overhead in conical shades so that they could still control the lighting and have darkened areas on set. The outside was constantly bathed in a cold, blue light that Cundey had discovered being used on airport runways. The reflective surface of the snow and the blue light helped create the impression of coldness. The team also made use of the flamethrowers and magenta-hued flares used by the actors to create dynamic lighting.

The team originally wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, but Universal was reluctant as it could affect their ability to sell the television rights for the film. Instead, Cundey suggested muting the colors as much as possible. The inside of the sets were painted in neutral colors such as gray, and many of the props were also painted gray, while the costumes were a mix of somber browns, blues, and grays. They relied on the lighting to add color. Albert Whitlock provided matte-painted backdrops, including the scene in which the Americans discover the giant alien spaceship buried in the ice. A scene where MacReady walks up to a hole in the ice where the alien had been buried was filmed at Universal, while the surrounding area, including the alien spaceship, helicopter, and snow, were all painted.

Carpenter&#x27;s friend John Wash, who developed the opening computer simulation for &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, used a Cromemco Z-2 to design the computer program showing how the Thing assimilates other organisms. Colors were added by placing filters in front of an animation camera used to shoot the computer frames. Model maker Susan Turner built the alien ship approaching Earth in the pre-credits sequence, which featured 144 strobing lights. Drew Struzan designed the film&#x27;s poster. He completed it in 24 hours, based only on a briefing, knowing little about the film.

==Release==
===Marketing===

The lack of information about the film&#x27;s special effects drew the attention of film exhibitors in early 1982. They wanted reassurance that &quot;The Thing&quot; was a first-rate production capable of attracting audiences. Cohen and Foster, with a specially employed editor and Universal&#x27;s archive of music, put together a 20-minute showreel emphasizing action and suspense. They used available footage, including alternate and extended scenes not in the finished film, but avoided revealing the special effects as much as possible. The reaction from the exclusively male exhibitors was generally positive, and Universal executive Robert Rehme told Cohen that the studio was counting on &quot;The Thing&quot;″s success, as they expected &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; to appeal only to children. While finalizing the film, Universal sent Carpenter a demographic study showing that the audience appeal of horror films had declined by seventy percent over the previous six months. Carpenter considered this a suggestion that he lower his expectations of the film&#x27;s performance. After one market research screening, Carpenter queried the audience on their thoughts, and one audience member asked, &quot;Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?&quot; When Carpenter responded that it was up to their imagination, the audience member responded, &quot;Oh, God. I hate that.&quot;

After returning from a screening of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, the audience&#x27;s silence at a trailer of &quot;The Thing&quot; caused Foster to remark, &quot;We&#x27;re dead&quot;. The response to public pre-screenings of &quot;The Thing&quot; resulted in the studio changing the somber, black-and-white advertising approved by the producers to a color image of a person with a glowing face. The tagline was also changed from &quot;Man is the warmest place to hide&quot;written by Stephen Frankfort, who wrote the &quot;Alien&quot; tagline, &quot;In space, no one can hear you scream&quot;to &quot;The ultimate in alien terror&quot;, trying to capitalize on &quot;Alien&quot;″s audience. Carpenter attempted to make a last-minute change of the film&#x27;s title to &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;, to no avail. The week before its release, Carpenter promoted the film with clips on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. In 1981, horror magazine &quot;Fangoria&quot; held a contest encouraging readers to submit drawings of what the Thing would look like. Winners were rewarded with a trip to Universal Studios. On its opening day, a special screening was held at the Hollywood Pacific Theatre, presided over by Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, with free admission for those in costume as monsters.

===Box office===
&quot;The Thing&quot; was released in the United States on June 25, 1982. During its opening weekend, the film earned $3.1million from 840 theatersan average of $3,699 per theaterfinishing as the number eight film of the weekend behind supernatural horror &quot;Poltergeist&quot; ($4.1million), which was in its fourth weekend of release, and ahead of action film &quot;Megaforce&quot; ($2.3million). It dropped out of the top10 grossing films after three weeks, and ended its run earning a total of $19.6million against its $15million budget, making it only the 42nd highest-grossing film of 1982. It was not a box office failure, nor was it a hit. Subsequent theatrical releases have raised the box office gross to $19.9million .

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The film received negative reviews on its release, and hostility for its cynical, anti-authoritarian tone and graphic special effects. Some reviewers were dismissive of the film, calling it the &quot;quintessential moron movie of the 80&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;instant junk&quot;, and a &quot;wretched excess&quot;. &quot;Starlog&quot;″s Alan Spencer called it a &quot;cold and sterile&quot; horror movie attempting to cash in on the genre audience, against the &quot;optimism of &quot;E.T.&quot;, the reassuring return of &quot;Star Trek II&quot;, the technical perfection of &quot;Tron&quot;, and the sheer integrity of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;&quot;.

The plot was criticized as &quot;boring&quot;, and undermined by the special effects. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Linda Gross said that &quot;The Thing&quot; was &quot;bereft, despairing, and nihilistic&quot;, and lacking in feeling, meaning the characters&#x27; deaths did not matter. Spencer said it featured sloppy continuity, lacked pacing, and was devoid of warmth or humanity. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; felt the film confused the use of effects with creating suspense, and that it lacked drama by &quot;sacrificing everything at the altar of gore&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;″s Dave Kehr considered the dialogue to be banal and interchangeable, making the characters seem and sound alike. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Gary Arnold said it was a witty touch to open with the Thing having already overcome the Norwegian base, defeating the type of traps seen in the 1951 version, while &quot;New York&quot;″s David Denby lamented that the Thing&#x27;s threat is shown only externally, without focusing on what it is like for someone who thinks they have been taken over. Roger Ebert considered the film to be scary, but offering nothing original beyond the special effects, while &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Vincent Canby said it was entertaining only if the viewer needed to see spider-legged heads and dog autopsies.

Reviews of the actors&#x27; performances were generally positive, while criticizing the depictions of the characters they portrayed. Ebert said they lacked characterization, offering basic stereotypes that existed just to be killed, and Spencer called the characters bland even though the actors do the best they can with the material. &quot;Time&quot;″s Richard Schickel singled Russell out as the &quot;stalwart&quot; hero, where other characters were not as strongly or wittily characterized, and &quot;Variety&quot; said that Russell&#x27;s heroic status was undercut by the &quot;suicidal&quot; attitude adopted toward the film&#x27;s finale. Other reviews criticized implausibilities such as characters wandering off alone. Kehr did not like that the men did not band together against the Thing, and several reviews noted a lack of camaraderie and romance, which Arnold said reduced any interest beyond the special effects.

The film&#x27;s special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive. &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; wrote that the Thing &quot;may be the most unloved monster in movie history... but it&#x27;s also the most incredible display of special effects makeup in at least a decade.&quot; Reviews called Bottin&#x27;s work &quot;genius&quot;, noting the designs were novel, unforgettable, &quot;colorfully horrific&quot;, and called him a &quot;master of the macabre&quot;. Arnold said that the &quot;chest chomp&quot; scene demonstrated &quot;appalling creativity&quot; and the subsequent severed head scene was &quot;madly macabre&quot;, comparing them to &quot;Alien&quot;″s chest burster and severed head scenes. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the most vividly gruesome horror film to ever stalk the screens&quot;. Conversely, Denby called them more disgusting than frightening and lamented that the trend of horror films to open the human body more and more bordered on obscenity. Spencer said that Bottin&#x27;s care and pride in his craft were shown in the effects, but both they and Schickel found them to be overwhelming and &quot;squandered&quot; without strong characters and story. Even so, Canby said that the effects were too &quot;phony looking to be disgusting&quot;. Canby and Arnold said the creature&#x27;s lack of a single, discernible shape was to its detriment, and hiding it inside humans made it hard to follow. Arnold said that the 1951 version was less versatile but easier to keep in focus.

Gross and Spencer praised the film&#x27;s technical achievements, particularly Cundey&#x27;s &quot;frostbitten&quot; cinematography, the sound, editing, and Morricone&#x27;s score. Spencer was critical of Carpenter&#x27;s direction, saying it was his &quot;futile&quot; attempt to give the audience what he thinks they want and that Carpenter was not meant to direct science fiction, but was instead suited to direct &quot;traffic accidents, train wrecks, and public floggings&quot;. Ansen said that &quot;atrocity for atrocity&#x27;s sake&quot; was ill-becoming of Carpenter.

&quot;The Thing&quot; was often compared to similar films, particularly &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;. Ebert and Denby said that &quot;The Thing&quot; seemed derivative compared to those films, which had portrayed the story in a better way. &quot;Variety&quot; called it inferior to the 1951 version. Arnold considered &quot;The Thing&quot; as the result of &quot;Alien&quot; raising the requirement for horrific spectacle.

&quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; actor Kenneth Tobey and director Christian Nyby also criticized the film. Nyby said, &quot;If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse... All in all, it&#x27;s a terrific commercial for J&amp;B Scotch&quot;. Tobey singled out the visual effects, saying they &quot;were so explicit that they actually destroyed how you were supposed to feel about the characters... They became almost a movie in themselves, and were a little too horrifying.&quot; In Phil Hardy&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;Science Fiction&quot;, a reviewer described the film as a &quot;surprising failure&quot; and called it &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s most unsatisfying film to date&quot;. The review noted that the narrative &quot;seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell&#x27;s hero is no more than a cypher compared to Tobey&#x27;s rounded character in Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;The Thing&quot;&quot;. Clennon said that introductory scenes for the characters, omitted from the film, made it hard for audiences to connect with them, robbing it of some of the broader appeal of &quot;Alien&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;The Thing&quot; received nominations from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films for Best Horror Film and Best Special Effects, but lost to &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, respectively. The film was nominated at the Razzie Awards for Worst Musical Score.

==Post-release==
===Performance analysis and aftermath===
In a 1999 interview, Carpenter said audiences rejected &quot;The Thing&quot; for its nihilistic, depressing viewpoint at a time when the United States was in the midst of a recession. When it opened, it was competing against the critically and commercially successful &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; ($619million), a family-friendly film released two weeks earlier that offered a more optimistic view of alien visitation. Carpenter described it as the complete opposite of his film. &quot;The Thing&quot; opened on the same day as the science fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, which debuted as the number two film that weekend with a take of $6.1million and went on to earn $33.8million. It was also regarded as a critical and commercial failure at the time. Others blamed an oversaturation of science fiction and fantasy films released that year, including &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; ($130million), &quot;Poltergeist&quot; ($121.7million), &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; ($97million), &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; ($34.5million), and &quot;Tron&quot; ($33million). Some analysts blamed Universal&#x27;s poor marketing, which did not compete with the deluge of promotion for prominent films released that summer. Another factor was the R rating it was given, restricting the audience to those over the age of 17 unless accompanied by an adult. In contrast, &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, another horror film, received a PG rating, allowing families and younger children to view it.

The impact on Carpenter was immediatehe lost the job of directing the 1984 science fiction horror film &quot;Firestarter&quot; because of &quot;The Thing&quot;″s poor performance. His previous success had gained him a multiple-film contract at Universal, but the studio opted to buy him out of it instead. He continued making films afterward but lost confidence, and did not openly talk about &quot;The Thing&quot;″s failure until a 1985 interview with &quot;Starlog&quot;, where he said, &quot;I was called &#x27;a pornographer of violence&#x27;... I had no idea it would be received that way... &quot;The Thing&quot; was just too strong for that time. I knew it was going to be strong, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be too strong... I didn&#x27;t take the public&#x27;s taste into consideration.&quot; Shortly after its release, Wilbur Stark sued Universal for $43million for &quot;slander, breach of contract, fraud and deceit&quot;, alleging he incurred a financial loss by Universal failing to credit him properly in its marketing and by showing his name during the end credits, a less prestigious position. Stark also said that he &quot;contributed greatly to the [screenplay]&quot;. David Foster responded that Stark was not involved with the film&#x27;s production in any way, and received proper credit in all materials. Stark later sued for a further $15million over Foster&#x27;s comments. The outcome of the lawsuits is unknown.

===Home media===
While &quot;The Thing&quot; was not initially successful, it was able to find new audiences and appreciation on home video, and later on television. Sidney Sheinberg edited a version of the film for network television broadcast, which added narration and a different ending, where the Thing imitates a dog and escapes the ruined camp. Carpenter disowned this version, and theorized that Sheinberg had been mad at him for not taking his creative ideas on board for the theatrical cut.

&quot;The Thing&quot; was released on DVD in 1998 and featured additional content, such as &quot;The Thing: Terror Takes Shape&quot;a detailed documentary on the production, deleted and alternate scenes, and commentary by Carpenter and Russell. An HD DVD version followed in 2006 containing the same features, and a Blu-ray version in 2008 featuring just the Carpenter and Russell commentary, and some behind-the-scenes videos available via picture-in-picture during the film. A 2016 Blu-ray release featured a 2K resolution restoration of the film, overseen by Dean Cundey. As well as including previous features such as the commentary and &quot;Terror Takes Shape&quot;, it added interviews with the cast and crew, and segments that focus on the music, writing, editing, Ploog&#x27;s artwork, an interview with Alan Dean Foster, who wrote the film&#x27;s novelization, and the television broadcast version of &quot;The Thing&quot; that runs fifteen minutes shorter than the theatrical cut. A 4K resolution restoration was released in 2017 on Blu-ray, initially as a United Kingdom exclusive with a limited run of eight thousand units. The restoration was created using the original film negative, and was overseen by Carpenter and Cundey. A 4KUltra HD Blu-ray was released in September 2021.

MCA released the soundtrack for &quot;The Thing&quot; in 1982. Varèse Sarabande re-released it in 1991 on compact disc and Compact Cassette. These versions eventually ceased being manufactured. In 2011, Howarth and Larry Hopkins restored Morricone&#x27;s score using updated digital techniques and arranged each track in the order it appears in the film. The album also includes tracks composed by Carpenter and Howarth for the film. A remastered version of the score was released on vinyl on February 23, 2017; a deluxe edition included an exclusive interview with Carpenter. In May 2020, an extended play (EP), &quot;Lost Cues: The Thing&quot;, was released. The EP contains Carpenter&#x27;s contributions to &quot;The Thing&quot;″s score; he re-recorded the music because the original masterings were lost.

===Other media===
A novelization of the film was published by Alan Dean Foster in 1982. It is based on an earlier draft of the script and features some differences from the finished film. A scene in which MacReady, Bennings, and Childs chase infected dogs out into the snow is included, and Nauls&#x27; disappearance is explained: Cornered by the Blair-Thing, he chooses suicide over assimilation.

In 2000, McFarlane Toys released two &quot;Movie Maniacs&quot; figures: the Blair-Thing and the Norris-Thing, including its spider-legged, disembodied head. SOTA Toys released a set featuring a MacReady figure and the Dog-Thing based on the film&#x27;s kennel scene, as well as a bust of the Norris-Thing&#x27;s spider-head. In 2017, Mondo and the Project Raygun division of USAopoly released &quot;The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31&quot;, a board game. Players take on the role of characters from the film or the Thing, each aiming to defeat the other through subterfuge and sabotage. &quot;The Thing: The Boardgame&quot; was released by Pendragon Game Studio in 2024. 

A pinball table based on &quot;The Thing&quot; is featured in &quot;Pinball M&quot; (2023), including R.J. MacReady and various other elements from the film. Characters from, and an area based on &quot;The Thing&quot; appear in the 2024 video game &quot;Funko Fusion&quot;.

==Thematic analysis==
The central theme of &quot;The Thing&quot; concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The immediate concern of &quot;The Thing&quot; is the inability to trust one&#x27;s peers, but this feeling can be widened to represent distrust of entire institutions.

Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. &quot;Diabolique&quot;″s Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that preferring annihilation to defeat is a recurring motif, both in MacReady&#x27;s destruction of the chess computer after being checkmated and his vow to destroy the Thing even at the expense of the team. Clarkson Fisher and &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s Michael Edward Taylor see the team&#x27;s accusatory distrust and fear of assimilation as an expression of the American Red Scare of the 1950s and 1960s, while Taylor also sees a commentary on the isolationism of the me generation in the 1970s. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War (1955–1975) &quot;fatigued counterculturalism&quot;the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities.
&quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, women are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. &quot;Vice&quot;″s Patrick Marlborough considered &quot;The Thing&quot; to be a &quot;scathing examination&quot; of manliness, noting that identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but &quot;male frailty&quot; prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other.

Nerdist&#x27;s Kyle Anderson and &quot;Strange Horizons&quot;″s Orrin Grey analyzed &quot;The Thing&quot; as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s cosmic horror. Anderson&#x27;s analysis includes the idea of cosmic horror in large part coming &quot;from the fear of being overtaken&quot;, connecting it to Lovecraft&#x27;s xenophobia and Blair&#x27;s character arc of becoming what he most fears. In contrast, Anderson compares Blair to MacReady, who represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self, using Blair&#x27;s character as an example. Discussing The Thing in the context of the first of three films in Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Trilogy&quot;, Grey states the threat the monster poses to the world &quot;is less disconcerting than the threat posed to the individual concept of self.&quot;

The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe &quot;The Thing&quot; as &quot;pro-science&quot; like &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; or &quot;anti-science&quot; like &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, Carpenter chose &quot;pro-human&quot;, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who&#x27;s not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.&quot; Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could be identified only by a blood test.

Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film&#x27;s ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey&#x27;s statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming. During production, Carpenter considered having MacReady be infected, and an alternate ending showed MacReady having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected. Russell has said that analyzing the scene for clues is &quot;missing the point&quot;. He continued, &quot;[Carpenter] and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn&#x27;t know anything... They didn&#x27;t know if they knew who they were... I love that, over the years, that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past the horrificness of the monster... to see what the movie was about, which was paranoia.&quot; However, Carpenter has teased, &quot;Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Retrospective reassessment===
In the years following its release, critics and fans have reevaluated &quot;The Thing&quot; as a milestone of the horror genre. A prescient review by Peter Nicholls in 1992 called &quot;The Thing&quot; &quot;a bleak, memorable film [that] may yet be seen as a classic&quot;. It has been called one of the best films directed by Carpenter. John Kenneth Muir called it &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s most accomplished and underrated directorial effort&quot;, and critic Matt Zoller Seitz said it &quot;is one of the greatest and most elegantly constructed B-movies ever made&quot;.

Trace Thurman described it as one of the best films ever, and in 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected it as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, at number 289, calling it &quot;a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror&quot;. It is now considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, and a classic of the genre. Several publications have called it one of the best films of 1982, including Filmsite.org, Film.com, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Muir called it &quot;the best science fiction-horror film of 1982, an incredibly competitive year, and perhaps even the best genre motion picture of the decade&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot; named it the ninth-best of the decade, calling it the &quot;greatest genre remake of all time&quot;. Numerous publications have ranked it as one of the best science fiction films, including number four by &quot;IGN&quot; (2016); number 11 by Rotten Tomatoes (2024); number12 by &quot;Thrillist&quot; (2018); number17 by &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; (2018); number 31 by &quot;Paste&quot; (2018); number 32 by &quot;Esquire&quot; (2015) and &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; (2017).

Similarly, &quot;The Thing&quot; has appeared on several lists of the top horror films, including number one by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;; number two by Bloody Disgusting (2018); number four by &quot;Empire&quot; (2016); and number six by &quot;Time Out&quot; (2016). &quot;Empire&quot; listed its poster as the 43rd best film poster ever. In 2016, the British Film Institute named it one of ten great films about aliens visiting Earth. It was voted the ninth best horror film of all time in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll, and is considered one of the best examples of body horror. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; listed its ending as one of the 25 best of all time. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which has compiled old and contemporary reviews, reports that 85% of 85 critics provided positive reviews for the film, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Grimmer and more terrifying than the 1950s take, John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot; is a tense sci-fi thriller rife with compelling tension and some remarkable make-up effects.&quot; On Metacritic, a similar website that aggregates both past and present reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In a 2011 interview, Carpenter remarked that it was perhaps his favorite film from his own filmography. He lamented that it took a long time for &quot;The Thing&quot; to find a wider audience, saying, &quot;If &quot;The Thing&quot; had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn&#x27;t have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I&#x27;m not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making &quot;Christine&quot; (1983) and &quot;Starman&quot; (1984) and &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; (1986), all those films. But my career would have been different.&quot;

===Cultural influence===
The film has had a significant effect on popular culture, and by 1998, &quot;The Thing&quot; was already considered a cult classic. It is listed in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, which says &quot;one of the most influential horror movies of the 1980s, much imitated but rarely bettered... It is one of the first films to unflinchingly show the rupture and warp of flesh and bone into grotesque tableaus of surreal beauty, forever raising the bar of cinematic horror.&quot; It has been referred to in a variety of media, from television (including &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, and &quot;Stranger Things&quot;) to games (&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot;, &quot;Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden&quot;, and &quot;Among Us&quot;), and films (&quot;The Faculty&quot;, &quot;Slither&quot;, and &quot;The Mist&quot;).
Several filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for &quot;The Thing&quot; or cited its influence on their own work, including Guillermo del Toro, James DeMonaco, J. J. Abrams, Neill Blomkamp, David Robert Mitchell, Rob Hardy, Steven S. DeKnight, and Quentin Tarantino. In 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked prominent horror filmmakers what film they had found the scariest. Two, John Sayles and Edgar Wright, cited &quot;The Thing&quot;. The 2015 Tarantino film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; takes numerous cues from &quot;The Thing&quot;, from featuring Russell in a starring role, to replicating themes of paranoia and mistrust between characters restricted to a single location, and even duplicating certain angles and layouts used by Carpenter and Cundey. Pieces of Morricone&#x27;s unused score for &quot;The Thing&quot; were repurposed for &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. Tarantino also cited &quot;The Thing&quot; as an inspiration for his 1992 film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;.

The film is screened annually in February to mark the beginning of winter at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station. In January 2010, &quot;Clarkesworld Magazine&quot; published &quot;The Things&quot;, a short story by Peter Watts told from the Thing&#x27;s point of view; it is unable to understand why humans are hostile toward it and horrified to learn that they do not shapeshift. The story received a 2011 Hugo Award nomination. In 2017, a 400-page art book was released featuring art inspired by &quot;The Thing&quot;, with contributions from 350 artists, a foreword by director Eli Roth, and an afterword by Carpenter.

The 2007 Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, featured &quot;The Thing: Assimilation&quot;, a haunted attraction based on the film. The attraction included MacReady and Childs, both held in stasis, the Blair-Thing and the outpost kennel.

==Sequels==

Dark Horse Comics published four comic book sequels starring MacReady, beginning in December 1991 with the two-part &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; by Chuck Pfarrer, which is set 24 hours after the film. Pfarrer was reported to have pitched his comic tale to Universal as a sequel in the early 1990s. This was followed by the four-part &quot;The Thing from Another World: Climate of Fear&quot; in July 1992, the four-part &quot;The Thing from Another World: Eternal Vows&quot; in December 1993, and &quot;The Thing from Another World: Questionable Research&quot;. In 1999, Carpenter said that no serious discussions had taken place for a sequel, but he would be interested in basing one on Pfarrer&#x27;s adaptation, calling the story a worthy sequel. A 2002 video game of the same name was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox to generally favorable reviews. The game&#x27;s plot follows a team of U.S. soldiers investigating the aftermath of the film&#x27;s events.

In 2005, the Syfy channel planned a four-hour miniseries sequel produced by Frank Darabont and written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick. The story followed a Russian team who recover the corpses of MacReady and Childs, as well as remnants of the Thing. The story moves forward 23 years, where the Thing escapes in New Mexico, and follows the attempts at containment. The project never proceeded, and Universal opted to continue with a feature film sequel. A prequel film, also titled &quot;The Thing&quot;, was released in October 2011 to a $31million worldwide box office gross and mixed reviews. The story follows the events after the Norwegian team discovers the Thing. In 2020, Universal Studios and Blumhouse Productions announced the development of a remake of Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot;. The remake was described as incorporating elements of &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot;, as well as the novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; and its expanded version &quot;Frozen Hell&quot;, which features several additional chapters.

Although released years apart, and unrelated in terms of plot, characters, crew, or even production studios, Carpenter considers &quot;The Thing&quot; to be the first installment in his &quot;Apocalypse Trilogy&quot;, a series of films based around cosmic horror, entities unknown to man, that are threats to both human life and the sense of self. &quot;The Thing&quot; was followed by &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; in 1987, and &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; in 1994. All three films are heavily influenced by Carpenter&#x27;s appreciation for the works of Lovecraft.

<doc id="30811" wikidata="Q307306" url="?curid=30811" title="Troff">
<text>troff (), short for &quot;typesetter roff&quot;, is the major component of a document processing system developed by Bell Labs for the Unix operating system. troff and the related nroff were both developed from the original roff.

While nroff was intended to produce output on terminals and line printers, troff was intended to produce output on typesetting systems, specifically the Graphic Systems CAT, which had been introduced in 1972. Both used the same underlying markup language, and a single source file could normally be used by nroff or troff without change.

&quot;troff&quot; features commands to designate fonts, spacing, paragraphs, margins, footnotes and more. Unlike many other text formatters, &quot;troff&quot; can position characters arbitrarily on a page, even overlapping them, and has a fully programmable input language. Separate preprocessors are used for more convenient production of tables, diagrams, and mathematics. Inputs to troff are plain text files and can be created by any text editor.

Extensive macro packages have been created for various document styles. A typical distribution of troff includes the me macros for formatting research papers, man and mdoc macros for creating Unix man pages, mv macros for creating mountable transparencies, and the ms and mm macros for letters, books, technical memoranda, and reports.

==History==
&quot;troff&quot;&#x27;s origins can be traced to a text-formatting program called RUNOFF, which was written by Jerome H. Saltzer for MIT&#x27;s CTSS operating system in the mid-1960s. (The name allegedly came from the phrase &quot;I&#x27;ll run off a document&quot;.)

Bob Morris ported it to the GE 635 architecture and called the program roff (an abbreviation of &quot;runoff&quot;). It was rewritten as rf for the PDP-7, and at the same time (1969), Doug McIlroy rewrote an extended and simplified version of &quot;roff&quot; in the BCPL programming language.

The first version of Unix was developed on a PDP-7 which was sitting around Bell Labs. In 1971 the developers wanted to get a PDP-11 for further work on the operating system. In order to justify the cost for this system, they proposed that they would implement a document-formatting system for the Bell Labs patents department. This first formatting program was a reimplementation of McIllroy&#x27;s &quot;roff&quot;, written by Joe F. Ossanna.

When they needed a more flexible language, a new version of &quot;roff&quot; called nroff (&quot;newer &quot;roff&quot;&quot;) was written, which provided the basis for all future versions. When they got a Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter, Ossanna modified &quot;nroff&quot; to support multiple fonts and proportional spacing. Dubbed &quot;troff&quot;, for &quot;typesetter roff&quot;, its sophisticated output amazed the typesetter manufacturer and confused peer reviewers, who thought that manuscripts using &quot;troff&quot; had been published before. As such, the name &quot;troff&quot; is pronounced rather than *.

With &quot;troff&quot; came &quot;nroff&quot; (they were actually almost the same program), which was for producing output for line printers and character terminals. It understood everything &quot;troff&quot; did, and ignored the commands which were not applicable, e.g., font changes.

Ossanna&#x27;s &quot;troff&quot; was written in PDP-11 assembly language and produced output specifically for the CAT phototypesetter. He rewrote it in C, although it was now 7000 lines of uncommented code and still dependent on the CAT. As the CAT became less common, and was no longer supported by the manufacturer, the need to make it support other devices became a priority. Ossanna died before this task was completed, so Brian Kernighan took on the task of rewriting &quot;troff&quot;. The newly rewritten version produced a device-independent code which was very easy for post-processors to read and translate to the appropriate printer codes. Also, this new version of &quot;troff&quot; (often called ditroff for &quot;device independent troff&quot;) had several extensions, which included drawing functions. The program&#x27;s documentation defines the output format of &quot;ditroff&quot;, which is used by many modern &quot;troff&quot; clones like GNU groff.

In 1983, &quot;troff&quot; was one of several UNIX tools available for Charles River Data Systems&#x27; UNOS operating system under Bell Laboratories license.

The &quot;troff&quot; collection of tools (including pre- and post-processors) was eventually called Documenter&#x27;s WorkBench (DWB), and was under continuous development in Bell Labs and later at the spin-off Unix System Laboratories (USL) through 1994. At that time, SoftQuad took over the maintenance, although Brian Kernighan continued to improve &quot;troff&quot; on his own. Thus, there are at least the following variants of the original Bell Labs &quot;troff&quot; in use:

* the SoftQuad DWB, based on USL DWB 2.0 from 1994;
* the DWB 3.4 from Lucent Software Solutions (formerly USL);
* troff, Plan 9 edition.

While &quot;troff&quot; has been supplanted by other programs such as Interleaf, FrameMaker, and LaTeX, it is still being used quite extensively. It remains the default formatter for the UNIX documentation.

The software was reimplemented as groff for the GNU system beginning in 1990. In addition, due to the open sourcing of Ancient UNIX systems, as well as modern successors such as the ditroff-based open-sourced versions found on OpenSolaris and Plan 9 from Bell Labs, there are several versions of AT&amp;T troff (CAT and ditroff-based) available under various open-source licenses.

== Macros ==
In general, one was not encouraged to use troff directly, but rather go through some easier-to-use interface.
Troff includes macros that are run before starting to process the document. These macros include setting up page headers and footers, defining new commands, and influencing how the output will be formatted. The command-line argument for including a macro set is &quot;-m&quot;name, which has led to many macro sets being known as the base filename with a leading m.

The standard macro sets, with leading m are:

* man for creating manual pages
* mdoc for semantically-annotated manual pages, which are better adapted to mandoc conversion to other formats. codice_1 is a fusion that supports both sets of manual commands.
* me for creating research papers
* mm for creating memorandums
* ms for creating books, reports, and technical documentation

The ms macros were the first of these, developed at AT&amp;T, before they were supplanted by the mm macros. One goal of the mm macros was that they be usable by the typing pool at Bell Labs and, over time, this happened and the mm macros became a standard at Bell Labs. AT&amp;T made the mm macros commercially available for System V Unix. In contrast, the me macros were developed at Berkeley.

An example of a simple business letter prepared with the mm macros would be:

A comprehensive list of macros available is usually listed in a codice_2 manual page.

==Preprocessors==
As &quot;troff&quot; evolved, since there are several things which cannot be done easily in &quot;troff&quot;, several preprocessors were developed. These programs transform certain parts of a document into &quot;troff&quot; input, fitting naturally into the use of &quot;pipelines&quot; in Unix — sending the output of one program as the input to another (see pipes and filters). Typically, each preprocessor translates only sections of the input file that are specially marked, passing the rest of the file through unchanged. The embedded preprocessing instructions are written in a simple application-specific programming language, which provides a high degree of power and flexibility.

* eqn preprocessor allows mathematical formulae to be specified in simple and intuitive manner.
* tbl is a preprocessor for formatting tables.
* refer (and the similar program &quot;bib&quot;) processes citations in a document according to a bibliographic database.

Three preprocessors provide &quot;troff&quot; with drawing capabilities by defining a domain-specific language for describing the picture.
* &quot;pic&quot; is a procedural programming language providing various drawing functions like &quot;circle&quot; and &quot;box&quot;.
* &quot;ideal&quot; allows the drawing of pictures declaratively, deriving the picture by solving a system of simultaneous equations based on vectors and transformations described by its input.
* &quot;grn&quot; describes the pictures through graphical elements drawn at absolute coordinates, based on the &quot;gremlin file format&quot; defined by an early graphics workstation.

In addition, there is a command soelim that removes codice_3 inclusion directives from the input text.

A typical structure of the pipeline might be:

codice_4

Yet more preprocessors allow the drawing of more complex pictures by generating output for &quot;pic&quot;.
* &quot;grap&quot; draws charts, like scatter plots and histograms.
* &quot;chem&quot; draws chemical structure diagrams.
* &quot;dformat&quot; draws record-based data structures.

== Other front-ends ==
Several other front-ends have been developed that are intended to be friendlier interfaces to troff. 

One of them is Sanscribe, originally developed at Berkeley and then enhanced during the 1980s by several users including Intel and InterACT. Used for writing memos, reports, documents, Sanscribe is built upon basic troff commands as well as the me macros and various pre- and post-processors such as soelim, eqn, tbl, grap, and pic. However it is a main program binary, not a preprocessor. The conditional inclusion capability renders it especially useful for maintaining multi-platform reference manuals. However, Sanscribe is fragile and prone to giving cryptic errors or producing weirdly formatted results.

A special-purpose front-end is vgrind, which generates nicely formatted source program listings, with such features as putting comments in italics, keywords in bold, and function names highlighted in margins. It can run either as a filter or as a main program with its output being passed to troff. It has support for the languages in use at Bell Labs facilities, including not just Fortran, C, and C++ but also domain-specific tools such as Bourne shell and yacc as well as those further afield such as Emacs Lisp and Icon.

A different approach is employed by the CADiZ suite of tools for the Z notation. Rather than the codice_5 program being a preprocessor in the front of the pipeline, it interacts multiple times with codice_6 as both input and output, using saved files rather than a pipe. CADiZ also contains its own set of macros, called codice_7 through codice_8.

<text>The Onion is an American digital media company and newspaper organization that publishes satirical articles on international, national, and local news. The company is currently based in Chicago, but originated as a weekly print publication on August 29, 1988, in Madison, Wisconsin. &quot;The Onion&quot; began publishing online in early 1996. In 2007, they began publishing satirical news audio and video online as the &quot;Onion News Network&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The Onion&quot; stopped publishing its print edition and launched Onion Labs, an advertising agency. &quot;The Onion&quot; was then acquired three times, first by Univision in 2016, which later merged &quot;The Onion&quot; and its several other publications into those of Gizmodo Media Group. This unit was sold in 2019 to Great Hill Partners, forming a new company named G/O Media. Then, in April 2024, G/O Media sold &quot;The Onion&quot; to Global Tetrahedron, a firm newly created by former Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson, which revived the print edition in August that year.

&quot;The Onion&quot;″s articles cover real and fictional current events, parodying the tone and format of traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, and street interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after that of the Associated Press. The publication&#x27;s humor often depends on presenting mundane, everyday events as newsworthy, surreal, or alarming, such as &quot;Rotation Of Earth Plunges Entire North American Continent Into Darkness&quot;. In 1999, comedian Bob Odenkirk praised the publication as &quot;the best comedy writing in the country&quot;.

&quot;The Onion&quot; previously ran &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, a non-satirical entertainment and pop culture publication founded in 1993 that contains interviews and reviews of newly released media and other weekly features, and &quot;ClickHole&quot;, a satirical website founded in 2014 which parodies clickbait websites. &quot;ClickHole&quot; was acquired by &quot;Cards Against Humanity&quot; in February 2020 while &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was acquired by Paste Magazine in March 2024.

==History==

===Publication&#x27;s name===
&quot;People always ask questions about where the name &quot;The Onion&quot; came from,&quot; said former President Sean Mills in a 2007 interview with &quot;Wikinews&quot;; &quot;and, when I recently asked Tim Keck, who was one of the founders, he told me... Literally that his uncle said he should call it &quot;The Onion&quot; when he saw him and Chris Johnson eating an onion sandwich. They had literally just cut up the onion and put it on bread.&quot; Former editorial manager Chet Clem believed this to be plausible, recollecting also in a 2007 interview that their food budget was so low when they started the paper that they were down to white bread and onions. In the same &quot;Spectator News&quot; interview, graphic editor Mike Loew forwarded the theory an &quot;onion&quot; was 1930s newspaper slang for a &quot;juicy, multi-layered story&quot;.

The onion sandwich theory had been referenced in many news sources when then editor-in-chief Cole Bolton, during a 2021 event at the University of Chicago, called that story &quot;the dumbest explanation&quot; and asserted that it is likely wrong. According to Bolton, the most plausible explanation is that &quot;The Onion&quot; was mocking a campus newsletter called &quot;The Union&quot;.

=== Madison (1988–2001) ===
&quot;The Onion&quot; was founded as a weekly print newspaper for satirical news in 1988 in Madison, Wisconsin, by University of Wisconsin students Tim Keck and Christopher Johnson. In 1989, Keck and Johnson sold the paper to Scott Dikkers, who had been contributing cartoons; Peter Haise, a lead advertising rep; and Jonathan Hart Eddy, the IT person, for $16,000 ($19,000 according to some sources). After the sale, Keck and Johnson separately became publishers of similar alternative weeklies: Keck of &quot;The Stranger&quot; in Seattle, Washington, and Johnson of the &quot;Weekly Alibi&quot; in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Haise left &quot;The Onion&quot; after 15 years and eventually opened a custom framing shop in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Dikkers, who joined the staff as a cartoonist, said he was de facto editor by the third issue and became &quot;The Onion&quot;″s longest-serving editor-in-chief (1988–1999, 2005–2008).

In &quot;The Onion&quot;&#x27;s earlier years, it was successful in a number of university locations (e.g., University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign). The publication primarily consisted of a mix of Dikkers&#x27;s cartoons, &quot;Spy&quot; magazine-like satire, and short fiction. The bottom three inches were reserved as ad space for coupons that were typically purchased by local, student-centered or inexpensive establishments, such as eateries and video rental stores.

The June 16, 1993, issue of &quot;The Daily Iowan&quot; ran a profile of Dikkers, in which it stated that &quot;Dikkers still lives in Madison, spending about five hours a week on &quot;Jim&#x27;s Journal&quot; and the rest of the time as co-owner of a satirical newspaper called &quot;The Onion&quot;&quot;.

In a 1994 interview with &quot;U. Magazine&quot;, Dikkers discussed Onion, Inc.&#x27;s plans to create a new sketch comedy show called &quot;The Comedy Castaways&quot;, which they were in the process of pitching to NBC, Fox, and HBO. With a pilot and the first two episodes in post-production, Dikkers said, &quot;I think what sets us apart is we&#x27;ve intentionally formed a tightly knit group of funny performers. A lot of these other shows are created by 50-year-olds, written by 40-year-olds and performed by 35-year-olds&quot;.

In 1995, Dave and Jeff Haupt sold their shares of Cisco Systems and they cut a deal with then-publisher Peter Haise for rights to &quot;The Onion&quot; name for 10 years in exchange for a one-time $25,000 licensing fee to open a franchise in Denver, Colorado. The publication also licensed &quot;The Onion&quot;&#x27;s content for between $200 and $500 a week. According to the Haupts, the staff in the paper&#x27;s Chicago office were known to smoke marijuana while watching Cubs games on television. But the Haupts and their partner, Dave Rogers, assembled a more business-focused staff. While other editions of The Onion ran pages of stories there weren&#x27;t enough ads to support, the Haupts cut content to avoid losses. It was a deal many at &quot;The Onion&quot; eventually regretted. There were blowups when the Haupts refused to run especially biting headlines or when they made changes to the paper&#x27;s layout. &quot;We might have been selling humor, but the business behind it was always very serious to us. The rest of &quot;The Onion&quot; was a complete disaster.&quot;

In the spring of 1996, Ben Karlin and Dikkers collaborated with Robert Smigel and Dana Carvey to create four short &quot;Onion&quot; news segments for &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;. Smigel said that after being introduced to &quot;The Onion&quot; by Bob Odenkirk a year earlier, &quot;it jumped out at me as something completely original and great, and I really wanted to use it on the show&quot;. Although four fake news segments anchored by Stephen Colbert were recorded, only one of the segments actually aired.

In 1996, when it was still only a print newspaper, an &quot;Onion&quot; article titled &quot;Clinton Deploys Vowels to Bosnia&quot; was widely disseminated online without attribution, spurring the creation of &quot;The Onion&quot;″s official website (theonion.com) so they could properly claim credit for content that was being passed around online forums such as Usenet and various mailing lists. The publication received expanded global recognition as a result of the website as well. In a 2002 interview, then-editor in chief Rob Siegel said, &quot;If you look at the breakdown of people who read &quot;The Onion&quot; online, it&#x27;s like Microsoft, Dell Computers, the Department of Justice and then, like, University of Wisconsin. So it&#x27;s a combination of students and pretty impressive people. I get the feeling that the print version is read by people hanging out in bars&quot;.

In the fall of 1996, Ben Karlin, who had been a writer/editor for the publication since graduating from the University of Wisconsin in 1993, moved to Los Angeles and joined other former &quot;Onion&quot; staff members to create a pilot for a news parody titled &quot;Deadline: Now&quot; for the Fox Network. While the 15-minute pilot, which was completed in 1997, was never picked up as a series for production, its creation led to steady writing work for Karlin and other former &quot;Onion&quot; staffers, such as writing some episodes of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; on the Cartoon Network. In the wake of Karlin&#x27;s departure, Siegel took over as editor of the publication.

Sometime after &quot;The Onion&quot; appeared online in 1996, the publication was threatened with a lawsuit from Janet Jackson because of the article &quot;Dying Boy Gets Wish: To Pork Janet Jackson&quot;. &quot;We were very nearly sued out of existence by Janet Jackson&quot;, said Siegel, adding that in the past he was forbidden to talk about the legal matter and the celebrity involved.

On January 27, 1998, MTV premiered &quot;Virtual Bill&quot;, a collaboration between writers of &quot;The Onion&quot; and 3-D character studio Protozoa. The titular &quot;Virtual Bill&quot; character was a quasi-realistic CGI version of Bill Clinton created by studio Protozoa who introduced music videos and told jokes written by the staff of &quot;The Onion&quot;. The voice of &quot;Virtual Bill&quot; was provided by then-editor Dikkers. After the initial premiere, &quot;Virtual Bill&quot; returned to MTV on December 17, 1998, with another TV special and an interactive web special produced by Pulse that ported the 3D data into a web compatible format using Pulse&#x27;s proprietary plug-in.

In January 1999, when Jon Stewart became the host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, he tapped former &quot;Onion&quot; writer/editor Karlin to be head writer of the newly restructured show. &quot;He had heard about this group of Onion people in L.A. and, in a weird way, I was the &quot;de facto&quot; ringleader of our group in L.A. I came to New York. Jon and I connected. It was kind of like a slightly awkward, but successful, first date. When I got back to Los Angeles, they offered me the head writer job&quot;.

From March 3–7, 1999, writers and editors of &quot;The Onion&quot; attended the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado, in part to promote the forthcoming &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot; anthology, and were met with effusive praise for their work from notable comedians such as Conan O&#x27;Brien, Dave Foley and Dave Thomas, as well as cartoonist Peter Bagge and musician Andy Prieboy.

On March 18, 1999, &quot;The Onion&quot;″s website won its first Webby Award in the category of &quot;Humor&quot;.

On March 23, 1999, &quot;The Onion&quot;″s first fully original book, &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot; was released. The book featured mocked-up newspaper front pages from the entire 20th century, presented under the premise that the publication had been continuously in print since before 1900. In the wake of the book&#x27;s success, networks such as HBO and NBC were in talks to bring &quot;The Onion&quot; to TV with a special based on &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot;.

Despite nearly two years of work spent on conceiving and producing &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot;, the writers received only bonuses of a few thousand dollars, despite the fact that the two-book publishing deal netted &quot;The Onion&quot; $450,000.

In April 2000, DreamWorks Studios optioned two stories from the satirical newspaper, &quot;Canadian Girlfriend Unsubstantiated&quot;—which was to be written by former &quot;Onion&quot; editor and writer Rich Dahm—and &quot;Tenth Circle Added to Rapidly Growing Hell&quot; with an eye toward producing the latter as a family comedy. &quot;The story is so dark and hate filled—I was shocked&quot;, said head writer Todd Hanson. &quot;It&#x27;s like an Onion joke. I mean, what are they going to do? Add a sickly-but-adorable moppet?&quot; added editor Robert Siegel. DreamWorks planned for the finished &quot;Tenth Circle Added to Rapidly Growing Hell&quot; to involve animation as well as musical singalongs.

In June 2000, writers and editors of &quot;The Onion&quot; participated in Comedy Central panel discussion moderated by Jeff Greenfield titled &quot;The State of &quot;The Onion&quot;&quot; during the &quot;Toyota Comedy Festival 2000&quot;.

In July 2000, &quot;The Onion&quot;″s editor Robert Siegel was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s most eligible bachelors. &quot;If a person is beautiful on the inside&quot;, Siegel said, &quot;looks don&#x27;t really matter&quot;.

=== New York City (2001–2012) ===

Beginning in the fall of 2000 to early 2001, the company relocated its editorial offices from Madison, Wisconsin, to a renovated warehouse in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (New York City) to raise &quot;The Onion&quot;″s profile, expand the publication from being simply a humor newspaper into a full production company, as well as develop editorial content in other media—including books, television and movies—and engage more directly with Internet companies as far as advertising revenue goes.

In February 2001, Miramax Films head Harvey Weinstein announced they had reached a first-look agreement to develop scripts and features with &quot;The Onion&quot;. &quot;As lifelong New Yorkers, we&#x27;re proud to welcome &quot;The Onion&quot; to our city with this first-look deal&quot;, said Harvey Weinstein. &quot;With their witty, sophisticated humor, they will undoubtedly soon be the toast of the town&quot;, Weinstein added.

On September 27, 2001, &quot;The Onion&quot; debuted its New York City print edition with an issue focused on the September 11 attacks. The popularity, and critical praise, of the issue resulted in &quot;The Onion&quot;″s website&#x27;s online traffic nearly doubling in the weeks following the attacks.

In November 2002, a humorous op-ed piece in &quot;The Onion&quot; that was satirically bylined by filmmaker Michael Bay titled &quot;Those Chechen Rebels Stole My Idea&quot; was removed from the site without explanation. Entertainment industry trade magazine Variety theorized, &quot;It&#x27;s not clear if Bay—a frequent object of &quot;The Onion&quot;″s satire—requested the move.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;The Onion&quot; was purchased by David Schafer, who had previously managed the $2.5 billion investment fund, from previous long-time owners Peter Haise and Scott Dikkers. The sale was a process that had been in the works since July 2001 and according to a memo from then-owner Haise, &quot;[Schafer] understands our quirky company and knows that we need some time to get to a higher level of operations and sales.&quot; In a 2003 CNN profile of &quot;The Onion&quot;, Schafer stated with regards to the company and the purchase, &quot;&quot;The Onion&quot;″s strong point was never accounting, financial management, or business. Buying it was a bit of a shot in the dark, but we felt we could get a handle on it.&quot; Also in 2003, editor Robert Siegel quit his day-to-day role at &quot;The Onion&quot; to focus on writing screenplays full-time. &quot;After the 14,000th headline I felt the itch to use a different part of my brain&quot;, he said. &quot;You can go mad thinking in headline form.&quot; In the wake of his departure, long-time staff writer Carol Kolb took over as editor of the publication.

In 2005, &quot;The Onion&quot; moved its New York City offices from its initial Chelsea location to downtown on Broadway in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan.

In 2006, &quot;The Onion&quot; had reached a print circulation of 549,000; it was distributed for free in several cities. The same year, it launched a YouTube channel, which was structured as a parody of modern American television news programs. In June 2006, it was also announced that Siegel had been tapped by Miramax Films to write the screenplay for a comedy titled &quot;Homeland Insecurity&quot; which was slated to be about a pair of Arab-Americans who are mistaken for terrorists while traveling to Texas. Additionally, rumors of a potential sale of &quot;The Onion&quot; to media conglomerate Viacom began appearing in various news outlets during July 2006 with &quot;The New York Times: DealBook&quot; expanding on the discussion by stating, &quot;While a source tells DealBook that such a deal has indeed been discussed, it is in very early stages and may never happen.&quot;

In April 2007, &quot;The Onion&quot; launched the Onion News Network, a parody of &quot;the visual style and breathless reporting of 24-hour cable news networks like CNN.&quot;

In 2008 Carol Kolb became the head writer of the Onion News Network with the role of the publication&#x27;s editor being taken over by writer Joe Randazzo. Randazzo first became a writer for &quot;The Onion&quot; in 2006 and—in his role as an editor—became the first editor of the publication that had no connection to &quot;The Onion&quot; during the publication&#x27;s initial Madison, Wisconsin, era.

In April 2009, &quot;The Onion&quot; was awarded a 2008 Peabody Award noting that the publication provides &quot;...ersatz news that has a worrisome ring of truth.&quot;

In November 2009, &quot;The Onion&quot; released &quot;Our Front Pages: 21 Years of Greatness, Virtue, and Moral Rectitude From America&#x27;s Finest News Source&quot; which was notable in not only compiling dozens of front pages from the publication&#x27;s history as a news parody but also showcasing front pages from the publication&#x27;s early, more casual campus humor focused era during the 1980s when the publication featured headlines such as, &quot;Depressed? Try Liposuction on that Pesky Head.&quot;

In July 2009, various news outlets began reporting rumors of an impending sale of &quot;The Onion&quot; with further details of the sale to be made on Monday, July 20, 2009. The purported sale was revealed as fictional Publisher Emeritus T. Herman Zweibel stating he&#x27;d sold the publication to a Chinese company—Yu Wan Mei Corporation—resulting in a week-long series of Chinese-related articles and features throughout the publication&#x27;s website and print editions. On Wednesday, July 22, 2009, the publication&#x27;s editor (Joe Randazzo) clarified the issue on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m sure there are many Chinese conglomerates out there that would love to buy &quot;The Onion&quot;. We are, in fact, still a solvent independently owned American company.&quot;

In August 2011, &quot;The Onion&quot;″s website began testing a paywall model, requiring a $2.95 monthly/$29.95 annual charge from non-U.S. visitors who wish to read more than about five stories within 30 days. &quot;We are testing a meter internationally as readers in those markets are already used to paying directly for some (other) content, particularly in the UK where we have many readers&quot;, said the company&#x27;s CTO Michael Greer.

In September 2011, it was announced that &quot;The Onion&quot; would move its entire editorial operation to Chicago by the summer of 2012. The news of the move left many of the writers—who moved with the publication from Madison to New York City in 2000—&quot;blindsided&quot;, putting them in a position to decide whether to uproot themselves from New York City and follow the publication to Chicago, which was already home to the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters. At a comedy show on September 27, 2011, then editor Joe Randazzo announced that he would not be joining the staff in Chicago.

===Chicago (2012–present)===
With the publication&#x27;s core editorial staff now based in Chicago, in March 2012 Cole Bolton—a Brown University graduate of business economics, former associate economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and research associate at Harvard Business School—was named the new editor-in-chief of &quot;The Onion&quot;. &quot;I was never in an improv group, never in a sketch group, never wrote for an &quot;Onion&quot; parody in college&quot;, said Bolton in a 2014 interview with comedy publication &quot;Splitsider&quot;. &quot;It was just sort of a decision that I decided, two years out of college, that I didn&#x27;t like where I was going in my life, and I wanted to do something that I cared about more, so I ended up just sending stuff in to &quot;The Onion&quot;.&quot;

Additionally, in March 2012 more insight into the internal issues surrounding the Chicago move—including an attempt made by the writers to find a new owner—are explored by articles in &quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Daily Intelligencer&quot;. According to an article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, founding editor Scott Dikkers returned to the publication in light of the Chicago move stating that he hopes to find a &quot;younger and hungrier&quot; pool of talent in Chicago than what was available in New York City. &quot;&quot;The Onion&quot; is obviously always going to draw talent from wherever it is&quot;, Dikkers said. &quot;In Madison, people used to just come in off the street [...] and we&#x27;d give them a shot. &quot;The Onion&quot; has always thrived on the youngest, greenest people.&quot;

In August 2012, it was announced that a group of former &quot;The Onion&quot; writers had teamed up with Adult Swim to create comedy content on a website called &quot;Thing X&quot;. According to the comedy website Splitsider, &quot;&quot;The Onion&quot; writers had nothing else going on, and AdultSwim.com wanted to take advantage of that. But only because they smelled a business opportunity. Adult Swim is just looking at it from a business standpoint.&quot; In June 2013, it was announced that &quot;Thing X&quot; would be shutting down with some staff moving over to parent website adultswim.com on June 18, 2013. In February 2013 &quot;The Onion&quot; was added to &quot;Advertising Age&quot;″s &quot;Digital A-List 2013&quot; because the publication &quot;...has not just survived, it&#x27;s thrived...&quot; since the publication&#x27;s 2012 move to consolidate operations and staff in Chicago.

In November 2013, the publication announced in &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot; that &quot;The Onion&quot; would move to an all-digital format by December 2013, citing a 30% year-over-year growth in page views to the publication&#x27;s website. The final print edition was published on December 13, 2013.

In 2013, &quot;The Onion&quot; received an email from Michael Cohen claiming that an article published about Donald Trump was defamation, and demanded that it be removed with an apology.

In June 2014, &quot;The Onion&quot; launched the spinoff website ClickHole, which satirizes and parodies so-called &quot;clickbait&quot; websites such as BuzzFeed and Upworthy that capitalize on viral content to drive traffic.

In November 2014, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that &quot;The Onion&quot; had hired a financial adviser for a possible sale. Additionally, in a memo addressing potential sale rumors provided to Walt Mossberg&#x27;s tech site Re/code Onion CEO Steve Hannah states, &quot;We have had follow-up conversations with numerous parties in recent months. Our advisors will continue to have those conversations and, hopefully, they will lead to the right outcome.&quot;

In June 2015 Steve Hannah—the publication&#x27;s CEO since 2004— stepped down from the position with the new CEO role passed onto current president of the organization, Mike McAvoy.

On September 21, 2015, &quot;StarWipe&quot;—a spinoff sister site of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; centered on celebrity culture—was launched. It was closed on June 17, 2016.

In October 2015, CEO Mike McAvoy announced a restructuring of the organization, layoffs as well as a series of management changes. &quot;But even though we&#x27;ve done well, we have not been able to keep pace with our ambitious goals for Onion Inc.&quot; Kurt Mueller—the company&#x27;s COO—elaborated on the details stating, &quot;We were overstaffed for the non-media-agency part of the business. We have less demand for a ton of new content for a brand. There&#x27;s demand, but we just overestimated what the demand is.&quot;

In January 2016, Univision Communications purchased a 40% stake in Onion, Inc. &quot;As an independent media company, we&#x27;ve always been forced to run a tight financial ship, which has made us smart and lean, but not always ready to invest in the great new ideas that we come up with,&quot; Mr. McAvoy said in a memo to staff. &quot;I&#x27;m excited to see what we can do with Univision behind us.&quot; This brings &quot;The Onion&quot; into the Fusion Media Group arm of Univision, the same media family as the Gizmodo collection of sites (Kotaku, Lifehacker, Deadspin, etc.), which also has led to a consolidated media management platform and aligned content presentation styles with these sister sites.

In January 2017, &quot;The Onion&quot; partnered with Lionsgate Films and production company Serious Business to develop multiple film projects. &quot;We&#x27;ve plotted our takeover of the film industry for some time&quot;, said Kyle Ryan, vice president of Onion Studios. &quot;With the help of Serious Business and Lionsgate, we&#x27;ll make room on our award shelf for some Oscars. To the basement you go, Pulitzers.&quot; Serious Business is a production company run by former UTA Online co-founder Jason U. Nadler, &quot;@midnight&quot; co-creator Jon Zimelis and writer/producer Alex Blagg.

In September 2017, the site&#x27;s editor-in-chief Cole Bolton and executive editor Ben Berkley stepped down from their posts. Chad Nackers—&quot;The Onion&quot;&#x27;s head writer—took over the role of editor-in-chief. The departures were partially due to disagreements about the direction the site was taking under the ownership of Univision.

In April 2018 the employees of the company unionized with The Writers Guild Of America, East. The union comprises &quot;all of the creative staffs at Onion Inc.: &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, &quot;The Onion&quot;, &quot;ClickHole&quot;, &quot;The Takeout&quot;, Onion Labs, and Onion Inc.&#x27;s video and art departments.&quot; and reached a contract agreement with management on December 20, 2018.

In July 2018, rumors of pending layoffs at &quot;The Onion&quot; and related websites &quot;Clickhole&quot; and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; were reported. Corporate parent Univision Communications is said to be looking to reduce the staff of the humor publication by around 15% amidst news of a pending sale of &quot;The Onion&quot; and related websites as well as Gizmodo Media Group assets. As stated an official Univision press release on the topic, &quot;Univision Communications Inc. (UCI) […] today announced that the Company has initiated a formal process to explore the sale of the assets comprising the Gizmodo Media Group (GMG) and &quot;The Onion&quot;.&quot;

On April 8, 2019, private equity firm Great Hill Partners acquired Gizmodo Media Group—including &quot;The Onion&quot;, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, and &quot;Clickhole&quot;—from Univision for an undisclosed amount. The properties were formed into a new company named G/O Media Inc. In March 2024, G/O sold The A.V. Club to Paste Magazine and was reported to be seeking buyers for &quot;The Onion&quot;.

On April 25, 2024, CEO Jim Spanfeller told employees that G/O had sold &quot;The Onion&quot; to Chicago firm Global Tetrahedron, which is owned by Twilio founder Jeff Lawson, with former NBC reporter Ben Collins serving as CEO. As a condition of the deal, the new owners will retain the website&#x27;s staff and keep it based in Chicago. The name &quot;Global Tetrahedron&quot; is taken from a &quot;fictional evil megacorporation&quot; that has been the subject of a running gag in &quot;The Onion&quot; articles.

On November 14, 2024, through a bankruptcy auction, parent company of &quot;The Onion&quot;, Global Tetrahedron, attempted to purchase &quot;InfoWars&quot;, a conspiratorial far-right website founded by Alex Jones, with the intent of turning the site into a parody of Jones&#x27;s conspiracy theories. The purchase was sanctioned by families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, who had successfully sued Jones for defamation. The purchase was initially halted the following day, and on December 10, the bankruptcy judge rejected the sale, concluding that the bidding process was flawed. No date has been set for a new auction, nor is an auction scheduled as of late.

====Print edition (1988–2013)====
During &quot;The Onion&quot; print edition&#x27;s 25-year run—from the publication&#x27;s initial creation in 1988 to the end of the print edition in 2013—it was distributed for free in various cities across the United States and Canada as well as via paid mail order subscription to subscribers around the world. By the time the print edition of &quot;The Onion&quot; ceased publication in December 2013, it was only available in Chicago, Milwaukee and Providence. At its peak, &quot;The Onion&quot; had a print circulation of about 500,000 while the publication&#x27;s websites brought in more than 10 million unique monthly visitors.

* Opinion columns, including mock editorials, point-counterpoints, and pieces from regular columnists.

* &quot;News in Photos&quot; that feature a photograph and caption with no accompanying story.
* &quot;American Voices&quot; (formerly called &quot;What Do You Think?&quot;), a mock vox populi survey on a topical current event. There are three respondents—down from the original six—for each topic, who appear to represent a diverse selection of demographics. Although their names and professions change each time they are used, the same six pictures have been reused weekly for over 20 years. The photos belong to people that happened to be near the publication&#x27;s old office in Madison: one is a Madison community theater actor, one used to work with The Onion&#x27;s CEO Chad Nackers at a restaurant, one delivered goods for UPS, and one is Mark Danielson&#x27;s aunt.
* An editorial cartoon drawn by &quot;Kelly&quot;, a fictional cartoonist. The cartoons are actually the work of artist Ward Sutton and they are a deadpan parody of conservative editorial cartoons, as well as editorial cartoons in general. Many of the cartoons feature the Statue of Liberty, usually shedding a single tear—of joy or anguish—depending on the situation.
* A Person of the Year award. For example, in 1996 the Denorex Man was chosen. For 2014, the Onion honored Malala Yousafzai and John Cena.

===&quot;Onion News Network&quot;===

In April 2007, &quot;The Onion&quot; launched &quot;Onion News Network&quot;—a daily web video broadcast—with a story about an illegal immigrant taking an executive&#x27;s $800,000-a-year job for $600,000 a year, directed by Dikkers. The publication reportedly initially invested about $1 million in the production and initially hired 15 new staffers to focus on the production of this video broadcast. On February 3, 2009, &quot;The Onion&quot; launched a spin-off of the &quot;Onion News Network&quot; called the &quot;Onion Sports Network.&quot;

In a &quot;Wikinews&quot; interview in November 2007, former &quot;Onion&quot; President Mills said the &quot;Onion News Network&quot; had been a huge hit. &quot;We get over a million downloads a week, which makes it one of the more successful produced-for-the-Internet videos&quot;, said Mills. &quot;If we&#x27;re not the most successful, we&#x27;re one of the most.&#x27;

In January 2011, &quot;The Onion&quot; launched two TV shows on cable networks: &quot;Onion SportsDome&quot; which premiered January 11 on Comedy Central, and the &quot;Onion News Network&quot; which premiered January 21 on Independent Film Channel (IFC). Later in the year IFC officially announced the renewal of the &quot;Onion News Network&quot; for a second season in March 2011 while Comedy Central officially announced the cancellation of &quot;Onion SportsDome&quot; in June 2011.

In August 2011, the Writers Guild of America, East, AFL–CIO, announced the unionization of the &quot;Onion News Network&quot; writing staff, averting a potential strike which hinged on pay and benefits. It is also not the first time Onion, Inc. has been criticized for the way it treats its employees: In June 2011 &quot;A.V. Club&quot; Philadelphia city editor Emily Guendelsberger was the victim of an attack and—according to the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;—her job did not provide health insurance to cover hospital bills. According to the WGA, &quot;Onion News Network&quot; was the only scripted, live-action program that had employed non-union writers. &quot;The ONN writers stood together and won real improvements&quot;, said WGAE Executive Director Lowell Peterson. &quot;We welcome them into the WGAE and we look forward to a productive relationship with the company.&quot; Peterson noted that more than 70 Guild members from all of the New York-based comedy shows signed a letter supporting the &quot;Onion News Network&quot; writers, and hundreds of Guild members sent emails to the producers.

In March 2012, IFC officially announced the cancellation of the &quot;Onion News Network&quot;. After the show&#x27;s cancellation, a pilot for a new comedy series titled &quot;Onion News Empire&quot; premiered on Amazon.com in April 2013, which presented as a behind-the-scenes look of &quot;The Onion&quot;″s newsroom. The pilot was one of several candidates for production on Amazon, but was not ultimately selected.

In September 2024, &quot;The Onion&quot; relaunched the &quot;Onion News Network&quot; on its YouTube page, starring former MSNBC host Joshua Johnson as ONN anchor Dwight Richmond.

===&quot;The Onion Movie&quot;===

&quot;The Onion Movie&quot; is a direct-to-video film written by then-&quot;Onion&quot; editor Robert D. Siegel and writer Todd Hanson and directed by Tom Kuntz and Mike Maguire. Created in 2003, Fox Searchlight Pictures was on board to release the movie, originally called &quot;The Untitled Onion Movie&quot;, but at some point in the process, directors Kuntz and Maguire—as well as writer Siegel—walked away from the project. In 2006, New Regency Productions took over the production of the troubled project. After two years of being in limbo, the film was released directly on DVD on June 3, 2008. Upon its release it was credited as being directed under the pseudonym of James Kleiner but is still directed by Kuntz and Maguire.

In the spring of 2014, former president, publisher, and CEO of &quot;The Onion&quot; Peter Haise filed a lawsuit Palm Beach County court against the publication&#x27;s current chairman David K. Schafer regarding a missing &quot;Executive Producer&quot; credit on the failed film. As stated in the lawsuit, &quot;Onion, Inc. has admitted that Haise was involved in and should have been named as an Executive Producer of the Film, and that the omission in the credits listed for the Film was an error.&quot;

===&quot;Onion Radio News&quot;===
The &quot;Onion Radio News&quot; was an audio podcast/radio show produced by &quot;The Onion&quot; from 1999 and 2009. The core voice of the podcast was that of a fictional newsreader named &quot;Doyle Redland&quot; who was voiced by Pete S. Mueller. At its peak &quot;Onion Radio News&quot; was picked up by the Westwood One radio network as well as Audible.com.

===Onion Public Radio===
On February 5, 2018, &quot;The Onion&quot; published its first podcast, titled &quot;A Very Fatal Murder&quot;. It was released in six parts and parodies other true crime podcasts such as &quot;Serial&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Murder&quot;. The story follows Onion Public Radio reporter David Pascall (voiced by David Sidorov) as he tries to investigate the murder of a 17-year-old girl named Hayley Price in the fictional town of Bluff Springs, Nebraska.

On January 16, 2020, &quot;The Onion&quot; expanded its podcast formula to include &quot;The Topical&quot;, in a partnership with Sony Music. &quot;The Topical&quot; was a satirical news podcast which parodies the style and format of NPR drive-time news broadcasts and &quot;The Daily&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot;. It was hosted by a fictional Leslie Price, with its final episode on May 20, 2021.

==Influence and controversies==
===Taken seriously===
Occasionally, the straight-faced manner in which &quot;The Onion&quot; reports non-existent events, happenings and ideas has resulted in mistakenly citing &quot;The Onion&quot; stories as real news.
* 98 Homosexual-Recruitment Drive Nearing Goal&quot;: In 1998, Fred Phelps posted &quot;The Onion&quot; article on his Westboro Baptist Church website as apparent &quot;proof&quot; that homosexuals were indeed actively trying to &quot;recruit&quot; others to be gay.
* &quot;Congress Passes Americans With No Abilities Act&quot;: At various times since the article&#x27;s initial publication in 1998, variants of the &quot;Americans With No Abilities Act&quot; article and theme have been passed around online including a variant in 2009 that changed the stated U.S. president from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama as well as a 2007 variant that changed the country from the United States of America to Australia.
* &quot;Harry Potter Books Spark Rise in Satanism Among Children&quot;: Beginning in the year 2000, an article on Harry Potter inciting children to practice witchcraft was the subject of a widely forwarded email which repeated the quotes attributed to children in the article. Columnist Ellen Makkai and others who believe the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books &quot;recruit&quot; children to Satanism have also been taken in by the article, using quotes directly from it to support their claims.
* &quot;Congress Threatens To Leave D.C. Unless New Capitol Is Built&quot;: On June 7, 2002, Reuters reported that the &quot;Beijing Evening News&quot; republished and translated portions of the article. The article is a parody of U.S. sports franchises&#x27; threats to leave their home city unless new stadiums are built for them. The &quot;Beijing Evening News&quot; initially stood by the story, demanding proof of its falsehood but later retracted the article, responding that &quot;...some small American newspapers frequently fabricate offbeat news to trick people into noticing them with the aim of making money.&quot;
* &quot;Prague&#x27;s Franz Kafka International Named World&#x27;s Most Alienating Airport&quot;: On the March 24, 2009, broadcast of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Fallon&#x27;s monologue used the topic of that specific &quot;Onion News Network&quot; video as a set-up for another joke claiming the report was based on a &quot;study&quot;.
* &quot;Conspiracy Theorist Convinces Neil Armstrong Moon Landing Was Faked&quot;: In September 2009, two Bangladeshi newspapers—&quot;The Daily Manab Zamin&quot; and the &quot;New Nation&quot;—published stories translated from &quot;The Onion&quot; claiming that astronaut Neil Armstrong had held a news conference claiming the Moon landing was an elaborate hoax.
* &quot;Denmark Introduces Harrowing New Tourism Ads Directed By Lars Von Trier&quot;: In February 2010, online newspapers such as &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot; (Italy) and &quot;Adresseavisen&quot; (Norway) repackaged clips from &quot;The Onion&quot; video piece as legitimate news.
* &quot;Frustrated Obama Sends Nation Rambling 75,000-Word E-Mail&quot;: In November 2010, the Fox Nation website presented &quot;The Onion&quot; article as a genuine report.
* &quot;Congress Takes Group Of Schoolchildren Hostage&quot;: In September 2011, United States Capitol Police investigated a series of tweets coming from &quot;The Onion&quot;″s Twitter account claiming that U.S. congressmen were holding twelve children hostage.
* &quot;Obama Openly Asks Nation Why On Earth He Would Want To Serve For Another Term&quot;: On January 7, 2012, Lim Hwee Hua—a former Singaporean MP—posted the article on her Facebook page.
* &quot;Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex&quot;: On February 3, 2012, U.S. Congressman John Fleming (R-Louisiana) posted a link to the article on his Facebook page.
* &quot;Gallup Poll: Rural Whites Prefer Ahmadinejad to Obama&quot;: On September 28, 2012, Iran&#x27;s Fars News Agency copied &quot;The Onion&quot; story verbatim on their website. &quot;The Onion&quot; updated the original story with the note: &quot;For more on this story: Please visit our Iranian subsidiary organization, Fars&quot;, linking to a screenshot of Fars&#x27;s coverage of the story.
* &quot;Kim Jong-Un Named &quot;The Onion&#x27;s&quot; Sexiest Man Alive For 2012&quot;: On November 27, 2012, the online version of the Chinese Communist Party newspaper &quot;The People&#x27;s Daily&quot; ran a story on Kim Jong-un, citing &quot;The Onion&#x27;s&quot; article as a source and even included a 55-page photo gallery with the article in tribute to the North Korean leader.
* &quot;Fred Phelps, Man Who Forever Stopped March Of Gay Rights, Dead At 84&quot;: In March 2014, Ed Farrell—the Vice Mayor of Maricopa, Arizona—apologized for inadvertently and enthusiastically praising Fred Phelps via a post of the satirical obituary on his Facebook page. In an interview about his Facebook post Farrell apologized for doing it, stating &quot;I had no clue about this guy; he&#x27;s an idiot. I can&#x27;t believe that I posted what I posted [...] shame on me.&quot;
* &quot;FIFA Frantically Announces 2015 Summer World Cup In United States&quot;: In May 2015, the former FIFA vice president Jack Warner—who was arrested on corruption charges that same month—drew attention to &quot;The Onion&quot; article by reporting it as real news in a video on Facebook.
* &quot;Study: Every 10 Seconds A Skyscraper Window Washer Falls To His Death&quot;: In September 2018, Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić made the statement commenting on the death of two workers who died working on the Belgrade Waterfront construction site. He expressed his condolences to the families, but said that &quot;in Serbia, there are proportionally a lot less accidents in dangerous jobs, such as construction. As for the allegations aimed against the state, I want to tell the citizens—even though I did not want to speak about it—that I read some data. Did you know that, in America, every ten seconds one window washer dies doing his job?&quot;.
* &quot;CIA Issues Posthumous Apology After New Evidence Clears Osama Bin Laden Of Involvement In 9/11 Attacks&quot;: On October 13, 2019, former Inspector-General of the Royal Malaysian Police Musa Hassan received criticism after promoting the titled post as real news on Twitter, and then doubling down when other Twitter users pointed out the satirical nature of the site, remarking &quot;Wait for The Onion to deny it. If not, it means that America allows the spreading of fake news.&quot;

===As a political actor===
Several commentators have characterized &quot;The Onion&quot;″s satire as overtly political. Noreen Malone characterized the publication as having a left-leaning outlook by stating:

Malone—like other pundits—specifically noted the publication&#x27;s sharp take on the Syrian Civil War, with David Weigel characterizing the publication&#x27;s stance as effectively being &quot;…advocacy for intervention in Syria.&quot; Weigel attributed the trend toward more news satire—including political news satire—as being a byproduct of the publication&#x27;s shorter turnaround times after the Internet edition became the main outlet for the publication&#x27;s voice, endangering &quot;The Onion&quot; of becoming a &quot;…hivemind version of Andy Borowitz, telling liberals that what they already think is not only true but oh-so-arch.&quot; &quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s Farhad Manjoo similarly attributed the publication&#x27;s &quot;…faster, bigger, more strident, and, to me, a little inconsistent…&quot; vibe to the exigencies of the Internet.

Emmett Rensin claimed &quot;The Onion&quot; was &quot;the paper most dedicated to the overthrowing capitalism in the United States&quot;, and &quot;represents some latent Marxism in our culture&quot;, citing examples of what he saw as &quot;The Onion&quot;&#x27;s indictments of false consciousness, commodity fetishization and valorization of the invisible hand. Rensin attributes the material to the humorists&#x27; need to work from &quot;obvious, intuitive truth—the kind necessary for any kind of broadly appealing humor&quot; rather than a conscious decision to promote Marxism or any &quot;explicit support for a communist solution&quot;.

Some of the publication&#x27;s political impact is unintentional. For example, the &quot;Onion&quot;″s long-running caricature of Joe Biden as a blue-collar &quot;creepy but harmless uncle&quot; character is often believed to have positively affected the real Joe Biden&#x27;s public image. In May 2019, the former &quot;Onion&quot; editor Joe Garden published an op-ed in &quot;Vice&quot; to express his regret over the character, which he felt had distracted from serious concerns about Biden&#x27;s political record and personal behavior.

In 2017, President Donald Trump expressed confidence that his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom he had just appointed as an advisor on foreign affairs, could bring peace to the Middle East. An Onion article then made fun of the idealistic way in which Trump treated the long, complicated and bloody conflict as a mere organisational issue he could delegate, reporting that peace between Israel and Arabia was just too big for Kushner to achieve within the already started office week and now had to be shifted into the subsequent week. The article was then passed around by White House staffers who were apparently alienated by Kushner&#x27;s appointment.

===U.S. Presidential Seal dispute===

In September 2005, the assistant counsel to President George W. Bush, Grant M. Dixton, wrote a cease-and-desist letter to &quot;The Onion&quot;, asking the publication to stop using the presidential seal, which it used in an online parody of Bush.

&quot;The Onion&quot; responded with a formal request to use the seal in accordance with the executive order, while maintaining that its use was legitimate. The letter stated, &quot;It is inconceivable that anyone would think that, by using the seal, &quot;The Onion&quot; intends to &#x27;convey... sponsorship or approval&#x27; by the president&quot;, but then went on to ask that the letter be considered a formal application requesting permission to use the seal.

===85th Academy Awards controversy===
During the 85th Academy Awards, a post on &quot;The Onion&quot;″s Twitter account called 9-year-old Best Actress nominee Quvenzhané Wallis &quot;a cunt&quot;. The post was deleted within an hour, but not before hundreds of angry responses. CEO Steve Hannah issued an apology to Wallis and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, calling the remarks &quot;crude and offensive&quot; and &quot;No person should be subjected to such a senseless, humorless comment masquerading as satire.&quot; Scott Dikkers—who was Vice President Creative Development for the publication at the time—said in an interview with NBC 5 Chicago that the publication had sent an apology note to Quvenzhané and her family but also stated, &quot;She&#x27;s a big star now. I think she can take it.&quot; The publication&#x27;s public apology was denounced by some former &quot;Onion&quot; writers, with one stating, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a great joke, but big deal.&quot;

===Murder of The Big Show===
On June 16, 2017, &quot;The Onion&quot; featured an article describing professional wrestler The Big Show being killed by WWE after a seven-year-old boy wandered into a steel cage during a live event in Indianapolis. The article, meant to lampoon the real-life killing of Harambe, a gorilla in a Cincinnati zoo, received criticism for satirizing the murder of an actual person as well as leading some fans to believe Big Show was dead.

===&quot;Amicus&quot; brief in &quot;Novak v. City of Parma&quot;===
On October 3, 2022, &quot;The Onion&quot; filed its first &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of &quot;Novak v. City of Parma&quot;. &quot;The Onion&quot; supported the &quot;certiorari&quot; petition of Anthony Novak, who was seeking civil damages after having been arrested and unsuccessfully prosecuted over a Facebook page parodying the page of the Parma Police Department. &quot;The Onion&quot; brief contained numerous jokes, including a claimed readership of 4.3 trillion, a remark that &quot;the federal judiciary is staffed entirely by total Latin dorks&quot;, and a boast regarding Jonathan Swift that &quot;its writers are far more talented, and their output will be read long after that hack Swift&#x27;s has been lost to the sands of time&quot;. The brief noted the paper&#x27;s Latin motto as (&quot;You are stupid&quot;).

<doc id="30814" wikidata="Q191827" url="?curid=30814" title="Taoiseach">
<text>The Taoiseach (, ) is the head of government or prime minister of Ireland. The office is appointed by the President of Ireland upon nomination by Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Oireachtas, Ireland&#x27;s national legislature) and the office-holder must retain the support of a majority in the Dáil to remain in office.

The Irish word &quot;&quot; means &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;leader&quot;, and was adopted in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland as the title of the &quot;head of the Government or Prime Minister&quot;. It is the official title of the head of government in both English and Irish, and is not used for the prime ministers of other countries, who are instead referred to in Irish by the generic term . The phrase &quot;an Taoiseach&quot; is sometimes used in an otherwise English-language context, and means the same as &quot;the Taoiseach&quot;.

The incumbent Taoiseach is Micheál Martin, TD, leader of Fianna Fáil, who took office on 23 January 2025, following the 2024 general election and an agreement between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and independent TDs.

==Overview==

Under the Constitution of Ireland, the Taoiseach is nominated by a simple majority of the voting members of Dáil Éireann. They are then formally appointed to office by the President, who is required to appoint whomever the Dáil designates, without the option of declining to make the appointment. For this reason, the Taoiseach may, informally, be said to have been &quot;elected&quot; by Dáil Éireann.

If the Taoiseach loses the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann, they are not automatically removed from office. Instead, they are compelled either to resign or to persuade the President to dissolve the Dáil and call new elections. If the President &quot;in his absolute discretion&quot; refuses to grant a dissolution, this effectively forces the Taoiseach to resign. To date, no President has ever refused a dissolution, although the option to exercise this prerogative arose in 1944 and 1994, and twice in 1982. The Taoiseach may lose the support of Dáil Éireann by the passage of a vote of no confidence, or implicitly, through the failure of a vote of confidence. Alternatively, the Dáil may refuse supply. In the event of the Taoiseach&#x27;s resignation, they continue to exercise the duties and functions of office until the appointment of a successor.

The Taoiseach nominates the remaining members of the Government, who are then, with the consent of the Dáil, appointed by the President. The Taoiseach may advise the President to dismiss cabinet ministers from office; which the President does not have discretion on. The Taoiseach is responsible for appointing eleven members of the sixty members of the Seanad.

The Department of the Taoiseach is the government department which supports and advises the Taoiseach in carrying out their various duties. The Taoiseach is assisted by one or more Ministers of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, one of whom is the Government Chief Whip.

===Salary===
Since 2013, the Taoiseach&#x27;s annual salary is €185,350. It was cut from €214,187 to €200,000 when Enda Kenny took office, before being cut further to €185,350 under the Haddington Road Agreement in 2013.

A proposed increase of €38,000 in 2007 was deferred when Brian Cowen became Taoiseach and in October 2008, the government announced a 10% salary cut for all ministers, including the Taoiseach. However this was a voluntary cut and the salaries remained nominally the same with both ministers and Taoiseach essentially refusing 10% of their salary. This caused controversy in December 2009 when a salary cut of 20% was based on the higher figure before the refused amount was deducted. The Taoiseach is also allowed an additional €118,981 in annual expenses.

===Residence===
There is no official residence of the Taoiseach. In 2008, it was reported speculatively that the former Steward&#x27;s Lodge at Farmleigh adjoining the Phoenix Park would become the official residence of the Taoiseach. However, no official statements were made nor any action taken. The house, which forms part of the Farmleigh estate acquired by the State in 1999 for €29.2 million, was renovated at a cost of nearly €600,000 in 2005 by the Office of Public Works. Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern did not use it as a residence, but his successor Brian Cowen used it occasionally, as did later Taoisigh Enda Kenny and Leo Varadkar, who each paid €50 per night for the use of the house to avoid benefit-in-kind tax being levied on them for use of the house as a grace and favour mansion.

===Salute===
&quot;&quot; (&quot;More of Cloyne&quot;) is a traditional air collected by Patrick Weston Joyce in 1873. &quot;Amhrán Dóchais&quot; (&quot;Song of Hope&quot;) is a poem written by Osborn Bergin in 1913. John A. Costello chose the air as his musical salute. The salute is played by army bands on the arrival of the Taoiseach at state ceremonies. Though the salute is often called &quot;, Brian Ó Cuív argued &quot; is the correct title.

==History==
===Origins and etymology===
The words and (deputy prime minister) are both from the Irish language and of ancient origin. Though the Taoiseach is described in the Constitution of Ireland as &quot;the head of the Government or Prime Minister&quot;, its literal translation is or . Although Éamon de Valera, who introduced the title in 1937, was a democratic politician who had in the past associated with paramilitaries, some have remarked that the meaning in 1937 made the title similar to the titles of fascist dictators of the time, such as (for Adolf Hitler), (for Benito Mussolini) and (for Francisco Franco). , in turn, refers to the system of tanistry, the Gaelic system of succession whereby a leader would appoint an heir apparent while still living.

In Scottish Gaelic, translates as &#x27;clan chief&#x27; and both words originally had similar meanings in the Gaelic languages of Scotland and Ireland. The related Welsh language word (current meaning: &#x27;prince&#x27;) has a similar origin and meaning. It is hypothesised that both derive ultimately from the proto-Celtic &#x27;chieftain, leader&#x27;.

The plural of is ( , ).

Although the Irish form is sometimes used in English instead of &#x27;the Taoiseach&#x27;, the English version of the Constitution states that they &quot;shall be called … the Taoiseach&quot;.

===Debate on the title===
In 1937 when the draft Constitution of Ireland was being debated in the Dáil, Frank MacDermot, an opposition politician, moved an amendment to substitute &quot;Prime Minister&quot; for the proposed &quot;Taoiseach&quot; title in the English text of the Constitution. It was proposed to keep the &quot;Taoiseach&quot; title in the Irish language text. The proponent remarked:
The President of the Executive Council, Éamon de Valera, gave the term&#x27;s meaning as &quot;chieftain&quot; or &quot;Captain&quot;. He said he was &quot;not disposed&quot; to support the proposed amendment and felt the word &quot;Taoiseach&quot; did not need to be changed. The proposed amendment was defeated on a vote and &quot;Taoiseach&quot; was included as the title ultimately adopted by plebiscite of the people.

===Modern office===

The modern position of Taoiseach was established by the 1937 Constitution of Ireland and is the most powerful role in Irish politics. The office replaced the position of President of the Executive Council of the 1922–1937 Irish Free State.

The positions of Taoiseach and President of the Executive Council differed in certain fundamental respects. Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the latter was vested with considerably less power and was largely just the chairman of the cabinet, the Executive Council. For example, the President of the Executive Council could not dismiss a fellow minister on his own authority. Instead, the Executive Council had to be disbanded and reformed entirely to remove a member. The President of the Executive Council also did not have the right to advise the Governor-General to dissolve Dáil Éireann on his own authority, that power belonging collectively to the Executive Council.

In contrast, the Taoiseach created in 1937 possesses a much more powerful role. The holder of the position can both advise the President to dismiss ministers and dissolve Parliament on his own authority—advice that the President is almost always required to follow by convention. His role is greatly enhanced because, under the Constitution, he is both and chief executive. In most other parliamentary democracies, the head of state is at least the nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In Ireland, however, executive power is explicitly vested in the Government, of which the Taoiseach is the leader.

Since the Taoiseach is the head of government, and may remove ministers at will, many of the powers specified, in law or the constitution, to be exercised by the government as a collective body, are in reality at the will of the Taoiseach. The Government almost always backs the Taoiseach in major decisions, and in many cases often merely formalises that decision at a subsequent meeting after it has already been announced. Nevertheless, the need for collective decision-making on paper acts as a safeguard against an unwise decision made by the Taoiseach.

Generally, where there have been multi-party or coalition governments, the Taoiseach has been the leader of the largest party in the coalition. One exception to this was John A. Costello, who was not the leader of his party, but an agreed choice to head the government, because the other parties refused to accept then Fine Gael leader Richard Mulcahy as Taoiseach. In 2011 Taoiseach Brian Cowen, resigned as party leader and was succeeded by Micheál Martin, but continued as Taoiseach until the formation of a new government following a general election.

Following the 2020 election, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael entered coalition together for the first time. The two agreed to rotate the role of Taoiseach, with Micheál Martin going first before being replaced by Leo Varadkar, and later Simon Harris, of the smaller Fine Gael party. The two parties opted to continue this rotating role after the 2024 election.

==List of office holders==

Before the enactment of the 1937 Constitution, the head of government was the President of the Executive Council. This office was held by W. T. Cosgrave of Cumann na nGaedheal from 1922 to 1932, and by Éamon de Valera of Fianna Fáil from 1932 to 1937. By convention, Taoisigh are numbered to include Cosgrave; therefore, Micheál Martin is considered the 15th Taoiseach, not the 14th.

<doc id="30816" wikidata="Q541347" url="?curid=30816" title="Tree rotation">
<text>In discrete mathematics, tree rotation is an operation on a binary tree that changes the structure without interfering with the order of the elements. A tree rotation moves one node up in the tree and one node down. It is used to change the shape of the tree, and in particular to decrease its height by moving smaller subtrees down and larger subtrees up, resulting in improved performance of many tree operations.

There exists an inconsistency in different descriptions as to the definition of the direction of rotations. Some say that the direction of rotation reflects the direction that a node is moving upon rotation (a left child rotating into its parent&#x27;s location is a right rotation) while others say that the direction of rotation reflects which subtree is rotating (a left subtree rotating into its parent&#x27;s location is a left rotation, the opposite of the former). This article takes the approach of the directional movement of the rotating node.

==Illustration==

The right rotation operation as shown in the adjacent image is performed with &quot;Q&quot; as the root and hence is a right rotation on, or rooted at, &quot;Q&quot;. This operation results in a rotation of the tree in the clockwise direction. The inverse operation is the left rotation, which results in a movement in a counter-clockwise direction (the left rotation shown above is rooted at &quot;P&quot;). The key to understanding how a rotation functions is to understand its constraints. In particular the order of the leaves of the tree (when read left to right for example) cannot change (another way to think of it is that the order that the leaves would be visited in an in-order traversal must be the same after the operation as before). Another constraint is the main property of a binary search tree, namely that all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the parent and all nodes in the left subtree are less than the parent. Notice that the right child of a left child of the root of a sub-tree (for example node B in the diagram for the tree rooted at Q) can become the left child of the root, that itself becomes the right child of the &quot;new&quot; root in the rotated sub-tree, without violating either of those constraints. As seen in the diagram, the order of the leaves doesn&#x27;t change. The opposite operation also preserves the order and is the second kind of rotation.

Assuming this is a binary search tree, as stated above, the elements must be interpreted as variables that can be compared to each other. The alphabetic characters to the left are used as placeholders for these variables. In the animation to the right, capital alphabetic characters are used as variable placeholders while lowercase Greek letters are placeholders for an entire set of variables. The circles represent individual nodes and the triangles represent subtrees. Each subtree could be empty, consist of a single node, or consist of any number of nodes.

==Detailed illustration==
When a subtree is rotated, the subtree side upon which it is rotated increases its height by one node while the other subtree decreases its height. This makes tree rotations useful for rebalancing a tree.

Consider the terminology of Root for the parent node of the subtrees to rotate, Pivot for the node which will become the new parent node, RS for the side of rotation and OS for the opposite side of rotation. For the root Q in the diagram above, RS is C and OS is P. Using these terms, the pseudo code for the rotation is:

 let Pivot = Root.OS
 Root.OS = Pivot.RS
 Pivot.RS = Root
 Root = Pivot

This is a constant time operation.

The programmer must also make sure that the root&#x27;s parent points to the pivot after the rotation. Also, the programmer should note that this operation may result in a new root for the entire tree and take care to update pointers accordingly.

==Inorder invariance==
The tree rotation renders the inorder traversal of the binary tree invariant. This implies the order of the elements is not affected when a rotation is performed in any part of the tree. Here are the inorder traversals of the trees shown above:

Computing one from the other is very simple. The following is example Python code that performs that computation:
def right_rotation(treenode):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Rotate the specified tree to the right.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 left, Q, C = treenode
 A, P, B = left
 return (A, P, (B, Q, C))
Another way of looking at it is:

Right rotation of node Q:

Left rotation of node P:

All other connections are left as-is.

There are also &quot;double rotations&quot;, which are combinations of left and right rotations. A &quot;double left&quot; rotation at X can be defined to be a right rotation at the right child of X followed by a left rotation at X; similarly, a &quot;double right&quot; rotation at X can be defined to be a left rotation at the left child of X followed by a right rotation at X.

Tree rotations are used in a number of tree data structures such as AVL trees, red–black trees, WAVL trees, splay trees, and treaps. They require only constant time because they are &quot;local&quot; transformations: they only operate on 5 nodes, and need not examine the rest of the tree.

==Rotations for rebalancing==
A tree can be rebalanced using rotations. After a rotation, the side of the rotation increases its height by 1 whilst the side opposite the rotation decreases its height similarly. Therefore, one can strategically apply rotations to nodes whose left child and right child differ in height by more than 1. Self-balancing binary search trees apply this operation automatically. A type of tree which uses this rebalancing technique is the AVL tree.

==Rotation distance==
The rotation distance between any two binary trees with the same number of nodes is the minimum number of rotations needed to transform one into the other. With this distance, the set of &quot;n&quot;-node binary trees becomes a metric space: the distance is symmetric, positive when given two different trees, and satisfies the triangle inequality.

It is an open problem whether there exists a polynomial time algorithm for calculating rotation distance, though several variants of the rotation distance problem admit polynomial time algorithms.

Daniel Sleator, Robert Tarjan and William Thurston showed that the rotation distance between any two &quot;n&quot;-node trees (for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 11) is at most 2&quot;n&quot; − 6, and that some pairs of trees are this far apart as soon as &quot;n&quot; is sufficiently large. Lionel Pournin showed that, in fact, such pairs exist whenever &quot;n&quot; ≥ 11.

<doc id="30830" wikidata="Q2529982" url="?curid=30830" title="The New York Times Company">
<text>The New York Times Company is an American mass media corporation that publishes &quot;The New York Times&quot; and its associated publications such as &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot; and other media properties. The New York Times Company&#x27;s headquarters are in The New York Times Building, a skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City.

== History ==
The company was founded by Henry Jarvis Raymond and George Jones in New York City. The first edition of the newspaper &quot;The New York Times&quot;, published on September 18, 1851, stated: &quot;We publish today the first issue of the New-York Daily Times, and we intend to issue it every morning (Sundays excepted) for an indefinite number of years to come.&quot;

The company moved into the cable channel industry, purchasing a 40% interest in the Popcorn Channel, a theatrical movie preview and local movie times, in November 1994. In 1996, it expanded upon its broadcasting by purchasing Palmer Communications, owners of WHO-DT in Des Moines and KFOR in Oklahoma City.

In April of 2002, The New York Times Company and Discovery Communications announced a joint venture television network called Discovery Times, although this was just a rename of the Discovery Civilization Network. The company completed its purchase of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; 50 percent interest in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; (&quot;IHT&quot;) for US$65 million on January 1, 2003, becoming the sole owner.

On March 18, 2005, the company acquired About.com, an online provider of consumer information, for US$410 million. In 2005, the company reported revenues of US$3.4 billion to its investors. The Times, on August 25, 2006, acquired Baseline StudioSystems, an online database and research service on the film and television industries for US$35 million.

In 2006, The Times sold their stake in Discovery Times to Discovery. The channel was relaunched as Investigation Discovery two years later. The company announced on September 12, 2006, its decision to sell its Broadcast Media Group, consisting of &quot;nine network-affiliated television stations, their related Web sites and the digital operating center&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on January 4, 2007, that the company had reached an agreement to sell all nine local television stations to the private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners, which then created a holding company for the stations, Local TV LLC. The company announced that it had finalized the sale of its Broadcast Media Group on May 7, 2007, for &quot;approximately $575 million&quot;.

On May 7, 2007, the company announced that its About.com web information service was acquiring Consumersearch.com, a Web site that compiles reviews of consumer products, for $33 million in cash. In 2007, the company moved from 229 West 43rd Street to the New York Times Building at 620 Eighth Avenue, on the west side of Times Square, between 40th and 41st streets across from the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey Bus Terminal.

On July 14, 2009, the company announced that WQXR was to be sold to WNYC, which moved the station to 105.9 FM and began to operate the station noncommercially on October 8, 2009. This US$45 million transaction, which involved Univision Radio&#x27;s WCAA moving to the 96.3 FM frequency from 105.9 FM, ended the Times&#x27; 65-year-long ownership of the station.

In December 2011, the company sold its Regional Media Group to Halifax Media Group, owners of &quot;The Daytona Beach News-Journal&quot;, for $143 million. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;The Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; of Worcester were not part of the sale. In 2011, the Times sold Baseline StudioSystems back to its original owners, Laurie S. Silvers and Mitchell Rubenstein, majority shareholders of Project Hollywood LLC.

Facing falling revenue from print advertising in its flagship publication in 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the company introduced a paywall to its website. As of 2012, it had been modestly successful, garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100 million in annual revenue.

In 2013, the New York Times Company sold &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and other New England media properties to John W. Henry, the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox. According to the Times Company, the move was made in order to focus more on its core brands.

After forming an editorial partnership with the New York Times in 2015, The Wirecutter was acquired by the Times in October 2016 for a reported $30 million. In March 2020, the New York Times Company acquired subscription-based audio app, Audm. In July 2020, the New York Times Company acquired podcast production company Serial Productions. The same month, the company appointed chief operating officer Meredith Kopit Levien to the position of CEO. In February 2022, the New York Times Company bought &quot;The Athletic&quot;, a subscription-based sports news website, for $550 million. Its founders, Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann, stayed with the publication, which is run separately from the &quot;Times&quot;. 

Later that month, the Times acquired Wordle, an Internet word puzzle game that grew from 90 players in October 2021 to millions at the time of purchase. ValueAct Capital took a stake in the company in August 2022. ValueAct aims to encourage the company to more actively pursue the sale of &quot;bundled&quot; subscriptions to its various offerings.

=== Radio stations ===

The paper bought AM radio station WQXR (1560kHz) in 1944. Its &quot;sister&quot; FM station, WQXQ, became WQXR-FM (96.3MHz). Branded as &quot;The Stereo Stations of &quot;The New York Times&quot;&quot;, its classical music radio format was simulcast on both the AM &amp; FM frequencies until December 1992, when the big-band and pop standards music format of station WNEW (1130kHz – now WBBR/&quot;Bloomberg Radio&quot;) was transferred to and adopted by WQXR; in recognition of the format change, WQXR changed its call letters to WQEW (a &quot;hybrid&quot; combination of &quot;WQXR&quot; and &quot;WNEW&quot;). By 1999, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was leasing WQEW to ABC Radio for its &quot;Radio Disney&quot; format. In 2007, WQEW was finally purchased by Disney; in late 2014, it was sold to Family Radio (a religious radio network) and became WFME. In 2009, WQXR-FM was sold to the WNYC radio group and, on October 8, moved from 96.3 to 105.9MHz (swapping frequencies with Spanish-language station WXNY-FM, which wanted the more powerful transmitter to increase its coverage) and began operating it as a noncommercial, public radio station.

== Holdings ==
Alongside its namesake newspaper, the company owns &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot; and related digital properties including NYTimes.com, as well as various brand-related properties.

== Ownership and leadership ==
Since September 25, 1997, the company has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NYT. From April 27, 1967, until January 13, 1969, the company&#x27;s Class A common stock traded over the counter. From January 14, 1969, until September 24, 1997, the shares were traded on the American Stock Exchange. Of the two categories of stock, Class A and Class B, the former is publicly traded and the latter is held privately—largely (over 90% through The 1997 Trust) by the descendants of Adolph Ochs, who purchased &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper in 1896.

=== Carlos Slim loan and investment ===
On January 20, 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that its parent company, the New York Times Company, had reached an agreement to borrow $250million from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, &quot;to help the newspaper company finance its businesses&quot;. The New York Times Company later repaid that loan ahead of schedule. Since then, Slim has bought large quantities of the company&#x27;s Class A shares, which are available for purchase by the public and offer less control over the company than Class B shares, which are privately held. Slim&#x27;s investments in the company included large purchases of Class A shares in 2011, when he increased his stake in the company to 8.1% of Class A shares, and again in 2015, when he exercised stock options—acquired as part of a repayment plan on the 2009 loan—to purchase 15.9million Class A shares, making him the largest shareholder. As of March 7, 2016, Slim owned 17.4% of the company&#x27;s Class A shares, according to annual filings submitted by the company. While Slim is the largest shareholder in the company, his investment only allows him to vote for Class A directors, a third of the company&#x27;s board.

== Community awards ==
The company sponsors a series of national and local awards designed to highlight the achievements of individuals and organizations in different realms.

In 2007, it inaugurated its first Nonprofit Excellence Award, awarded to four organizations &quot;for the excellence of their management practices&quot;. Only nonprofits in New York City, Long Island, or Westchester were eligible.

Jointly with the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the American Library Association, the New York Times Company sponsors an award to honor librarians &quot;for service to their communities&quot;. The &quot;I Love My Librarian!&quot; award was given to ten recipients in December 2008, and presented by the New York Times Company president and CEO Janet L. Robinson, Carnegie Corporation president Vartan Gregorian, and Jim Rettig, president of the American Library Association. The award has been given to ten exceptional librarians annually since that date.

In May 2009, the company launched The New York Times Outstanding Playwright Award to honor an American playwright who had recently had his or her professional debut in New York. The first winner was Tarell Alvin McCraney for his play &quot;The Brothers Size&quot;. In 2010, Dan LeFranc won for his play &quot;Sixty Miles to Silver Lake&quot;.

<text>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (colloquially known as the Bucs) are a professional American football team based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. They joined the NFL in as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division.

Prior to the season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division. The Seahawks eventually rejoined the NFC in 2002, leaving the Buccaneers as the only NFL team not to play in their original conference. As a result of the league&#x27;s realignment prior to the season, the Buccaneers joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The team is owned by the Glazer family and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

The Buccaneers have won two Super Bowl championships and, along with the Baltimore Ravens, are the only two NFL franchises that are undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances. They were regarded as a perennial losing franchise for most of their first two decades due to suffering 26 consecutive losses in their first two seasons (including a winless inaugural season) and 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1983 to 1996—the most in NFL history—contributing to their league-worst overall winning percentage of .41.

Despite these early struggles, Tampa Bay is the first post-merger expansion team to clinch a division title, win a playoff game, and host a conference championship, all of which they accomplished by their fourth season in 1979. The team&#x27;s image improved by the time of their first championship in 2002, also the first for any of the six organizations built after the merger, but they would not win another playoff game until their second Super Bowl championship season in 2020. In 2024, their image further improved by tying the New Orleans Saints for the most NFC South division titles, with seven. This also included franchise and division records with four consecutive division titles and five consecutive playoff appearances.

==History==
===Hugh Culverhouse era (1976–1994)===
==== John McKay years (1976–1984) ====
The Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.

Tampa Bay went 0–14 in their first season. They were outscored by an average of almost 21 points per game. Only three games ended with the Buccaneers within one possession. Until the Detroit Lions in 2008, the 1976 Bucs were the only Super Bowl-era team to go winless in a whole season. Their losing streak caused them to become the butt of late-night television comedians&#x27; jokes. Tampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their second season, starting with a record of 0–26 (though the Bucs had beaten the Atlanta Falcons, 17–3, in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season). The Saints&#x27; head coach, Hank Stram, was fired after losing to the Buccaneers. Their first win came on December 11, 1977, on the road against the New Orleans Saints in Week 13. Tampa Bay needed one more week to get their second victory, a home win over the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1977 season finale. The Cardinals also fired their coach, Don Coryell, shortly afterward.
The Buccaneers improved to a 5–11 mark in 1978. The team boasted a strong defensive unit that finished seventh in points allowed. The team was competitive in numerous close games. The Bucs&#x27; situation improved rapidly in the 1979 season. With the maturation of quarterback Doug Williams and future four-time Pro Bowl tight end Jimmie Giles, the first 1,000-yard rushing season from running back Ricky Bell, and a smothering, league-leading, Star Studded defense led by future NFL Hall of Famer Lee Roy Selmon, the Bucs kicked off the season with five consecutive victories, a performance that landed them on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot;

With four games left in the season, the Bucs needed to win only one of them to make the playoffs. In the first, STP was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the Minnesota Vikings 23–22. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14–0 by the Chicago Bears; and in O. J. Simpson&#x27;s final home game in San Francisco, Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1–13 record. However, in the season finale at home against the Kansas City Chiefs, which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3–0 victory. Finishing with a 10–6 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–17 in the divisional round of the playoffs. Because the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the NFC Championship Game the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9–0. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay&#x27;s five-year plan. The Buccaneers regressed in 1980 and finished with a 5–10–1 mark.

The Buccaneers made the playoffs again by winning their division in the 1981 season. It came down to a thrilling final game at Detroit; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Detroit Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR Kevin House and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT David Logan sealed the win for the Buccaneers. In the playoffs, the Cowboys defeated the Bucs, 38–0, in the divisional round. The loss remains the largest postseason shutout loss in franchise history.

The 1982 season started 0–3 for the Bucs, before a player&#x27;s strike shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the &quot;Cardiac Kids&quot; for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5–4 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the Cowboys at Dallas, losing 30–17. As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse&#x27;s ownership.

Before the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the United States Football League in a salary dispute. The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2–14, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses—an NFL record. Included was the drafting of Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson with the first pick in the 1986 draft. Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay. Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the Kansas City Royals and would later return for parts of football seasons with the Los Angeles Raiders. Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Bucs quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. Steve Young won with the 49ers and Trent Dilfer won with the Baltimore Ravens. In the 1984 season, the team went 6–10 in John McKay&#x27;s final season.

Former Atlanta Falcons&#x27; coach Leeman Bennett was named head coach prior to the 1985 season. He led the team to consecutive 2–14 finishes in 1985 and 1986. Bennett was fired following the end of the 1986 season. Ray Perkins was hired to be the head coach of the Buccaneers prior to the 1987 season. Perkins coached for the team for almost four seasons, getting fired during 1990 season. Under Perkins&#x27;s tenure, the team won no more than five games in a single season.

Under Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL&#x27;s more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers.

Hardy Nickerson, a future five-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. John Lynch, a future Pro Bowl, and Hall of Fame strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the 1995 NFL draft the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks. Pro Bowl Fullback, Mike Alstott, was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft.

===Glazer family era (1995–present)===
Despite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse&#x27;s death in 1994 revealed a man close to bankruptcy despite having a low payroll for his team. His son, Miami attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr. soon sued his father&#x27;s associates (Stephen Story, Jack Donlan, and Fred Cone) who had built the trust account that was meant to manage the elder Culverhouse&#x27;s business (which involved a $350 million estate) after having his wife sign a post-nuptial agreement. At any rate, a settlement was soon reached that gave control of the trust to Culverhouse Jr., who sold the team for $192 million. Interested parties included New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to Baltimore, as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.

However, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate Malcolm Glazer outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons Bryan, Edward, and Joel in charge of the team&#x27;s financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced Hillsborough County voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become Raymond James Stadium.

==== Tony Dungy years (1996–2001) ====
The Glazers&#x27; deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team–in Tampa Bay–finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team&#x27;s performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Tony Dungy as head coach. Additionally, the team jettisoned the old uniform designs in favor of a modern look.

During Dungy&#x27;s first season in 1996, the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1–8. But in the second half of the season, they finished 5–2, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by Hardy Nickerson and the maturing of Sam Wyche&#x27;s draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his Cover 2 defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin and linebackers coach Lovie Smith, became the foundation for Tampa Bay&#x27;s future success. Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the Tampa 2. It has been brought to the Chicago Bears by Smith, Detroit Lions by Rod Marinelli, Kansas City Chiefs by Herman Edwards and to the Indianapolis Colts by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.

The team started the 1997 season 5–0, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; twice. The Bucs went 10–6 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team. In the Bucs&#x27; final home game at Houlihan&#x27;s Stadium (formerly Tampa Stadium), the team defeated the Lions 20–10. They lost at Lambeau Field to the eventual NFC champion Packers 21–7 in the Divisional Round. Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season.

The 1998 season, the first to be played in the newly constructed Raymond James Stadium, saw the Bucs lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8–8 record. The Bucs had to play the first six football games of the year (including preseason) on the road, as the new stadium was not quite finished.

The 1999 season brought much better fortune. On the strength of the NFL&#x27;s number 3 overall defense and a performance by rookie quarterback Shaun King, the Bucs finished the season with an 11–5 record and won their third NFC Central Division Championship. They beat the Washington Redskins 14–13 in the Divisional round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl Champion St. Louis Rams in a low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11–6. The Bucs&#x27; loss was controversial, highlighted by the reversal of a pass from King to wide receiver Bert Emanuel, which ended the Bucs&#x27; chances at continuing their last-minute drive. In league meetings following the season, the NFL changed the rules regarding what constituted an incomplete pass.

While the Bucs played well in 2000 and 2001 and made the playoffs in each season, they were unable to fulfill their primary goal of a Super Bowl victory. The wild card spots that Tampa Bay earned forced them to go on the road for their postseason opener in each year, and both road games took them into frigid Philadelphia to play the Eagles. The Buccaneers historically have struggled in games played with a temperature of less than (as late as 1999, they had never won a game with a temperature played under 40 degrees) and the latter loss to the Eagles was the sixth time that Tampa Bay had lost a postseason game on the road (out of six played).

==== Jon Gruden years (2002–2008) ====

Dungy was fired by the Buccaneers following a 31–9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wildcard Round of 2001 and soon thereafter hired as the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, while the Bucs mounted a search for his replacement that would include numerous names and rejections. Several potential candidates were offered the job, including University of Florida head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) Steve Spurrier, former New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells, and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs&#x27; offer—the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs&#x27; general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was Jon Gruden; however, he was still under contract with the Oakland Raiders.

While talks with the Raiders were secretly underway, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, San Francisco 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci. Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs&#x27; head coach and their general manager, Raiders owner Al Davis agreed to release Gruden to Tampa Bay.

The Glazers&#x27; shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it was costly. The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four draft picks, including the Bucs&#x27; first and second-round picks in 2002, their first-round pick in 2003, and their second-round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash. (The league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches.) Gruden was frustrated by the limitation of his coaching authority by Davis and was more than pleased to return to Tampa Bay. His parents lived in Carrollwood, and he had spent part of his childhood in Tampa in the early 1980s when his father was a running backs coach and later a scout for the Bucs.

Upon his arrival in Tampa, Gruden immediately went to work, retooling a sluggish offense, changing over 50% of the starting offense. With a new Tailback, Wide Receiver, Two Tight Ends, Left Tackle, and Left Guard, Gruden put his stamp on the teams offense to remove the &quot;Dungy&#x27;s Team&quot; label. The league&#x27;s sweeping realignment sent the Bucs to the new NFC South Division, along with the Falcons, Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints.

===== Super Bowl XXXVII champions (2002) =====

Led by the league&#x27;s top defense, the 2002 season was the Buccaneers&#x27; most successful to date. Linebacker Derrick Brooks was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year with a tendency to make big plays. They won the NFC South title with the team&#x27;s best ever record, 12–4, and scored more points in two playoff wins over the 49ers and Eagles than in Bucs playoff history combined. The Philadelphia Eagles were a thorn in Tampa Bay&#x27;s side, having eliminated the Bucs in each of the last two seasons&#x27; wild card games. Tampa Bay entered the game as heavy underdogs and fell behind early. However, the Bucs persevered and took a ten-point lead into the fourth quarter. Ronde Barber sealed the win in dramatic fashion with a late interception return for a touchdown, and a 27–10 victory. The Bucs then went on to rout Gruden&#x27;s former team, the Raiders, who had the league&#x27;s number one offense, by a score of 48–21 in Super Bowl XXXVII, nicknamed &#x27;The Pirate Bowl&#x27;.

Soon after the Super Bowl victory, a growing number of press reports indicated Gruden&#x27;s lack of patience with general manager McKay, a major architect of the Bucs&#x27; rebuilding effort over the previous ten years. McKay, like Gruden, had long-established ties to the Tampa Bay area. However, during the 2003 season, the Gruden-McKay relationship deteriorated as the Bucs struggled on the field. In November, Keyshawn Johnson was deactivated by the team ten games into the season for his conduct, which included sideline arguments with Bucs coaches and players. Johnson was eventually traded to the Dallas Cowboys for wide receiver Joey Galloway, who later in his career played for the New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Washington Redskins.

In December, the Glazers allowed McKay to leave the Bucs before the end of the regular season, and he promptly joined the Falcons as president and general manager. Thus, McKay watched his first game as a Falcons executive sitting next to owner Arthur Blank in a Raymond James Stadium skybox. The Falcons defeated the Bucs 30–28. The Bucs suffered a sluggish start and finished the season 7–9. With the Raiders&#x27; dismal 4–12 performance, neither Super Bowl team reached the playoffs that year.

For 2004, Bruce Allen was hired as general manager. After Allen&#x27;s arrival, both John Lynch and Warren Sapp were released, stunning many Buccaneer fans. The distracted Buccaneers began the 2004 season with a 1–5 record, their worst start under Gruden. The fading accuracy of kicker Martín Gramática did not help matters, as the team lost many close games en route to a 5–11 record.

In the 2005 season, the Buccaneers celebrated their 30th season in the league, and returned to their winning ways. The Bucs selected Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams in the first round of the 2005 draft, and the rookie would provide a running game the Buccaneers had not possessed since the days of James Wilder Sr. in the 1980s. Williams would later go on to receive the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award. After starting 5–1, the team entered a midseason slump hampered by a season-ending injury to starting QB Brian Griese. Replacement starter Chris Simms struggled early, but came into his own, leading the team to a last-minute win over the Redskins. The Bucs won the NFC South Division finishing 11–5. The season ended abruptly, however, with a 17–10 loss in the Wild Card round, in a rematch with Washington that saw receiver Edell Shepherd drop the potential game-winning catch in the endzone.
After winning the division in 2005, the Bucs suffered through an abysmal 2006 season. The season was plagued by injuries, with starters such as guard Dan Buenning, wide receiver Michael Clayton, running back Cadillac Williams, defensive end Simeon Rice, cornerback Brian Kelly, and quarterback Chris Simms all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season. The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as quarterback Bruce Gradkowski, tackle Jeremy Trueblood, and guard Davin Joseph.
The Bucs started off the season 0–3, with Simms throwing one touchdown to 7 interceptions. In the third game of the season, a last-minute loss to the Panthers, Simms&#x27;s spleen was ruptured, and he was placed on injured reserve for the balance of the season. After their bye week, the Bucs elected to start Gradkowski, a sixth-round pick from Toledo. After nearly beating the Saints, Gradkowski led the team to last-minute wins over the Cincinnati Bengals and Philadelphia Eagles. The success was short-lived, however, and the Bucs lost five of the next six games. Tim Rattay replaced Gradkowski as quarterback late in the season, and the team finished 4–12. The aged defense, with 5 starters who had played there for a decade or more, was ranked 17th overall, the first time a Tampa defense was not ranked in the top ten since 1996.

After the disappointing 2006 season, the Buccaneers for the first time in several seasons had money to spend in free agency. They brought in quarterback Jeff Garcia, offensive tackle Luke Petitgout, defensive end Kevin Carter, and linebacker Cato June. On April 28, 2007, the Buccaneers drafted Clemson defensive end Gaines Adams with the 4th overall pick in the NFL draft. After the draft the Buccaneers picked up tight end Jerramy Stevens. and defensive tackle Ryan Sims.

The off-season changes resulted in the Buccaneers winning the NFC South title in the 2007 season, finishing with a 9–7 record, and the 4th seed in the conference. The division crown was the second one in three seasons under Gruden. In the Wild Card round of the playoffs held on January 6, 2008, the Buccaneers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants by a final score of 24–14.
During the 2008 offseason, the Bucs re-signed head coach Gruden and general manager Allen through the 2011 season. They also acquired former players Warrick Dunn, who had spent the last 6 seasons with the Falcons, and Brian Griese, who was the starting quarterback for the team in 2005 until a knee injury sidelined him for the remainder of the year. Chris Simms was finally released, having not played in a game since his injury in 2006. The Bucs got off to a great start in 2008, with a 9–3 record going into the final month of the season, tied for first place in the division, with a chance at the top seed in the conference. On December 2, it was announced that defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin would be leaving the team after the season&#x27;s end, for the same job at the University of Tennessee, serving under his son Lane Kiffin, who had just been named the new head coach at the school. After the announcement, the Buccaneers would lose their final four games of the season to finish 9–7 for the second consecutive season. Unlike 2007, it was not enough to secure the division championship, nor a playoff appearance.

Raheem Morris was named the replacement for Monte Kiffin as defensive coordinator in December 2008. A month later, after the huge collapse that ended the 2008 season, the Buccaneers fired Jon Gruden and swiftly elevated Morris to the head coach position. Bruce Allen was also let go, with Mark Dominik named his successor as general manager. Several veterans were released including Derrick Brooks, Joey Galloway, and Jeff Garcia. The new staff traded for tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., signed quarterback Byron Leftwich, and drafted Josh Freeman with the 17th overall pick.

====Raheem Morris====
The 2009 squad started out 0–7, behind Leftwich and later Josh Johnson. Following their bye week, the team elevated Freeman to starting quarterback, resulting in the team&#x27;s first win of the season. The team finished 3–13, the worst record since 1991.

The Bucs&#x27; 2010 season surprised many, producing the greatest single-season turnaround in franchise history, going 10–6. This was largely behind the stellar performances of Freeman, rookie receiver Mike Williams, and LeGarrette Blount. Despite the effort, the team narrowly missed the playoffs, losing out on the wild card tiebreaker to the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers.

Tampa Bay began the 2011 season with high hopes, adding several key defensive players through the draft. After a 4–2 start, however, the Buccaneers collapsed, dropping ten consecutive games to finish 4–12. The day after a 45–24 loss to the Falcons in their final game of the season, the team fired Morris, offensive coordinator Greg Olson and the rest of his corresponding staff. During the Morris era, the lack of on-the-field success, along with several contributing factors, including the recession, saw attendance slip, precipitating local television blackouts for the first time since the mid-1990s. All eight regular-season home games were blacked out in 2010, and 5 of 7 were blacked out in 2011 (one &quot;home&quot; game was played in London).

====Greg Schiano====
About three weeks after firing Raheem Morris, the Buccaneers hired Greg Schiano from Rutgers as the new head coach. During his introductory conference he stated &quot;There will be Buccaneer men, and there will be a Buccaneer Way.&quot; The phrase &quot;The Buccaneer Way&quot; became a slogan among fans and local media, describing the new regime and attitude. The team filled out the coaching staff with new faces, including Mike Sullivan, Bill Sheridan, and Butch Davis. In 2013, Dave Wannstedt was also added as special teams coach. In the first day of free agency, the club signed top prospects Vincent Jackson and Carl Nicks, as well as Eric Wright. The $140 million committed to the team during that 24-hour period is the largest investment the Glazer family has put into the team going back almost a decade.

The team finished the 2012 season at 7–9, notably ranking first in rushing defense. Furthermore, the rushing offense was highlighted by the breakout performance of Doug Martin. After two seasons of game-day local television blackouts, the improved team began seeing increased attendance and attention, and some blackouts lifted. 6 games were blacked out in 2012. For the three-year period of 2010–2012, the Bucs led the NFL in local television blackouts with 19 (Cincinnati was second with 11). Schiano&#x27;s strict and regimented coaching style, however, drew criticism at the end of a game against the Giants, ordering his defense to continue to aggressively tackle the offense as Giants quarterback Eli Manning was taking a knee to end the game. Afterwards, Schiano was met at midfield by an irate Tom Coughlin, who did not appreciate the Bucs&#x27; aggressiveness.

Coming into the 2013 season, fans and analysts had better than average expectations for Tampa Bay. They were expected to improve their record, and potentially make a playoffs run. The predictions proved unfounded, as numerous issues on and off the field saw the team collapse. The team dealt with several players, including Lawrence Tynes, Carl Nicks, and Johnthan Banks, contracting antibiotic-resistant MRSA infections, which led to a 2015 lawsuit by Tynes that settled in 2017. During training camp, a reported rift began to divide Schiano and quarterback Josh Freeman. After an 0–3 start, Freeman was benched, and ultimately released. This was after Freeman reportedly missed several team meetings, along with the team&#x27;s annual photograph. Schiano started rookie Mike Glennon, but the team continued to lose. The fans&#x27; confidence of Schiano began to decay rapidly, and after a 0–8 start, the team got its first win of the season on a Monday night against Miami. A brief win streak saw improvements with Glennon at quarterback, and Bobby Rainey took over at running back with stellar numbers after Doug Martin went down with a shoulder injury. There were no blackouts in 2013, as the Glazers bought up the necessary tickets for two of the games to get to the 85% threshold needed to prevent local blackouts.

Despite some individual improvements, and some impressive performances by members of the defense, the team dropped the last three games of the season, and finished 4–12. The team ranked last or near the bottom in almost every offensive category. On December 30, 2013, Schiano and general manager Mark Dominik were fired.

====Lovie Smith====

On January 1, 2014, Lovie Smith was hired as the new head coach of the Buccaneers, replacing Greg Schiano. Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under Tony Dungy. During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: &quot;There was a certain brand of football you expected from us,&quot; Smith said. &quot;You know we would be relentless. There was a brand of football that you got from us each week at Raymond James Stadium. It was hard for opponents to come in and win. We have gotten away from that a little bit, and it&#x27;s time ... for us to become a relevant team again.&quot;

On January 21, 2014, Jason Licht was hired as the new general manager, replacing Mark Dominik. He was officially introduced at One Buc Place on January 23, 2014. In his first news conference, Licht talked about his philosophy: &quot;Our philosophy is going to be to build through the draft. That&#x27;s where we find our stars. That&#x27;s where we find the next generation. But also in the short term and long term we&#x27;re going to supplement our roster through free agency but we&#x27;re going to look for value. We&#x27;re going to spend wisely.&quot;

After signing veteran free agent Josh McCown and many more free agents, many analysts predicted that the Buccaneers could be the surprise team of the year and possibly make a playoff run. Those predictions soon went away after the Bucs began the season 0–3, including a 56–14 blowout against the Falcons on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;. McCown was injured in that game, and second-year quarterback Mike Glennon was named the starter. His first start of the 2014 season ended with the Bucs earning their first victory of the season in Pittsburgh against the Steelers 27–24. The Bucs lost the next 4 games, including two overtime losses against the Saints and the Vikings, one blowout against the Ravens, and a 5-point loss against the Cleveland Browns. Going into week 10 at 1–8, McCown returned as the starter. Mathematically, the Bucs were still in playoff contention only being 3 games out of first place in the division. McCown&#x27;s first game back ended with a 27–17 loss to the Falcons but won the following week in a 27–7 blowout against struggling Washington. The Bucs would lose the next three games and were officially knocked out of playoff contention in week 14. The Bucs finished 2–14, winning 2 fewer games than the previous season and secured the first-overall draft pick for the 2015 NFL draft.

Despite the team&#x27;s record, first-round draft pick wide receiver Mike Evans had more than 1,000 receiving yards, and he became the youngest NFL player to record more than 200 receiving yards in a single game. Vincent Jackson also had more than 1,000 yards receiving, which represented Tampa Bay&#x27;s first pair of 1,000 yard receivers in a season. Second-year CB Johnthan Banks led the team with 4 interceptions and has 50 tackles. Danny Lansanah flourished in the Tampa 2 system with 81 tackles, 1.5 QB sacks, and 3 interceptions, with 2 of those interceptions returned for touchdowns for the 2014 season. Jacquies Smith, who was signed from Buffalo after waiving rookie DE Scott Solomon a month into the season, had 17 combined tackles, 13 solo tackles, 6.5 sacks, and 1 forced fumble in only 8 starts for 2014.

In December 2014, a report surfaced that the Buccaneers used homeless people to sell beer and did not pay them.

After the conclusion of the 2014 season, Tampa Bay hired Ben Steele to become the team&#x27;s new offensive quality control coach as well as former Falcons offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter to be their new offensive coordinator after parting ways with QB coach and interim offensive coordinator Marcus Arroyo. Having a 2–14 record, tied for the worst record in the NFL in 2014, Tampa Bay gained the first-overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. They also made some headlines when they released quarterback Josh McCown on February 11, 2015, to save $5.25 million in cap space. With the first overall pick in the NFL draft, the Buccaneers selected Jameis Winston from Florida State. Throughout the off-season, there was much debate whether the Buccaneers should pick Winston or Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota.

On January 6, 2016, Smith was fired by the Buccaneers after posting a record of 8–24 in his two seasons, including a 6–10 record in the 2015 season.

====Dirk Koetter====
On January 15, 2016, Dirk Koetter was promoted from offensive coordinator to become the new head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2016, Koetter won his first game as head coach, but the team&#x27;s record slipped to 3–5 by week 9 following a 43–28 loss to Atlanta on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;. The Buccaneers rattled off five straight victories, their longest winning streak since 2002. They earned upset victories over the heavily favored Chiefs and Seahawks, but snapped the streak with late-season losses to both Dallas and New Orleans. The Buccaneers ended with a 9–7 record, but lost the NFC&#x27;s sixth seed to the Lions due to tiebreakers.

On March 9, 2017, the Buccaneers signed former Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson, defensive tackle Chris Baker, former Cowboys safety J. J. Wilcox (traded to Pittsburgh Steelers), former New York Jets kicker Nick Folk, and veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. The season got off to a 2–6 start with poor performance, especially in the kicking game. After a loss to the Lions in week 14, they were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. Tampa Bay finished the season 5–11. This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance. Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons.

The Buccaneers began the 2018 season 2–0, their first 2–0 start since 2010. Journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick started the first two games while Jameis Winston was serving a three-game suspension. Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards and four touchdowns in both games, against the Saints (the eventual NFC South winner) and the Eagles (the defending Super Bowl champions). On Monday night in Week 3 against the Steelers, Fitzpatrick became the first player in NFL history to throw for 400+ yards in three consecutive games. However, he also threw three interceptions, and Tampa Bay lost the game 30–27. Fitzpatrick remained the starter for Week 4 against the Bears. He struggled and was benched after halftime in favor of Winston. Winston was named the starter for Week 6, but was averaging at least two interceptions per game. After week 6&#x27;s loss to the Falcons, defensive coordinator Mike Smith was fired and linebackers coach Mark Duffner was named interim defensive coordinator. Both Winston and Fitzpatrick took snaps under center as the season wore on, and at 5–7 they were still mathematically alive for the postseason. However, they dropped their last four games to finish 5–11. After a second consecutive last-place season, Koetter was fired.

==== Bruce Arians years (2019–2021) ====

Following the termination of Dirk Koetter, the Buccaneers named Bruce Arians as the 12th head coach in franchise history on January 8, 2019. Arians had been retired from coaching for a year, having spent the 2018 season in the broadcast booth. Because Arians was still under contract with the Arizona Cardinals through the end of the 2019 season, Tampa Bay agreed to give the Cardinals a sixth-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft for the rights to Arians, as well as receiving Arizona&#x27;s seventh-round pick in the same draft. On the same day it was reported the Bucs would also bring Byron Leftwich, who had served under Arians in Arizona, as offensive coordinator. The next day the Buccaneers announced the hiring of former Jets head coach Todd Bowles as defensive coordinator.

In 2019, Tampa Bay finished with a 7–9 record. The team finished the season with the best run defense in the league and top 10 in total offense. Jameis Winston, in the final year of his five-year contract, set franchise records with 5,109 passing yards and 33 touchdown passes. He became the eighth quarterback in NFL history to eclipse 5,000 yards in a single season. However he had a league-leading 30 interceptions. He set a mark as the first quarterback in league history to throw 30 touchdown passes and 30 interceptions in the same season. His final pass attempt as a Buccaneers player was a pick-six in overtime to lose against Atlanta in Week 17. Winston was not re-signed by Tampa Bay, and he was subsequently picked up by the Saints during the 2020 offseason.

===== Super Bowl LV champions (2020) =====
The Buccaneers made arguably the biggest acquisition of the 2020 offseason when they acquired veteran quarterback Tom Brady, widely considered the greatest to ever play the position. The offensive engine of the New England Patriots&#x27; sports dynasty from 2001 to 2019, Brady announced that he would not be re-signing with the Patriots after 20 seasons and joined the Buccaneers for 2020.
Later in the offseason, tight end and Brady&#x27;s New England teammate Rob Gronkowski announced that he was coming out of retirement to return to the NFL. On the same day, the Patriots made an agreement to trade Gronkowski to the Buccaneers, along with a seventh-round pick in exchange for a compensatory fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft. Gronkowski would finish the regular season with 45 receptions, 623 receiving yards, and 7 receiving touchdowns in 16 games.

On September 6, 2020, the Buccaneers signed running back Leonard Fournette, who had been waived the week prior by the Jacksonville Jaguars.

On October 27, 2020, free agent wide receiver Antonio Brown signed a one-year contract with the Buccaneers. The move reunited Brown with Arians, who was his first offensive coordinator on the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Brady, whom he played one game alongside of for the Patriots. Brown made his first appearance with the Bucs in week 9 and would finish the regular season with 45 receptions, 483 receiving yards, and 4 receiving touchdowns in eight games.

In Week 15, the Buccaneers overcame a 17–0 deficit against the Atlanta Falcons, to win 31–27 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.

In the 2020 season, Tampa Bay clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 after a 47–7 victory against the Lions in Week 16. By the end of the 2020 regular season, Brady had set the Buccaneers record for passing touchdowns with 40. In the same game, receiver Mike Evans set the NFL record for consecutive 1,000-yard seasons to start a career with 7 straight 1,000 yard seasons.

In the playoffs, the Buccaneers defeated the Washington Football Team 31–23 in the wild card round, their first postseason victory since winning Super Bowl XXXVII in 2002. In the divisional round, they defeated the Saints 30–20 to advance to the NFC Championship Game for the fourth time in franchise history, and first since the 2002 season. They then defeated the Packers to advance to Super Bowl LV for the franchise&#x27;s second appearance in the league championship, facing the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bucs defeated the Chiefs to win their second Super Bowl title by a score of 31–9. Coincidentally, Raymond James Stadium was named as the host stadium of Super Bowl LV in 2017 when it was determined that SoFi Stadium, which had been awarded the game the year before its construction had begun, would not be completed in time to be eligible under league requirements to host. Thus, the Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history to play in and win a Super Bowl that was held at its home stadium.

In the 2021 offseason, the Buccaneers re-signed all 22 of their starters from the 2020 Super Bowl championship season, in addition to re-signing Fournette and former Bengals running back Giovani Bernard. The Buccaneers are the first team in the salary cap era (1994), and fourth team all-time, to re-sign all 22 starters from their Super Bowl team, while every other team&#x27;s roster changed.

After the 2021 regular season, in which they posted a 13–4 record and secured the #2 seed in the NFC playoffs. The team defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 31–15 in the Wild Card Round. The Buccaneers&#x27; title defense came to an end with a 30–27 last-second loss to the eventual Super Bowl LVI champion Los Angeles Rams in the Divisional Round.

==== Todd Bowles years (2022–present) ====
On February 1, 2022, quarterback Tom Brady announced his retirement from the league. Brady had one season remaining on his contract with the Buccaneers. However, on March 13, after only forty days, he reversed his decision, and announced he would return for the 2022 season. On March 30, a couple weeks after Brady&#x27;s announcement, head coach Bruce Arians announced his second retirement from coaching and shifted to Senior Football Consultant. Defensive coordinator and former Jets head coach Todd Bowles was immediately named his replacement.

Despite signing former All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, former Pro-Bowlers Akiem Hicks and Keanu Neal, and Brady&#x27;s former teammates Shaq Mason and Logan Ryan, the Buccaneers struggled under Bowles in his first season as head coach. They finished 8–9, but still won the NFC South division title, the fifth sub .500 team since the merger to make the playoffs. They lost at home to the Cowboys in the Wild Card Round. On February 1, 2023, Brady announced his retirement, this time &quot;for good&quot;.

In 2023, Tampa Bay hired Seahawks quarterbacks coach Dave Canales to be their offensive coordinator and signed Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield to a one-year, $8.5 million contract to be the team&#x27;s next starting quarterback. The Buccaneers won the NFC South with a 9–8 record, their third consecutive division crown. They defeated Philadelphia in the Wild Card Round 32–9. The Buccaneers saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 31–23 loss to the Detroit Lions.

During the 2024 offseason, Baker Mayfield signed a three-year contract extension with the Buccaneers to remain the starting quarterback. Dave Canales departed to take the head coaching job at Carolina, and was replaced at the offensive coordinator position by Liam Coen. The Buccaneers finished the regular season 10–7, and won the NFC South for a franchise-best fourth consecutive season. This also tied the record for most consecutive NFC South titles, with four, and total NFC South titles, with seven; furthermore, this marked the fifth consecutive playoff appearance for the team, both a franchise and division record. Mayfield threw 41 touchdown passes, and the Tampa Bay offense ranked third in the league. Despite missing three games due to a hamstring injury, wide receiver Mike Evans finished the regular season with 1,004 receiving yards. Evans tied the NFL record held by Jerry Rice for the most consecutive seasons with 1,000+ receiving yards (11), as well as extend his own current record for most such seasons consecutively from the start of a career.

==Defense==

Throughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense. It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end Lee Roy Selmon with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the AP Defensive Player of the Year, and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions, including the 2002 championship season. The team&#x27;s defense was instrumental in their 2020 playoff run which led to their second Super Bowl title. All five of the Buccaneers Hall of Fame inductees are defensive players or coaches.

===1978–1982===
Led by Selmon, Linebackers Dewey Selmon, Richard Wood, Dave Lewis, and Mike Washington, Mark Cotney, and Cedric Brown in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3–4 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the Super Bowl as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9–0 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. Although 1980 was a down year, the unit made pass defense adjustments and returned in 1981 to finish No. 1 in Touchdowns allowed; giving up only 10 touchdowns all season.

===1997–2008: The Tampa 2===
The team drafted franchise cornerstones John Lynch in 1993, and Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker Hardy Nickerson. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league&#x27;s top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach Tony Dungy created the &quot;Tampa 2&quot; defense, a modified version of the established Cover 2 scheme.

Kiffin&#x27;s defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers: Derrick Brooks, John Lynch, Warren Sapp, Ronde Barber, and Pro Bowlers, Hardy Nickerson, Simeon Rice, Shelton Quarles, Donnie Abraham, and Super Bowl XXXVII MVP Dexter Jackson. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the 1990s All-Decade 2nd Team while the 2000s All-Decade Team featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.

====2002 defense====

The 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 1976 Steelers, 1985 Bears, 1986 Giants, 2000 Ravens and 2010&#x27;s Seattle Seahawks. In the regular season, Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). Derrick Brooks was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12–4 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only a combined 37 points in three games – all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes – returning 4 for touchdowns – and collected 11 sacks.

In Super Bowl XXXVII, the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP Rich Gannon, the defense actually outscored the Raiders offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48–21 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3). Defensive back Dwight Smith became the only player in Super Bowl history to record multiple interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl, while fellow defensive back Dexter Jackson was awarded Super Bowl MVP for his two interceptions in the game. In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns.

===2019–present: Todd Bowles&#x27; 3–4 defense===
When Arians was hired by the Bucs, he appointed former New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles to be the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator. That same offseason, the team drafted linebacker Devin White with the fifth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, after signing outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett to a one-year, $4 million contract, and defensive end Ndamukong Suh for one year, $10 million. With these acquisitions, along with linebackers Lavonte David, Carl Nassib, Jason Pierre-Paul, nose tackles Vita Vea and Beau Allen and defensive end William Gholston, Bowles implemented the 3–4 defensive scheme, with a heavy emphasis on blitzing. David and White were the teams&#x27; leaders, Barrett led the team, and the league, in sacks with 19.5, and the 2019 Buccaneers finished No. 1 in the league in run defense. The team&#x27;s defense improved next season after Suh, Barrett, and Pierre-Paul were re-signed and Antoine Winfield Jr. was drafted in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. The Buccaneers defense was a massive part of the teams&#x27; turn-around in 2020, finishing 1st in run defense, 7th in pass defense and 8th in total defense. The Buccaneers pass defense improved 29th to 7th, thanks in part to their young secondary, led by Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, Jordan Whitehead, Winfield Jr., Ross Cockrell, Herb Miller and Mike Edwards. Nicknamed, the &quot;Grave Diggers&quot;, they forced two interceptions, including a pick-six by Jamel Dean, four sacks and gave up no touchdowns against 2020 NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers in Week 6, forced three interceptions against future Hall of famer Drew Brees, and five sacks and another interception against Rodgers in the NFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl LV, against the league&#x27;s No. 1 offense led by 2018 NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes, the Buccaneers held Kansas City to season lows in points and red zone attempts, with 9 points, all from field goals, 22 first downs, and 0–3 red zone attempts. They forced two interceptions, three sacks, 29 pressures, and five quarterback hits, and a 49.9 passer rating during the game. In 19 total games in 2020, the Buccaneers recorded 18 interceptions, 58 sacks, 19 forced fumbles, and 12 fumble recoveries.

==Facilities==

Since 1998, the Buccaneers have played their home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. Prior to that, they had played in Tampa Stadium since their establishment.

In 1975, the Buccaneers built a small practice complex with offices near Tampa International Airport called One Buccaneer Place – often shorted to &quot;One Buc Place&quot;. The team utilized the unspectacular facility through 2005. It sat across the street from International Plaza and Bay Street, and backed up to the runways of the airport. It was located about two miles away from Tampa Stadium. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, infestations, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as &quot;The Woodshed&quot;; some of the coaches&#x27; offices were actually converted broom closets. The frequent summertime rain sent the team to practice in a nearby parking garage. Some players and staff even claim to have come down with illnesses from spending too much time in the building. For much of the team&#x27;s existence, the Buccaneers held training camp on the University of Tampa campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped Disney&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando (2002–2008).
In August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from Raymond James Stadium (on the former site of Tampa Bay Center), the state-of-the-art facility on is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An adjacent climate-controlled indoor practice facility, featuring an artificial turf field, was later completed in 2017. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at this new complex.

In the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Buccaneers 2002 championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called &quot;Moment of Victory&quot;. The life-size statues included players Mike Alstott, Ronde Barber, Derrick Brooks, Brad Johnson, John Lynch, Shelton Quarles, Simeon Rice, Warren Sapp, and head coach Jon Gruden. The statues are modeled after images from the sideline towards the end of Super Bowl XXXVII.

Initially, the facility might have been unnamed, but for over a decade, it simply was referred to as &quot;One Buc Place&quot;, utilizing the same name as the old building. In 2018, the facility was officially named Advent Health Training Facility, as part of a ten-year naming rights deal with Advent Health.

==Logos and uniforms==
===Logos===
Since their inception in 1976, the Buccaneers have gone through two distinct logo/uniform eras. From 1976 to 1996, the team utilized orange, red, and white uniforms with a &quot;Bucco Bruce&quot; logo. Since 1997, the team has utilized red and pewter uniforms, with a &quot;skull and swords&quot; logo.

The original &quot;Bucco Bruce&quot; logo has seen three distinct versions. The original version was the most distinctive; both in color and design. The logo was refreshed in 1992 with the most obvious differences being the design of the face, specifically the open eye, the design on the dagger, and the usage of white near the neck of the first design. The 2009 throwback uniforms utilized a cleaned up and crisper version of the 1976–1991 logo. From 1997 onwards, the Buccaneers&#x27; newer &quot;skulls and swords&quot; logo has gone through three iterations. The first was somewhat smaller on the helmet, and featured a more conventionally-shaped skull. The second edition was larger on the helmet, had a different shade of red, and a different design for the shape and face of the skull. The current version is mostly the same as the second, with only minor changes, including a smaller size on the helmet.

===1976===

Shortly after the franchise was awarded, in February 1975 the team name of &quot;Buccaneers&quot; was selected, along with proposed team colors of green, orange and white. The name was said to be reminiscent of José Gaspar and the Buccaneers of the Caribbean Sea, and the color orange representing the Florida citrus industry. Almost immediately, the nickname &quot;Bucs&quot; became popular, but the alternative &quot;Bay Bucs&quot; failed to gain traction.

A few months later, however, green was dropped from the color scheme. The artists&#x27; renditions were too similar to the aqua used by the Miami Dolphins, as well as the green shades utilized by the Miami Hurricanes and Florida A&amp;M. While they desired to keep the primary color orange, which provided a popular visual link to the Gators, Hurricanes, and Florida A&amp;M, they sought to further distinguish themselves. The color red as an accent color was substituted, as a gesture to the former Tampa Spartans and loosely, to the Florida State Seminoles. The orange/red/white combination was now a composite of all major college teams in the state at the time. Officially speaking, the club&#x27;s colors during this time period were Florida orange, red, and white.

Long-time &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; cartoonist and Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla member Lamar Sparkman designed the first team logo. Faced with the challenge of designing a logo that did not closely resemble that of the other &quot;pirates&quot; in the league, the Raiders, Sparkman came up with a moustached pirate wearing a plumed slouch hat, with a large hoop earring in his left ear and clutching a dagger in his teeth. The pirate appeared to be winking. Sparkman decided to portray the character not as a &quot;hairy-legged slob&quot;, but more of gallant, swashbuckling, and rakish, &quot;classy&quot; type. The eye wink was used rather than an eyepatch, since the Raiders&#x27; logo already depicted a patch over one eye. For a very brief time he was referred to as &quot;Morgan&quot;, and coach John McKay called him &quot;Errol Flynn&quot;. Local &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; sportswriter Hubert Mizell coined the somewhat belittling nickname &quot;Bucco Bruce&quot; in a February 1976 column, noting almost immediately the mascot&#x27;s unintimidating and &quot;cavalier&quot; appearance. The nickname stuck, while the logo and the name &quot;Bucco Bruce&quot; became symbols and reminders of the club&#x27;s ongoing futility. Sports writer and commentator Nick Bakay once said that Bucco Bruce was a pirate who &quot;struck fear in the hearts of no one&quot;.

The original home uniforms featured orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red, white trousers, and striped socks. These are the now-infamous &quot;Creamsicle uniforms&quot;, so named from the perceived similarity of the uniform&#x27;s appearance to the ice cream snack. Road white jerseys had orange numerals outlined in red. During their first season in 1976, however, the orange jerseys were only utilized for preseason games. The Buccaneers wore their white jerseys for all 14 regular season games. After the 1976 season, the team would not see striped socks again until they began wearing them as throwback uniforms starting in 2009.

===1977–1991===
After only one season, the original orange numerals (with red outline) for the white &quot;away&quot; jerseys were reversed. For 1977 and beyond, the white jerseys were revised to have red numerals with an orange outline. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes. The striped socks were dropped.

During the 1985 season, the team wore a special patch marking their tenth season. In 1989, 1990, and 1991, the Buccaneers elected to wear white at home to accommodate Vinny Testaverde&#x27;s color blindness. Testaverde had bad performances in the darker (orange) uniforms and persuaded head coach Ray Perkins to change the team&#x27;s home uniform to white.

Beloit College, located in Beloit, Wisconsin, received a notice from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the college&#x27;s illegitimate use of their mascot. Beloit College&#x27;s buccaneer is the mirror image of the Tampa Bay buccaneer, with the creamsicle colors replaced with Beloit&#x27;s school colors. Athletic Director Ed DeGeorge said Beloit&#x27;s Buccaneers have used the logo since the early 1980s, when he chose it from a book while ordering decals for the football team&#x27;s helmets. The NFL&#x27;s Buccaneers joined the league in 1976. However, the Buccaneers withdrew their claim against Beloit College because of the independent decision to redesign the logo.

===1992–1996===
In 1992, the Bucco Bruce logo was given a minor facelift, as part of an overall uniform refresh. It resulted in a crisper and larger version, and was used for five seasons. The team introduced orange trousers to be worn with the white jerseys. The white jerseys now had an orange collar, and would no longer be paired with white pants. Most regular season home games during this period (except primetime games and selected late season games) saw white jerseys with orange pants. The white on white combination would be used during preseason only.

Prior to the team&#x27;s season finale in 1995 against the Lions, coach Sam Wyche suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys. The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker Hardy Nickerson.

For the 1993 season, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their uniforms, which read &quot;Mr C&quot; in cursive script. It was in recognition of owner Hugh Culverhouse, who was battling terminal lung cancer. For 1994, the Buccaneers carried the league-wide NFL 75th anniversary patch, and as part of the &quot;throwback&quot; theme of the season, wore white jerseys with white pants on two occasions.

Shortly after Malcom Glazer purchased the franchise in January 1995, ownership announced that they were planning to introduce new team colors, logos, and uniforms. Ownership hoped to switch to new uniforms as early as the 1995 season, however the NFL informed them that it was too late to do so at that time. A formal uniform switch request was then submitted to the league and tentatively scheduled to take effect for the 1996 season. Team officials and the NFL Properties department began to research a new design. The local newspaper even held an informal design contest to raise awareness and generate publicity. However, in the meantime, the talks for a new stadium had stalled, leaving open the chance that the franchise might relocate. As a result, the uniform change was postponed. In March 1996, it was announced that the orange &quot;Creamsicle&quot; uniforms would be utilized for at least another year until the stadium plans were ironed out.

===1997–2013===

A ballot measure to fund the construction of a new stadium passed in September 1996. As a result, the franchise was guaranteed to stay in Tampa, and the plans to design a new uniform were resurrected and reenergized. The Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team&#x27;s image. Starting with the season, the primary team colors were changed to red and pewter, with black and orange as accents. The &quot;Bucco Bruce&quot; logo was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed sabres which is a modified Jolly Roger (similar to the one commonly associated with Calico Jack). The flagpole was another larger sabre. The &quot;Buccaneers&quot; team name was written in a new font, &quot;Totally Gothic&quot;, and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white. Orange pinstriping, and an orange football, was used to maintain a visual link to the former colors. Chris Berman nicknamed them &quot;the pirates in pewter pants,&quot; a play on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. The nickname &quot;Pewter Pirates&quot; also became trendy. The Buccaneers staged a ceremony at The Pier on April 7, 1997, in which Bucco Bruce walked the plank of the pirate ship &quot;Bounty&quot; docked in Tampa Bay. But not before he was pardoned at the last minute by Governor Lawton Chiles.

The new uniforms were adopted while Raymond James Stadium was still under construction, and the new colors would be prominent at the new facility. This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the Tampa Bay Bandits, the USFL team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985. That team had a color scheme of red, silver, black, and white.

The new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during the preseason and for early regular season games. The red-on-white combination has been used sparingly, for some prime time home games or special occasions. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers.

For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club&#x27;s 30th season. In 2014, a circular patch was worn with the initials &quot;MG&quot;, after the death of owner Malcolm Glazer. For 2015, a patch commemorating the club&#x27;s 40th season was worn.

Like many other NFL teams located in subtropical climates, the Buccaneers customarily wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season – forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors&#x27; bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00 p.m. Eastern, whereas the west (home) sideline is in the shade. In certain previous years, such as 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1996 – the last year of the original uniforms, the Buccaneers generally wore white at home for the entire season including preseason. Since the new uniforms were adopted, the Buccaneers typically wear their red jerseys for home games during the second half of the season, and for most nighttime home games. They have also worn red jerseys all four times as the home team in International Series games. During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. Since the 1997 season, the Buccaneers have worn both their red jerseys (5 times) and white jerseys (4 times) for home postseason games. At Super Bowl XXXVII, in which Tampa Bay was the designated home team, they elected to wear their red home jerseys. This was despite the kickoff temperature of , one of the hottest Super Bowls on record.

The Buccaneers&#x27; 1997 uniform change prompted a 2003 lawsuit by the Raiders, who claimed that the NFL and the Buccaneers had infringed upon key trademark elements of the Raiders&#x27; brand, including the Raiders&#x27; pirate logo. In the same suit, the Raiders challenged the Carolina Panthers&#x27; color scheme, which included silver and black. The Raiders wanted the courts to bar the Buccaneers and Panthers from wearing their uniforms while playing in California. However, since the lawsuit was filed in a California state court, the lawsuit was tossed out because only federal courts have jurisdiction on intellectual property issues.

===2014–2019===

The Buccaneers unveiled a revised logo and helmet on February 20, 2014. This was followed two weeks later on March 3, with the unveiling of new uniforms to be used starting in the 2014 season. The jersey numbers featured a high visibility reflective outline, the helmet logo was revamped and enlarged, the helmet itself was a darker shade of pewter, and the facemask had a chrome-effect coating. The original Creamsicle shade of orange was reintroduced as accent trim. The reaction to the newer uniforms was mixed. Of note, the jersey numbers were derisively compared to digital alarm clock numerals. Different color sock combinations were used with white and colored uniforms, almost always being pewter or red; however, there were two occasions in 2014 when orange socks were used for two different weeks.

Like the 1997–2013 version, the new 2014 uniforms could be worn as combinations of red or white jerseys paired with either pewter or white trousers. As before, the Buccaneers typically wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season, and their red jerseys at home during the second half of the season as well as for night games.

In 2015, the Buccaneers debuted a Color Rush uniform featuring red jerseys and red trousers, with pewter numerals.

===2020–present===
The Buccaneers unveiled three designs on April 7, 2020. The new uniform designs evoke the club&#x27;s 1997–2013 design, while incorporating modern design elements from the 2014 uniform refresh, including the enlarged flag-and-crossed-swords logo, the newer shade of pewter, as well as the modern ship design logo on the sleeves. While the Buccaneers kept the familiar red and white jerseys with either white or pewter pants, they changed their &quot;Color Rush&quot; alternate uniform to an all-pewter combination.

For Super Bowl LV held at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa Bay was the designated home team, the first team in NFL history to play in a Super Bowl in their own stadium. They elected to wear their road white jerseys with pewter trousers, instead of their red jerseys, citing the success they had enjoyed during the season in that combination. Tampa Bay routed Kansas City 31–9, giving them a Super Bowl win in both their red jerseys (XXXVII) and their white jerseys (LV).

During the 2020 season, the Buccaneers finished with a 6–0 record wearing their newer white jersey/pewter pants combination, including three postseason victories over New Orleans, Green Bay, and Kansas City, respectively. They were first introduced in their Week 6 game against Green Bay, a 38–10 win at Raymond James Stadium. A renewed interest in wearing white jerseys at home saw Tampa Bay schedule six of eight 2021 home games with white (up from the typical four), plus home playoff games in the Wild Card and Divisional rounds with white/pewter as well.

===Throwback uniform===
Following their uniform change in 1997, the Buccaneers did not wear the old orange uniforms, even during popular league-sponsored &quot;throwback&quot; weekends. The old uniforms were mostly eschewed by the club, and the sale of team merchandise in the old color scheme was embargoed for several years. Fans&#x27; opinions of the old uniforms were equally negative. However, after over a decade, there was a renewed interest in the old uniforms, as throwbacks and other alternate uniforms across the league were becoming increasingly popular. In 2008, the team revealed that they would be wearing orange throwback uniforms for one game in the 2009 season. Their use was in conjunction with the creation of a Buccaneers Ring of Honor, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the 1979 division championship team.

Throwback merchandise went on sale in the summer of 2009, and referred to the orange color not as &quot;Florida Orange&quot;, but as &quot;Orange Glaze&quot;. Considerable research was done using photographs and old uniforms to match the original color schemes. The dagger-biting pirate was given a cleaned-up look, and the orange, red, and white uniforms debuted against the Packers (Tampa Bay&#x27;s former division rival) on November 8, 2009. Raymond James Stadium was also transformed via orange banners and classic field logos and fonts back to the classic Tampa Stadium look of the late 1970s. The Buccaneers won their first throwback game behind rookie quarterback Josh Freeman&#x27;s first-career NFL start. The throwback game was to become an annual tradition, but went on hiatus after 2012 due to league-wide safety restrictions requiring players wear the same helmet throughout the season. After changes in league policies, the throwback uniforms returned in 2023. The Buccaneers are 1–5 in throwback games.

==Players of note==

===Current roster===
===Pro Football Hall of Famers===
===Awards of Excellence===
===Retired numbers===
The Buccaneers have retired three jersey numbers, led by Lee Roy Selmon&#x27;s number 63. Derrick Brooks (55) and Warren Sapp (99) had their numbers formally retired after they were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Despite not being formally retired, the Buccaneers have not reissued 20 (Ronde Barber), 40 (Mike Alstott), or 47 (John Lynch) since those players retired from playing. As of 2024, neither Lynch nor Barber have had their numbers retired, despite also being inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Another number that has seen limited usage is 42, worn by the late Ricky Bell. Since Bell&#x27;s last season in 1981, 42 has only been worn by two players, the most recent being in 1990.
===Individual awards===


















===NFL All-Decade and Anniversary Teams===
Since Tampa Bay&#x27;s entrance into the NFL, at least one player has been included on each NFL All-Decade Team, excluding the 1970s which Tampa Bay only had existed for four seasons. Tampa Bay has had players elected to the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s teams. Among the three Anniversary Teams, the franchise did not exist for the 50th Anniversary Team, no players were selected to the 75th Anniversary Team, and five players were selected to the 100th Anniversary Team. Players are only included on lists which they played for the team within the years of the decade; members, such as Tom Brady, did not join the Buccaneers until 2020, despite being a member of the 2000s and 2010s All-Decade Teams.







===Tampa Stadium Krewe of Honor===
In 1991, the organization initiated the &quot;Krewe of Honor&quot; to recognize top players, and featured a mural of the first class of three members. The display was painted in 1992 by Pat Donatelli and located on the east side of the stadium. Honorees were presented with a plaque. Quarterback Doug Williams was subsequently inducted September 6, 1992, and owner Hugh Culverhouse on September 5, 1993. No additional members were added before Tampa Stadium was closed and demolished; when the stadium was demolished in 1998, so was the Krewe.


===Ring of Honor===
On November 8, 2009, the team unveiled a new Ring of Honor at Raymond James Stadium. Hall of Fame defensive tackle, as well as the franchise&#x27;s first-ever draft pick, Lee Roy Selmon was the first inductee. On October 19, 2008, one year prior to the inception of the Ring of Honor, Mike Alstott was honored by the club following his retirement. He would be formally inducted into the ring in 2015. Former head coach Jon Gruden was inducted in 2017, but due to controversy surrounding emails he sent while working for ESPN, his name was removed in 2021. However, he was reinstated in February 2025. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the induction ceremony for 2020 inductee Monte Kiffin was postponed until 2021. Inductees John Lynch and Ronde Barber were both honored a second time for having subsequently been named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Criteria for induction is loose, and no formal voting process is conducted. Ownership considers players, coaches, or club executives that have had &quot;an indelible impact on the franchise&quot;. Maintaining strong ties to the team and the greater Tampa Bay community is an important factor. As of 2023, each of the players that had been named to the defunct &quot;Krewe of Honor&quot; have been subsequently inducted into the new Ring of Honor, with the lone exception of Ricky Bell.

The ring initially featured the player&#x27;s number and last name in protruding, illuminated letters, along the frieze of the stadium&#x27;s upper deck. When the stadium underwent renovations in 2016–2017, the ring was refreshed to flat white letters on a red background, expanded to include both first and last names. Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees are additionally denoted by a hall of fame logo next to their names. In 2021, the ring was further expanded with recognition of Tampa Bay&#x27;s two Super Bowl victories (2002 and 2020) on the wall below the frieze.

===All-Pro Team Selections===
Many current and former members of the Buccaneers have been selected to the Associated Press All-Pro first and second teams. While the AP All-Pro teams are generally considered the highest nomination, Pro Football Writers of America, Newspaper Enterprise Association, Pro Football Weekly, Pro Football Focus, and The Sporting News have also nominated Buccaneers players to their All-Pro teams.

==Culture==

=== Tampa Bay Buccaneers Cheerleaders ===
The Bucs created an official cheerleading squad in their first season, called the &quot;Swash-Buc-Lers&quot;. In 1999, they were renamed as the &quot;Tampa Bay Buccaneers Cheerleaders&quot;.

===&quot;A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story&quot;===

&quot;A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story&quot; is a made-for-television movie that recounts the life of the late Buccaneer running back Ricky Bell. The movie takes place through a dramatic reenactment of the 1981 season, including actual footage of gameplay around the dramatized role by Mario Van Peebles playing Bell himself. Bell finds himself befriending an impaired child who inspire each other to become better in their own ways. It also includes other former Buccaneer players, like Lee Roy Selmon, Charley Hannah, and Doug Williams (only through gameplay footage).

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===

====Atlanta Falcons====

The Buccaneers and Falcons met for the first time in the 1977 season, one year after the Buccaneers joined the NFL as the newest expansion team. The rivalry became fiercer after the 2002 season, when the Buccaneers and Falcons were placed in the same division, leading to constant clashes for the divisional title. The Falcons lead the overall series, 32–31. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.

====Carolina Panthers====

The Buccaneers and Panthers first meet in 1995, back when the later team joined the NFL as expansion franchise. However, the rivalry would take off during the 2000s with the creation of the NFC South and was described as &quot;heated&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; due to two main reasons; the first being that both teams fought for dominating control over the NFC South throughout most of the 2000s. The second reason being that players on both franchises suffered season ending injuries during their annual games. Examples include Chris Simms, Dante Wesley, Clifton Smith, and Kavika Pittman. As of the 2024 season, the Panthers lead the rivalry 25–24.

====New Orleans Saints====

The Saints and Buccaneers have one noticeable parallel throughout the two franchises history, they were both regarded as unsuccessful franchises until the 21st century, which was both teams were placed in the NFC South in 2002, as well as when their rivalry would truly begin to take off, when both teams improved their fortunes, though the Buccaneers got over the hump first with by winning Super Bowl XXXVII and the Saints winning their first Super Bowl 7 years later in Super Bowl XLIV. The first meeting between these two franchises first occurred in 1977 when the Buccaneers beat the Saints and ended their 26-game straight losing streak. While it is not the most well known rivalry in the NFL, it&#x27;s grown into one of the league&#x27;s fiercest and most physical. The rivalry reached new heights in the 2000s, which was when the Buccaneers had a higher advantage over the Saints in the regular season, when both teams started posting winning seasons in that decade. New Orleans Saints leads the rivalry 39–24 and the two franchises met once in the playoffs in which the Buccaneers defeated the Saints 30 to 20 and eventually won Super Bowl LV.

===Conference===
From 1977 to 2001; the Buccaneers played in the former NFC Central division, culminating in two former divisional rivalries developing with the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers.

==== Green Bay Packers ====

The Buccaneers and Packers were division rivals from 1977 to 2002 when both were in the NFC Central division. The teams have played several notable games, including a Snow Bowl game in 1985, a playoff game in 1998 and the NFC Championship Game in 2021. As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the series 34–24–1.

==== Philadelphia Eagles ====
The Buccaneers have grown a fairly recent playoff rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles beginning in the late 1970s, but reached new heights in competition during the new millennium as the two teams have met in the postseason four times since 2000. The rivalry would return in the early 2020s when the Buccaneers beat the Eagles in the 2021 and 2023 NFC Wild Card games. As of the 2023 season, The Buccaneers lead the all-time series 12–11. The Eagles lead in regular season matchups 8–9, while the Buccaneers leads 4–2 in the postseason.

==== Los Angeles Rams ====
The Buccaneers have also grown a recent rivalry with the Los Angeles Rams as the two teams have faced off numerous times in the postseason; first meeting in the 2022 NFC Divisional round, and in the Conference Championship twice, both in 1979 and 2000 with the Rams winning all 3 matchups. The two teams became the first in league history to win a Super Bowl in their home stadiums as Tampa won Super Bowl LV in 2021, and Los Angeles won Super Bowl LVI a year later. Both teams combine for four Super Bowl championships as they regularly fought for control of the conference in the early 2000s and 2020s respectively. As of the 2023 season, the Rams lead the all-time series 19–10.

===Inter Conference===
==== Miami Dolphins ====

The Buccaneers developed a minor instate rivalry with fellow Floridian team; the Miami Dolphins. The two teams had their first meeting in Week 7 of the 1976 season, with the Dolphins winning 23–20. The 1976 meeting was the only one where both teams were members of the AFC, with Tampa leaving later to join the NFC. As a result, the two teams can only meet as interconference rivals, which is not guaranteed to be annual. As of the 2023 season, the Buccaneers leads the all-time regular-season series 7–5.

==Radio and television==
The Buccaneers&#x27; current flagship radio stations are WXTB 97.9 FM and WDAE 620 AM. The play-by-play announcer since 1989 has been Gene Deckerhoff. Former Bucs tight end Dave Moore joined Deckerhoff as analyst for the 2007 season. T. J. Rives works as the sideline reporter.

Broadcast legend and former Green Bay Packers&#x27; announcer Ray Scott was the play-by-play man for the Bucs&#x27; first two seasons in 1976 and 1977. Dick Crippen called the team&#x27;s games in the first half of the 1978 season, with Jim Gallogly taking over for the second half. From 1979 to 1988 Mark Champion, who became the radio voice of the Detroit Lions (1989–2004) and then the Detroit Pistons (2001–present), held that position with the Bucs.

Former Buccaneer Hardy Nickerson served as color commentator for one season in 2006, until he signed with the Bears as a linebackers coach on February 23, 2007. Nickerson had replaced Scot Brantley, who was the commentator from 1999 through 2005. Jesse Ventura, the famous professional wrestler, actor, and former governor of Minnesota, was Deckerhoff&#x27;s partner on the Bucs radio broadcasts for one year, 1990, and former Buc David Logan held that position after Ventura until his death after the 1998 season. Dave Kocerek and Fran Curci were also color commentators for the Buccaneers during their earlier years.

Ronnie Lane previously worked as a sideline reporter.

The Bucs have broadcast on FM radio since signing with Top 40 station WRBQ-FM in . The team moved to WQYK-FM in , then to WFUS in , and then to WXTB in .

While regular season and playoff games in the NFL are all broadcast by national television contracts on CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN and NFL Network, the television broadcasts are for the most part handled by the individual teams. WESH simulcasts the broadcast in the Orlando area.

CBS, Fox and NBC games are shown respectively in Tampa Bay on WTSP, WTVT and WFLA-TV, while they are shown respectively in Orlando on WKMG, WOFL and WESH. The great majority of games are aired on Fox owned-and-operated stations WTVT and WOFL, by virtue of Fox owning the rights to NFC games. WTSP and WKMG air any Buccaneers home games against American Football Conference teams. &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games on ESPN and Thursday night games on NFL Network are simulcast locally on WMOR-TV, who also previously carried the Bucs&#x27; &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; games when they were televised on ESPN and TNT; previously, the Bucs&#x27; appearances on the cable networks were seen locally on WFLA-TV and WFTS.

At WFLA, Chris Myers was the play-by-play announcer with John Lynch as color commentator. Both Myers and Lynch worked nationally with Fox Sports at the time until Lynch became the general manager of the San Francisco 49ers in 2017. Ron Jaworski previously served as color commentator, until he signed with &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; for 2007. Charles Davis also served as color commentator from 2007 to 2008.

WTOG channel 44 also previously broadcast Buccaneers preseason games for many years, ending in 2002. Former CBS play-by-play and ESPN golf broadcaster Jim Kelly was the play-by-play announcer for many of those games in the 1980s, and Joe Namath was a commentator.

In the early years of the franchise, WTVT, then a CBS affiliate, broadcast some Buccaneers preseason games. Sports anchor Andy Hardy handled the play-by-play, and for one game in 1978, his broadcast partner was his friend, Florida State alumni, and movie actor Burt Reynolds.

<text>The Tennessee Titans are a professional American football team based in Nashville, Tennessee. The Titans compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The Tennessee Titans play their home games at Nissan Stadium; the team will move to a new stadium which will be completed in 2027.

Originally known as the Houston Oilers, the team was founded in 1959 by Houston oil tycoon Bud Adams, who remained the owner until his death in 2013. The team began play in 1960 in Houston, Texas, as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Houston Oilers won the first two AFL championships along with four division titles, and joined the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. The Houston Oilers made playoff appearances from 1978 to 1980 and from 1987 to 1993, with Hall of Famers Earl Campbell and Warren Moon, respectively.

In 1997, the Houston Oilers relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, playing at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee, for one season while waiting for a new stadium to be constructed. The team moved to Nashville&#x27;s Vanderbilt Stadium in 1998. For those two seasons, the team was known as the Tennessee Oilers, but changed its name to the Tennessee Titans for the 1999 season, when they moved into Adelphia Coliseum, now known as Nissan Stadium. The Tennessee Titans&#x27; training facility is in Saint Thomas Sports Park, a 31-acre site at the MetroCenter complex in Nashville.

The Tennessee Titans played in Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, losing 23–16 to the St. Louis Rams. Led by Steve McNair and Eddie George, the Tennessee Titans made the playoffs in all but one season from 1999 to 2003, but only twice in the next 13 years. From 2016 to 2021, the Tennessee Titans had six consecutive winning seasons and four playoff appearances. The Tennessee Titans are the only NFL team to have two players rush for 2,000 yards in a season, Chris Johnson (2009) and Derrick Henry (2020).

==History==
===Houston Oilers===
After failed attempts to start an NFL expansion team in Houston, Adams founded the Houston Oilers in 1959, as one of the eight charter members of the upstart American Football League (AFL) and a member of its Eastern Division. Beginning play at Jeppesen Stadium at the University of Houston, the team moved to Rice Stadium at Rice University in 1965. Led by quarterback George Blanda, who played with the team from 1960 to 1966, the Houston Oilers made it to each of the first three AFL championship games. The Oilers won the first two AFL championships, both against the San Diego Chargers, but lost the 1962 American Football League Championship Game 20–17 to the Dallas Texans, now Kansas City Chiefs, after double overtime. The Houston Oilers failed to post a winning season in the next six seasons, but in 1967, a 9–4–1 record returned the team to the AFL championship game where it lost 40–7 to the Oakland Raiders. The Houston Oilers moved into the Astrodome after the season, becoming the first professional football team to move into a domed stadium. After failing to qualify for the AFL playoffs in 1968, the Oilers qualified the following season in 1969, but were eliminated in the divisional round by the Oakland Raiders in a 56–7 blowout.

Following the season, the AFL merged with the NFL in 1970, with the Houston Oilers being assigned to the new American Football Conference (AFC)&#x27;s Central division. The Houston Oilers failed to qualify for the NFL playoffs from 1970 to 1977, and posted one winning season in 1975. In 1978, the Houston Oilers selected running back Earl Campbell with the first overall pick in the 1978 NFL draft. Campbell led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances as a wildcard berth from 1978 to 1980. Campbell led the NFL in rushing yards and won the Offensive Player of the Year Award in each of those three seasons. The Oilers made it to the AFC championships in 1978 and 1979, but were defeated both times by the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Houston Oilers failed to post a winning record between 1981 and 1987, a drought that ended when the Houston Oilers acquired quarterback Warren Moon in 1987. With Moon and Hall of Fame offensive linemen Mike Munchak and Bruce Matthews, the Houston Oilers made six consecutive playoff appearances from 1987 to 1993. During the 1992–93 NFL playoffs, the Houston Oilers earned the dubious distinction of being on the losing end of what was then the biggest comeback in NFL history when in the divisional round, the Houston Oilers&#x27; third-quarter 32-point lead against the Buffalo Bills turned into a 41–38 loss in overtime. This remains the largest blown lead in playoff history. After the 1993 season, Moon was traded to the Minnesota Vikings and Munchak retired to begin a coaching career. The following season, the Oilers finished with a league-worst 2–14 season, and Jack Pardee was fired as head coach after a 1–9 start and was succeeded by Jeff Fisher. The following two seasons, the Oilers drafted quarterback Steve McNair and running back Eddie George respectively, who became franchise players over the next several years. The Oilers respectively went 7–9 and 8–8 in their final two seasons in Houston.

===Tennessee Oilers===
After the 1995 season, Bud Adams announced the move to Tennessee. A Nashville stadium for the Tennessee Oilers would not be ready until 1999, so the Tennessee Oilers planned to play two seasons at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee. The team was based in Nashville and commuted to Memphis, Tennessee for games.

In Memphis, Tennessee had some of the smallest NFL crowds since the 1950s attended games. In the first seven games of the season, there were crowds of less than 27,000, and two games drew less than 18,000 people.

For the 1998 season, the Tennessee Oilers played their home games at the stadium on the campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. That year, the team was in playoff contention until losing their last two games for another 8–8 record. The Tennessee Oilers were 6–2 in Nashville and 2–6 on the road.

===Tennessee Titans===
During the 1998 offseason, Adams appointed an advisory committee to decide on a new name for the Tennessee Oilers to coincide with the opening of their new stadium, which was renamed Nissan Stadium in 2015. On November 14, 1998, the new name of Tennessee Titans was unveiled. The name is a nod to how Nashville is nicknamed the &quot;Athens of the South&quot; for its classical architecture and large number of higher learning institutions.

The 1999 season marked a remarkable beginning for the Titans, as they made a dramatic run to Super Bowl XXXIV. Led by head coach Jeff Fisher and quarterback Steve McNair, the team finished the regular season with a 13–3 record. Their playoff journey included the famous &quot;Music City Miracle&quot; victory over the Buffalo Bills, where a last-second lateral play resulted in a kickoff return touchdown. The Titans reached the Super Bowl but narrowly lost to the St. Louis Rams, falling one yard short of a potential game-tying touchdown.

In the years following their Super Bowl appearance, the Tennessee Titans experienced mixed success. They reached the playoffs several times in the early 2000s, with standout performances from players like running back Eddie George and defensive end Jevon Kearse. However, the team struggled with consistency and faced multiple rebuilding phases. Following the departures of George and McNair in 2003 and 2005, respectively, the Titans drafted quarterback Vince Young in 2006, who led the team to a playoff berth in 2007. Despite being named Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2006 and being a two-time Pro Bowl selection, Young&#x27;s tenure was marred by injuries, inconsistency and clashes with Jeff Fisher. In 2008, Young was benched in favor of veteran Kerry Collins, who led the Titans to a league best 13–3 record and a playoff appearance before being defeated in the divisional round of the playoffs to the Baltimore Ravens. In 2009, following a 0–6 start under Collins, Young returned as starting quarterback and led the Titans to winning eight of their final ten games and narrowly missing the playoffs. The 2009 season was also notable as it was the season in which second-year running back Chris Johnson became the sixth player to run for more than 2,000 yards in a season and broke Marshall Faulk&#x27;s record for most single season yards from scrimmage. Johnson made three Pro Bowl appearances with the Titans before departing after the 2013 season. Following the 2010 season, Young, Collins and Fisher all departed, and quarterback Jake Locker was drafted in 2011. After spending his rookie season as a backup, Locker&#x27;s career as a starter beginning in 2012 was marked by inconsistent play and numerous injuries, which led to his retirement shortly after departing from the team after the 2014 season after a four-year career.

After posting a league-worst 2–14 record during the 2014 season, their worst since moving to Tennessee, the Titans drafted quarterback Marcus Mariota in the 2015 NFL Draft with the second overall pick, who became the Titans&#x27; franchise quarterback for the next four seasons. Although the Titans finished with another league worst record of 3–13 during the 2015 season, Mariota along with multi-Pro Bowl teammates such as tight end Delanie Walker, offensive tackle Taylor Lewan and defensive tackle/defensive end Jurrell Casey, led the Titans to three consecutive winning records of 9–7 from 2016 to 2018. During the 2017 season, the Titans returned to the playoffs for the first time since the 2008 and won their first playoff game since 2003, overcoming a 21–3 halftime deficit against the Kansas City Chiefs to win 22–21 before being eliminated in the divisional round. The Titans saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 35–14 loss to the New England Patriots. Despite their postseason success in the 2017 season, the Titans moved on from head coach Mike Mularkey.

The Tennessee Titans entered a new era in the late 2010s with the hiring of head coach Mike Vrabel in 2018. Prominent players drafted during the 2019 season included defensive end Jeffery Simmons and wide receiver A. J. Brown, both of whom would later have prolific careers with the team. Under Vrabel&#x27;s leadership, during the 2019 season, Mariota was benched in favor of offseason trade acquisition Ryan Tannehill after a 2–4 start and with the emergence running back Derrick Henry, who led the NFL in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, the team returned to prominence. The Titans reached the AFC Championship Game during the 2019 season. Mariota, Walker and Casey all departed after the 2019 season.

Derrick Henry won the Offensive Player of the Year Award in 2020 after rushing for 2,000 yards. Henry was part of a 2020 campaign that saw the Titans win the AFC South with an 11–5 record. The Titans&#x27; season ended with a 20–13 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.

In the 2021 season, the Titans finished with a 12–5 record, won the AFC South, and got a first round bye. The Titans&#x27; season ended with a Divisional Round 19–16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. The Titans traded away Brown after the season. In 2022, the Titans suffered their first losing season since 2015 with a 7–10 mark, losing each of their last seven games despite a 7–3 start. In the 2023 season, the Titans finished with a 6–11 record. Following the 2023 season, Vrabel was fired as head coach. Former Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan was hired to be the team&#x27;s head coach prior to the 2024 season. Prominent departures that occurred during or after the 2023 season included Henry, Tannehill and two-time First-Team All-Pro safety Kevin Byard.

==Logos and uniforms==
When the team debuted as the Houston Oilers in 1960, its logo was an oil rig derrick. Except for minor color changes throughout the years, this logo remained the same until the team was renamed the Titans in 1999. The logo was originally called &quot;Ol&#x27; Riggy&quot;, but this name was dropped before the 1974 season.

The Oilers&#x27; uniforms consisted of blue or white jerseys, red trim, and white pants. From 1966 to 1971, the pants with both the blue and white jerseys were silver to match the color of the helmets. The team commonly wore light blue pants on the road with the white jerseys from 1972 to 1994, with the exception of the 1980 season, and selected games in the mid-1980s, when the team wore an all-white road combination. For selected games in 1973 and 1974, and again from 1981 through 1984, the Oilers wore their white jerseys at home. Coach Jeff Fisher discarded the light blue pants in 1995. From 1960 to about 1965 and from 1972 to 1974, the Oilers wore blue helmets; the helmets were silver from 1966 to 1971 and white from 1975 to 1998.

From 1997 to 1998, when it was known as the Tennessee Oilers, the team had an alternate logo that combined elements of the flag of Tennessee with the derrick. The team also wore its white uniforms during home games. In its two years as the Tennessee Oilers, the team wore its colored jerseys for road games against the Miami Dolphins and a Thanksgiving Day game against the Dallas Cowboys. It wore all white exclusively in its last year as the Tennessee Oilers.

When the team was renamed the Titans in 1999, it introduced a new logo that was a circle with three stars representing the state&#x27;s Grand Divisions, containing a large &quot;T&quot; with a trail of flames similar to a comet. The uniforms consisted of white helmets, red trim, and either navy or white jerseys. White pants were worn with the navy jerseys, and navy pants with the white jerseys. On both the navy and white jerseys, the outside shoulders and sleeves were light Titans blue. In a game against the Washington Redskins on October 15, 2006, the Titans wore their navy jerseys with navy pants for the first time. Since 2000, the Titans have worn their dark uniforms at home. They have worn white at home during daytime contests in September home games to gain an advantage with the heat, except in the 2005, 2006 and 2008 seasons.

In 2003, the Titans introduced an alternate jersey that was light Titans blue with navy outside shoulders and sleeves, which was worn with blue pants. Until 2007, they wore the jersey twice in each regular-season game. They always wore the Titans blue jersey in their annual divisional game against the Houston Texans and for other selected home games. Their selection in those games was representative of the organization&#x27;s ties to Houston and the AFL. On November 19, 2006, the Titans introduced light Titans blue pants in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles. In December 2006, they combined the Titans blue pants with the Titans blue jersey to create an all Titans blue uniform. Vince Young appeared in this uniform in the cover art for &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot;.

During the 2006 season, the Titans wore seven different uniform combinations, pairing the white jersey with all three sets of pants (white, Titans blue, navy blue), the navy jersey with the white and navy pants, and the Titans blue jersey with navy and Titans blue pants. In a game against the Atlanta Falcons on October 7, 2007, the Titans paired the navy blue jersey with the Titans blue pants for the first time. They wore the navy blue jerseys with the light blue pants against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The team paired the Titans blue jerseys with the white pants for the first time in a home game against the Indianapolis Colts on November 14, 2013. In 2008, the Titans blue jerseys became the regular home uniforms, with the navy blue jerseys being relegated to alternate status but not worn until 2013.

In 2009, the Titans and the Buffalo Bills began the 2009 NFL preseason in the Hall of Fame Game. Played at Canton&#x27;s Pro Football Hall of Fame Field at Fawcett Stadium on August 9, 2009, the game was nationally televised on NBC. The Titans defeated the Bills, 21–18. In honor of the AFL&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the Titans wore Oilers&#x27; uniforms for the game. In 2009, the team honored former quarterback Steve McNair by placing a small, navy blue disc on the back of their helmets with McNair&#x27;s white number nine inside of it.

In 2013, the team wore the navy blue jerseys twice in honor of their 15th anniversary as the Titans. The Titans wore white jerseys for all games in 2014, for the exceptions of two preseason home games, in which the team wore their light Titans blue jerseys, and a game against the Houston Texans on October 26, 2014, in which the Titans wore their navy blue uniforms.

Beginning in 2015, navy blue became the team&#x27;s primary home jersey color again, marking the first time since 2007 that the Titans wore navy as their primary home jersey. The light Titans blue jersey, which was the team&#x27;s primary jersey color from 2008 to 2014, became the team&#x27;s alternate jersey for a second time.

On April 4, 2018, the Titans debuted new uniforms that retain the color palette of navy blue, Titans blue and white, with new red and silver elements being introduced. The new helmets are navy blue with one silver sword-shaped stripe through the center and metallic gray face masks.

On July 23, 2023, the Titans unveiled the throwback powder blue Oilers uniforms.

==Rivalries==
The Titans share rivalries with their three AFC South opponents, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, and Indianapolis Colts. They have historical rivalries with former divisional opponents such as the Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, and Buffalo Bills.

===Divisional===
====Jacksonville Jaguars====

The rivalry with the Jaguars began in 1995 when the Titans were the Houston Oilers. The rivalry was heated in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the success of both franchises at the time, including a season in which Jacksonville went 14–2 and Tennessee went 13–3. That season, all three of Jacksonville&#x27;s losses, including the playoffs, came against the Titans, who played that year in Super Bowl XXXIV. The rivalry cooled when both teams experienced misfortune in the late 2000s to early 2010s, but both teams ended lengthy playoff droughts in 2017. As of the 2024 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 35–26.

====Houston Texans====

The Titans’ rivalry with the Houston Texans is more prevalent in Houston due to the Titans having previously played in the city. The Titans dominated the rivalry in the early 2000s, but the series has since evened out in the 2010s. As of the 2024 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 24–22.

====Indianapolis Colts====

Since the creation of the AFC South, the Titans and the Colts have been division rivals. In 2011, the Titans swept the Colts after 11 straight losses. In 2018, the Colts defeated the Titans in the last game of the regular season to clinch the final Wild Card spot, eliminating Tennessee from playoff contention. In 2020, the Titans claimed the AFC South championship over the Colts due to tie-breaking measures. As of the 2024 season, the Colts lead the all-time series 39–22.

===Conference===
====Buffalo Bills====

While in the AFL, the Houston Oilers was in the same division as the Buffalo Bills, but were moved to the AFC Central division following the NFL-AFL merger. Their rivalry remained strong into the 1980s and 1990s with Warren Moon leading the Oilers against Jim Kelly and the Bills. In 1993, the Comeback, and the January 8, 2000 Music City Miracle, were two iconic moments in Oilers/Titans history have occurred against the Bills. The Bills and Titans were featured in an AFL legacy game in 2009 as part of festivities commemorating the 50th anniversary of the AFL&#x27;s foundation. Titans owner Bud Adams was fined $250,000 by the league following the 41–17 Titans win in which he obscenely gestured toward the Bills sideline. Adams and Bills owner Ralph Wilson had maintained a friendly rivalry and were the last living original AFL owners at that time. As of the 2024 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 30–21.

====Baltimore Ravens====

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Titans and the Ravens began a rivalry, which flared up when former Titans quarterback Steve McNair went to the Ravens. From the realignment of the NFL&#x27;s divisions in 2002 to the 2020–21 NFL playoffs, the Titans have faced off against Baltimore five times in the postseason. Derrick Henry left the Titans in the 2024 offseason to play for the Ravens.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAL/TEN Playoff recaps&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2024 season, the Ravens lead the all-time series 14–13.

===Historic===
====Pittsburgh Steelers====

After the move to the AFC Central division, the Titans developed a rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers were the Oilers&#x27; primary divisional rival and by the 2020s, the Titans had played them more than any other NFL team. As of the 2024 season, the Steelers lead the all-time series 49–32.

===Defunct===
=== Texas Governor&#x27;s Cup: Dallas Cowboys/Dallas Texans ===

The Cowboys previously led the series against the Oilers 18–13.

==Culture==
===Flameheads===
During the Titans&#x27; first season in its new stadium, the end zone sections became known as the Flame Pit and fans began wearing head wear resembling flames. Called &quot;Flameheads&quot;, the costumes became prevalent during the Titans&#x27; successful years of the early 2000s. Flames are tied to the organization because in Greek Mythology, the Titan Prometheus stole fire and gave it to humanity.

===Cheerleaders and mascot===
The Tennessee Titans Cheerleaders represent the team in the NFL. They perform at every home game in Nissan Stadium and regularly do acts with the team&#x27;s mascot T-Rac. They have 28 members with four captains. They perform a variety of dance moves and high-risk stunts. They attend community events in Middle Tennessee.

T-Rac is the raccoon mascot of the Titans, debuting in the team&#x27;s inaugural preseason home game in August 1999 against the Atlanta Falcons. The raccoon is the state animal of Tennessee. T-Rac appears at every game in Nissan Stadium and performs at community events in Tennessee.

===Stadium traditions===
During every home game&#x27;s 4th quarter, the stadium plays a video of &quot;office linebacker&quot; Terry Tate, performed by Lester Speight, shouting his catchphrase, &quot;the pain train&#x27;s coming&quot;! The phrase is followed by the playing of &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; by Johnny Cash.

After every Titans first down at Nissan Stadium, the jumbotron plays a scene from the movie &quot;300&quot;, where the Spartans chant after King Leonidas asks, &quot;What is your profession?&quot; Titans fans simultaneously perform the chant three times, &quot;OOH! OOH! OOH!&quot; The chant debuted in video game form in &quot;Madden NFL 22&quot;.

===Titans Ring of Honor===
In 1999, Adams established a Titans/Oilers Hall of Fame after the 40th season of the franchise to honor past players and management, with the first class being seven that were all inducted on December 9, 1999. It was changed to Oilers/Titans Ring of Honor in 2008. Bum Phillips, Jeff Fisher and Floyd Reese were inducted in 2021. Billy &quot;White Shoes&quot; Johnson is the most recent inductee.

==Radio and television==

The flagship radio station of the Titans Radio Network for several years was WKDF 103.3-FM. WGFX 104.5-FM, the original Tennessee Oilers/Titans Radio flagship station, has served as the Titans Radio flagship station since the 2010 season. Mike Keith is the team&#x27;s play-by-play announcer, and former Titans assistant coach Dave McGinnis, head coach of the Arizona Cardinals from 2000 to 2003, provides color commentary during games. Previous to McGinnis, former Titans tight end Frank Wycheck provided the color commentary. Larry Stone provides injury and scoring updates. The Titans Radio Network is broadcast on 70 stations.

In 2011, the Titans extended its agreement with existing radio partners while creating a provision allowing home games to be broadcast on SiriusXM. They were the final team in the NFL to reach such a deal.

Most preseason games are televised on Nexstar station WKRN-TV, the ABC affiliate in Nashville, with &quot;The Mike Vrabel Show&quot;, a weekly Tuesday night coach&#x27;s show. The preseason games are distributed through a network consisting of Nexstar stations throughout the state and some affiliates where Nexstar has no stations.

For regular season games, Nashville CBS affiliate WTVF airs the most games due to its AFC-centric rights. Fox affiliate WZTV carries home games against NFC opponents, with select flexed games, NBC affiliate WSMV-TV has &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; broadcasts, and WKRN carries the team&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games.

<text>The Tetrarchy was the system instituted by Roman emperor Diocletian in 293 AD to govern the ancient Roman Empire by dividing it between two emperors, the &quot;augusti&quot;, and their junior colleagues and designated successors, the &quot;caesares&quot;. 

Initially Diocletian chose Maximian as his &quot;caesar&quot; in 285, raising him to co-&quot;augustus&quot; the following year; Maximian was to govern the western provinces and Diocletian would administer the eastern ones. The role of the &quot;augustus&quot; was likened to Jupiter, while his &quot;caesar&quot; was akin to Jupiter&#x27;s son Hercules. Galerius and Constantius were appointed &quot;caesares&quot; in March 293. Diocletian and Maximian retired on 1 May 305, raising Galerius and Constantius to the rank of &quot;augustus&quot;. Their places as &quot;caesares&quot; were in turn taken by Valerius Severus and Maximinus Daza.

The orderly system of two senior and two junior rulers endured until Constantius died in July 306, and his son Constantine was unilaterally acclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; and &quot;caesar&quot; by his father&#x27;s army. Maximian&#x27;s son Maxentius contested Severus&#x27; title, styled himself &quot;princeps invictus&quot;, and was appointed &quot;caesar&quot; by his retired father in 306. Severus surrendered to Maximian and Maxentius in 307. Maxentius and Constantine were both recognized as &quot;augusti&quot; by Maximian that same year. Galerius appointed Licinius &quot;augustus&quot; for the west in 308 and elevated Maximinus Daza to &quot;augustus&quot; in 310.

Constantine&#x27;s victory over Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 left him in control of the western part of the empire, while Licinius was left in control of the east on the death of Maximinus Daza. Constantine and Licinius jointly recognized their sons – Crispus, Constantine II, and Licinius II – as &quot;caesares&quot; in March 317. Ultimately the tetrarchic system lasted until c. 324, when mutually destructive civil wars eliminated most of the claimants to power: Licinius resigned as &quot;augustus&quot; after losing the Battle of Chrysopolis, leaving Constantine in control of the entire empire.

The Constantinian dynasty&#x27;s emperors retained some aspects of collegiate rule; Constantine appointed his son Constantius II as another &quot;caesar&quot; in 324, followed by Constans in 333 and his nephew Dalmatius in 335, and the three surviving sons of Constantine in 337 were declared joint &quot;augusti&quot; together, and the concept of the division of the empire under multiple joint emperors endured until the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. In the Eastern Roman Empire, &quot;augusti&quot; and &quot;caesares&quot; continued to be appointed sporadically.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;tetrarchy&quot; (from the , &quot;tetrarchia&quot;, &quot;leadership of four [people]&quot;) describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals.

Although the term &quot;tetrarch&quot; was current in antiquity, it was never used in the imperial college (as it&#x27;s often called) under Diocletian. Instead, the term was used to describe independent portions of a kingdom that were ruled under separate leaders. The tetrarchy of Judaea, established after the death of Herod the Great, is the most famous example of the antique tetrarchy. The term was understood in the Latin world as well, where Pliny the Elder glossed it as follows: &quot;each is the equivalent of a kingdom, and also part of one&quot; (&quot;regnorum instar singulae et in regna contribuuntur&quot;).

As used by the ancients, the term describes not only different governments, but also a different system of government from the Diocletianic arrangements. The Judaean tetrarchy was a set of four independent and distinct states, where each tetrarch ruled a quarter of a kingdom as they saw fit; the Diocletianic tetrarchy was a college led by a single supreme leader. When later authors described the period, this is what they emphasized: Ammianus had Constantius II admonish Gallus for disobedience by appealing to the example in submission set by Diocletian&#x27;s lesser colleagues; his successor Julian compared the Diocletianic tetrarchs to a chorus surrounding a leader, speaking in unison under his command. Only Lactantius, a contemporary of Diocletian and a deep ideological opponent of the Diocletianic state, referred to the tetrarchs as a simple multiplicity of rulers.

Much modern scholarship was written without the term. Although Edward Gibbon pioneered the description of the Diocletianic government as a &quot;New Empire&quot;, he never used the term &quot;tetrarchy&quot;; neither did Theodor Mommsen. It did not appear in the literature until used in 1887 by schoolmaster Hermann Schiller in a two-volume handbook on the Roman Empire (&quot;Geschichte der Römischen Kaiserzeit&quot;), to wit: &quot;die diokletianische Tetrarchie&quot;. Even so, the term did not catch on in the literature until Otto Seeck used it in 1897.
==Creation==
The first phase, sometimes referred to as the diarchy (&quot;rule of two&quot;), involved the designation of the general Maximian as co-emperor—firstly as &quot;caesar&quot; (heir apparent) in 285, followed by his promotion to &quot;augustus&quot; in 286. Diocletian took care of matters in the eastern regions of the empire while Maximian similarly took charge of the western regions. In 293, Diocletian thought that more focus was needed on both civic and military problems, so with Maximian&#x27;s consent, he expanded the imperial college by appointing two &quot;caesares&quot; (one responsible to each &quot;augustus&quot;)—Galerius and Constantius I.

In 305, the senior emperors jointly abdicated and retired, allowing Constantius and Galerius to be elevated in rank to &quot;augustus&quot;. They in turn appointed two new &quot;caesares&quot;—Severus II in the west under Constantius, and Maximinus in the east under Galerius—thereby creating the second Tetrarchy.

The four tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire against bordering rivals (notably Sassanian Persia) and barbarians (mainly Germanic, and an unending sequence of nomadic or displaced tribes from the eastern steppes) at the Rhine and Danube. These centres are known as the tetrarchic capitals. Although Rome ceased to be an operational capital, Rome continued to be nominal capital of the entire Roman Empire, not reduced to the status of a province but under its own, unique Prefect of the city (praefectus urbi, later copied in Constantinople).

The four tetrarchic capitals were:

*Nicomedia in northwestern Asia Minor (modern İzmit in Turkey), a base for defence against invasion from the Balkans and Persia&#x27;s Sassanids was the capital of Diocletian, the eastern (and most senior) &quot;augustus&quot;; in the final reorganisation by Constantine the Great, in 318, the equivalent of his domain, facing the most redoubtable foreign enemy, Sassanid Persia, became the praetorian prefecture Oriens, &#x27;the East&#x27;, the core of later Byzantium.
*Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica in the Vojvodina region of modern Serbia, and near Belgrade, on the Danube border) was the capital of Galerius, the eastern &quot;caesar&quot;; this was to become the Balkans-Danube prefecture Illyricum.
*Mediolanum (modern Milan, near the Alps) was the capital of Maximian, the western &quot;augustus&quot;; his domain became &quot;Italia et Africa&quot;, with only a short exterior border.
*Augusta Treverorum (modern Trier, in Germany) was the capital of Constantius, the western &quot;caesar&quot;, near the strategic Rhine border; it had been the capital of Gallic emperor Tetricus I. This quarter became the prefecture Galliae.

Aquileia, a port on the Adriatic coast, and Eboracum (modern York, in northern England near the Celtic tribes of modern Scotland and Ireland), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.

In terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division among the four tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a &#x27;war theater&#x27;. Each tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective praetorian prefect, each supervising several vicarii, the governors-general in charge of another, lasting new administrative level, the civil diocese. For a listing of the provinces, now known as eparchy, within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see Roman province.

In the West, the &quot;augustus&quot; Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his &quot;caesar&quot;, Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the &quot;augustus&quot; Diocletian and his &quot;caesar&quot;, Galerius, were much more flexible.

==Public image==
Although power was shared in the tetrarchic system, the public image of the four members of the imperial college was carefully managed to give the appearance of a united empire (&quot;patrimonium indivisum&quot;). This was especially important after the numerous civil wars of the 3rd century.

The tetrarchs appeared identical in all official portraits. Coinage dating from the tetrarchic period depicts every emperor with identical features—only the inscriptions on the coins indicate which one of the four emperors is being shown. The Byzantine sculpture &quot;Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs&quot; shows the tetrarchs again with identical features and wearing the same military costume.

==Military successes==
One of the greatest problems facing emperors in the Third Century Crisis was that they were only ever able to personally command troops on one front at any one time. While Aurelian and Probus were prepared to accompany their armies thousands of miles between war regions, this was not an ideal solution. Furthermore, it was risky for an emperor to delegate power in his absence to a subordinate general, who might win a victory and then be proclaimed as a rival emperor himself by his troops (which often happened). All members of the imperial college, on the other hand, were of essentially equal rank, despite two being senior emperors and two being junior; their functions and authorities were also equal.

Under the Tetrarchy a number of important military victories were secured. Both the dyarchic and the tetrarchic system ensured that an emperor was near to every crisis area to personally direct and remain in control of campaigns simultaneously on more than just one front. After suffering a defeat by the Persians in 296, Galerius crushed Narseh in 298—reversing a series of Roman defeats throughout the century—capturing members of the imperial household and a substantial amount of booty and gaining a highly favourable peace treaty, which secured peace between the two powers for a generation. Similarly, Constantius defeated the British usurper Allectus, Maximian pacified the Gauls, and Diocletian crushed the revolt of Domitianus in Egypt.

==Demise==

When in 305 the 20-year term of Diocletian and Maximian ended, both abdicated. Their &quot;caesares&quot;, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus, were both raised to the rank of &quot;augustus&quot;, and two new &quot;caesares&quot; were appointed: Maximinus Daza (&quot;caesar&quot; to Galerius) and Valerius Severus (&quot;caesar&quot; to Constantius). These four formed the second tetrarchy.

However, the system broke down very quickly thereafter. When Constantius died in 306, Constantine, Constantius&#x27; son, was proclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; by his father&#x27;s troops; however, Galerius instead chose to promote Severus to &quot;augustus&quot; while granting Constantine the position of caesar to Severus. At the same time, Maxentius, the son of Maximian, resented being left out of the new arrangements, so he rebelled against and defeated Severus before forcing him to abdicate and then arranging his murder in 307. Maxentius and Maximian both then declared themselves &quot;augusti&quot;. By 308 there were therefore no fewer than four claimants to the rank of &quot;augustus&quot; (Galerius, Constantine, Maximian and Maxentius), and only one to that of &quot;caesar&quot; (Maximinus Daza).

In 308 Galerius, together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the supposedly retired Maximian, called an imperial &quot;conference&quot; at Carnuntum on the River Danube. The council agreed that Licinius would become &quot;augustus&quot; in the West, with Constantine as his &quot;caesar&quot;. In the East, Galerius remained &quot;augustus&quot; and Maximinus remained his &quot;caesar&quot;. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared a usurper. This agreement proved disastrous: by 308 Maxentius had become &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Italy and Africa even without any imperial status, and neither Constantine nor Maximinus—who had both been &quot;caesares&quot; since 306 and 305 respectively—were prepared to tolerate the promotion of the &quot;augustus&quot; Licinius as their superior.

After an abortive attempt to placate both Constantine and Maximinus with the meaningless title &quot;filius augusti&quot; (&quot;son of the &quot;augustus&quot;&quot;, essentially an alternative title for &quot;caesar&quot;), they both had to be recognised as Augusti in 309. However, four full Augusti all at odds with each other did not bode well for the tetrarchic system.

Between 309 and 313 most of the claimants to the imperial office died or were killed in various civil wars. Constantine forced Maximian&#x27;s suicide in 310. Galerius died naturally in 311. Maxentius was defeated by Constantine at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 and subsequently killed. Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in 313 after being defeated in battle by Licinius.

By 313, therefore, there remained only two rulers: Constantine in the West and Licinius in the East. The tetrarchic system was at an end, although it took until 324 for Constantine to finally defeat Licinius, reunite the two halves of the Roman Empire and declare himself sole &quot;augustus&quot;.

== Emperors ==
==Family tree==
==Detailed timeline==

Two &quot;caesares&quot; are appointed in 293, thus starting the Tetrarchy.

After the retirement of the two a&quot;ugusti&quot; both previous &quot;caesares&quot; succeeded them, and two new &quot;caesares&quot; were appointed.

After the sudden death of Constantius Chlorus (who died of natural causes), the &quot;caesar&quot; Flavius Severus succeeded him as &quot;augustus&quot;. However, Constantius&#x27; troops immediately proclaimed Constantine, Constantius&#x27; son, as their new &quot;augustus&quot;. Galerius accepted Constantine as part of the imperial college, but only as &quot;caesar&quot;. On 28 October 306, Maximian&#x27;s son Maxentius proclaimed himself emperor in Rome. Maximian also proclaimed himself emperor, ruling jointly with his son. Despite being accepted by the Roman Senate, they were not recognized by the other emperors.

Severus was taken hostage by Maximian in April 307, but Galerius still acknowledged him as the official emperor of the west. Constantine was denied the promotion to &quot;augustus&quot; even after Severus&#x27; death in September, as Galerius had decided to exclude him from the system altogether. Maximian acknowledge Constantine&#x27;s status as &quot;augustus&quot;, but this meant nothing given that he himself was declared an usurper. Galerius and Maximinus thus remained as the only &quot;legimitate&quot; members of the imperial college.

At the council of Carnutum, Diocletian decides that Licinius will be the new &quot;augustus&quot; of the west (although his western domains only consist of the Diocese of Pannonia). Constantine was given back the title of &quot;caesar&quot;, which he continued to unacknowledge.

Maximinus was proclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; by his troops in about May 310. Galerius reluctantly agreed to recognize both Maximinus and Constantine as &quot;augusti&quot;, thus breaking the Diocletian&#x27;s tetrarchic system.

After the death of Galerius&#x27; (who died of natural causes), Licinius acquires parts of his domains, thus ruling over territories both in the East and West.

Licinius eventually fights and defeats Maximinus, gaining all eastern territories. He then makes peace with Constantine, who remains as the emperor of the West. This joint rule lasted until 316, when Licinius rejected Constantine&#x27;s election of Bassianus as &quot;caesar&quot;. In the ensuing war, both &quot;augusti&quot; appointed their own sons as &quot;caesares&quot;, restoring a dynastic system. Licinius appointed Valens and Martinian as &quot;augustus&quot; in 316 and 324 respectively (literary sources refer to them as &quot;caesar&quot;, but coins bear the title &quot;augustus&quot;); almost nothing is known about them.
== Chronological table ==
==Legacy==

Although the tetrarchic system as such only lasted until 313, many aspects of it survived. The fourfold regional division of the empire continued in the form of Praetorian prefectures, each of which was overseen by a praetorian prefect and subdivided into administrative dioceses, and often reappeared in the title of the military supra-provincial command assigned to a &quot;magister militum&quot;.

The pre-existing notion of &quot;consortium imperii&quot;, the sharing of imperial power, and the notion that an associate to the throne was the designated successor (possibly conflicting with the notion of hereditary claim by birth or adoption), was to reappear repeatedly.

The idea of the two halves, the east and the west, re-emerged and eventually resulted in the permanent de facto division into two separate Roman empires after the death of Theodosius I; though, importantly, the Empire was never formally divided. The emperors of the eastern and western halves legally ruled as one imperial college until the Fall of the Western Roman Empire left Byzantium, the &quot;second Rome&quot;, as the sole direct heir.

*The constellation of Jewish principalities in the Herodian kingdom of Judea was known as a tetrarchy; see Tetrarchy (Judea).
*In the novel &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, the Pevensie siblings rule Narnia as a tetrarchy of two kings and two queens.

<text>Theism is broadly defined as the belief in the existence of at least one deity. In common parlance, or when contrasted with &quot;deism&quot;, the term often describes the philosophical conception of God that is found in classical theism—or the conception found in monotheism—or gods found in polytheistic religions—or a belief in God or gods without the rejection of revelation, as is characteristic of deism.

Atheism is commonly understood as non-acceptance or outright rejection of theism in the broadest sense of the term (i.e., non-acceptance or rejection of belief in God or gods). Related (but separate) is the claim that the existence of any deity is unknown or unknowable; a stance known as agnosticism. 
&quot;Agnostic theism&quot; is a personal belief in one or more deities along with acceptance that the existence or non-existence of the deity or deities is fundamentally unknowable.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;theism&quot; derives from the Greek (&quot;theós&quot;) or &quot;theoi&quot; meaning &#x27;god&#x27; or &#x27;gods&#x27;. The term &quot;theism&quot; was first used by Ralph Cudworth (1617–1688). In Cudworth&#x27;s definition, they are &quot;strictly and properly called Theists, who affirm that a perfectly conscious understanding being, or mind, existing of itself from eternity, was the cause of all other things&quot;.

==Types of theism==

=== Classical theism ===

Classical theism is the form of theism that describes God as the Absolute Being. Central insights of classical theistic theology includes emanationism and divine simplicity. Classical theistic traditions can be observed in major religions and philosophies, such as Sufism in Islam, Vaishnavism in Hinduism, Sikhism in general, and Platonism.

===Monotheism===

Monotheism (from Greek ) is the belief in theology that only one deity exists. Some modern day monotheistic religions include Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Mandaeism, Druze, Baháʼí Faith, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Rastafari, some sects of Hinduism, and Eckankar.

===Polytheism===

Polytheism is the belief in multiple deities, which are usually assembled into a pantheon, along with their own religious sects and rituals. Polytheism was the typical form of religion before the development and spread of the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which enforce monotheism. It is well documented throughout history; from prehistory and the earliest records of ancient Egyptian religion and ancient Mesopotamian religion to the religions prevalent during Classical antiquity, such as ancient Greek religion and ancient Roman religion, and in ethnic religions such as Germanic, Slavic, and Baltic paganism and Native American religions.

Notable polytheistic religions practiced today include Taoism, Shenism or Chinese folk religion, Japanese Shinto, Santería, most traditional African religions, and various neopagan faiths such as Wicca, Druidry, Romuva, and Hellenism. Hinduism, while popularly held as polytheistic, cannot be exclusively categorised as such as some Hindus consider themselves to be pantheists and others consider themselves to be monotheists. Both are compatible with Hindu texts since there exists no consensus of standardisation in the faith. Advaita Vedanta, a philosophy in Hinduism, offers a combination of monotheism and polytheism, holding that Brahman is the sole &quot;ultimate reality&quot; of the universe, yet unity with it can be reached by worshipping multiple Devas and Devies.

A major division in modern polytheistic practices is between so-called &quot;soft&quot; polytheism and &quot;hard&quot; polytheism. &quot;Soft&quot; polytheism is the belief that different gods may be psychological archetypes, personifications of natural forces, or fundamentally one deity in different cultural contexts (e.g., Odin, Zeus, and Indra all being the same god as interpreted by Germanic, Greek, and Indic peoples, respectively)—known as . In this way, gods may be interchangeable for one another across cultures. &quot;Hard&quot; polytheism is the belief that gods are distinct, separate, real divine beings rather than psychological archetypes or personifications of natural forces. Hard polytheists reject the idea that &quot;all gods are one essential god&quot; and may also reject the existence of gods outside their own pantheon altogether.

Polytheism is further divided according to how the individual deities are regarded:

; Henotheism: Henotheism is the belief that there may be more than one deity but only one of them is to be worshiped. Zoroastrianism is sometimes considered an example. 
; Kathenotheism: Kathenotheism is the belief that there is more than one deity, but only one deity is worshiped at a time (or ever) and another may be worthy of worship in another time or place. If they are worshiped one at a time, then each is supreme in turn.
; Monolatrism: Monolatrism is the belief that there may be more than one deity but only one is worthy of being worshiped. Most of the modern monotheistic religions may have begun as monolatrous ones, but this is disputed.

===Pantheism===

Pantheism is the belief that reality, the universe and the cosmos are identical to divinity and a supreme being or entity. Pointing to the universe as being an immanent creator deity in and of itself, the deity is understood as still expanding, creating, and eternal, or that all things compose an all-encompassing, immanent god or goddess that is manifested as the universe. As such, even astronomical objects are viewed as part of the sole deity. The worship of all gods of every religion has been conceived as a form of pantheism, but such a system is more akin to Omnism.
Pantheist belief does not recognize a distinct personal god, anthropomorphic or otherwise, but instead characterizes a broad range of doctrines differing in forms of relationships between reality and divinity. Pantheistic concepts date back thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been identified in various religious traditions. The term &quot;pantheism&quot; was coined by mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697, and since then has been used to describe the beliefs of a variety of individuals and organizations. Pantheism was popularized in Western culture as a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza—in particular, his book &quot;Ethics&quot;. A pantheistic stance was also expressed by the 16th-century by philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno.

===Deism===

; Classical Deism: Classical deism is the belief that one God exists and created the world, but that the Creator does not alter the original plan for the universe. Instead, the deity presides over it in the form of Providence; some classical deists, however, did believe in divine intervention.
Deism typically rejects supernatural events (such as prophecies, miracles, and divine revelations) prominent in organized religion. Instead, deism holds that religious beliefs must be founded on human reason and observed features of the natural world, and that these sources reveal the existence of a supreme being as creator.
; Pandeism: Pandeism is the belief that God preceded the universe and created it but is now equivalent with it.
; Polydeism: Polydeism is the belief that multiple gods exist but do not intervene in the universe.

===Autotheism===

Autotheism is the belief that divinity exists within oneself and that individuals can achieve a godlike state. It is found in various philosophical and religious traditions emphasizing personal divinity or spiritual progression.

In Advaita Vedanta, a Hindu philosophical school, the phrase &quot;aham Brahmāsmi (&quot;&quot;I am Brahman&quot;) expresses the unity of the individual self (&quot;atman&quot;) with the ultimate reality (&quot;Brahman&quot;).

In Mormonism, the doctrine of exaltation suggests that faithful individuals can attain godhood in the afterlife.

Autotheistic ideas also appear in Gnosticism, which emphasizes self-knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;) as the path to recognizing one’s divine nature, and in Friedrich Nietzsche’s concept of the &quot;Übermensch&quot;, which advocates transcending human limitations to create one’s own values.

===Value-judgment Theisms===
; Eutheism: Eutheism is the belief that a deity is wholly benevolent.
; Dystheism: Dystheism is the belief that a deity is not wholly good, and is possibly evil.
; Maltheism: Maltheism is the belief that a deity exists but is wholly malicious.
; Misotheism: Misotheism is active hatred toward and for God, gods, and/or other divine beings.

===Non-theism and atheism ===
; Atheism : Atheism is defined by most people as the belief in the non-existence of gods, goddesses, and messiahs. Some atheists express an active disbelief or rejection of the existence of such entities.

; Non-theism: Non-theism is the belief in no gods or god.

; Agnosticism : Agnosticism is the belief that it is not known or not knowable whether a god or gods or the supernatural are part of reality regardless of how popular theistic beliefs may be. Agnostics withhold judgement on the existence and non-existence of a god on the basis that there is not enough evidence to come to a definitive conclusion that there is a god or that there is no god&#x27;.

=== Alterity theism ===
Alterity theism is a belief that the supreme being is radically transcendent to the point that it cannot be recognized as having any genuine being at all.

<text>In mathematics, the tensor product formula_1 of two vector spaces and (over the same field) is a vector space to which is associated a bilinear map formula_2 that maps a pair formula_3 to an element of formula_1 denoted .

An element of the form formula_5 is called the tensor product of and . An element of formula_1 is a tensor, and the tensor product of two vectors is sometimes called an &quot;elementary tensor&quot; or a &quot;decomposable tensor&quot;. The elementary tensors span formula_1 in the sense that every element of formula_1 is a sum of elementary tensors. If bases are given for and , a basis of formula_1 is formed by all tensor products of a basis element of and a basis element of .

The tensor product of two vector spaces captures the properties of all bilinear maps in the sense that a bilinear map from formula_10 into another vector space factors uniquely through a linear map formula_11 (see the section below titled &#x27;Universal property&#x27;), i.e. the bilinear map is associated to a unique linear map from the tensor product formula_1 to .

Tensor products are used in many application areas, including physics and engineering. For example, in general relativity, the gravitational field is described through the metric tensor, which is a tensor field with one tensor at each point of the space-time manifold, and each belonging to the tensor product of the cotangent space at the point with itself.

== Definitions and constructions ==

The &quot;tensor product&quot; of two vector spaces is a vector space that is defined up to an isomorphism. There are several equivalent ways to define it. Most consist of defining explicitly a vector space that is called a tensor product, and, generally, the equivalence proof results almost immediately from the basic properties of the vector spaces that are so defined. 

The tensor product can also be defined through a universal property; see , below. As for every universal property, all objects that satisfy the property are isomorphic through a unique isomorphism that is compatible with the universal property. When this definition is used, the other definitions may be viewed as constructions of objects satisfying the universal property and as proofs that there are objects satisfying the universal property, that is that tensor products exist.

=== From bases ===
Let and be two vector spaces over a field , with respective bases formula_13 and .

The &quot;tensor product&quot; formula_1 of and is a vector space that has as a basis the set of all formula_15 with formula_16 and . This definition can be formalized in the following way (this formalization is rarely used in practice, as the preceding informal definition is generally sufficient): formula_1 is the set of the functions from the Cartesian product formula_18 to that have a finite number of nonzero values. The pointwise operations make formula_1 a vector space. The function that maps formula_20 to and the other elements of formula_18 to is denoted .

The set formula_22 is then straightforwardly a basis of , which is called the &quot;tensor product&quot; of the bases formula_13 and .

We can equivalently define formula_1 to be the set of bilinear forms on formula_25 that are nonzero at only a finite number of elements of . To see this, given formula_26 and a bilinear form , we can decompose formula_27 and formula_28 in the bases formula_13 and formula_30 as:
formula_31
where only a finite number of formula_32&#x27;s and formula_33&#x27;s are nonzero, and find by the bilinearity of formula_34 that:
formula_35

Hence, we see that the value of formula_34 for any formula_26 is uniquely and totally determined by the values that it takes on . This lets us extend the maps formula_15 defined on formula_18 as before into bilinear maps formula_40 , by letting:
formula_41

Then we can express any bilinear form formula_34 as a (potentially infinite) formal linear combination of the formula_15 maps according to:
formula_44
making these maps similar to a Schauder basis for the vector space formula_45 of all bilinear forms on . To instead have it be a proper Hamel basis, it only remains to add the requirement that formula_34 is nonzero at an only a finite number of elements of , and consider the subspace of such maps instead. 

In either construction, the &quot;tensor product of two vectors&quot; is defined from their decomposition on the bases. More precisely, taking the basis decompositions of formula_47 and formula_48 as before:
formula_49

This definition is quite clearly derived from the coefficients of formula_50 in the expansion by bilinearity of formula_51 using the bases formula_13 and , as done above. It is then straightforward to verify that with this definition, the map formula_53 is a bilinear map from formula_10 to formula_55 satisfying the universal property that any construction of the tensor product satisfies (see below). 

If arranged into a rectangular array, the coordinate vector of formula_56 is the outer product of the coordinate vectors of formula_27 and . Therefore, the tensor product is a generalization of the outer product, that is, an abstraction of it beyond coordinate vectors. 

A limitation of this definition of the tensor product is that, if one changes bases, a different tensor product is defined. However, the decomposition on one basis of the elements of the other basis defines a canonical isomorphism between the two tensor products of vector spaces, which allows identifying them. Also, contrarily to the two following alternative definitions, this definition cannot be extended into a definition of the tensor product of modules over a ring.

=== As a quotient space ===
A construction of the tensor product that is basis independent can be obtained in the following way.

Let and be two vector spaces over a field. 

One considers first a vector space that has the Cartesian product formula_10 as a basis. That is, the basis elements of are the pairs formula_20 with formula_60 and . To get such a vector space, one can define it as the vector space of the functions formula_61 that have a finite number of nonzero values and identifying formula_20 with the function that takes the value on formula_20 and otherwise.

Let be the linear subspace of that is spanned by the relations that the tensor product must satisfy. More precisely, is spanned by the elements of one of the forms:
: formula_64
where , formula_65 and .

Then, the tensor product is defined as the quotient space:
: formula_66
and the image of formula_20 in this quotient is denoted .

It is straightforward to prove that the result of this construction satisfies the universal property considered below. (A very similar construction can be used to define the tensor product of modules.)

=== Universal property ===
In this section, the universal property satisfied by the tensor product is described. As for every universal property, two objects that satisfy the property are related by a unique isomorphism. It follows that this is a (non-constructive) way to define the tensor product of two vector spaces. In this context, the preceding constructions of tensor products may be viewed as proofs of existence of the tensor product so defined.

A consequence of this approach is that every property of the tensor product can be deduced from the universal property, and that, in practice, one may forget the method that has been used to prove its existence. 

The &quot;universal-property definition&quot; of the tensor product of two vector spaces is the following (recall that a bilinear map is a function that is &quot;separately&quot; linear in each of its arguments):
:The &quot;tensor product&quot; of two vector spaces and is a vector space denoted as , together with a bilinear map formula_68 from formula_10 to , such that, for every bilinear map , there is a &quot;unique&quot; linear map , such that formula_70 (that is, formula_71 for every formula_60 and ).

=== Linearly disjoint ===

Like the universal property above, the following characterization may also be used to determine whether or not a given vector space and given bilinear map form a tensor product.

For example, it follows immediately that if formula_73 and formula_74 are positive integers then formula_75 and the bilinear map formula_76 defined by sending formula_77 to formula_78 form a tensor product of formula_79 and . Often, this map formula_80 will be denoted by formula_81 so that formula_82 denotes this bilinear map&#x27;s value at .

As another example, suppose that formula_83 is the vector space of all complex-valued functions on a set formula_84 with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise (meaning that formula_85 is the map formula_86 and formula_87 is the map ). Let formula_84 and formula_80 be any sets and for any formula_90 and , let formula_91 denote the function defined by . 
If formula_92 and formula_93 are vector subspaces then the vector subspace formula_94 of formula_95 together with the bilinear map: 
formula_96
form a tensor product of formula_97 and .

== Properties ==
=== Dimension ===
If and are vector spaces of finite dimension, then formula_55 is finite-dimensional, and its dimension is the product of the dimensions of and .

This results from the fact that a basis of formula_55 is formed by taking all tensor products of a basis element of and a basis element of .

=== Associativity ===

The tensor product is associative in the sense that, given three vector spaces , there is a canonical isomorphism: 
: formula_100
that maps formula_101 to .

This allows omitting parentheses in the tensor product of more than two vector spaces or vectors.

=== Commutativity as vector space operation ===

The tensor product of two vector spaces formula_102 and formula_103 is commutative  in the sense that there is a canonical isomorphism: 
: formula_104
that maps formula_5 to .

On the other hand, even when , the tensor product of vectors is not commutative; that is , in general.
The map formula_106 from formula_107 to itself induces a linear automorphism that is called a . 
More generally and as usual (see tensor algebra), let formula_108 denote the tensor product of copies of the vector space . For every permutation of the first positive integers, the map:
: formula_109
induces a linear automorphism of , which is called a braiding map.

== Tensor product of linear maps ==

Given a linear map , and a vector space , the &quot;tensor product:&quot; 
: formula_110
is the unique linear map such that:
: formula_111
The tensor product formula_112 is defined similarly.

Given two linear maps formula_113 and , their tensor product: 
: formula_114 
is the unique linear map that satisfies: 
: formula_115

One has: 
: formula_116

In terms of category theory, this means that the tensor product is a bifunctor from the category of vector spaces to itself.

If and are both injective or surjective, then the same is true for all above defined linear maps. In particular, the tensor product with a vector space is an exact functor; this means that every exact sequence is mapped to an exact sequence (tensor products of modules do not transform injections into injections, but they are right exact functors).

By choosing bases of all vector spaces involved, the linear maps and can be represented by matrices. Then, depending on how the tensor formula_5 is vectorized, the matrix describing the tensor product formula_118 is the Kronecker product of the two matrices. For example, if , and above are all two-dimensional and bases have been fixed for all of them, and and are given by the matrices:
formula_119
respectively, then the tensor product of these two matrices is:
formula_120

The resultant rank is at most 4, and thus the resultant dimension is 4. here denotes the tensor rank i.e. the number of requisite indices (while the matrix rank counts the number of degrees of freedom in the resulting array). .

A dyadic product is the special case of the tensor product between two vectors of the same dimension.

== General tensors ==

For non-negative integers and a type formula_121 tensor on a vector space is an element of:
formula_122
Here formula_123 is the dual vector space (which consists of all linear maps from to the ground field ).

There is a product map, called the :
formula_124

It is defined by grouping all occurring &quot;factors&quot; together: writing formula_125 for an element of and formula_126 for an element of the dual space:
formula_127

If is finite dimensional, then picking a basis of and the corresponding dual basis of formula_123 naturally induces a basis of formula_129 (this basis is described in the article on Kronecker products). In terms of these bases, the components of a (tensor) product of two (or more) tensors can be computed. For example, if and are two covariant tensors of orders and respectively (i.e. formula_130 and ), then the components of their tensor product are given by:
formula_131

Thus, the components of the tensor product of two tensors are the ordinary product of the components of each tensor. Another example: let be a tensor of type with components , and let be a tensor of type formula_132 with components . Then:
formula_133
and:
formula_134

Tensors equipped with their product operation form an algebra, called the tensor algebra.

=== Evaluation map and tensor contraction ===
For tensors of type there is a canonical evaluation map:
formula_135
defined by its action on pure tensors:
formula_136

More generally, for tensors of type , with , there is a map, called tensor contraction:
formula_137
(The copies of formula_102 and formula_123 on which this map is to be applied must be specified.)

On the other hand, if formula_102 is , there is a canonical map in the other direction (called the coevaluation map):
formula_141
where formula_142 is any basis of , and formula_143 is its dual basis. This map does not depend on the choice of basis.

The interplay of evaluation and coevaluation can be used to characterize finite-dimensional vector spaces without referring to bases.

=== Adjoint representation ===
The tensor product formula_144 may be naturally viewed as a module for the Lie algebra formula_145 by means of the diagonal action: for simplicity let us assume , then, for each ,
formula_146
where formula_147 is the transpose of , that is, in terms of the obvious pairing on ,
formula_148

There is a canonical isomorphism formula_149 given by:
formula_150

Under this isomorphism, every in formula_145 may be first viewed as an endomorphism of formula_152 and then viewed as an endomorphism of . In fact it is the adjoint representation of .

== Linear maps as tensors ==
Given two finite dimensional vector spaces , over the same field , denote the dual space of as , and the -vector space of all linear maps from to as . There is an isomorphism:
formula_153
defined by an action of the pure tensor formula_154 on an element of ,
formula_155

Its &quot;inverse&quot; can be defined using a basis formula_156 and its dual basis formula_157 as in the section &quot;Evaluation map and tensor contraction&quot; above:
formula_158

This result implies:
formula_159
which automatically gives the important fact that formula_160 forms a basis of formula_161 where formula_162 are bases of and .

Furthermore, given three vector spaces , , the tensor product is linked to the vector space of &quot;all&quot; linear maps, as follows:
formula_163
This is an example of adjoint functors: the tensor product is &quot;left adjoint&quot; to Hom.

== Tensor products of modules over a ring ==

The tensor product of two modules and over a &quot;commutative&quot; ring is defined in exactly the same way as the tensor product of vector spaces over a field:
formula_164
where now formula_165 is the free -module generated by the cartesian product and is the -module generated by these relations.

More generally, the tensor product can be defined even if the ring is non-commutative. In this case has to be a right--module and is a left--module, and instead of the last two relations above, the relation:
formula_166
is imposed. If is non-commutative, this is no longer an -module, but just an abelian group.

The universal property also carries over, slightly modified: the map formula_167 defined by formula_168 is a middle linear map (referred to as &quot;the canonical middle linear map&quot;); that is, it satisfies:
formula_169

The first two properties make a bilinear map of the abelian group . For any middle linear map formula_170 of , a unique group homomorphism of formula_171 satisfies , and this property determines formula_172 within group isomorphism. See the main article for details.

=== Tensor product of modules over a non-commutative ring ===

Let &quot;A&quot; be a right &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;B&quot; be a left &quot;R&quot;-module. Then the tensor product of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is an abelian group defined by:
formula_173
where formula_174 is a free abelian group over formula_175 and G is the subgroup of formula_174 generated by relations:
formula_177

The universal property can be stated as follows. Let &quot;G&quot; be an abelian group with a map formula_178 that is bilinear, in the sense that:
formula_179

Then there is a unique map formula_180 such that formula_181 for all formula_182 and .

Furthermore, we can give formula_171 a module structure under some extra conditions:
# If &quot;A&quot; is a (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;R&quot;)-bimodule, then formula_171 is a left &quot;S&quot;-module, where .
# If &quot;B&quot; is a (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;S&quot;)-bimodule, then formula_171 is a right &quot;S&quot;-module, where .
# If &quot;A&quot; is a (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;R&quot;)-bimodule and &quot;B&quot; is a (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;T&quot;)-bimodule, then formula_171 is a (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;)-bimodule, where the left and right actions are defined in the same way as the previous two examples.
# If &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring, then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;R&quot;)-bimodules where formula_187 and . By 3), we can conclude formula_171 is a (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;R&quot;)-bimodule.

=== Computing the tensor product ===
For vector spaces, the tensor product formula_1 is quickly computed since bases of of immediately determine a basis of , as was mentioned above. For modules over a general (commutative) ring, not every module is free. For example, is not a free abelian group (-module). The tensor product with is given by:
formula_190

More generally, given a presentation of some -module , that is, a number of generators formula_191 together with relations:
formula_192
the tensor product can be computed as the following cokernel:
formula_193

Here , and the map formula_194 is determined by sending some formula_195 in the th copy of formula_196 to formula_197 (in ). Colloquially, this may be rephrased by saying that a presentation of gives rise to a presentation of . This is referred to by saying that the tensor product is a right exact functor. It is not in general left exact, that is, given an injective map of -modules , the tensor product:
formula_198
is not usually injective. For example, tensoring the (injective) map given by multiplication with , with yields the zero map , which is not injective. Higher Tor functors measure the defect of the tensor product being not left exact. All higher Tor functors are assembled in the derived tensor product.

== Tensor product of algebras ==

Let be a commutative ring. The tensor product of -modules applies, in particular, if and are -algebras. In this case, the tensor product formula_171 is an -algebra itself by putting:
formula_200
For example:
formula_201

A particular example is when and are fields containing a common subfield . The tensor product of fields is closely related to Galois theory: if, say, , where is some irreducible polynomial with coefficients in , the tensor product can be calculated as:
formula_202
where now is interpreted as the same polynomial, but with its coefficients regarded as elements of . In the larger field , the polynomial may become reducible, which brings in Galois theory. For example, if is a Galois extension of , then:
formula_203
is isomorphic (as an -algebra) to the .

== Eigenconfigurations of tensors ==
Square matrices formula_204 with entries in a field formula_205 represent linear maps of vector spaces, say , and thus linear maps formula_206 of projective spaces over . If formula_204 is nonsingular then formula_170 is well-defined everywhere, and the eigenvectors of formula_204 correspond to the fixed points of . The &quot;eigenconfiguration&quot; of formula_204 consists of formula_74 points in , provided formula_204 is generic and formula_205 is algebraically closed. The fixed points of nonlinear maps are the eigenvectors of tensors. Let formula_214 be a formula_215-dimensional tensor of format formula_216 with entries formula_217 lying in an algebraically closed field formula_205 of characteristic zero. Such a tensor formula_219 defines polynomial maps formula_220 and formula_221 with coordinates:
formula_222

Thus each of the formula_74 coordinates of formula_170 is a homogeneous polynomial formula_225 of degree formula_226 in . The eigenvectors of formula_204 are the solutions of the constraint:
formula_228
and the eigenconfiguration is given by the variety of the formula_229 minors of this matrix.

== Other examples of tensor products ==

=== Topological tensor products ===
Hilbert spaces generalize finite-dimensional vector spaces to arbitrary dimensions. There is an analogous operation, also called the &quot;tensor product,&quot; that makes Hilbert spaces a symmetric monoidal category. It is essentially constructed as the metric space completion of the algebraic tensor product discussed above. However, it does not satisfy the obvious analogue of the universal property defining tensor products; the morphisms for that property must be restricted to Hilbert–Schmidt operators.

In situations where the imposition of an inner product is inappropriate, one can still attempt to complete the algebraic tensor product, as a topological tensor product. However, such a construction is no longer uniquely specified: in many cases, there are multiple natural topologies on the algebraic tensor product. 

=== Tensor product of graded vector spaces ===
Some vector spaces can be decomposed into direct sums of subspaces. In such cases, the tensor product of two spaces can be decomposed into sums of products of the subspaces (in analogy to the way that multiplication distributes over addition).

=== Tensor product of representations ===
Vector spaces endowed with an additional multiplicative structure are called algebras. The tensor product of such algebras is described by the Littlewood–Richardson rule.

=== Tensor product of quadratic forms ===
=== Tensor product of multilinear forms ===
Given two multilinear forms formula_230 and formula_231 on a vector space formula_102 over the field formula_205 their tensor product is the multilinear form:
formula_234

This is a special case of the product of tensors if they are seen as multilinear maps (see also tensors as multilinear maps). Thus the components of the tensor product of multilinear forms can be computed by the Kronecker product.

=== Tensor product of sheaves of modules ===
=== Tensor product of line bundles ===


=== Tensor product of fields ===
=== Tensor product of graphs ===

It should be mentioned that, though called &quot;tensor product&quot;, this is not a tensor product of graphs in the above sense; actually it is the category-theoretic product in the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms. However it is actually the Kronecker tensor product of the adjacency matrices of the graphs. Compare also the section Tensor product of linear maps above.

=== Monoidal categories ===
The most general setting for the tensor product is the monoidal category. It captures the algebraic essence of tensoring, without making any specific reference to what is being tensored. Thus, all tensor products can be expressed as an application of the monoidal category to some particular setting, acting on some particular objects.

== Quotient algebras ==
A number of important subspaces of the tensor algebra can be constructed as quotients: these include the exterior algebra, the symmetric algebra, the Clifford algebra, the Weyl algebra, and the universal enveloping algebra in general.

The exterior algebra is constructed from the exterior product. Given a vector space , the exterior product formula_235 is defined as:
formula_236

When the underlying field of does not have characteristic 2, then this definition is equivalent to:
formula_237

The image of formula_238 in the exterior product is usually denoted formula_239 and satisfies, by construction, . Similar constructions are possible for formula_240 ( factors), giving rise to , the th exterior power of . The latter notion is the basis of differential -forms.

The symmetric algebra is constructed in a similar manner, from the symmetric product:
formula_241

More generally:
formula_242

That is, in the symmetric algebra two adjacent vectors (and therefore all of them) can be interchanged. The resulting objects are called symmetric tensors.

== Tensor product in programming ==

=== Array programming languages ===
Array programming languages may have this pattern built in. For example, in APL the tensor product is expressed as codice_1 (for example codice_2 or codice_3). In J the tensor product is the dyadic form of codice_4 (for example codice_5 or codice_6).

J&#x27;s treatment also allows the representation of some tensor fields, as codice_7 and codice_8 may be functions instead of constants. This product of two functions is a derived function, and if codice_7 and codice_8 are differentiable, then codice_5 is differentiable.

However, these kinds of notation are not universally present in array languages. Other array languages may require explicit treatment of indices (for example, MATLAB), and/or may not support higher-order functions such as the Jacobian derivative (for example, Fortran/APL).

<doc id="30845" wikidata="Q131582" url="?curid=30845" title="Tiramisu">
<text>Tiramisu is an Italian dessert made of ladyfinger pastries () dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks, sugar, and mascarpone, and flavoured with cocoa powder. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts. Its origin is disputed between the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The name comes from the Italian &quot;tirami su&quot; ().

==History==

Tiramisu appears to have been invented in the late 1960s or early 1970s, but where and when exactly is unclear. Some believe the recipe was modeled after sbatudin, a simpler dessert made of egg yolks and sugar. Others argue it originated from another dish, &quot;dolce Torino&quot;.

The tiramisu recipe is not found in cookbooks before the 1960s. It is mentioned in a &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; restaurant column published in 1978. It is not mentioned in encyclopaedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982. It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto region. 

Obituaries for the restaurateur Ado Campeol (1928–2021) reported that it was invented at his restaurant Le Beccherie in Treviso on 24 December 1969 by his wife Alba di Pillo (1929–2021) and the pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto (1943–2024). The dish was added to its menu in 1972. At the time of his death in July 2024, the Le Beccherie restaurant credited Linguanotto as the creator of the tiramisu.

It has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th-century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramisù explains, to &quot;solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives&quot;.

There is evidence of a &quot;tiremesù&quot; semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, since 1938. This may be the name&#x27;s origin, while the recipe for tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, zuppa inglese. Others claim it was created towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.

On 29 July 2017, tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. In 2013, Luca Zaia, President of Veneto, sought European Union protected status certification for the dessert, based on the ingredients used in 1970, so substitute ingredients, such as strawberries, could not be used in a dish called tiramisu.

==Original ingredients==
Traditional tiramisu contains ladyfingers (&quot;savoiardi&quot;), egg yolks, sugar, coffee, mascarpone, and cocoa powder. A common variant involves soaking the &quot;savoiardi&quot; in alcohol, such as Marsala wine, amaretto or a coffee-based liqueur. The original tiramisu made at Le Beccherie was circular.

==Variations==

The original shape of the cake is round, although the shape of the biscuits also allows the use of a rectangular or square pan. However, it is often assembled in round glasses, which show the various layers, or pyramids. Modern versions can have the addition of whipped cream or whipped egg whites, or both, combined with mascarpone. This makes the dish lighter, thick and foamy. Among the most common alcoholic changes includes the addition of Marsala wine. The cake is usually eaten cold.

Another variation involves the preparation of the cream with eggs heated to sterilize it, but not so much that the eggs scramble. Over time, replacing some of the ingredients, mainly coffee, there arose numerous variants such as tiramisu with chocolate, amaretto, berry, lemon, strawberry, pineapple, yoghurt, banana, raspberry, and coconut.

Numerous variations of tiramisu exist. Some cooks use other cakes or sweet, yeasted bread, such as panettone, in place of ladyfingers (&quot;savoiardi&quot;). Bakers living in different Italian regions often debate the use and structural qualities of utilising other types of cookies, such as pavesini for instance, in the recipe. Other cheese mixtures are used as well, some containing raw eggs, and others containing no eggs at all. Marsala wine can be added to the recipe, but other liquors are frequently substituted for it in both the coffee and the cheese mixture, including dark rum, Madeira, port, brandy, Malibu or Irish cream and especially coffee-flavoured liqueurs such as Tia Maria and Kahlúa.

<text>The Toronto Blue Jays are a Canadian professional baseball team based in Toronto. The Blue Jays compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East Division. Since 1989, the team has played its home games primarily at Rogers Centre in downtown Toronto.

The name &quot;Blue Jays&quot; originates from the bird of the same name, and blue is also the traditional colour of Toronto&#x27;s collegiate and professional sports teams including the Maple Leafs (ice hockey) and the Argonauts (Canadian football). In 1976, out of the over 4,000 suggestions, 154 people selected the name &quot;Blue Jays.&quot; In addition, the team was originally owned by the Labatt Brewing Company, makers of the popular beer Labatt Blue. Colloquially nicknamed the &quot;Jays,&quot; the team&#x27;s official colours are royal blue, navy blue, red, and white. 

An expansion franchise, the club was founded in Toronto in 1977. Originally based at Exhibition Stadium, the team began playing its home games at SkyDome upon its opening in 1989. They are the second MLB franchise to be based outside the United States, and currently the only team based outside the U.S. after the first Canadian franchise, the Montreal Expos, became the Washington Nationals in 2005. Since 2000, the Blue Jays have been owned by Rogers Communications and in 2004, SkyDome was purchased by that company, which renamed it Rogers Centre. The Blue Jays and the Atlanta Braves are the only two MLB teams under corporate ownership; the Blue Jays are the only American League team to be under such ownership. 

Due to border restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Blue Jays played home games at TD Ballpark in Dunedin, Florida, for April and May of the 2021 season, and Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York, for the 2020 season as well as June and July 2021, returning home to Toronto as of July 30 of that year.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Blue Jays went through struggles typical of an expansion team, frequently finishing last in their division. In 1983, they had their first winning season and two years later, became division champions. From 1985 to 1993, the Blue Jays were an AL East powerhouse, winning five division championships in nine seasons, including three consecutive from 1991 to 1993. During that run, the team also became back-to-back World Series champions in and , led by a core group of award-winning All-Star players, including Hall of Famer Roberto Alomar, Joe Carter, John Olerud, and Devon White. The Blue Jays became the first (and, to date, only) team outside the U.S. to appear in and win a World Series and the fastest AL expansion team to do so, winning in its 16th year. As of 2019, they are one of only two MLB franchises that are undefeated through multiple World Series appearances, along with the National League&#x27;s Miami Marlins. After 1993, the Blue Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs for 21 consecutive seasons until clinching a playoff berth and division championship in 2015. The team clinched a second consecutive playoff berth in 2016, after securing an AL wild card position. In both years, the Blue Jays beat the Texas Rangers in the AL Division Series, but lost the AL Championship Series. Most recently, they qualified for the playoffs as a wild card team in 2020, 2022, and 2023.

From 1977 to 2024, the Blue Jays&#x27; overall win-loss record is ().

==History==

The Toronto Blue Jays came into existence in 1976, as one of two teams slated to join the American League for the following season, via the 1977 Major League Baseball expansion. Toronto had been mentioned as a potential major league city as early as the 1880s and been home to the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the International League, from 1896 to 1967. In January 1976, the San Francisco Giants nearly relocated to Toronto after owner Horace Stoneham agreed to sell the team to a Canadian consortium. The group, which included Labatt Breweries of Canada, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s Howard Webster, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), planned to rebrand the team as the Toronto Giants and play at Exhibition Stadium. However, a court ruling halted the move, and the Giants remained in San Francisco. Despite this setback, Toronto&#x27;s ambition for an MLB team persisted, leading to their successful bid in the 1976 American League expansion, driven by a need to balance the league after Seattle was granted a team as a result of a lawsuit over their loss of the Pilots.

The new Toronto franchise, purchased for $7 million, was named the Toronto Blue Jays following a contest that attracted over 4,000 suggestions. The name reflected Toronto&#x27;s tradition of using blue in team colors and was influenced by majority owner Labatt Breweries&#x27; flagship beer, Labatt Blue. The franchise&#x27;s first employee, Paul Beeston, began as vice president of business operations, and before the inaugural 1977 season, Peter Bavasi and Pat Gillick were appointed as president and assistant general manager, respectively. The Blue Jays debuted on April 7, 1977, with a win against the Chicago White Sox amid a snowstorm, marking the beginning of a journey from early struggles to eventual success. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Blue Jays showed gradual improvement, highlighted by their first winning season in 1983. The team&#x27;s fortunes rose significantly under manager Bobby Cox in 1985 when they won their first American League East title. The late 1980s and early 1990s, under manager Cito Gaston, were particularly successful, with the Blue Jays winning multiple division titles and back-to-back World Series championships in 1992 and 1993, making them the first team outside the US to achieve this feat. Key players during this golden era included Roberto Alomar, Joe Carter, and Dave Stieb.

After the mid-1990s strike and subsequent downturn, the Blue Jays faced challenges but also saw the rise of talents like Roy Halladay and Carlos Delgado. The late 1990s brought brief revitalization with the acquisition of Roger Clemens. In the early 2000s, general manager J.P. Ricciardi led a rebuilding phase, culminating in a competitive roster by the mid-2000s. The team&#x27;s resurgence in the 2010s featured playoff appearances in 2015 and 2016, driven by stars like José Bautista and Josh Donaldson. The Blue Jays continue to build for future success, with young talents like Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, and Cavan Biggio leading the charge, though Biggio was later traded in 2024.

=== 2024 season ===

During the off-season, the Blue Jays re-signed Kiermaier and signed utility player Isiah Kiner-Falefa, designated hitter Justin Turner, and pitcher Yariel Rodríguez. The Blue Jays also traded Santiago Espinal for a pitching prospect.

During the regular season, the Blue Jays designated Cavan Biggio for assignment and traded him for a prospect afterwards. Before the 2024 trade deadline, the Blue Jays traded away Yimi Garcia, Nate Pearson, Danny Jansen, Justin Turner, Yusei Kikuchi, Trevor Richards, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and Kevin Kiermaier.

=== 2025 season ===

The Toronto Blue Jays signed Anthony Santander and Max Scherzer.

==Popularity==
In 1977, after just 50 home games, the Blue Jays set an MLB record for a first-year expansion team, with an overall attendance of 1,219,551 during those games. By the end of the season, 1,701,152 fans had attended. After setting an attendance record in 1990, with 3,885,284 fans, in 1991, the Blue Jays became the first MLB team to attract over four million fans, with an attendance of 4,001,526, followed by 4,028,318 in 1992. Each of those records were broken in 1993 by the expansion Colorado Rockies, although the Blue Jays&#x27; 1993 attendance of 4,057,947 stood as an AL record for 12 years until it was broken by the 2005 New York Yankees.

Several Blue Jays became very popular in Toronto and throughout the major leagues, starting with Dave Stieb, whose seven All-Star selections is a franchise record. He is closely followed by Roy Halladay and José Bautista, who were selected six times each, and by Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter, who were selected five times each. Bautista set a major league record in 2011 (which only stood for a year), with 7,454,753 All-Star votes. In his first season with the Blue Jays in 2015, Josh Donaldson set a new major league record by receiving 14,090,188 All-Star votes.

The team is popular throughout Canada, as the only MLB team based in the country following the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington. The team has played a number of exhibition games at BC Place in Vancouver including three-game series against the Milwaukee Brewers prior to both the 1984 and 1985 seasons (the Vancouver Canadians were the AAA farm team of the Brewers at the time), as well as single games against the Detroit Tigers and Brewers in 1993 and against the Montreal Expos and Seattle Mariners in 1994 in a series billed as the &quot;Baseball Classic&quot;. The Jays also played the Cleveland Indians in an exhibition game at War Memorial Stadium in nearby Buffalo, New York in 1987. More recently, the club has hosted a pair of exhibition games at Olympic Stadium in Montreal prior to the start of the season against the New York Mets (2014), Cincinnati Reds (2015), Boston Red Sox (2016), Pittsburgh Pirates (2017), St. Louis Cardinals (2018), Milwaukee Brewers (2019). A series against the New York Yankees was scheduled for 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The club also has discussed playing more games at BC Place with the president of the Vancouver Canadians.

==Culture==
===&quot;OK Blue Jays&quot;===

During the seventh-inning stretch of home games, before singing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game,&quot; Blue Jay fans sing and clap to the pop song &quot;OK Blue Jays&quot; by Keith Hampshire and The Bat Boys, which was released in 1983. The song was remixed in 2003, and since then, the new, shortened version has been played at home games.

===&quot;Let&#x27;s Go Blue Jays&quot;===
At home games, the &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Blue Jays&quot; chant is played four times followed by Charge being played thrice.

===Mascots===

From 1979 to 1999, BJ Birdy served as the Blue Jays&#x27; sole mascot, played by Kevin Shanahan. In 2000, he was replaced by a duo named Ace and Diamond. After the 2003 season, Diamond was removed by the team, leaving Ace as the team&#x27;s sole mascot. Since the 2010s, Ace has been accompanied by his younger brother, Junior. This usually happens on the Jr. Jay Saturday promotions until the end of the 2017 season. The promotions were moved to select Sundays since the 2018 season since the Blue Jays can no longer hold early Saturday afternoon games to accommodate American national broadcasts on Fox, though Fox did occasionally broadcast Blue Jays games at the Rogers Centre.

===Sunday Salute===
Since 2012, every Sunday home game, the Blue Jays pay tribute to a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. During the third inning, the team presents the honoured member with a personalized jersey.

===National anthems===
Since 2005, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; has been sung before &quot;O Canada&quot; at every home game. In some home games (including Canada Day home games and playoffs), &quot;O Canada&quot; is sung in English and French. When &quot;O Canada&quot; was sung during the Home Opener, Canada Day, and playoff games, a giant Canadian flag was carried by members of the Canadian Armed Forces. Sportsnet only airs the national anthems during the home opener, Canada Day, and playoff games. On June 29, 2019, &quot;O Canada&quot; was sung in Cree and English. On September 30, 2021, the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, &quot;O Canada&quot; was sung in English, French, and Anishinaabemowin. On the following National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, September 30, 2022, &quot;O Canada&quot; was sung in French, English, and Blackfoot. For Blue Jays road games, &quot;O Canada&quot; is sung before the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as all road games (since the Expos moved to Washington, DC) for the Blue Jays are in the United States.

===Canada Day===
The Blue Jays traditionally host an afternoon home game during Canada Day. During the game, the team wears red jerseys instead of blue jerseys. During the pre-game ceremony, a giant Canadian flag is carried by members of the Canadian Armed Forces while &quot;O Canada&quot; is sung in English and French by a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force Band. The game was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the game was held in Buffalo, New York due to Canada–U.S. travel restrictions.

===Jays Shop===

The Blue Jays operate a store called the Jays Shop that sells primarily Blue Jays merchandise. This store has two locations at Rogers Centre, though, until January 2023, there was an additional location in the Toronto Eaton Centre shopping mall.

==Uniforms==
===1977–1988: Pullovers and powder blue===
The Blue Jays wore pullover uniforms during their first decade of existence. The front of the home white uniforms contained the team name in a unique blue/white/blue split-letter style, with the team logo centred below. The road uniforms were powder blue, with the city name in front and the team logo centred below. Initially, the city name was rendered in bold blue letters before gaining a white outline the following season. By 1979, it was replaced by the team name in a split-lettered white/blue/white style. Player numerals also used the split-letter style, except on the road uniform during its first two seasons. Player names in blue were added to both uniforms for the 1980 season but were dropped from the road uniform in 1981. The caps were blue with the Blue Jays logo on a white panel in front.

In 2008, the Blue Jays&#x27; powder blue road uniform from this era was restored as an alternate home uniform worn every Friday until 2010.

===1989–1996: Championship blues===
The Blue Jays adopted buttoned uniforms upon moving to Rogers Centre (then SkyDome) in 1989. Aside from the additions of buttons and belts, the only change affecting the home uniforms was the relocation of the team logo to the left chest. The road uniforms changed from powder blue to grey, while the city name and numerals in blue/white/blue split letters were emblazoned, and the logo moved to the left chest. Player names were also added to the road uniform. All-blue caps were worn with their road uniform while keeping the white-panelled blue caps at home. By 1993, the all-blue caps were worn universally, supplanting and eventually retiring the original cap design.

In 1994 the Blue Jays began wearing blue alternate uniforms with the team name and numerals in white/blue/white split letters.

===1997–2003: Red, teal and blue===
The Blue Jays updated their logo prior to the 1997 season with a new bird design and an enlarged red maple leaf at the back. The usage of red was greatly increased on the team&#x27;s new uniforms. On the home uniforms, the letters and numerals were changed to blue/teal/blue split letters, while road uniform letters and numerals were changed to blue/red/blue split letters. On the alternate blue uniforms, split letters and numerals became red/blue/red. Red also appeared on the pant and sleeve stripes, while the new logo occupied the left sleeve. Player names also took on the new block split-letter style. An updated all-blue cap was paired with the home and road uniforms, while a red-brimmed blue cap (with a modified logo without a baseball) was used with the blue alternates.

In 1999 the Blue Jays unveiled an alternate sleeveless white uniform, featuring the same lettering style as the regular home uniform. However, the chest numerals were replaced with the primary logo. Blue undershirts were worn with this uniform.

Before the 2001 season, slight modifications were made to the uniforms, eliminating the tricolour stripes and adding a single colour piping along the chest and neck. While the home uniforms remained mostly intact, the road uniforms gained blue sleeves in a faux-vest design. On the alternate white uniform (now a faux vest instead of a straight sleeveless design), the new &quot;T-bird&quot; logo replaced the primary &quot;jay leaf&quot; logo, which moved to the left sleeve. In 2003, the &quot;T-bird&quot; logo became the primary, taking over the previous logo&#x27;s placement on the caps and sleeves, while the alternate white uniforms brought back chest numerals. The &quot;T-bird&quot; logo depicts a blue jay flexing its biceps and is nicknamed &quot;Muscle Jay.&quot;

===2004–2011: The &quot;Black-and-Graphite Jays&quot;===
Before the 2004 season, the Blue Jays adopted a new visual identity, going with a black, silver and graphite motif. The home and black alternates simply read &quot;Jays&quot; in front and in a 3D-oriented diagonal arrangement, with the bird connected to the letter &quot;J.&quot; Letters and numerals were in graphite with light blue and silver trim. The road uniforms featured the city name in a similar letter style as the logo, with graphite letters and numerals trimmed in light blue and silver. In 2008, however, amid complaints of illegibility, the Blue Jays tweaked their road uniforms to include 3D-style block letters and numerals in light blue trimmed in black and white, along with chest numerals. The &quot;J-bird&quot; alternate was added to the left sleeve. A red maple leaf would be added on the right sleeve starting in 2009. The Blue Jays wore all-black caps with the &quot;J-bird&quot; logo for much of the uniforms&#x27; existence, save for the 2004 and 2005 seasons when they wore all-graphite caps at home, and in 2007 when an alternate all-black cap with the &quot;T&quot; from the previous road uniform was used.

===Since 2012: Return to traditional look===
Prior to the 2012 season, the Blue Jays unveiled new uniforms and a new logo. The logo is a modernized version of the original logo used from 1977 to 1996. The bird&#x27;s head was also made sleeker than its 1977–1996 predecessor. The uniforms are similar to the ones used from 1989 to 1996, the team&#x27;s most successful era. New serifed split letters were also released. In 2015, the Blue Jays began wearing a modernized version of the white-panelled blue caps they originally wore from 1977 to 1993 as an alternate.

Before the 2020 season, the Blue Jays unveiled a modernized version of the powder blue uniforms, featuring navy/white/navy serifed split letters and numerals. These uniforms are paired with a powder-brimmed navy cap and an all-navy helmet.

===Canada Day uniforms===
Since 1996, the Blue Jays wore predominantly red or red-accented uniforms every July 1, Canada Day. The uniforms were based on the team&#x27;s alternate uniforms they wore at the time but with red as the primary colour. On a few occasions, the Blue Jays added red trim to an existing white uniform (or, in the case of the 2006 uniforms, their black alternates) and sometimes added the flag of Canada or a red maple leaf on the uniform.

===City Connect uniform===
In 2024, the Blue Jays unveiled a City Connect uniform inspired by Toronto&#x27;s nightlife. The jersey is nicknamed &quot;Night Mode&quot; and is a &quot;pitch blue&quot; (dark blue) uniform that features an illustration of the Toronto skyline in royal blue, centred by the &quot;Toronto&quot; wordmark in red. The &quot;pitch blue&quot; colour is a reference to Lake Ontario&#x27;s reflection at night. The traditional Blue Jays logo patch on the sleeve is recoloured to match the uniform. The cap is also &quot;pitch blue&quot; and features a red maple leaf at the centre of a stylized red and blue &quot;T&quot; in split letters.

==Rivalries==

===Montreal Expos===

The Montreal Expos were the Blue Jays&#x27; geographic National League rival, being the other Canadian MLB team before it was relocated. From 1978 to 1986, the teams played an annual mid-season exhibition game known as the Pearson Cup, named after former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. The teams began facing each other in the regular season in 1997 with the advent of interleague play. During the 2003 and 2004 seasons, the Expos&#x27; last two seasons before relocating to Washington, D.C., as the Nationals, the Pearson Cup was awarded after a pair of three-game sets.
===Detroit Tigers===
The Detroit Tigers are the Blue Jays&#x27; geographic and traditional rival, dating back to the 1980s, when the teams were AL East contenders. The Tigers moved to the AL Central in 1998, and the rivalry has died down as a result, with the teams facing each other only six to seven times per year since 2011. Depending on traffic and border delays, Detroit is about a four-hour drive from Toronto. According to &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, a July 2017 three-game series at Comerica Park against the Blue Jays drew a season-best-to-date total attendance of 115,088.
===Seattle Mariners===
Although the Seattle Mariners are not a divisional rival, many Blue Jays fans from Western Canada travel to Seattle when the Blue Jays play there as Seattle is geographically closer to Western Canada than Toronto is. Depending on traffic and border delays, Seattle is about a three-hour drive from Vancouver. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; estimated that Blue Jays fans represented around 70 percent of the crowd in Safeco Field for a June 2017 weekend series.
==Broadcasting==

===Radio===

The Blue Jays&#x27; former radio play-by-play announcer, Tom Cheek, called every Toronto Blue Jays game from the team&#x27;s inaugural contest on April 7, 1977, until June 3, 2004, when he took two games off following the death of his father—a streak of 4,306 consecutive regular-season games and 41 postseason games. Cheek later died on October 9, 2005, and the team commemorated him during their 2006 season by wearing a circular patch on the left sleeve of their home and road game jerseys. The patch was adorned with the letters &#x27;TC&#x27;, Cheek&#x27;s initials, as well as a stylized microphone. Cheek is also honoured with a place in the Blue Jays&#x27; &quot;Level of Excellence&quot; in the upper level of the Rogers Centre; the number 4,306 is depicted beside his name. In 2008, Cheek received the third most votes from fans to be nominated for the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting excellence. Cheek finally received the Frick Award posthumously in 2013 after nine years on the ballot.

Radio broadcasts of Blue Jays games originate from Sportsnet 590 CJCL in Toronto, which, like the Blue Jays, is owned by Rogers Communications. After Cheek&#x27;s retirement in 2005, Jerry Howarth, who had been Cheek&#x27;s broadcasting partner since 1982, took over as lead play-by-play announcer, with Mike Wilner as the secondary play-by-play announcer. During the 2007 to 2012 seasons, former Blue Jays catcher Alan Ashby was the colour commentator. Former Blue Jays pitcher Jack Morris served as the colour commentator during the 2013 season, after which he was replaced by former Montreal Expos catcher Joe Siddall since the 2014 season.

Former Blue Jays pitcher Dirk Hayhurst filled in for Morris for some games during the 2013 season.

Another former catcher for the Blue Jays, Gregg Zaun, has served as the occasional colour commentator from the 2011 season until the end of the 2017 season when he was terminated amid accusations of improper conduct from several female employees.

Following Howarth&#x27;s retirement in the 2017 season, Ben Wagner was hired as the primary radio play-by-play announcer, splitting said duties with Dan Shulman and Mike Wilner.

In November 2020, Mike Wilner was laid off by the team. In February 2021, it was announced that &quot;in an effort to minimize travel and closely adhere to team, league, and government protocols related to the pandemic&quot;, all radio broadcasts for the 2021 season will be a simulcast of the television broadcast. Wagner will assume an alternative role. However, once the Blue Jays returned to Rogers Centre in late July 2021, dedicated radio broadcasts resumed.

The Blue Jays have the largest geographical home market in all of baseball, encompassing all of Canada. Despite this, the number of radio stations that broadcast games is actually quite small. Only 18 radio stations across the country aired at least some Blue Jays games during the 2021 season, which is fewer affiliates than most MLB teams, which have more stations covering smaller geographic areas.

===Television===
All Blue Jays games are carried nationally on Sportsnet (which, like the Blue Jays, is owned by Rogers Communications). As of 2023, Dan Shulman serves as the lead play-by-play announcer, with Buck Martinez as the primary colour commentator; on select series, Toronto Raptors play-by-play announcer Matt Devlin calls the game in place of Shulman, and Joe Siddall works colour commentary in place of Martinez. Prior to that, Martinez had been the primary play-by-play announcer alongside colour commentator Pat Tabler, with Shulman only calling games sporadically since 2016. In previous years, the colour analyst role rotated between Pat Tabler, Rance Mulliniks, Darrin Fletcher, and from 2011 to 2017, Gregg Zaun. Sportsnet became the team&#x27;s primary carrier soon after it launched in the late 1990s and became the team&#x27;s exclusive broadcaster in 2010. As of August 2010, Sportsnet One also broadcasts Blue Jays games (often in case of scheduling conflicts with the main Sportsnet channels). Rogers was, however, criticized by fans and critics due to Sportsnet One only being carried by Rogers Cable systems on launch.

Sportsnet&#x27;s broadcasts of the 2015 American League Division Series involving the Blue Jays were among the highest-rated telecasts in network history, with Game 4 drawing an audience of 4.38 million viewers.
In September 2012, AMI-tv simulcast three Blue Jays games with described video provided by CJCL correspondent Sam Cosentino, which included explanations of on-screen graphics. Paul Beeston praised AMI&#x27;s involvement, stating that &quot;to our knowledge, we are the first sports organization to have our games provided through this revolutionary approach to accommodating the needs of the blind and low-vision community.&quot;

On June 27, 2013, Rogers&#x27; over-the-air Toronto multicultural Omni Television station CJMT-DT simulcast a Blue Jays game, scheduled to be started by Taiwanese player Chien-Ming Wang, with commentary in Mandarin, marking the first ever Canadian MLB broadcast in the language. In June 2018, Omni announced that it would air Sunday afternoon games in Tagalog, the most spoken language of the Philippines, through the remainder of the season. Sportsnet and Omni announced a regular season of Sunday broadcasts in Tagalog for the 2019 season.

TVA Sports has aired games in French since 2011, with Denis Casavant and François Paquet on play-by-play and Rodger Brulotte on colour. The channel currently has rights to 81 Blue Jay games per season in a three-year deal signed in 2023. Jacques Doucet, former Montreal Expos radio announcer, broadcast the Blue Jays on TVA Sports from 2011 until his retirement in 2022.

The Sports Network (TSN), which (like the Jays) was owned by Labatt from 1984 to 1995, served as the primary cable television outlet for the Blue Jays prior to the launch of Sportsnet. TSN (and later, its sister channel TSN2) continued to carry approximately ten Jays games through the 2009 season until May 2010; most recently, Rod Black handled play-by-play while Tabler served as colour commentator on these telecasts. CBC has carried Blue Jays games intermittently throughout the team&#x27;s history, most recently in 2007 and 2008; those broadcasts featured Jim Hughson as the play-by-play announcer, and former Blue Jays Rance Mulliniks and Jesse Barfield on colour commentary. Games also aired on CTV (except in Montreal) from the team&#x27;s inception until the late 1990s. The Blue Jays have not appeared over-the-air in Canada in English since 2008.

In 2008, Rogers Communications, owner of the Jays, was granted a license by the Canadian Radio-Television Commission (CRTC) for a &quot;Baseball TV&quot; specialty channel. The channel would have been dedicated to coverage of baseball, combining content from the United States–based MLB Network with original Canadian content. However, the channel was never launched, and Rogers sponsored an application to allow distribution of the U.S. MLB Network on Canadian providers instead.

Due to the structure of Rogers&#x27; MLB broadcast contracts, Sportsnet is not permitted to use its domestic production for Blue Jays games if the team is in postseason play (as it is technically still considered a regional broadcaster) and instead carries the U.S. broadcast (such as Fox in 2015, and TBS in 2016). This is in contrast to the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors (via TSN and Sportsnet), as well as the NHL and MLS&#x27;s Canadian-based teams (via Hockey Night in Canada on CBC and Sportsnet, and TSN respectively) who were allowed to produce their own broadcasts during postseason games. Buck Martinez has served as a colour commentator for post-season coverage ultimately simulcast by Sportsnet, however, having formerly worked Division Series games for TBS and on the MLB International broadcast of the 2016 World Series. In 2022, however, MLB allowed Sportsnet to carry its own production of Blue Jays postseason games as it is technically a national broadcaster.

===No-hitters===
Only one Blue Jays pitcher has thrown a no-hitter in franchise history. It was accomplished by Dave Stieb on September 2, 1990, after losing three no-hit bids with two outs in the ninth inning.

No perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, has been thrown in Blue Jays history. The franchise came closest on August 4, 1989, when Stieb gave up a double to Yankees&#x27; batter Roberto Kelly with two outs in the ninth, who then scored by the next batter.

===Triple Crown champions===
Roger Clemens won the pitching Triple Crown in 1997 and 1998.

===Baseball Hall of Famers===
Eleven former Blue Jays, one former manager, and one former general manager have been elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Second baseman Roberto Alomar, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2011, is the first player to be inducted based primarily on service as a player for the Blue Jays.

Bobby Doerr, a second baseman with the Boston Red Sox, served as a hitting coach with the Blue Jays early in their history, 1977–1981, and was the first person associated with the franchise to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1986.

Early Wynn, the Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher (1972) and career 300-game winner, was a radio broadcaster for the Blue Jays with Tom Cheek during their first few years, 1977–1981.

===Retired numbers===


Soon after becoming the first person to be inducted in the Hall of Fame as a Blue Jay, on July 31, 2011, second baseman Roberto Alomar was the first person to have his number, #12, retired by the Blue Jays. However, #12 was unretired due to controversies surrounding Alomar. Jordan Hicks became the first Blue Jay since 2011 to wear this number.

On March 29, 2018, the Blue Jays retired #32 in honour of Roy Halladay, who died in an airplane crash on November 7, 2017, becoming the second number to be retired by the Blue Jays.
===Level of Excellence===
In 1996, the Blue Jays instituted a &quot;Level of Excellence&quot; on the 500 level of the Rogers Centre, honouring &quot;tremendous individual achievement.&quot;

Players&#x27; uniform numbers were listed—and in Tom Cheek&#x27;s case, the number of consecutive games he called for the Blue Jays—until the 2013 All-Star Break, even though, with the exception of Roberto Alomar and Roy Halladay these numbers have not been retired. During the 2013 All-Star Break, the Level of Excellence was redesigned for the addition of Carlos Delgado&#x27;s name. The redesign removed all uniform numbers from the Level of Excellence aside from Roberto Alomar&#x27;s retired #12, Roy Halladay&#x27;s retired #32 and Tom Cheek&#x27;s 4306 consecutive called games streak. On April 30, 2021, the Blue Jays announced that they would remove Alomar from the Level of Excellence and take down his banner at Rogers Centre after he was banned from baseball for sexual harassment.

On March 5, 2023, the Blue Jays announced that Jose Bautista would join the Level of Excellence on August 12, 2023, in a pre-game ceremony prior to their game that day versus the Chicago Cubs.

<text>A turbine ( or ) (from the Greek , &quot;tyrbē&quot;, or Latin &quot;turbo&quot;, meaning vortex) is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor.

Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.

== History ==

Hero of Alexandria demonstrated the turbine principle in an aeolipile in the first century AD and Vitruvius mentioned them around 70 BC.

Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.

The word &quot;turbine&quot; was first applied to this kind of device in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin in a memo, &quot;Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse&quot;, which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris. The word derives from the Latin , meaning &quot;vortex&quot; or &quot;top&quot;, and was in use in French to describe certain seashells. However, it was not until 1824 that a committee of the Académie (composed of Prony, Dupin, and Girard) reported favorably on Burdin&#x27;s memo. Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.

Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to Anglo-Irish engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931) for invention of the reaction turbine, and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913) for invention of the impulse turbine.

== Theory of operation ==
A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:

Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid&#x27;s &quot;pressure head&quot; is changed to &quot;velocity head&quot; by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle. Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton&#x27;s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines. Impulse turbines are most efficient for use in cases where the flow is low and the inlet pressure is high.

Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid&#x27;s pressure or mass. The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton&#x27;s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. Reaction turbines are better suited to higher flow velocities or applications where the fluid head (upstream pressure) is low.

In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons-type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval-type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.

In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may use either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in pressure. Under these conditions, blading becomes strictly a reaction type design with the base of the blade solely impulse. The reason is due to the effect of the rotation speed for each blade. As the volume increases, the blade height increases, and the base of the blade spins at a slower speed relative to the tip. This change in speed forces a designer to change from impulse at the base, to a high reaction-style tip.

Classical turbine design methods were developed in the mid 19th century. Vector analysis related the fluid flow with turbine shape and rotation. Graphical calculation methods were used at first. Formulae for the basic dimensions of turbine parts are well documented and a highly efficient machine can be reliably designed for any fluid flow condition. Some of the calculations are empirical or &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; formulae, and others are based on classical mechanics. As with most engineering calculations, simplifying assumptions were made.

Velocity triangles can be used to calculate the basic performance of a turbine stage. Gas exits the stationary turbine nozzle guide vanes at absolute velocity &quot;V&quot;a1. The rotor rotates at velocity &quot;U&quot;. Relative to the rotor, the velocity of the gas as it impinges on the rotor entrance is &quot;V&quot;r1. The gas is turned by the rotor and exits, relative to the rotor, at velocity &quot;V&quot;r2. However, in absolute terms the rotor exit velocity is &quot;V&quot;a2. The velocity triangles are constructed using these various velocity vectors. Velocity triangles can be constructed at any section through the blading (for example: hub, tip, midsection and so on) but are usually shown at the mean stage radius. Mean performance for the stage can be calculated from the velocity triangles, at this radius, using the Euler equation:

:formula_1

Hence:

:formula_2

where:

:formula_3 is the specific enthalpy drop across stage
:formula_4 is the turbine entry total (or stagnation) temperature
:formula_5 is the turbine rotor peripheral velocity
:formula_6 is the change in whirl velocity

The turbine pressure ratio is a function of formula_7 and the turbine efficiency.

Modern turbine design carries the calculations further. Computational fluid dynamics dispenses with many of the simplifying assumptions used to derive classical formulas and computer software facilitates optimization. These tools have led to steady improvements in turbine design over the last forty years.

The primary numerical classification of a turbine is its specific speed. This number describes the speed of the turbine at its maximum efficiency with respect to the power and flow rate. The specific speed is derived to be independent of turbine size. Given the fluid flow conditions and the desired shaft output speed, the specific speed can be calculated and an appropriate turbine design selected.

The specific speed, along with some fundamental formulas can be used to reliably scale an existing design of known performance to a new size with corresponding performance.

Off-design performance is normally displayed as a turbine map or characteristic.

The number of blades in the rotor and the number of vanes in the stator are often two different prime numbers in order to reduce the harmonics and maximize the blade-passing frequency.

== Types ==
* Steam turbines are used to drive electrical generators in thermal power plants which use coal, fuel oil or nuclear fuel. They were once used to directly drive mechanical devices such as ships&#x27; propellers (for example the &quot;Turbinia&quot;, the first turbine-powered steam launch), but most such applications now use reduction gears or an intermediate electrical step, where the turbine is used to generate electricity, which then powers an electric motor connected to the mechanical load. Turbo electric ship machinery was particularly popular in the period immediately before and during World War II, primarily due to a lack of sufficient gear-cutting facilities in US and UK shipyards.
* Aircraft gas turbine engines are sometimes referred to as turbine engines to distinguish them from piston engines.
* Transonic turbine. The gas flow in most turbines employed in gas turbine engines remains subsonic throughout the expansion process. In a transonic turbine the gas flow becomes supersonic as it exits the nozzle guide vanes, although the downstream velocities normally become subsonic. Transonic turbines operate at a higher pressure ratio than normal but are usually less efficient and uncommon.
* Contra-rotating turbines. With axial turbines, some efficiency advantage can be obtained if a downstream turbine rotates in the opposite direction to an upstream unit. However, the complication can be counter-productive. A contra-rotating steam turbine, usually known as the Ljungström turbine, was originally invented by Swedish Engineer Fredrik Ljungström (1875–1964) in Stockholm, and in partnership with his brother Birger Ljungström he obtained a patent in 1894. The design is essentially a multi-stage radial turbine (or pair of &#x27;nested&#x27; turbine rotors) offering great efficiency, four times as large heat drop per stage as in the reaction (Parsons) turbine, extremely compact design and the type met particular success in back pressure power plants. However, contrary to other designs, large steam volumes are handled with difficulty and only a combination with axial flow turbines (DUREX) admits the turbine to be built for power greater than ca 50 MW. In marine applications only about 50 turbo-electric units were ordered (of which a considerable number were finally sold to land plants) during 1917–19, and during 1920–22 a few turbo-mechanic not very successful units were sold. Only a few turbo-electric marine plants were still in use in the late 1960s (ss Ragne, ss Regin) while most land plants remain in use 2010.
* Statorless turbine. Multi-stage turbines have a set of static (meaning stationary) inlet guide vanes that direct the gas flow onto the rotating rotor blades. In a stator-less turbine the gas flow exiting an upstream rotor impinges onto a downstream rotor without an intermediate set of stator vanes (that rearrange the pressure/velocity energy levels of the flow) being encountered.
* Ceramic turbine. Conventional high-pressure turbine blades (and vanes) are made from nickel based alloys and often use intricate internal air-cooling passages to prevent the metal from overheating. In recent years, experimental ceramic blades have been manufactured and tested in gas turbines, with a view to increasing rotor inlet temperatures and/or, possibly, eliminating air cooling. Ceramic blades are more brittle than their metallic counterparts, and carry a greater risk of catastrophic blade failure. This has tended to limit their use in jet engines and gas turbines to the stator (stationary) blades.
* Ducted fan (shrouded) turbine. Many turbine rotor blades have shrouding at the top, which interlocks with that of adjacent blades, to increase damping and thereby reduce blade flutter. In large land-based electricity generation steam turbines, the shrouding is often complemented, especially in the long blades of a low-pressure turbine, with lacing wires. These wires pass through holes drilled in the blades at suitable distances from the blade root and are usually brazed to the blades at the point where they pass through. Lacing wires reduce blade flutter in the central part of the blades. The introduction of lacing wires substantially reduces the instances of blade failure in large or low-pressure turbines.
* Propfan (shroudless turbine). Modern practice is, wherever possible, to eliminate the rotor shrouding, thus reducing the centrifugal load on the blade and the cooling requirements.
* Tesla turbine or bladeless turbine uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.
* Water turbines:
** Pelton wheel, a type of impulse water turbine.
** Francis turbine, a type of widely used water turbine.
** Kaplan turbine, a variation of the Francis Turbine.
** Turgo turbine, a modified form of the Pelton wheel.
**Tyson turbine, a conical water turbine with helical blades emerging partway down from the apex gradually increasing in radial dimension and decreasing in pitch as they spiral towards the base of the cone.
** Cross-flow turbine, also known as Banki-Michell turbine, or Ossberger turbine.
* Wind turbine. These normally operate as a single stage without nozzle and interstage guide vanes. An exception is the Éolienne Bollée, which has a stator and a rotor.
* Velocity compound &quot;Curtis&quot;. Curtis combined the de Laval and Parsons turbine by using a set of fixed nozzles on the first stage or stator and then a rank of fixed and rotating blade rows, as in the Parsons or de Laval, typically up to ten compared with up to a hundred stages of a Parsons design. The overall efficiency of a Curtis design is less than that of either the Parsons or de Laval designs, but it can be satisfactorily operated through a much wider range of speeds, including successful operation at low speeds and at lower pressures, which made it ideal for use in ships&#x27; powerplant. In a Curtis arrangement, the entire heat drop in the steam takes place in the initial nozzle row and both the subsequent moving blade rows and stationary blade rows merely change the direction of the steam. Use of a small section of a Curtis arrangement, typically one nozzle section and two or three rows of moving blades, is usually termed a Curtis &#x27;Wheel&#x27; and in this form, the Curtis found widespread use at sea as a &#x27;governing stage&#x27; on many reaction and impulse turbines and turbine sets. This practice is still commonplace today in marine steam plant.
* Pressure compound multi-stage impulse, or &quot;Rateau&quot;, after its French inventor, Auguste Rateau. The Rateau employs simple impulse rotors separated by a nozzle diaphragm. The diaphragm is essentially a partition wall in the turbine with a series of tunnels cut into it, funnel shaped with the broad end facing the previous stage and the narrow the next they are also angled to direct the steam jets onto the impulse rotor.
* Mercury vapour turbines used mercury as the working fluid, to improve the efficiency of fossil-fuelled generating stations. Although a few power plants were built with combined mercury vapour and conventional steam turbines, the toxicity of the metal mercury was quickly apparent.
* Screw turbine is a water turbine which uses the principle of the Archimedean screw to convert the potential energy of water on an upstream level into kinetic energy.

== Uses ==
A large proportion of the world&#x27;s electrical power is generated by turbo generators.

Turbines are used in gas turbine engines on land, sea and air.

Turbochargers are used on piston engines.

Gas turbines have very high power densities (i.e. the ratio of power to mass, or power to volume) because they run at very high speeds. The Space Shuttle main engines used turbopumps (machines consisting of a pump driven by a turbine engine) to feed the propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen) into the engine&#x27;s combustion chamber. The liquid hydrogen turbopump is slightly larger than an automobile engine (weighing approximately 700 lb) with the turbine producing nearly 70,000 hp (52.2 MW).

Turboexpanders are used for refrigeration in industrial processes.
